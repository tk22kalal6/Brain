      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) are at higher risk of developing hypocalcemia (low serum calcium levels) within the first 24 to 72 hours of life. This is due to the immaturity of parathyroid hormone response and the abrupt interruption of transplacental calcium supply after birth. Since maternal diabetes can interfere with calcium homeostasis, monitoring serum calcium levels is important in these neonates to detect and manage potential hypocalcemia, which can present with symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability, or seizures. Although the infant in this scenario currently has a normal blood glucose level (60 mg/dL), it is standard practice to check calcium levels due to the known risk in this population. Incorrect: Option: A) Serum potassium While potassium disturbances can occur in neonates, it is not a routine or expected issue specifically in infants of diabetic mothers unless there are additional complications like perinatal asphyxia or renal dysfunction. It is not the most immediate or relevant concern in this scenario. B) CBC A complete blood count (CBC) might be ordered if there is suspicion of infection, anemia, or polycythemia (which can occur in IDMs), but it is not as directly relevant or expected as serum calcium measurement in the context of a well-appearing infant with a normal glucose level. D) Serum chloride Serum chloride is rarely a primary concern in the immediate evaluation of an infant of a diabetic mother unless there are issues related to acid-base balance or dehydration. It is not typically part of the standard initial assessments in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mouth–Nose During neonatal resuscitation, the correct and recommended sequence for suctioning is mouth first, then nose. This is because if the nose is suctioned first, the infant may gasp or take a breath in response, which can lead to aspiration of secretions from the mouth into the lungs. By suctioning the mouth first, any secretions that could be aspirated are cleared before the infant breathes. This practice is emphasized in neonatal resuscitation guidelines to reduce the risk of airway obstruction and aspiration, thereby supporting effective ventilation and oxygenation. Incorrect: Options B) Nose–Mouth Suctioning the nose first may stimulate a gasp reflex, which increases the risk of aspirating oral secretions into the lungs. Therefore, this sequence is not recommended. C) Mouth–Nose–Trachea Routine tracheal suctioning is not performed unless there is a specific indication, such as meconium-stained amniotic fluid with poor respiratory effort. Including \"trachea\" in routine suctioning is inappropriate and not part of standard neonatal resuscitation unless advanced airway management is needed. D) Trachea–Nose–Mouth This sequence is incorrect for routine care. Tracheal suctioning is reserved for specific emergencies, and starting with the trachea is unnecessary and invasive in a newborn with spontaneous breathing. Additionally, suctioning the nose before the mouth poses the same aspiration risk discussed earlier.",

      "solution": "Correct answer: (C) BCDE In newborn intravenous (IV) cannulation, the equipment used must be suitable for the delicate and small veins of a neonate. Here's a breakdown of each correct item: B. 24 gauge needle – This is the appropriate size for neonatal IV access. A 24G cannula is small and suitable for fragile neonatal veins, minimizing trauma and reducing the risk of complications like infiltration or phlebitis. C. 5 mL syringe – A small syringe is required to flush the IV line, administer medications, or aspirate blood gently. The 5 mL size allows precise control and is ideal for neonatal dosing and vein integrity. D. Normal saline – Used for flushing the cannula to ensure patency and to administer IV medications or fluids. It is the standard isotonic solution used in neonates. E. Adhesive tape – Crucial for securing the cannula after insertion to prevent dislodgement. In neonates, the tape must be gentle to avoid skin damage. Incorrect option: A. 22 gauge needle – While a 22G cannula might be used in older children or adults, it is too large for most newborns and can cause vein trauma or difficulty in insertion.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Improvement in Heart Rate (HR) The best indicator of adequate ventilation in a newborn during resuscitation is improvement in heart rate. Ventilation is the most critical step in neonatal resuscitation, and if it is effective, the heart rate will increase—typically above 100 beats per minute. This response occurs because oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance improve with proper ventilation, leading to enhanced cardiac function. In fact, heart rate is the primary vital sign used to assess the effectiveness of resuscitation efforts, especially in the first minute after birth. Incorrect: Options A) Chest rise While visible chest rise suggests air is entering the lungs, it is not a definitive indicator of effective ventilation. Sometimes, chest rise may be deceptive, especially in cases of poor lung compliance or airway obstruction. C) Improvement in color Color change (e.g., from blue to pink) is a subjective sign and can be influenced by lighting or skin tone. It occurs later than heart rate changes and is not a reliable primary indicator of ventilation adequacy. D) Air entry Hearing air entry on auscultation helps confirm ventilation, but it does not quantify how effective the ventilation is. Also, it can be difficult to assess in noisy delivery room environments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hydrocortisone A 3-week-old neonate with ambiguous genitalia, hyponatremia (Na+ 127 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (K+ 6 mEq/L) is presenting with features suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)—most likely due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common form. This enzyme deficiency leads to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, resulting in salt-wasting, dehydration, and life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. The ambiguous genitalia are due to androgen excess from shunting of precursors. The definitive and specific treatment is hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid that replaces the deficient cortisol, suppresses ACTH overproduction (reducing androgen excess), and helps stabilize the patient. In salt-wasting CAH, mineralocorticoid replacement (like fludrocortisone) and sodium supplementation are also typically required, but hydrocortisone is the first-line emergency therapy. Incorrect: Options A) Calcium gluconate Calcium gluconate is used to stabilize the myocardium in cases of severe hyperkalemia, especially when ECG changes are present. However, it does not treat the underlying cause of the electrolyte imbalance in CAH. B) Potassium resins/sequestration These may lower potassium levels but do not address the hormonal deficiency causing the imbalance. They are supportive at best and not specific or primary therapy in CAH. D) Broad spectrum antibiotics There is no indication of infection in this case. Antibiotics are not relevant unless there is a suspected or confirmed infection, which is not evident from the clinical and laboratory presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Anser (A) Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) After Step 1 of neonatal resuscitation (which includes warming, positioning the airway, clearing secretions if needed, drying, and stimulating), the heart rate (HR) is assessed. If the HR is < 100 beats per minute, this indicates inadequate or absent spontaneous breathing, and the next appropriate step is to initiate positive pressure ventilation (PPV), not CPAP. CPAP is appropriate only for newborns who are breathing spontaneously but have labored respirations or low oxygen saturation. If HR is below 100, it's a sign that ventilation is inadequate, and CPAP alone is insufficient. These infants need active respiratory support with PPV to improve both ventilation and heart rate. Incorrect Options B) Consider ECG monitor Using an ECG monitor helps provide a more accurate and continuous assessment of heart rate, which is critical in guiding resuscitation steps. C) Start pulse oximetry Pulse oximetry is essential to monitor oxygen saturation levels and guide oxygen supplementation, particularly important in neonates receiving respiratory support. D) Supplement with O2 Oxygen supplementation is part of the support given if saturations are below target levels; it's used in conjunction with ventilation support as needed.",

Among metabolic causes, electrolyte imbalances are key contributors. The four conditions listed — hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, and hypocalcemia — are all known causes of seizures in neonates. i) Hypomagnesemia Low magnesium levels can lead to increased neuronal excitability and seizures. It often occurs alongside hypocalcemia and must be corrected to effectively treat calcium-related seizures. ii) Hyponatremia A fall in serum sodium leads to cerebral edema, increasing intracranial pressure and triggering seizures. This is particularly dangerous when the sodium drop is acute and severe. iii) Hypernatremia High sodium levels cause cellular dehydration, particularly in brain cells. This can result in intracerebral hemorrhage or direct brain injury, both of which can provoke seizures. iv) Hypocalcemia This is one of the most common metabolic causes of neonatal seizures. Calcium is vital for neurotransmission and neuromuscular function; low levels can lead to twitching, jitteriness, or full seizures. It’s especially common in preterm infants, infants of diabetic mothers, or after birth asphyxia. Incorrect Options: A) i, iv – Excludes sodium disturbances, which are significant causes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Skin to skin contact + exclusive breast feeding + early discharge Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is a neonatal care technique primarily aimed at preventing hypothermia and promoting bonding, breastfeeding, and overall well-being for preterm or low birth weight infants. The key components of Kangaroo Mother Care are: Skin-to-skin contact: This is the foundation of KMC. The infant is placed on the mother’s chest (or the father’s), dressed in only a diaper, so that the baby can benefit from body warmth, bonding, and stimulation from the parent's skin. This also helps regulate the baby's temperature, heart rate, and respiration. Exclusive breastfeeding: KMC strongly encourages exclusive breastfeeding, which provides the newborn with optimal nutrition and helps in the establishment of a strong immune system. Breast milk is especially important for preterm infants due to its protective effects against infections and its ability to meet the specific nutritional needs of the infant. Early discharge: One of the goals of KMC is to facilitate early discharge from the hospital. This means that the infant can be safely discharged earlier than usual with the ongoing support of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding at home. The mother or caregiver is trained to continue KMC at home to ensure the infant continues to thrive in a safe environment. Incorrect Options: A) Skin to skin contact + exclusive breast feeding + prevent infection: While infection prevention is important in neonatal care, it is not listed as one of the primary components of KMC. The primary components are skin-to-skin contact, exclusive breastfeeding, and early discharge. C) Skin to skin contact + prevent infection + early discharge: This option includes skin-to-skin contact and early discharge, but it misses the crucial component of exclusive breastfeeding, which is central to KMC's benefits. D) Exclusive breast feeding + prevent infection + early discharge: This option leaves out skin-to-skin contact, which is the cornerstone of KMC and provides essential warmth and bonding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 18-24 months Children typically reach half of their adult height by the age of 18 to 24 months. This period marks a significant phase of growth during the first few years of life, where rapid physical development occurs.

After this, growth slows down somewhat, with more gradual increases in height and weight as they move through the toddler and preschool years. Incorrect Options: A) 28-32 months – By 28-32 months, the child is past the period of reaching half of adult size, which occurs earlier. B) 32-36 months – The child would have surpassed half of adult size by this age. C) 12-18 months – By 12 months, children typically reach about 1/3 of their adult size, not half.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 3 years The developmental age of a child is assessed based on their ability to perform various physical, cognitive, and social tasks typical of children at certain stages. Let's break down the child's abilities in the question: Can ride a tricycle: Typically, children can start riding a tricycle around 3 years of age. Can climb upstairs and downstairs with one foot at a time: This is usually expected of children around 3 years of age, when they gain enough motor coordination and balance to use alternating feet while climbing stairs. Can say name and knows own sex: These are common achievements for children at 3 years of age, as they begin to develop more self-awareness and basic language skills. Cannot narrate a story: The ability to narrate a story or provide complex verbal descriptions generally develops around 4-5 years. At age 3, children can typically speak in short phrases or sentences but may not yet be able to tell a coherent story. Given that the child is unable to narrate a story (which is typical for a 3-year-old), but can perform the other tasks listed, the developmental age of the child aligns with 3 years. Incorrect Options: B) 4 years – At 4 years, children are generally more capable of narrating simple stories and engaging in more complex play or conversations. This child’s ability does not match typical 4-year-old milestones. C) 5 years –By 5 years, children are usually able to engage in more complex storytelling and understand abstract concepts more clearly, which the child in this case cannot do yet. D) 2 years –A 2-year-old would not typically be able to ride a tricycle or climb stairs with alternating feet. These are skills expected to develop closer to 3 years of age.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 3 years Handedness refers to a consistent preference for using one hand over the other for tasks such as writing, feeding, or throwing. While some preference may appear earlier, definite handedness typically develops around 3 years of age. At this stage: Children begin to show a clear and consistent preference for using one hand. The brain's lateralization of function (dominance of one cerebral hemisphere) becomes more evident. By age 3, most children start consistently using either the right or left hand for activities like drawing or feeding themselves. Incorrect: Options: A) 2 years – At 2 years, children may show some hand preference, but it is often inconsistent. It's still common for toddlers to switch hands frequently. C) 4 years – By this age, handedness is usually already well established, though some refinement in motor skills continues. D) 5 years – Most children already have a clear hand preference before age 5. Waiting until 5 years is too late to mark the onset of handedness.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Feeding by spoon By the age of 3 years, a child is expected to have achieved several developmental milestones across motor, social, and language domains. One key self-help milestone expected by this age is the ability to feed themselves with a spoon. Feeding by spoon reflects a combination of fine motor coordination, independence, and cognitive understanding of eating behaviors. If a 3-year-old is unable to feed themselves using a spoon, it suggests a delay in self-help or adaptive skills development, which may warrant further assessment. Incorrect Options A) Hopping on one leg This is a gross motor milestone typically achieved by 4 years of age, not 3. Its absence in a 3-year-old is normal and not considered delayed development. B) Drawing square Drawing a square is a fine motor and cognitive milestone usually seen at 4 to 5 years. It is not expected at age 3, so its absence is not delayed. D) Passing a ball to someone This is usually achieved before 3 years, but by 3 years, a child should be able to throw or kick a ball rather than just pass it. However, this task is relatively simple and not a critical milestone to determine developmental delay at 3 years.",

It follows an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern. In X-linked dominant disorders, only one copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. Males with a MECP2 mutation typically do not survive infancy (as they lack a second X chromosome), which is why Rett syndrome is almost exclusively seen in females, who have two X chromosomes. It presents with normal early development, followed by loss of acquired skills, particularly motor and communication abilities, along with stereotypic hand movements. Incorrect Options: B) OTC deficiency (Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency) This is an X-linked recessive disorder. It primarily affects males, and females are usually carriers with milder or no symptoms. C) Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5, not X-linked.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mitochondrial The inheritance pattern described — an affected male does not transmit the disease to any children, while an affected female passes it to all her children — is characteristic of mitochondrial inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother, as sperm do not contribute mitochondria to the embryo. Therefore, only females can transmit mitochondrial disorders to their offspring — both sons and daughters. Males, even if affected, do not pass on the condition because they do not contribute mitochondrial DNA to their children. This unique inheritance pattern points directly to a mitochondrial disorder. Incorrect Options: A) Autosomal recessive Requires both parents to pass on a defective gene. It doesn’t follow a maternal-only transmission pattern, and affected individuals can be born to unaffected parents. B) X-linked dominant An affected male would typically pass the condition to all daughters and no sons, while an affected female could pass it to both sons and daughters, but not always all children. C) X-linked recessive Mostly affects males, and affected males do not pass the condition to their sons (since sons inherit their father's Y chromosome), but can pass the gene to daughters (who become carriers).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Screen for WASP gene The child presents with a triad of findings highly suggestive of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS): Recurrent bloody stools – Suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to thrombocytopenia and immune dysregulation. Atopic dermatitis – Common skin manifestation in WAS. Petechiae with a platelet count of 20,000/mm³ – Indicates severe thrombocytopenia, a hallmark of WAS. In WAS, platelets are not only low in number but also abnormally small. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder caused by mutations in the WASP gene. The classic triad includes: Eczema Recurrent infections Thrombocytopenia with small platelets Given this clinical picture, the next step should be to confirm the diagnosis by screening for a mutation in the WASP gene, which will guide further management, including consideration of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the definitive treatment. Incorrect Options: B) Bone marrow biopsy While a bone marrow biopsy may be considered in evaluating unexplained thrombocytopenia, it is not the first step when the clinical triad of WAS is strongly suggestive. It does not confirm the genetic cause. C) Check for antibodies against platelets This would be appropriate in suspected immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However, the presence of eczema and recurrent infections rules out ITP as the sole cause.

Breast milk is uniquely suited for the nutritional and immunological needs of newborns, especially preterm infants. When the biological mother’s milk is unavailable or insufficient, pasteurized donor human milk from a certified human milk bank is the next best option.

Incorrect Options: A) Cow milk Cow’s milk is not suitable for infants, especially preterm babies. It has a high protein and sodium content, which can stress immature kidneys and increase the risk of NEC and allergies. B) Preterm formula Preterm formulas are specially designed and nutritionally better than cow’s milk or term formulas for preterm babies.

It has no role in the management of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by abnormal hemoglobin S, leading to red blood cell sickling, vaso-occlusion, and hemolysis. Management focuses on reducing sickling episodes, preventing complications, and improving oxygen delivery. Useful Drugs in Sickle Cell Anemia: A) Hydroxyurea Increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which reduces sickling and vaso-occlusive crises. It's a first-line disease-modifying therapy for SCD. B) L-Glutamine An amino acid supplement shown to reduce oxidative stress and vaso-occlusive events in sickle cell patients. Approved by the FDA for SCD. C) Voxelotor A hemoglobin modulator that increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, reducing sickling. It helps improve anemia in SCD patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rota Virus Intussusception is a condition where part of the intestine folds into an adjacent section, causing bowel obstruction. It is a rare but known adverse event associated with Rotavirus vaccination. Rotavirus vaccines (such as Rotarix and RotaTeq) are oral live-attenuated vaccines used to prevent severe diarrheal illness caused by rotavirus, particularly in infants. While highly effective and generally safe, post-marketing surveillance identified a small increased risk of intussusception, especially within 7 days after the first dose. Despite this risk, the benefits of rotavirus vaccination far outweigh the risks, as rotavirus can cause life-threatening dehydration in infants. Incorrect Options: B) Typhoid Typhoid vaccines (oral or injectable) have no known association with intussusception. C) Polio Neither the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) nor the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) are linked to intussusception.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mothers with IgG-CMV have low risk of transmitting disease Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital viral infection. Transmission to the fetus occurs transplacentally, and the risk of fetal infection depends on whether the maternal infection is primary or secondary. Primary CMV infection during pregnancy (first-time infection) carries the highest risk of transmission to the fetus, with a higher chance of symptomatic disease. Mothers with pre-existing immunity (IgG positive, i.e., past CMV infection) have a much lower risk of transmission if reactivation or reinfection occurs. This is because maternal IgG antibodies offer partial protection against transplacental transmission. Incorrect Options: A) Triad of SNHL, dental and calcification in 20-30% The classic triad includes sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), periventricular intracranial calcifications, and chorioretinitis, not dental anomalies. While dental anomalies can occur, they are not part of the classic triad. C) 30-40% asymptomatic CMV have high risk of SNHL later While asymptomatic infants can develop SNHL later, the risk is much lower — estimated at 10-15%, not as high as 30–40%.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) SLE Congenital heart block (CHB) is a condition where the electrical conduction system of the heart is impaired in the fetus, leading to bradycardia and, in severe cases, heart failure or hydrops. The most common cause of congenital heart block is autoimmune-related, particularly maternal autoimmune diseases, especially Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) is associated with the presence of anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies, which can cross the placenta and affect the fetal heart, leading to congenital heart block. A positive anti-Ro/anti-La antibody in the mother is a key risk factor for fetal heart block. In these cases, the fetus may develop first-degree, second-degree, or complete heart block. Incorrect Options: A) APLA Syndrome While antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA) can cause complications like miscarriage and thrombosis, it is not the most common cause of congenital heart block. However, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies associated with SLE are often also present in APLA, but SLE is the primary concern in cases of heart block. B) Congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects in the fetus are not typically caused by maternal conditions but result from genetic factors or teratogenic influences. While congenital heart block may occur with other heart defects, SLE is the primary focus in this case. D) Hemolytic anemia Hemolytic anemia, especially in the context of Rh incompatibility, is a different issue and is not linked to congenital heart block. It can lead to hydrops fetalis but not to heart block.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) C and D (TGA and Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome) Cyanotic heart disease refers to congenital heart defects that result in low oxygen levels in the blood, often causing a bluish tint to the skin (cyanosis). In these conditions, there is often an abnormal mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. When considering cyanotic heart disease with increased pulmonary blood flow, the condition involves increased flow of blood to the lungs, leading to pulmonary over-circulation. TGA (Transposition of the Great Arteries) is a condition where the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, resulting in cyanosis. If there is a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or atrial septal defect (ASD), it can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome is a condition where the left side of the heart is underdeveloped. The right ventricle performs both pulmonary and systemic circulation, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow initially. As the defect progresses, it leads to cyanosis due to inadequate systemic circulation. Therefore, TGA and Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (Option A) are cyanotic heart defects with increased pulmonary blood flow. Incorrect Options: 1. Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a cyanotic heart defect, but it is typically associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow rather than increased pulmonary blood flow. The hallmark of Tetralogy of Fallot is pulmonary stenosis, which restricts blood flow to the lungs. 2. Ebstein’s Anomaly Ebstein's anomaly involves an abnormality of the tricuspid valve, which can cause right atrial dilation and right heart failure. It may cause cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting but does not typically cause increased pulmonary blood flow. 5. Tricuspid Atresia In tricuspid atresia, there is an absence of the tricuspid valve, leading to right-to-left shunting and cyanosis. This condition may lead to decreased pulmonary blood flow depending on the associated defects, rather than increased pulmonary blood flow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection) TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection) is a congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to other veins or structures such as the right atrium or the superior vena cava. As a result, oxygenated blood from the lungs does not reach the left atrium properly, and there is an abnormal connection between the pulmonary venous return and the right side of the heart. In TAPVC, oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the right atrium (or other parts of the right side of the heart), mixing with deoxygenated blood, causing equal oxygen saturation levels across all cardiac chambers. This mixing leads to cyanosis, as the oxygenated blood is shunted into the right side and subsequently to the lungs, rather than being distributed to the rest of the body. Incorrect Options: A) TGA (Transposition of the Great Arteries) In TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, causing two separate circulations. There is no mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood unless there is a shunt, such as a PDA or ASD, but the saturation levels in the cardiac chambers are not the same. C) Tricuspid Atresia In tricuspid atresia, there is no tricuspid valve, and the right ventricle is underdeveloped. Blood flows through a septal defect (like an ASD or VSD) to the left side of the heart. The oxygen saturation would typically be higher on the left side, with cyanosis present due to right-to-left shunting, but the saturations are not equal in all chambers. D) TOF (Tetralogy of Fallot) In TOF, there is right-to-left shunting through a VSD and pulmonary stenosis, which leads to cyanosis. However, the saturations are typically lower in the right side of the heart and higher on the left side (due to mixing), meaning saturation is not the same in all chambers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) FEV1/ FVC >0.80 Option A (FEV1/FVC >0.80) is the correct answer because a normal FEV1/FVC ratio of >0.80 suggests that there is no significant obstruction in the airways, which is inconsistent with asthma. In asthma, the primary pathophysiology involves reversible airway obstruction, leading to a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio. Therefore, a ratio greater than 0.80 indicates normal lung function and does not suggest asthma. This is a key reason why Option A is the correct answer. Incorrect Option: Option B (Bronchodilator response - reversibility either FEV1 >12% OR predicted FEV1 >10%): A bronchodilator response with an increase in FEV1 of more than 12% (or more than 10% of predicted FEV1) is a classic sign of asthma. Asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction, and a positive bronchodilator response indicates airway hyperresponsiveness, which is a key feature of asthma. Therefore, this suggests asthma, making it an incorrect answer. Option C (Exercise challenge worsening in FEV1 >15%): An exercise challenge causing a greater than 15% drop in FEV1 is often seen in individuals with asthma. This is known as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), a phenomenon where physical exertion triggers airway narrowing, leading to a significant reduction in lung function. This is a hallmark feature of asthma, not an exclusion, so it cannot be the correct answer. Option D (Daily peak expiratory flow am to pm variation >20%): Diurnal variation in peak expiratory flow (PEF) greater than 20% is an indicator of variable airflow limitation, which is typical in asthma. Asthma often results in fluctuating airflow due to factors like inflammation, airway constriction, and mucus production. Such daily variations in lung function are a key characteristic of asthma, making Option D an incorrect answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) B, C, and D In a child with an exacerbation of bronchial asthma, the primary focus is on relieving the acute symptoms and improving the child’s airway function. Let's break down the appropriate steps: Option B (Start oxygen): Oxygen therapy is essential when a child with asthma exacerbation shows signs of hypoxia (low oxygen levels), which may present as cyanosis, difficulty breathing, or increased work of breathing. Supplemental oxygen helps maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent respiratory failure. Thus, starting oxygen is a critical step in the management of an asthma exacerbation. Option C (Start prednisolone): Prednisolone, a systemic corticosteroid, is used to reduce inflammation and prevent further bronchoconstriction during an asthma exacerbation. Corticosteroids help to control the underlying inflammatory response, which is the hallmark of asthma. Starting systemic steroids is a standard treatment to manage an asthma exacerbation and speed up recovery. Option D (Salbutamol inhalation): Salbutamol, a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), is used to provide quick relief of bronchoconstriction. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, making it easier for the child to breathe. Inhaled salbutamol is one of the first-line treatments in acute asthma exacerbations, and it should be administered as needed. Incorrect Option: Option A (X-Ray): An X-ray is not routinely indicated in the management of an asthma exacerbation unless there are concerns about other underlying causes (such as pneumonia, foreign body aspiration, or pneumothorax) or if the child has severe symptoms that do not respond to treatment. However, an X-ray is not necessary for the immediate management of an asthma exacerbation in most cases, making it unnecessary in this context. Therefore, Option A (X-ray) is not part of the routine management.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) IV Ceftriaxone The clinical presentation of high-grade fever, inspiratory stridor, swallowing difficulty, and drooling of saliva in a child strongly suggests epiglottitis, a life-threatening condition caused by bacterial infection, most commonly by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), although other organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus can also cause it. Epiglottitis leads to airway obstruction, which can progress rapidly, making airway management a priority. Along with airway management, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly to cover the likely bacterial pathogens, and IV Ceftriaxone (a broad-spectrum cephalosporin) is an appropriate choice for initial therapy to treat the infection and prevent further complications such as sepsis. Incorrect Option: Option A (Nebulized Racemic Epinephrine): Nebulized racemic epinephrine is used for croup, a viral condition with stridor and barking cough, which typically affects children under 5 years of age. However, it is not indicated in the management of epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection and requires antibiotics, not nebulized epinephrine, to treat the underlying infection. Option B (Anti-diphtheria toxin): Anti-diphtheria toxin is used to treat diphtheria, which can cause pharyngeal swelling and airway obstruction. However, the symptoms described here (fever, inspiratory stridor, drooling) are more characteristic of epiglottitis, not diphtheria. Therefore, anti-diphtheria toxin is not the correct treatment for this condition. Option C (Corticosteroids/Conservative): Corticosteroids may be used in the management of croup to reduce inflammation, but epiglottitis requires antibiotic therapy to treat the bacterial infection, and corticosteroids are not the first-line treatment. While supportive care is important, antibiotics are the primary therapy for bacterial infections like epiglottitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cystic Fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a classic example of an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator), most commonly the ΔF508 mutation. For a child to be affected by CF, they must inherit two defective copies of the CFTR gene, one from each parent. Parents are typically carriers who do not show symptoms. CF primarily affects the lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal system, and sweat glands, leading to thick, sticky mucus production, recurrent lung infections, malabsorption, and failure to thrive. Since it follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, Option A is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B) Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, especially in Type I and Type IV, which are the more common forms. Although rarer autosomal recessive forms do exist (e.g., Type VII and VIII), the majority of clinically relevant and common cases are autosomal dominant, so this is not the best answer. C) Treacher Collins Syndrome Treacher Collins syndrome is a craniofacial developmental disorder most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It is caused by mutations in the TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D genes. While rare autosomal recessive forms may occur (especially with POLR1C mutations), the dominant form is the most typical. D) Achondroplasia Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It results from mutations in the FGFR3 gene. Most cases occur as de novo (new) mutations, but when inherited, it follows a dominant pattern.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 508; phenylalanine; Cl Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. This gene codes for a chloride ion channel that is vital for the regulation of salt and water transport across epithelial cells in the lungs, pancreas, intestines, and other organs. The most common mutation is known as ΔF508 (also written as F508del), where: 508 refers to the position of the mutation on the CFTR protein. Phenylalanine (F) is the amino acid that is deleted at this position. The mutation disrupts the function of chloride (Cl-) ion transport. This defective chloride transport leads to thick, sticky mucus in various organs, predisposing individuals to recurrent respiratory infections, malabsorption, and other complications. Thus, Option A is correct because it identifies: The correct position (508), The correct amino acid involved (phenylalanine), And the correct ion affected (chloride). Incorrect Options: Option B (708; tryptophan; Ca) This is incorrect in all three aspects — the position (708) is not the key site of mutation, tryptophan is not the affected amino acid, and calcium (Ca²?) transport is not the primary defect in CF. Option C (708; tryptophan; Cl) While chloride transport is correctly mentioned, both the amino acid (tryptophan) and the position (708) are incorrect. Option D (708; phenylalanine; Cl) This option correctly identifies phenylalanine and chloride, but the position (708) is incorrect. The mutation most commonly occurs at position 508.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cystic fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which affects epithelial ion transport, leading to thick secretions in multiple organs. In males with CF, one of the most common reproductive manifestations is Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens (CBAVD), which may also be associated with the absence or underdevelopment of seminal vesicles. This abnormality results in obstructive azoospermia, a common cause of infertility in men with CF. Notably, some men with CBAVD may not have classic pulmonary or gastrointestinal features of CF but still carry mutations in the CFTR gene — this is considered a mild or atypical CF phenotype.. Incorrect Options: B) Klinefelter Syndrome: Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) affects testicular development, resulting in small, firm testes, low testosterone, and infertility, but the vas deferens and seminal vesicles are present. Infertility is due to testicular failure, not absence of the reproductive ducts. C) Kallmann Syndrome: Kallmann syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia. It results from deficient GnRH secretion, leading to underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics and infertility. The reproductive tract structures, including vas deferens and seminal vesicles, are usually present. D) Chromosomal microdeletion: Certain Y chromosome microdeletions (especially in the AZF region) can lead to male infertility by impairing spermatogenesis, but they do not typically cause congenital absence of the vas deferens or seminal vesicles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A and B Febrile seizures are seizures associated with fever in children aged 6 months to 5 years, without evidence of CNS infection or other underlying neurologic cause. Several risk factors increase the likelihood of febrile seizures, and understanding them helps guide both diagnosis and counseling. Option A (Age < 1 year) Children younger than 1 year are at higher risk of febrile seizures. The peak incidence is around 18 months, but children under 1 year have a more immature nervous system, making them more susceptible to seizures during febrile episodes. Option B (Fever < 24 hours) Febrile seizures commonly occur early in the febrile illness, often within the first 24 hours. This is thought to be due to the rapid rise in body temperature, not necessarily the height of the fever. Thus, seizures are more likely when the fever has just started. Incorrect Options: Option C (Fever > 24 hours) While febrile seizures can occur at any point during a fever, they are less likely to occur after 24 hours. Most febrile seizures happen during the initial phase of the febrile illness. Option D (Temperature 35–36°C) This range is below normal body temperature (i.e., hypothermia), which is not associated with febrile seizures. Febrile seizures occur during episodes of fever, typically when body temperature rises above 38°C (100.4°F).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rectal diazepam The child is having a prolonged generalized seizure (>5 minutes), now considered status epilepticus. Immediate benzodiazepine administration is the first-line treatment. When IV access is not available, alternative non-IV routes must be used without delay. Rectal diazepam is the most widely used and recommended non-IV route in pediatric settings, especially in emergencies when IV access is difficult. It is effective, relatively easy to administer, and rapidly absorbed through the rectal mucosa, making it ideal in this situation. This route is recommended by standard protocols like the American Epilepsy Society and PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support). Incorrect Options: A) IV phenobarbitone Phenobarbitone is not the first-line drug in an actively seizing child and requires IV access, which is not currently possible. It is reserved for later stages of status epilepticus when benzodiazepines and phenytoin fail. C) Intraosseous midazolam While midazolam can be used intramuscularly or intranasally if IV access is not available, intraosseous (IO) access is an invasive procedure requiring expertise and specific equipment. It is used when both IV and non-invasive routes fail or in advanced resuscitation settings, not as the first non-IV option. D) IV phenytoin Phenytoin is typically the second-line agent after benzodiazepines fail, and again, IV access is needed. In this case, IV access is not possible, making this option inappropriate at this stage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phenytoin IV This is a case of established status epilepticus, defined as a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or repeated seizures without recovery in between. The standard stepwise approach is: First-line: A benzodiazepine (e.g., rectal diazepam, IV lorazepam, IM/intranasal midazolam). If seizures continue beyond 5–10 minutes after first-line, proceed to: Second-line therapy: An IV antiepileptic drug, most commonly: Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin Alternatives include levetiracetam or valproate (depending on availability and clinical context). Since IV access is now available and benzodiazepine has already been given without success, the next step is to administer an IV long-acting antiepileptic, most classically phenytoin. This is supported by PALS, NICE, and ILAE guidelines. Incorrect Options: A) IV phenobarbitone This is considered a third-line agent used in refractory status epilepticus (when seizures persist after both benzodiazepines and second-line agents like phenytoin). It's too early in the treatment ladder for this. B) Rectal diazepam Already administered (non-IV benzodiazepine), and since it failed, repeating it is not appropriate once IV access is available. Also, rectal route is no longer preferred when IV access is achieved. C) Intraosseous midazolam This is a backup route when IV access cannot be established, which is not the case here. Additionally, midazolam (a benzodiazepine) was part of the first-line options, and the case has already moved beyond that.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) West syndrome West syndrome, also known as infantile spasms, is a severe epileptic encephalopathy that typically presents in infants between 3–12 months of age. The classic triad includes: Infantile spasms (sudden flexion or extension movements), Hypsarrhythmia on EEG (chaotic, high-amplitude background), Developmental regression or delay. The drug of choice for West syndrome is ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone). It is believed to work by modulating the brain’s excitatory and inhibitory balance and suppressing abnormal cortical activity. ACTH has shown superior efficacy in stopping spasms and improving developmental outcomes compared to many other antiepileptic drugs, particularly in cryptogenic (non-symptomatic) cases. Incorrect Options: A) Tuberous sclerosis Tuberous sclerosis can cause West syndrome, but ACTH is used to treat West syndrome itself, not the underlying tuberous sclerosis. Management of tuberous sclerosis may also involve vigabatrin, which is preferred in TS-associated infantile spasms. C) Rolandic epilepsy This is a benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, often resolving with age and typically treated with conventional antiepileptics like carbamazepine or no treatment in mild cases. ACTH is not used here. D) Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) JME is a genetic generalized epilepsy starting in adolescence, managed with drugs like valproic acid or levetiracetam.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A, B and D Absence seizures are a type of generalized non-motor seizure typically seen in childhood absence epilepsy. They are characterized by brief lapses in consciousness, often with staring spells, and typically have 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges on EEG. The mainstay of treatment includes anti-epileptic drugs that target T-type calcium channels or that are effective in generalized epilepsies. A) Ethosuximide Ethosuximide is considered the first-line treatment specifically for absence seizures in children. It is particularly effective and has fewer cognitive side effects compared to valproate. It works by inhibiting T-type calcium channels in thalamic neurons. B) Valproate Valproate is also highly effective in treating absence seizures, especially when the child has mixed seizure types (e.g., generalized tonic-clonic along with absence seizures). It has a broader spectrum of activity but comes with more potential side effects, especially in girls due to risk of teratogenicity. D) Lamotrigine Lamotrigine is considered a second-line agent for absence seizures. It's less effective than ethosuximide or valproate but is sometimes preferred due to a better side effect profile, particularly for long-term use. Incorrect Option: C) Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is contraindicated in absence seizures. It can worsen generalized epilepsies, including absence and myoclonic seizures, by promoting synchronization of cortical discharges. Hence, it should not be used in absence seizure cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) This case describes a classic presentation of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), a generalized epilepsy syndrome that typically begins in adolescence (ages 12–18 years). Key clinical features of JME include: Myoclonic jerks, especially in the morning or upon awakening — often described as dropping objects or sudden jerky movements of the arms. Jerks are exacerbated by stress, sleep deprivation, or fatigue, such as during exams or early in the day. Many patients do not initially have loss of consciousness, which distinguishes it from generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Family history of epilepsy is common, as JME has a genetic predisposition. EEG findings often show generalized 4–6 Hz polyspike and wave discharges. Incorrect Options: B) Atypical absence This involves prolonged lapses in consciousness, often with less distinct onset/offset and more subtle EEG changes (slow spike-and-wave). It does not cause myoclonic jerks or object dropping. C) Choreo-athetoid epilepsy This is not a recognized clinical epilepsy syndrome. Choreoathetosis refers to involuntary movement disorders, not epilepsy. D) Centrotemporal spikes (Rolandic epilepsy) This is a benign childhood epilepsy, often occurring during sleep with focal motor seizures involving the face or oropharyngeal muscles.

Let's break down each statement: A. Polygenic inheritance JME is believed to have polygenic inheritance, meaning that multiple genes contribute to the development of the condition. There is often a family history of epilepsy, but it doesn't follow a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern. C. Lamotrigine decreases the incidence of myoclonus Lamotrigine is an effective treatment for JME, particularly for controlling generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Although valproate is the first-line treatment, lamotrigine can be beneficial in reducing the frequency of myoclonic jerks in some patients, particularly if valproate is contraindicated (e.g., in females due to its teratogenic effects). Incorrect Options: B. Valproate should be avoided Valproate is first-line treatment for JME because it is highly effective in controlling myoclonic jerks, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and absence seizures. The recommendation to avoid valproate is generally reserved for females of childbearing age due to the potential for teratogenicity, not because it is ineffective. D. BZD alone can treat myoclonic jerks Benzodiazepines (BZD), such as clonazepam, may provide short-term relief for myoclonic jerks, but they are not first-line treatment. Valproate and lamotrigine are preferred as long-term management options, as they provide better control of seizures and myoclonus.

Bulging anterior fontanelle in infants is a classic clinical sign of raised intracranial pressure, and when accompanied by fever and seizures, it strongly suggests central nervous system (CNS) infection such as meningitis. Meningitis can present subtly in young children with signs like irritability, vomiting, poor feeding, seizures, and fontanelle bulge rather than the classic signs seen in older children or adults (e.g., neck stiffness). Incorrect Options: B) Febrile seizure Febrile seizures are common between 6 months and 5 years, but they are typically associated with high-grade fever, and neurological examination is otherwise normal. A bulging fontanelle is not typical and raises concern for underlying CNS pathology, ruling this out as the most likely cause here. C) Pseudotumor cerebri Also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, this is extremely rare in infants. It usually occurs in older children or adolescents, particularly obese females, and does not typically present with fever or seizures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A Till 24 hours after starting antibiotics Children diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, especially caused by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal meningitis), require isolation precautions to prevent transmission to others. The bacteria are transmitted through respiratory droplets, making early isolation critical. Once appropriate antibiotics are started, the infectivity drops significantly within 24 hours. Therefore, droplet isolation precautions should be continued for at least 24 hours after initiation of effective antibiotic therapy. This is standard guidance from bodies like the CDC and AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics). Incorrect Options: B) Till cultures become negative Culture results take 48–72 hours, and by that time, the patient is no longer infectious if already on antibiotics. Isolation until negative cultures is not necessary. C) Till antibiotic course is complete Bacterial meningitis treatment usually continues for 7–21 days, depending on the organism, but the risk of transmission does not persist that long. Isolation until course completion is not practical or needed. D) Till 12 hrs after admission There's no evidence that isolation based solely on time since admission is effective. The key factor is antibiotic initiation, not just hospital admission.",

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), particularly HSV-1 or HSV-2, can cause herpes meningoencephalitis. The presence of vesicles on the skin, soles, and mucocutaneous regions along with neurological signs like neck stiffness strongly points toward herpetic infection. HSV meningoencephalitis is a medical emergency requiring prompt initiation of IV acyclovir. Incorrect Option B Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is caused by enteroviruses (most commonly Coxsackie A16 or Enterovirus 71). While HFMD may present with vesicular lesions on hands, feet, and mouth, and rarely causes aseptic meningitis, the distribution of lesions in this question is more generalized (body and soles), which is more typical of herpes.

Immunization decisions in such children must take into account the type of vaccine and the immunosuppressive status. B. You can only give killed vaccines Live vaccines are generally contraindicated during periods of high-dose or prolonged steroid therapy due to the risk of disseminated infection. Killed (inactivated) vaccines are safe and recommended. C. Siblings cannot be given OPV Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) is a live attenuated vaccine, and virus shedding can occur in the stool. This poses a risk of transmission to an immunocompromised sibling. Therefore, OPV should not be given to household contacts of immunosuppressed children. Instead, Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) is preferred. D. Pneumococcal vaccine is important prior to treatment Children with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of encapsulated bacterial infections, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hence, giving pneumococcal vaccination (both PCV and PPSV23) before initiating or during low-dose immunosuppression is important for infection prevention. Incorrect Option: A. You can give all vaccines This is incorrect because live vaccines (e.g., MMR, Varicella, OPV) are contraindicated in children on immunosuppressive therapy like long-term or high-dose steroids.

Appropriate diagnosis, evaluation, and management are crucial to prevent long-term complications such as renal scarring. Let's evaluate each option: B. Bladder and bowel dysfunction increases the risk Bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) significantly increases the risk of recurrent UTI. Conditions like infrequent voiding, constipation, or incomplete bladder emptying lead to urinary stasis, which facilitates bacterial growth and infection. C. Recurrent UTI should get MCU Micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) is recommended in children with recurrent febrile UTIs, especially in younger children (<2 years) or those with abnormal renal ultrasound. MCU helps in detecting vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and other anatomical abnormalities that predispose to UTI. Incorrect Options: A. Most common is S. pneumoniae The most common cause of UTI in children is Escherichia coli (E. coli), not Streptococcus pneumoniae. E. coli accounts for 80–90% of UTIs in children. D.

DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan) – Second DMSA renal scan is done after the acute infection subsides, typically after 2–3 months. It detects: Cortical scarring Renal parenchymal defects Differential renal function It is used to assess damage caused by recurrent or severe UTIs. B. MCU (Micturating Cystourethrogram) – Third MCU is performed if the USG is abnormal or if recurrent UTI occurs.

Let’s break it down: Brown-colored urine: Suggests hematuria, typically glomerular in origin, often described as \"cola\" or \"tea-colored\" urine. Oliguria: Indicates reduced urine output, common in acute nephritic syndrome. Facial and pedal edema: Due to salt and water retention from impaired glomerular filtration. Hypertension (BP 126/90): Common in PSGN due to fluid overload and renal sodium retention. Urinalysis findings: +3 proteinuria – moderate proteinuria is expected in nephritic syndrome. 100 RBCs, granular casts – indicates glomerular bleeding and tubular injury, typical of PSGN. Renal function: Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL is slightly elevated for a child, consistent with mild AKI. Urea 56 mg/dL supports decreased renal clearance. The history and lab findings are most consistent with PSGN. Incorrect Options: B) Nephrolithiasis Stones usually cause gross hematuria, severe flank pain, and sometimes dysuria, but not edema or hypertension. Also, no RBC casts are seen. C) FSGN (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) FSGS is more of a chronic nephrotic syndrome, typically with massive proteinuria, minimal hematuria, and progressive renal dysfunction.

The reasons for this include: CMV reactivation or transmission from the donor organ, especially in seropositive donors to seronegative recipients. Use of immunosuppressive therapy post-transplant increases susceptibility. CMV can cause a wide range of complications: CMV syndrome (fever, malaise, leukopenia) Tissue-invasive disease (hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis) Increases risk of graft rejection and opportunistic infections. In India, where CMV seroprevalence is high, reactivation of latent infection is particularly common post-transplant. Incorrect Options: A) Varicella Varicella (VZV) can cause serious disease in immunosuppressed individuals, but it's less common than CMV post-transplant.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 40 ml/min/1.73 m². To calculate the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) in children, the Schwartz formula is commonly used: eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²)=k×Height (cm)Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)\\text{eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²)} = \\frac{k \\times \\text{Height (cm)}}{\\text{Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)}}eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²)=Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)k×Height (cm)? For children aged 1–13 years, the constant k = 0.413. In this case, the child’s height is 100 cm, and serum creatinine is 1 mg/dL. eGFR=0.413×1001=41.3≈40 ml/min/1.73 m²\\text{eGFR} = \\frac{0.413 \\times 100}{1} = 41.3 \\approx 40 \\text{ ml/min/1.73 m²}eGFR=10.413×100?=41.3≈40 ml/min/1.73 m² Thus, the correct answer is B, which reflects moderate kidney dysfunction. Incorrect Options: A) 80 ml/min/1.73 m² This would be the eGFR if the child had either a much lower serum creatinine or a significantly greater height. With a serum creatinine of 1 mg/dL and 100 cm height, this value is too high and not consistent with Schwartz formula output. C) 33 ml/min/1.73 m² This is slightly lower than the actual calculated value (41.3). It could result from a slightly different height or incorrect formula usage, but does not match the child's actual parameters. D) 55 ml/min/1.73 m² This value is also higher than the actual eGFR and does not align with the provided serum creatinine and height using the standard pediatric calculation method.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Posterior urethral valves Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the most common cause of urinary tract obstruction in male infants and children. PUV is a congenital anomaly that results from an abnormal membrane or valve-like structure in the posterior urethra. It leads to bladder outlet obstruction, causing backpressure effects that can damage the bladder, ureters, and kidneys. PUV typically presents in utero or during infancy, and may cause: Hydronephrosis Oligohydramnios (if severe) Poor urinary stream Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) Chronic kidney disease if untreated Early diagnosis (via antenatal ultrasound) and prompt postnatal management are critical. Incorrect Options: B) Anterior urethral valves These are much rarer than PUV and cause similar obstructive symptoms, but the obstruction is in the anterior urethra. PUV is far more prevalent and clinically significant in male children. C) Ureterocele A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the distal ureter, often seen in association with a duplicated collecting system. While it can cause obstruction, it is not the most common cause, especially not in male children.

It results from a gain-of-function mutation in the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the distal nephron, leading to: Increased sodium reabsorption Increased potassium and hydrogen ion excretion Resulting features: Hypertension Hypokalemia Metabolic alkalosis Low renin and aldosterone levels Thus, Liddle syndrome is characterized by hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with hypertension, making Option C the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A) Bartter syndrome Bartter syndrome also presents with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, but typically with normal or low blood pressure. It is due to a defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, causing sodium and chloride wasting. B) Gitelman syndrome Similar to Bartter syndrome but involves the distal convoluted tubule, and features hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria, with normal or low BP, not hypertension.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by the degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. This results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, especially affecting proximal muscles. A key clinical feature of SMA, particularly Type I (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), is the presence of tongue fasciculations—tiny, involuntary muscle twitches visible on the surface of the tongue. These fasciculations reflect lower motor neuron involvement, which is a hallmark of SMA. Other signs include: Hypotonia (“floppy baby”) Absent deep tendon reflexes Progressive respiratory failure (in severe cases) Incorrect Options: A) Myasthenia gravis This is a disorder of neuromuscular junction transmission, typically affecting extraocular and bulbar muscles. It causes fatigable weakness, but does not present with fasciculations or lower motor neuron signs like tongue fasciculations. C) Duchenne muscular dystrophy A primary myopathy with pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles and proximal muscle weakness. It affects muscle fibers directly but does not involve the lower motor neurons, so tongue fasciculations are not seen. D) Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) An acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy affecting peripheral nerves, often causing ascending weakness and areflexia. While it is a lower motor neuron disorder, tongue fasciculations are not typical of GBS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Steroids Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that often presents with ascending weakness, areflexia, and sometimes respiratory failure. The mainstay treatments aim to reduce the autoimmune attack on peripheral nerves. Corticosteroids are not useful and have not shown benefit in multiple clinical trials for GBS. In fact, guidelines recommend against their routine use for treating GBS, as they do not speed up recovery or improve outcomes, unlike other therapies such as IVIG and plasmapheresis. Incorrect Options: A) Plasmapheresis Plasmapheresis is one of the two first-line treatments for GBS. It works by removing circulating antibodies that attack the peripheral nerves. It’s most effective when started early in the course of illness. B) IV Immunoglobulins IVIG is equally effective as plasmapheresis in treating GBS. It helps by neutralizing harmful autoantibodies and modulating immune response. It’s often preferred due to ease of administration and fewer complications. D) Ventilatory Support Up to 30% of GBS patients may develop respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. Early monitoring of respiratory function and mechanical ventilation when needed is life-saving and an essential part of supportive care.",

The following are likely differential diagnoses: 1. Severe Dehydration Common with diarrhea and vomiting in young children. Leads to hypovolemia, poor perfusion, and potentially shock, which can result in altered consciousness. This is a primary concern in acute gastroenteritis. 3. Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) Dehydration is a predisposing factor for CVT in children. Presents with altered sensorium, seizures, and sometimes focal neurological signs. Must be considered if sensorium does not improve with rehydration. 4. Hyponatremia Due to electrolyte losses from diarrhea or inappropriate fluid replacement (e.g., with hypotonic fluids). Can cause cerebral edema, leading to lethargy, vomiting, and seizures or coma. INCORRECT OPTION 2. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) – Incorrect in this context While HUS can follow bloody diarrhea (often due to E. coli O157:H7), the current case involves watery diarrhea without mention of hematuria, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. HUS presents more commonly after diarrheal illness and with renal failure and anemia, not typically within 3 days. Less likely early differential in this scenario.",

In perinatal or congenital infection, it targets erythroid progenitor cells in the fetal bone marrow, leading to: Severe fetal anemia High-output cardiac failure Hydrops fetalis (manifesting as ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions) Possible myocarditis contributing to fetal demise This spectrum of findings—anemia, myocarditis, high-output failure, and ascites—is classic for congenital Parvovirus B19 infection. Incorrect Options: B) CMV (Cytomegalovirus) Congenital CMV causes sensorineural hearing loss, periventricular calcifications, microcephaly, and jaundice. While anemia can occur, hydrops and heart failure are not typical features. C) Treponema pallidum (Congenital syphilis) Causes snuffles, saber shins, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, and bone abnormalities, but does not commonly cause hydrops fetalis due to anemia or myocarditis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cl- increased in sweat and decreased in pancreatic secretion Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator), most commonly the ΔF508 mutation. The CFTR protein functions as a chloride channel and plays a critical role in fluid and electrolyte transport across epithelial surfaces. In CF, the CFTR protein is dysfunctional or absent, leading to abnormal chloride ion transport across various epithelial tissues, including: Sweat Glands: CFTR normally reabsorbs Cl and Na in sweat ducts. In CF, this reabsorption is defective → Cl remains in the sweat. Result: ↑ Cl- in sweat — the basis for the sweat chloride test, a key diagnostic tool for CF. Pancreas: CFTR facilitates Cl- secretion into pancreatic ducts, which drives bicarbonate and water secretion. In CF, reduced Cl- transport → viscous secretions, pancreatic duct obstruction, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. So, Cl- secretion is decreased in the pancreas. Incorrect Options: A) Cl- increased in sweat and pancreatic secretion Only correct for sweat; pancreatic Cl- secretion is decreased, not increased. B) Cl- decreased in sweat and pancreatic secretion Opposite of what happens; sweat Cl- is increased, not decreased. C) Cl- decreased in sweat and increased in pancreatic secretion This contradicts the known pathophysiology of CF.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HSV-2 Teratogens are agents that cause malformations or functional deficits in a developing fetus when the mother is exposed during pregnancy. These include viruses, drugs, chemicals, and radiation. Among infections, the classic TORCH group includes major teratogenic pathogens. Let's examine the options: A) HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus type 2) – NOT teratogenic HSV-2 typically causes perinatal transmission during vaginal delivery, especially if the mother has an active genital lesion. It can lead to neonatal herpes, which may affect the skin, eyes, CNS, or become disseminated. However, HSV-2 is not considered teratogenic because it does not typically affect organogenesis in utero. Thus, it does not cause congenital malformations when contracted during the first trimester. INCORRECT OPTION B) CMV (Cytomegalovirus) – Teratogenic A major TORCH infection. Can cause sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, periventricular calcifications, developmental delay, and chorioretinitis. One of the most common teratogenic viral infections. C) Rubella – Teratogenic Rubella infection during the first trimester is highly teratogenic. Classic features include congenital rubella syndrome: cataracts, deafness, congenital heart disease, and \"blueberry muffin\" rash. Vaccination prevents these severe outcomes. D) Varicella Zoster – Teratogenic Primary infection (chickenpox) in early pregnancy can cause congenital varicella syndrome. Features include limb hypoplasia, cutaneous scars, neurologic abnormalities, and ocular defects.",

It provides a structured framework to engage adolescents in conversation and to identify risk behaviors, mental health issues, or psychosocial stressors. The acronym HEADSSS stands for: H – Home (living situation, relationships with family) E – Education/Employment (school performance, future plans) A – Activities (social life, hobbies, sports) D – Drugs (use of tobacco, alcohol, or other substances) S – Sexuality (orientation, sexual activity, contraception) S – Suicide/Depression (mood, self-harm, mental health) S – Safety (exposure to violence, bullying, online safety) This tool is particularly effective in adolescents (typically ages 10–19 years) due to the complexity of developmental and psychosocial changes during this phase. Incorrect Options: A) Infants HEADSSS is not applicable to infants as they cannot self-report and are not involved in complex social or psychological scenarios. B) 0–5 years Children in this age group are in early development stages and are assessed primarily through parental observation and developmental screening tools, not HEADSSS.

Once initial fluid bolus is complete, insulin infusion (typically 0.05–0.1 units/kg/hr) is started after the first hour. INCORRECT OPTIONS A) Insulin stat + infusion Giving a stat (bolus) dose of insulin is not recommended, as it can lead to cerebral edema due to rapid osmotic shifts.

It is classified into mild, moderate, and severe stages based on clinical and neurological signs. Among the listed options, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone) is a key clinical indicator of severe HIE. In infants, persistent hypotonia, especially when accompanied by poor reflexes, lethargy, seizures, or abnormal posture, strongly suggests moderate to severe brain injury. Incorrect Options: A) APGAR 4–7 at 5 minutes While a low APGAR score is a warning sign, it is not specific for severe HIE. Many babies with low APGAR scores recover quickly and do not develop HIE. Severe HIE is more often associated with APGAR <3 at 5 minutes or persisting low scores beyond 10 minutes. C) Cord pH <7.2 A cord pH <7.2 indicates mild acidosis. Severe HIE typically correlates with cord pH <7.0. Thus, pH <7.2 may suggest some degree of hypoxia but not necessarily severe HIE.

The most likely causes involve dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, or cerebral pathology. Let’s analyze the differentials: A) Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT): Severe dehydration and hemoconcentration can precipitate CVT, especially in infants and children. CVT can present with vomiting, seizures, and altered sensorium, making it a relevant differential. B) Hyponatremia: Common in children with prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, especially if given hypotonic fluids. Severe hyponatremia can cause brain edema, resulting in decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and irritability. C) Severe Dehydration: This is one of the most common and immediate complications of diarrhea and vomiting. It directly leads to hypovolemia, shock, and decreased cerebral perfusion, which explains altered consciousness.

It is associated with a wide range of clinical features, but caudal regression syndrome is not a typical feature of Down syndrome. Let’s analyze each of the given options: A) Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine issue in individuals with Down syndrome. It is due to both autoimmune thyroiditis and the inherent susceptibility of the thyroid gland in these individuals. The incidence of hypothyroidism in people with Down syndrome is higher than in the general population, and it often requires monitoring and management. B) Hearing Loss: Hearing loss is a prevalent concern in individuals with Down syndrome. It can be due to conductive hearing loss from ear infections or sensorineural hearing loss. Children with Down syndrome should undergo regular hearing screenings, as they are at an increased risk for hearing deficits. C) Short Stature: Short stature is another characteristic commonly seen in Down syndrome. Growth delay occurs, and children with Down syndrome tend to be shorter in height compared to their peers. Growth hormone deficiency and delayed puberty are sometimes contributing factors. Incorrect option: D) Caudal Regression Syndrome: Caudal regression syndrome (CRS) is a rare disorder where there is abnormal development of the lower spine and limbs. It typically results in defects in the caudal (lower) part of the body, such as absence of the lower limbs, spinal cord anomalies, or anal atresia. CRS is not associated with Down syndrome. The features of CRS are unrelated to the typical phenotypic manifestations of Down syndrome, and it occurs in a different context of embryological development. The most common causes of CRS include maternal diabetes, genetic mutations, or teratogenic exposures during pregnancy, not trisomy 21.",

Explanation: The combination of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) findings—markedly low glucose (20mg/dL), elevated protein (63mg/dL), and lymphocytosis—is highly characteristic of Tubercular meningitis (TBM). Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent, consumes glucose, leading to its significant depletion in the CSF. The inflammation caused by the infection results in elevated protein levels, and the body's immune response typically manifests as a predominance of lymphocytes in the CSF. In contrast, typical bacterial meningitis usually shows neutrophilic predominance, and viral meningitis typically presents with normal CSF glucose levels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) MR s/c on right arm, and Oral vitamin A at 9 months completed At the next vaccination visit for a child who has received BCG at birth and has already been vaccinated at 14 weeks, the following steps are generally recommended: Measles-Rubella (MR) Vaccine: The MR vaccine is given at 9 months of age as part of the routine immunization schedule. It is usually administered as a subcutaneous (s/c) injection. The correct site for administration of this vaccine is the right arm, according to typical immunization guidelines. Oral Vitamin A: Vitamin A supplementation is recommended at 9 months of age, and this is usually given orally. It is commonly provided at the same time as the measles-rubella vaccine to improve the immune response and decrease the risk of complications from measles. Therefore, Option B is the correct choice, as it correctly suggests the MR vaccine on the right arm and oral vitamin A at 9 months. Incorrect options: Option A (MR s/c on left arm, and Oral vitamin A at 9 months completed): The MR vaccine is usually given in the right arm, not the left. While oral vitamin A at 9 months is correct, the left arm administration of MR vaccine is not the standard. Option C (MR s/c on left arm, and Oral vitamin A at 8 months completed): Again, the MR vaccine should be given on the right arm, not the left. Additionally, oral vitamin A should be given at 9 months, not 8 months. The timing of vitamin A supplementation at 8 months is premature for this schedule. Option D (MR s/c on right arm, and Oral vitamin A at 8 months completed): While the MR vaccine is correctly given on the right arm, oral vitamin A should be given at 9 months, not at 8 months.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hydroxyurea In sickle cell anemia, the drug primarily used to reduce the frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive crises is hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which reduces sickling of red blood cells and improves blood flow, thereby decreasing the frequency of painful episodes and other complications associated with the disease. Hydroxyurea has been shown to: Increase HbF levels, which helps prevent sickling of red blood cells. Reduce the number of painful crises and hospitalizations due to vaso-occlusion. Improve overall quality of life and survival in patients with sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea is currently the gold standard treatment for managing sickle cell anemia and preventing vaso-occlusive crises. Incorrect Options: B) Methotrexate-Leucovorin: Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug primarily used in autoimmune conditions, certain cancers, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is not used in sickle cell anemia for managing vaso-occlusive crises. Leucovorin is a folic acid derivative used to mitigate the side effects of methotrexate, but neither drug is used in the treatment of sickle cell crises.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Asymptomatic patients have risk of SNHL Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common intrauterine infection, affecting 0.2% to 2.2% of live births globally. While many infected infants are asymptomatic at birth, they are still at risk for developing long-term complications, including sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Asymptomatic patients with congenital CMV infection have an increased risk of developing SNHL later in childhood. This is the most common long-term complication of congenital CMV infection, and children may develop hearing loss that may not be immediately apparent at birth. Hearing loss may be progressive and can occur over time, often detected as part of routine childhood hearing screening. Incorrect options : A) It is the most common intrauterine infection, second to syphilis: This statement is incorrect. CMV is actually the most common congenital viral infection and is the leading cause of congenital infections, but it is not \"second to syphilis.\" Syphilis is a less common congenital infection in comparison to CMV. B) Blood PCR is best to diagnose within 2-3 weeks of life: While blood PCR is indeed a useful diagnostic tool for detecting congenital CMV infection, the best time to perform PCR for accurate results is within the first 2-3 weeks of life, not necessarily as a universal recommendation for diagnosis in all cases. The statement itself is partially true, but it is not the most specific answer to the question. PCR from urine or saliva samples, rather than blood, is typically considered more useful for diagnosis in the first 3 weeks. D) 30-40% are symptomatic at birth: This statement is incorrect. Only about 10-15% of infants born with congenital CMV infection show symptoms at birth. The vast majority of affected infants are asymptomatic at birth, and some may develop symptoms later in life. The percentage is significantly lower than 30-40%.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bag & mask ventilation The infant described in the scenario with respiratory distress, high respiratory rate, and a scaphoid abdomen is likely presenting with a condition known as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). In CDH, abdominal contents (such as the intestines or liver) herniate into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm, leading to lung hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs) and impaired respiratory function. One of the key management principles in these cases is that bag and mask ventilation (BVM) should not be attempted initially. Here's why: Bag and mask ventilation (BVM) can increase intra-abdominal pressure, which may worsen the herniation of the abdominal organs into the chest cavity, further compressing the already underdeveloped lungs and worsening the respiratory distress. In addition, air can enter the stomach due to the diaphragmatic defect, causing gastric distension, which further compromises ventilation. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid bag & mask ventilation in such a situation and proceed with other management strategies such as: Intubation: Intubation and controlled ventilation are recommended in cases of CDH to provide optimal oxygenation and ventilation while avoiding air entry into the stomach. Free-flow oxygen can be administered to help improve oxygenation. Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) may be used, but it should be done carefully, and the underlying condition (e.g., diaphragmatic hernia) must be considered. Incorrect Options: B) PPV (Positive Pressure Ventilation): While PPV may be necessary in cases of respiratory distress, it is a safer alternative to bag-mask ventilation when properly performed in a controlled manner. PPV can help provide adequate ventilation, but in cases like CDH, it should be done with caution to avoid worsening the hernia. C) Intubation: Intubation is the preferred approach in cases of suspected CDH. It allows for controlled ventilation and ensures that air does not enter the stomach, thus preventing gastric distension and worsening the condition. Intubation should be prioritized when bag-mask ventilation is contraindicated. D) Free-flow oxygen: Free-flow oxygen can be safely administered and can improve oxygenation, especially in infants with respiratory distress. This does not worsen the underlying condition and is used as part of initial stabilization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Megaloblastic anemia The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is megaloblastic anemia. Here's the reasoning behind this: Vegan diet: A vegan diet typically lacks sufficient sources of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folate. Both of these nutrients are crucial for normal red blood cell production. A deficiency in either can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency is more commonly associated with pernicious anemia in vegans because vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products. Folate deficiency can also lead to megaloblastic anemia, though it is less specific than B12 deficiency. MCV of 110 fL: The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is an important indicator of the size of red blood cells. An MCV of 110 fL is considered macrocytic, which suggests megaloblastic anemia, where the red blood cells are larger than normal. Hemoglobin (Hb) of 10 g/dl: The hemoglobin level is lower than the normal range, indicating anemia. Anemia with an elevated MCV is characteristic of megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate. Incorrect options: B) Iron deficiency anemia: Iron deficiency anemia typically presents with microcytic anemia (low MCV), not macrocytic anemia. The MCV is usually low in iron deficiency anemia, which is the opposite of the 110 fL seen here. In addition, iron deficiency is not associated with elevated MCV. C) Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia is characterized by bone marrow failure, resulting in pancytopenia (low red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). It doesn't typically cause macrocytic anemia. In this case, the patient’s hemoglobin is low, but there is no mention of other blood counts being abnormal, which would be expected in aplastic anemia. D) Thalassemia: Thalassemia is typically associated with microcytic anemia, not macrocytic anemia. Thalassemia also tends to present with a low MCV and would not explain the high MCV of 110 fL seen here.",

This technique is primarily used in the management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in preterm neonates. RDS occurs due to insufficient surfactant production in the lungs of premature infants, leading to difficulty in breathing and oxygenation INSURE technique involves: Intubation: The infant is intubated to ensure an open airway and help with respiratory support. Surfactant administration: Surfactant is administered to help reduce surface tension in the lungs, improve lung compliance, and facilitate better gas exchange. Extubation: After surfactant administration and stabilization of the baby, the infant is extubated to non-invasive support, such as CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), for ongoing respiratory support. This method helps avoid prolonged mechanical ventilation and its associated complications, making it a commonly used approach for RDS. Incorrect Options: B) Birth Asphyxia: INSURE is not typically used in the management of birth asphyxia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Neonatal sepsis Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a common bacterial pathogen associated with neonatal sepsis, especially in newborns. It can be transmitted from the mother to the infant during childbirth and is one of the leading causes of severe infections in neonates, including: Neonatal sepsis Pneumonia Meningitis GBS colonizes the genital tract of pregnant women and can lead to infections in newborns, particularly in the first few days of life. Prompt detection and treatment with antibiotics during labor can help reduce the risk of neonatal infection. Incorrect Options : A) Infective endocarditis: While Streptococcus agalactiae can cause a range of infections, it is not a common cause of infective endocarditis. Endocarditis is more commonly associated with other types of streptococci (such as Streptococcus viridans) or staphylococci. C) Acute pharyngitis +/- Tonsillitis: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) (not Group B Streptococcus) is the usual cause of acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis. GBS does not typically cause these upper respiratory tract infections. D) Biofilm with dental caries: Streptococcus mutans (another type of Streptococcus) is more commonly associated with the formation of biofilms on teeth and the development of dental caries. Streptococcus agalactiae is not typically associated with dental caries.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) GH (Growth Hormone) While Growth Hormone (GH) plays a critical role in postnatal growth, it is not essential for in utero growth. In utero growth is primarily regulated by other factors such as insulin, thyroxine, and IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1). Insulin is essential for fetal development and is involved in glucose metabolism and growth regulation. Thyroxine (from the maternal thyroid) plays a crucial role in brain development and overall fetal growth. IGF-1 is also crucial for fetal growth, and it mediates the effects of insulin and growth hormone on fetal tissues. In contrast, growth hormone becomes more important after birth when its effects on postnatal growth are more pronounced. Therefore, GH is not required for fetal growth in utero. Incorrect Options: B) Insulin: Insulin is crucial for fetal growth and metabolism. The fetus relies on maternal insulin to regulate glucose uptake and promote growth, making it essential for in utero development. C) Thyroxine: Thyroxine (from the mother) is essential for brain development and general fetal growth. A deficiency in maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy can lead to developmental delays and stunted fetal growth. D) IGF-1: Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a major role in promoting fetal growth, especially in response to maternal insulin. It is a key regulator of growth in utero and mediates the effects of insulin on fetal tissues.",

On average, the head circumference increases by approximately 2 cm per month during the first 3 months. This is part of the rapid brain development that occurs during this period. Incorrect Options: A) 0.5 cm: This is much too slow for the first 3 months. The brain grows significantly during this period, leading to a much faster increase in head circumference than 0.5 cm per month. B) 1 cm: While the head circumference does increase during the first few months, an increase of only 1 cm per month is generally slower than typical growth during this stage. Typically, the increase is about 2 cm per month, which is more consistent with normal developmental patterns. D) 4 cm: An increase of 4 cm per month would be abnormal and too rapid for head circumference growth in the first three months.

Normal Saline (NS): Provides sodium and chloride to maintain electrolyte balance and ensure hydration without causing significant shifts in osmolality. Incorrect Options: B) 10% DNS: This solution is hypertonic and could potentially lead to hyperglycemia. A higher concentration of dextrose is not needed for maintenance purposes in most children and could cause issues such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances. C) 10% D + N/2: This is not a standard or recommended solution for maintenance fluid. A higher concentration of dextrose (10%) could again cause hyperglycemia. Additionally, the formulation is not a typical balance for maintenance therapy. D) 5% D + N/4: This option would provide an appropriate amount of dextrose (5%), but the N/4 (sodium) is insufficient for most children's requirements.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Urine calcium creatinine ratio >15 Nutritional rickets is primarily caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, leading to impaired calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The typical findings and pathophysiology associated with nutritional rickets include: Normal calcium (A): In early stages of nutritional rickets, calcium levels may remain within normal range due to compensatory mechanisms, such as increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. However, in advanced cases, calcium levels may drop, but it is not a constant feature of early nutritional rickets. Low phosphorus (B): A decrease in phosphorus is commonly observed in rickets due to impaired intestinal absorption of phosphorus. This results from inadequate vitamin D, which is essential for efficient phosphorus absorption in the gut. High PTH (D): Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase in response to low calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, a compensatory mechanism to try to increase calcium reabsorption from the bones and kidneys. Incorrect Options: Urine calcium creatinine ratio >15 (C): This ratio is typically seen in hypercalciuria, which is associated with other conditions like hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia, not nutritional rickets. In nutritional rickets, calcium excretion in urine can be normal or low, and there is no consistent increase in the urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio. Nutritional rickets is more likely to show a low urinary calcium due to the body’s compensatory retention of calcium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency The clinical presentation described in the question suggests a disorder related to adrenal steroidogenesis, which affects the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. Here are the key features: SMR-5: This suggests sexual maturity rating 5, indicating that the child has already reached adult stage of sexual development (likely due to premature puberty). Height age = chronological age: This indicates normal growth in terms of age but may suggest early pubertal development, which is commonly seen in adrenal disorders. Hyperpigmentation: This is a key feature of adrenal insufficiency. It occurs due to increased ACTH secretion, which stimulates melanocytes, causing hyperpigmentation of the skin, particularly in the creases, elbows, and knuckles. Short stature: Often seen in adrenal disorders like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to premature closure of the growth plates secondary to early puberty. Hypertension (BP 150/90 mmHg): This suggests sodium retention and volume overload, both of which can occur due to mineralocorticoid excess (increased aldosterone-like effects). 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In this condition: There is deficiency in the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, leading to the accumulation of 11-deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone (DOC). The DOC has mineralocorticoid effects, causing hypertension due to sodium retention and fluid retention. Additionally, androgen excess leads to premature puberty (SMR-5) and hyperpigmentation due to increased ACTH secretion in an attempt to stimulate the adrenal glands. It can also lead to short stature due to early puberty and subsequent premature closure of growth plates. Incorrect Options: B) 21 alpha hydroxylase deficiency: This is the most common form of CAH. It primarily presents with salt-wasting, virilization (masculinization in females), and hypotension (due to aldosterone deficiency), rather than the hypertension observed here. This condition does not typically cause hyperpigmentation as seen in this case, and it is more commonly associated with hypoglycemia rather than high blood pressure. C) 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency: This enzyme deficiency results in low cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroid production. The deficiency often leads to salt-wasting (not hypertension) and ambiguous genitalia in newborns. It is associated with poor sexual development and lack of pubertal progression, making it inconsistent with the clinical picture of premature sexual maturity (SMR-5) seen here. D) Cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme deficiency: This enzyme deficiency also leads to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, resulting in salt-wasting and hypotension rather than hypertension. Similar to 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, this condition does not cause hypertension, and would present with delayed sexual development, not premature puberty.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chronic malnutrition This child’s anthropometric measurements show signs of chronic malnutrition based on the provided z-scores: Weight-for-age < -3.2 SD: This indicates that the child's weight is significantly below the expected weight for their age. A z-score of less than -3 SD is considered severe underweight and typically indicates malnutrition. Height-for-age < -2.5 SD: A height-for-age z-score less than -2.5 SD indicates stunting, which is a sign of chronic malnutrition. This means that the child has not reached the expected height for their age, likely due to nutritional deficiencies over a long period or poor growth conditions. Weight-for-height < -1.7 SD: This suggests the child has wasting or acute malnutrition (also known as marasmus), but not as severe as the criteria for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A z-score between -1 and -2.5 is considered moderate malnutrition. Diagnosis: Chronic malnutrition The combination of stunting (low height-for-age) and moderate wasting (low weight-for-height), with a significantly low weight-for-age, points towards chronic malnutrition. Chronic malnutrition often reflects long-term nutritional deficiencies, typically seen in children with poor feeding practices, inadequate nutrition over an extended period, or recurrent infections. Incorrect Options: A) Acute malnutrition: Acute malnutrition, also known as wasting, typically refers to a rapid loss of weight due to recent inadequate food intake or illness. In this case, while the child has some degree of wasting (weight-for-height < -1.7 SD), the key indicator of acute malnutrition would be more severe wasting and rapid weight loss, which is not the case here. B) Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): SAM would be diagnosed if the child had severe wasting (weight-for-height < -3 SD), edema, or very low weight-for-age. Here, while the weight-for-age is low, it is not sufficiently severe to qualify as SAM. The weight-for-height z-score of -1.7 indicates moderate wasting, not severe. C) Acute on chronic malnutrition: Acute on chronic malnutrition refers to a situation where a child with long-standing malnutrition experiences a recent exacerbation, such as an acute illness or other event that causes further weight loss or worsening nutritional status. While the child has some features of malnutrition, there is no indication of a recent acute event or illness, making this diagnosis less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Purulent conjunctivitis In Kawasaki disease, the characteristic conjunctivitis is non-purulent (not involving pus). It presents with redness and inflammation in both eyes but without the thick, yellowish pus seen in bacterial conjunctivitis. This feature, along with the other classic signs like fever, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy, helps distinguish Kawasaki disease from bacterial eye infections. Therefore, purulent conjunctivitis is not seen in Kawasaki disease. Incorrect Options: B) Strawberry tongue: Strawberry tongue is a hallmark feature of Kawasaki disease. It refers to the red, swollen appearance of the tongue, which is covered with a white coating and resembles the appearance of a strawberry. This feature is very commonly seen and is one of the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease. C) Polymorphic rash: A polymorphic rash is also commonly observed in Kawasaki disease. It is multiform in appearance, meaning it can present as maculopapular, erythematous, or vesicular lesions, and typically affects the trunk and extremities. It is one of the key features that helps differentiate Kawasaki disease from other febrile illnesses in children. D) Cervical lymphadenopathy: Cervical lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck) is a prominent feature of Kawasaki disease. It is commonly seen in about 50% of cases and is one of the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease. This condition is part of the inflammatory response seen in Kawasaki disease and usually presents with enlarged lymph nodes, often on one side of the neck.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pain abdomen IgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is an autoimmune condition that primarily affects the small blood vessels. It often presents with palpable purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and kidney involvement. Abdominal pain is a common and sometimes severe manifestation of IgA vasculitis, and it is often associated with complications like intestinal intussusception or bleeding. Steroids are indicated in cases of severe abdominal pain, especially if there are signs of complications such as intestinal ischemia or bleeding, as steroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage. Incorrect Options: A) Arthritis: Arthritis is one of the common features of IgA vasculitis, affecting large joints (like knees and ankles). However, arthritis in this condition is usually self-limiting and can often be managed symptomatically with NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for pain relief. Steroids are generally not required for mild arthritis unless it becomes severe or refractory to other treatments. B) GI bleeds: Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur in IgA vasculitis, but it is usually treated based on the severity of the bleeding. In the case of minor bleeding, supportive management and close observation may be sufficient. Steroids are generally not indicated unless there is significant, life-threatening GI bleeding, in which case other treatments like endoscopy or surgical intervention might be necessary. C) Severe rash: The characteristic purpuric rash in IgA vasculitis is typically self-limited and resolves over time. It does not usually require steroid treatment unless it is associated with severe complications, like skin necrosis or ulcerations, which is rare. For most cases, the rash is treated symptomatically, and steroids are not routinely required unless the rash is associated with more severe systemic involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypokalemia with paradoxical aciduria seen in type-4 RTA The correct answer is B, as it is incorrect in the context of type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Let's first understand why: Type 4 RTA is associated with aldosterone deficiency or resistance. This leads to: Hyperkalemia (not hypokalemia) Mild metabolic acidosis Impaired distal acid secretion Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis So, stating that hypokalemia and paradoxical aciduria are seen in type 4 RTA is false, making option B the correct \"EXCEPT\" answer. A) Rickets is seen in Fanconi syndrome, phosphaturia Fanconi syndrome is a proximal tubule disorder where there is impaired reabsorption of various solutes including phosphate, glucose, bicarbonate, and amino acids. Loss of phosphate (phosphaturia) leads to hypophosphatemic rickets in children. C) RTA-2 has abnormal bicarbonate excretion Type 2 RTA is also known as proximal RTA, where the renal tubules fail to reabsorb bicarbonate properly. This leads to excessive bicarbonate loss in the urine and metabolic acidosis. It's associated with Fanconi syndrome and can also lead to rickets in children. D) Type 4 is aldosterone deficiency Type 4 RTA is caused by either hypoaldosteronism or aldosterone resistance. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion and sodium reabsorption. Its deficiency leads to hyperkalemia and reduced acid secretion in the distal nephron, causing mild metabolic acidosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) PVL (Periventricular Leukomalacia) Spastic quadriplegia is a severe form of cerebral palsy that affects all four limbs. It is most commonly associated with Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL), especially in preterm infants. PVL refers to white matter injury near the lateral ventricles, often due to ischemia or inflammation in the perinatal period. The motor fibers (corticospinal tracts) for the legs and arms run close to these regions, and damage here leads to diffuse spasticity, typically affecting all four limbs — hence spastic quadriplegia. Incorrect Options: B) Basal ganglia calcification This is more commonly associated with movement disorders such as chorea or dystonia, not typically spastic quadriplegia. C) Cerebellum degeneration Leads to ataxia, poor coordination, and balance problems, not spasticity. D) Cystic degeneration This is a nonspecific term. While it may be seen in severe brain injury, it is not specifically linked to spastic quadriplegia without further specification (e.g., cystic PVL would be more accurate).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C,D) The correct responses are C (6 months–6 years) and D (Simple is <15 minutes & 1 episode in 24 hrs). Febrile seizures typically occur in children aged 6 months to 6 years and are associated with fever without evidence of intracranial infection. Simple febrile seizures are generalized, last less than 15 minutes, and do not recur within 24 hours—hence, option D accurately describes their clinical criteria. These features help differentiate simple febrile seizures from complex ones, which may require more investigation or treatment. INCORRECT OPTIONS: Option A (54% recurrence in non-febrile seizure) This statement is misleading. Febrile seizures are different from afebrile (non-febrile) seizures. The recurrence rate of febrile seizures themselves is about 30-40% after the first episode, particularly in younger children. However, stating a 54% recurrence rate in non-febrile seizures in the context of febrile seizures is inaccurate and unrelated. Option B (Controlled by anti-seizure medication) Simple febrile seizures are usually self-limiting and do not require long-term antiepileptic treatment. Antiseizure medications are not routinely indicated unless the child has complex febrile seizures or an underlying epileptic disorder. Therefore, while medications can be used if seizures become recurrent or complex, this statement is not true for the general management of typical febrile seizures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Self-inflating bag A) Self-inflating bag, because free flow oxygen cannot be delivered effectively via a self-inflating bag unless a special reservoir attachment and technique are used. In routine use, a self-inflating bag requires positive pressure to open the patient valve, which only happens when the bag is squeezed. Hence, unless it's actively being squeezed, no oxygen reaches the patient, making it unsuitable for free flow oxygen delivery. Incorrect Options: B) Self-inflating reservoir bag While a self-inflating bag alone is ineffective for free flow oxygen, with a reservoir and modifications, it can deliver free flow oxygen better than a standard self-inflating bag. Still, it's not the preferred method due to inconsistency, but it is possible with adaptations. C) Face mask firmly over mouth Free flow oxygen can be delivered via a face mask placed firmly over the mouth; however, it is more ideal to cover both mouth and nose to ensure effective oxygenation in neonates and infants. D) Face mask over mouth & nose This is one of the preferred methods for delivering free flow oxygen, especially in neonates. It ensures that oxygen is properly inhaled through both airways.",

Thirst indicates that the child still has an intact level of consciousness and drive, distinguishing some dehydration from no dehydration or severe dehydration, where a child may be lethargic or unable to drink. Incorrect Options: A) Sunken eyes: In SAM, sunken eyes are always present, even in a well-hydrated child, due to loss of fat — hence not a reliable indicator. C) Lethargy: Lethargy in SAM could be due to severe dehydration, hypoglycemia, or sepsis, and is not used to diagnose some dehydration. D) Delayed skin pinch: In SAM, skin elasticity is reduced, so the skin pinch test may always appear delayed, making it unreliable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A) PPHN (Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn) Inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) is a selective pulmonary vasodilator used primarily in Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs when the newborn fails to transition from fetal to postnatal circulation, maintaining high pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia. iNO acts by relaxing smooth muscles in the pulmonary vasculature, thus lowering pulmonary artery pressure without causing systemic hypotension. This improves oxygenation and reduces the need for more invasive interventions like ECMO. Incorrect Options: B) Acute unstable angina: iNO is not used in the management of acute coronary syndromes. Vasodilators like nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin), beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents are more relevant here. C) Erectile dysfunction: Erectile dysfunction is treated with oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil), which enhance nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, but iNO gas is not used for this indication. D) Sleep apnea: iNO has no role in the treatment of sleep apnea. Treatments typically include CPAP, weight management, or surgery for obstructive causes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 4 years At 4 years of age, children typically reach milestones such as: Telling a story - By this age, children can begin forming simple narratives, though the complexity may vary. Going to the toilet alone - Most 4-year-olds are able to perform self-toileting with minimal assistance. Copying a cross - Drawing basic shapes like crosses is a common fine motor milestone achieved around this age. Thus, these developmental milestones are indicative of a 4-year-old child. Incorrect Options: A) 2 years: At 2 years of age, children are still mastering basic skills such as walking, simple words, and may start showing an interest in potty training, but telling stories and drawing shapes are not typical at this stage. B) 3 years: A 3-year-old can engage in simple pretend play, build towers with blocks, and begin potty training but telling detailed stories and copying a cross are generally not fully developed yet. D) 5 years: While a 5-year-old might show more advanced skills such as copying a triangle and using more complex language, the specific milestones mentioned in the question, like telling simple stories and self-toileting, are also seen at age 4, so 5 years might be slightly too advanced for this combination.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Duodenal atresia Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. While it can present with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, duodenal atresia is not typically associated with CF. Duodenal atresia refers to a congenital blockage or closure of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), which results in vomiting and inability to pass stool in newborns. It is a separate congenital anomaly and is not a common feature of cystic fibrosis. In CF, gastrointestinal issues tend to arise from the thick, sticky mucus that obstructs ducts, including the pancreas, leading to pancreatic insufficiency and other digestive problems. Duodenal atresia is more often seen in isolation or in conditions like Down syndrome. Incorrect Options: A) Meconium ileus Meconium ileus is a classic early sign of cystic fibrosis, seen in neonates. It occurs when thick meconium obstructs the intestines, particularly the ileum, which is a hallmark of CF. This is a common presentation in newborns with CF. C) Coagulopathy Coagulopathy, particularly vitamin K deficiency, can be seen in cystic fibrosis due to pancreatic insufficiency, which impairs the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding tendencies and clotting issues. D) Diarrhea Diarrhea is a common gastrointestinal symptom in cystic fibrosis due to the pancreatic insufficiency, which leads to malabsorption and the inability to digest food properly. This often results in steatorrhea (fatty stools) and sometimes diarrhea.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Most need phototherapy/phototherapy is required Breast milk jaundice is typically a benign condition that occurs due to the presence of substances in the breast milk that inhibit the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin efficiently. In most cases, phototherapy is not required, as the condition usually resolves on its own over time without the need for intervention. Most infants with breast milk jaundice do not require phototherapy unless their bilirubin levels become dangerously high. Incorrect Options: (A) Increase in unconjugated bilirubin – Correct statement. In breast milk jaundice, there is an increase in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin in the infant's bloodstream. This is due to the substances in breast milk that inhibit the processing of bilirubin in the liver. This leads to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, which causes jaundice. (C) Bilirubin > 10 mg/dL in 3-4 weeks – Correct statement. Breast milk jaundice typically manifests after the first few days of life and can persist for several weeks. It is characterized by bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dL in the first 3-4 weeks of life, although the levels generally peak during the second week of life and then gradually decrease. (D) Breastfeeding should be stopped – Incorrect statement. In breast milk jaundice, it is not recommended to stop breastfeeding. In fact, continued breastfeeding is encouraged because breast milk jaundice is a self-limiting condition. The benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the potential risks, and cessation of breastfeeding is generally unnecessary.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The Kasai portoenterostomy is the primary surgical treatment for biliary atresia. However, the statement \"Kasai surgery to be done before 3 months\" is not entirely accurate. While earlier surgery improves outcomes, the recommended age for Kasai procedure is ideally before 60 days (i.e., 2 months) of life to maximize success in restoring bile flow and preventing progressive liver damage. Surgery after 90 days (3 months) is associated with significantly worse prognosis, and many children eventually require liver transplantation. Thus, the statement is incorrect because the optimal time for Kasai is before 2 months, not just any time before 3 months. Incorrect Option: B) Most common cause of cholestasis Biliary atresia is the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis, especially in term infants. It accounts for a significant proportion of cases with persistent jaundice beyond 2 weeks of age. C) HIDA scan used for diagnosis A HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is commonly used in the work-up of biliary atresia. It assesses bile flow from the liver into the intestines. A lack of excretion into the bowel suggests biliary obstruction and supports the diagnosis. D) Liver biopsy helps to differentiate from other causes Liver biopsy plays a crucial role in differentiating biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis like neonatal hepatitis. In biliary atresia, the biopsy typically shows bile duct proliferation, bile plugs, and portal fibrosis.",

SAM is defined using acute indicators of nutritional status that reflect recent weight loss or wasting, not chronic indicators like height-for-age or weight-for-age, which are more reflective of stunting or underweight, respectively. Therefore, this parameter does not directly correlate with SAM. Option (A) Edema (Correlates with SAM) Edema, especially bilateral pitting edema, is a hallmark of kwashiorkor, one of the clinical forms of SAM.

Edema in SAM is a sign of kwashiorkor, and in effective treatment, nutritional edema should begin to resolve within a few days of starting therapy. If edema persists on day 10, it is considered a primary treatment failure, suggesting the therapeutic approach is not effective or there may be an underlying complication (e.g., infection, poor adherence, incorrect feeding strategy). Incorrect Options: (B) Not started to lose edema on day 4 While the reduction in edema may begin by day 4, not losing edema by day 4 is not yet considered treatment failure.

While lack of appetite by day 10 is concerning and suggests complications or ongoing infection, persistent edema is a more definitive marker for treatment failure in the context of edema resolution. (D) Less than 5 mg/kg/day weight gain on day 10 This is actually a marker of secondary treatment failure during the rehabilitation phase. Primary treatment failure focuses more on early clinical signs such as non-resolving edema or continued complications.",

It is a highly contagious viral infection that primarily affects the small intestine, causing watery diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. The severity of dehydration can be significant, often requiring hospitalization and rehydration therapy. The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine has significantly reduced its incidence in many countries, but it remains the leading cause in areas with low vaccine coverage. Incorrect Options: (B) E. coli While Escherichia coli (particularly ETEC – enterotoxigenic E. coli) can cause diarrhea, especially traveler’s diarrhea, it is less common than rotavirus in young children in terms of prevalence and impact globally. (C) Shigella Shigella causes bloody diarrhea (dysentery) and is more common in older children. It is not the leading cause in children under 2 years of age and is typically associated with febrile illness and tenesmus.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chest compression at least 1/3rd of anteroposterior diameter During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children, it is recommended that chest compressions should be at least one-third the depth of the chest’s anteroposterior (AP) diameter, which translates to approximately 4 cm in infants and 5 cm in children. This guideline ensures adequate cardiac output during compressions and is a standard part of pediatric Basic Life Support (BLS) protocols per the American Heart Association (AHA). Incorrect Options: (B) Adenosine is preferred via intraosseous route While intraosseous (IO) access is acceptable when intravenous (IV) access is not available, adenosine is a short-acting drug that is ideally administered via rapid IV push followed by a saline flush. IO is not preferred due to potential delay and less predictable pharmacodynamics. (C) Dose of adrenaline is 0.01 ml/kg in IV/IO route in 1:1000 dilution The correct dose of adrenaline (epinephrine) during pediatric cardiac arrest is 0.01 mg/kg of 1:10,000 solution, not 1:1000, when given IV or IO. A 1:1000 dilution is used for intramuscular administration in anaphylaxis, not CPR. (D) 2 rescuers ratio 30:2 In children and infants, the correct chest compression to ventilation ratio is: 30:2 when only one rescuer is present. 15:2 when two rescuers are present.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Duodenal atresia Duodenal atresia is not typically seen in cystic fibrosis (CF). While CF can cause various gastrointestinal issues due to thick, sticky mucus obstructing ducts in the pancreas and other organs, duodenal atresia is more commonly associated with Down syndrome. In CF, meconium ileus (blockage of the intestine in newborns), diarrhea, and coagulopathy due to vitamin K malabsorption are more commonly observed. Incorrect Options: (A) Meconium ileus Meconium ileus is very common in newborns with CF, occurring due to the thickened meconium obstructing the intestines. It is often one of the first signs of CF seen in the neonatal period. (B) Diarrhea Diarrhea can occur in cystic fibrosis due to the inability of the pancreas to secrete enough digestive enzymes (pancreatic insufficiency), leading to poor nutrient absorption and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea. (C) Coagulopathy Coagulopathy can be a complication in CF, often due to vitamin K deficiency resulting from malabsorption issues, which leads to bleeding disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Height for age In the context of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), the diagnosis is based on several key criteria related to weight and muscle or fat tissue loss, but height-for-age is not typically used to diagnose SAM. The key measurements for SAM include: Weight for height: This is the primary indicator used to diagnose severe wasting, a hallmark of SAM. If a child has a weight for height less than -3 standard deviations (SD), they are considered to have SAM. Edema: The presence of bilateral edema (swelling of the feet, legs, or face) is a sign of severe malnutrition and is one of the defining features of SAM. MUAC (Mid-Upper Arm Circumference) < 11.5 cm: This is another indicator of severe malnutrition, used when assessing wasting and muscle depletion. Height for age, on the other hand, is a measure of stunting and is typically used to assess chronic malnutrition, not acute malnutrition. While stunting can be an indicator of long-term nutritional deficiency, it is not a diagnostic feature of SAM. Incorrect Options: (B) Weight for height This is a key measurement for diagnosing SAM. A weight for height less than -3 SD indicates severe wasting, a critical feature of SAM. (C) Edema Edema (swelling, often in the feet or face) is a classic sign of severe acute malnutrition and indicates severe nutritional deficiency.

If the child does not respond to treatment as expected, it is considered failure to respond. Let's go through each of the options to understand why (C) and (E) are the correct choices for failure to respond: Failure to gain weight 5g/kg/d by day 20 (Option C) This is incorrect as a parameter for failure to respond. The expected weight gain in the first few days to weeks of treatment is around 5g/kg/day. A failure to gain this amount is indicative of treatment failure, and it's a correct parameter. Therefore, this should not be considered an incorrect response parameter. Appetite not increased by day 4 (Option E) If the child has not regained appetite by day 4, this is an incorrect parameter for failure to respond. One of the early signs of successful treatment is an increase in appetite. If appetite is not restored, this may indicate a problem with the treatment or underlying issues. However, appetite restoration is expected within the first few days. Incorrect Options: (A) Failure to lose edema by day 4 This is correct as a parameter for failure to respond. If edema (swelling due to fluid retention) does not begin to reduce by day 4, it indicates that the child may not be responding well to the nutritional treatment. (D) Weight/height reach -2SD This is incorrect as a failure-to-respond parameter because weight-for-height reaching -2SD would generally indicate a significant improvement in the child’s malnutrition status, not failure to respond.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) a, b, d a) Failure to lose edema by day 14: One of the key signs of recovery in SAM is the reduction of edema. Edema should typically begin to resolve by day 14 if the treatment is effective. If the edema persists beyond this time, it indicates that recovery is not progressing as expected. Therefore, failure to lose edema by day 14 is a parameter that suggests failure to recover rather than recovery. b) Failure to gain weight 5g/kg/d: Weight gain is an important indicator of recovery in SAM. A typical target is a weight gain of 5g/kg/day during the early stages of treatment. Failure to achieve this weight gain suggests that the child is not responding to nutritional rehabilitation, so it is not a sign of recovery. d) Edema on day 10: Edema should begin to resolve within the first few days of treatment, typically by day 10. If edema is still present at this point, it suggests that recovery is not progressing as expected and indicates a delay in the nutritional rehabilitation process. Incorrect Options: b) Failure to gain weight 5g/kg/d: As mentioned earlier, this is an indicator of failure to recover, not a parameter for recovery. c) Weight/height reaching -2SD: This is a positive indicator of recovery. The child’s weight and height should improve and move closer to the normal range as treatment progresses. Reaching -2 standard deviations (SD) in weight-for-age or height-for-age measurements is actually a good sign that recovery is occurring, and it is not an incorrect parameter for recovery. e) Appetite being increased: A return of appetite is another key sign of recovery in SAM. If the child’s appetite improves, it suggests that they are beginning to tolerate food and are on the path to recovery. Therefore, increased appetite is a positive indicator of recovery. Thus, options a, b, and d are the correct answer as they are indicators of failure to recover, while the other options, c and e, are parameters of recovery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) HIDA used for diagnosis in all This statement is incorrect and is the correct answer to the question. While HIDA (Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid) scan is commonly used in the diagnostic workup of extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), it is not always conclusive or appropriate in all cases. The scan evaluates bile excretion and can suggest biliary obstruction if the tracer is not excreted into the intestine. However, its accuracy depends on adequate hepatic function, and false negatives can occur, particularly in infants with severe liver dysfunction. Therefore, HIDA scan is not universally definitive for diagnosis, and liver biopsy remains a more specific and sensitive tool, especially in differentiating EHBA from other causes of neonatal cholestasis. Incorrect Options: A) Kasai's surgery should be done before 3 months. The Kasai portoenterostomy is the primary surgical treatment for EHBA, and timing is critical. It is most successful when performed before 60–90 days (3 months) of life, as earlier intervention leads to better bile drainage and improves the long-term prognosis. B) Most common cause of neonatal cholestasis. EHBA is the most common surgical cause of neonatal cholestasis, especially in term infants. It should be considered in all infants with persistent jaundice beyond two weeks, particularly if associated with pale stools and dark urine. D) Liver biopsy can help in differentiating from others. Liver biopsy is a crucial diagnostic tool for differentiating EHBA from other intrahepatic causes of cholestasis. Histological features suggestive of EHBA include bile duct proliferation, bile plugs in ducts, portal fibrosis, and giant cell transformation of hepatocytes.",

The 30:2 ratio applies when a single rescuer is performing CPR on children. b) Dose of adenosine/ adrenaline 0.01 ml/kg in IV or 10 in 1:1000 Incorrect. The correct dose of adrenaline in pediatric resuscitation is 0.01 mg/kg (not ml/kg) using a 1:10,000 concentration for IV/IO administration.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 4 years At 4 years of age, children typically achieve several important developmental milestones. These include: Copying a cross: This is a standard fine motor skill that indicates improved hand-eye coordination and the ability to follow structured patterns. By 4 years, most children can copy a cross, which is a part of the developmental screening tests like Denver Developmental Screening Test. Telling a story: At this stage, children can form complex sentences and narratives. They are capable of recounting past events and using imagination, indicating advanced language and cognitive development. Going to the toilet alone: Most 4-year-olds have achieved toilet training and are able to manage their toileting needs independently, which is a key self-care milestone. Incorrect Options: A) 2 years: At this age, children can typically speak a few words, use two-word phrases, and start toilet training, but they cannot copy complex shapes like a cross, narrate full stories, or consistently use the toilet without assistance. B) 3 years: While 3-year-olds show significant development in language and motor skills (e.g., copying a circle, speaking in simple sentences), copying a cross and telling stories independently is still emerging, and toilet independence may not be complete. D) 5 years: By 5 years, these skills are well established, but they are usually acquired earlier, around 4 years of age.

Incorrect Options : (B) Salmonella: Can cause diarrhea, including invasive disease and enteric fever, but rarely causes HUS. It is not commonly associated with the triad of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hematuria. (C) Shigella: Especially Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can produce Shiga toxin and can cause HUS, but it is a less common cause than E. coli O157:H7. Hence, not the best answer.

Increased troponin T is a biochemical marker of myocardial injury, typically used in acute coronary syndromes and myocarditis, but it is not a part of Nada’s clinical criteria for congenital heart disease. Thus, it is not included in the diagnostic framework defined by Nada's criteria. Incorrect Options: (A) Abnormal X-ray: Chest X-ray abnormalities (like cardiomegaly or increased pulmonary vascular markings) are included in Nada’s criteria because they can be early indicators of structural heart disease. (B) Diastolic murmur: Diastolic murmurs are always pathological and are part of Nada’s criteria. Their presence strongly suggests the need for echocardiographic evaluation for congenital heart disease.

      "solution": "Correct Answer(D) Methionine Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). This enzyme complex is responsible for the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs): Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine. Because these amino acids cannot be properly broken down in MSUD, they and their corresponding ketoacids accumulate in the blood and urine, leading to neurotoxicity and the characteristic sweet-smelling urine. Therefore, dietary restriction of Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine is essential in managing MSUD to prevent their toxic accumulation. Incorrect Options: (A) Valine –Valine is a branched-chain amino acid and must be restricted in MSUD. It contributes to the metabolic buildup and symptoms when not properly metabolized. (B) Leucine – Leucine is the most neurotoxic of the BCAAs in MSUD and is typically the primary focus of dietary restriction.

      "solution": "Correct Answer(D) Knee height In critically ill or bedridden children where standing height or recumbent length cannot be accurately measured, knee height is a reliable surrogate to estimate stature. This method involves measuring the distance from the heel to the anterior surface of the thigh (usually from the heel to the top of the tibia or femoral condyle) using calipers. It is particularly useful in children who are unconscious, immobilized, or in intensive care settings. The measurement can then be used in standard equations to estimate height and track growth or nutritional status. Incorrect Options: (A) CRL (Crown-Rump Length) This is primarily used to assess fetal growth in early pregnancy, not in postnatal or critically ill children. (B) Head circumference Head circumference is important in assessing brain growth and development, especially in infants, but it does not reflect overall height or body length. (C) Arm span While arm span can correlate with height, it is less reliable in children and may be affected by musculoskeletal abnormalities. It's also difficult to measure accurately in a sick child lying in bed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer(D) Fever with petechiae Parvovirus B19 does not typically cause fever with petechiae, which is more characteristic of infections like dengue fever, meningococcemia, or enteroviral infections. Parvovirus B19 primarily affects red blood cell precursors and has a predilection for causing hematologic and fetal complications. Fever with petechiae is not a hallmark of Parvovirus B19. While it may cause mild fever, petechiae are not a typical feature of its clinical spectrum. Petechial rash usually signifies capillary fragility or platelet dysfunction, which is not a primary effect of Parvovirus B19 infection. Incorrect Options: (A) Transient aplastic crisis in immunocompromised patients. Parvovirus B19 can cause transient aplastic crisis, especially in patients with underlying hemolytic anemias like sickle cell disease, and in immunocompromised patients where the virus is not effectively cleared. (B) PRCA (Pure Red Cell Aplasia) Chronic Parvovirus B19 infection can lead to pure red cell aplasia, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals, due to its direct infection of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. (C) Hydrops fetalis , Parvovirus B19 can infect the fetus via transplacental transmission, causing severe anemia, which may lead to hydrops fetalis and fetal demise if not managed appropriately.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The correct diagnosis for this 6-week-old child's symptoms is Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The key differentiating factor is the description of \"non-projectile but forceful vomiting.\" While infantile GERD often manifests as effortless spitting up, more significant reflux can present with forceful, non-projectile emesis. The vomiting is non-bilious, which is consistent with reflux as it originates from the stomach. The child's normal abdominal examination and normal bowel movements further support GERD, as these findings rule out more severe issues like significant intestinal obstruction. GERD is a very common condition in infants due to the immaturity of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the symptoms often peak around 4-6 months of age, fitting the timeline. Incorrect Options: d) Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (CHPS): This diagnosis is unlikely because the vomiting is explicitly stated as \"non-projectile.\" The hallmark symptom of CHPS is projectile vomiting, where the stomach contents are expelled with significant force, often across the room. While CHPS typically presents at this age (3-6 weeks), and features non-bilious, forceful vomiting, the absence of projectile nature makes it an improbable primary diagnosis in this specific scenario. a) Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA): While CMPA can cause vomiting, it typically presents with other systemic symptoms beyond just vomiting. These often include irritability, skin rashes (e.g., eczema), respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheezing), and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea (which can be bloody or mucoid), constipation, or poor weight gain. The isolated finding of \"non-projectile but forceful vomiting\" without any of these additional signs makes CMPA less likely to be the primary diagnosis here. b) Intestinal obstruction: A non-bilious intestinal obstruction would indicate an issue high in the gastrointestinal tract, such as a gastric outlet obstruction or a duodenal obstruction proximal to the bile duct entry. However, a significant intestinal obstruction would typically lead to additional findings on examination, such as abdominal distension, abnormal bowel sounds, and most importantly, changes in bowel movements (e.g., obstipation or lack of stool passage if complete, or abnormal stools if partial). The \"normal abdomen examination and normal bowel movement\" in this case make a significant intestinal obstruction highly unlikely.",
