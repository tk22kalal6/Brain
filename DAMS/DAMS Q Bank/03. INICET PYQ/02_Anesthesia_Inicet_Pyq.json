      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Option A,B,D-High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) delivers very high flows of O2 [2 to 40 L/min]This is the newest technique of O2 delivery (in adults) using heated [37°C] and humidified gas. Using oxygen that is heated to body temperature and supersaturated with water (to a relative humidity of 99%), O2 flow rates up to 40–60 L/min can be delivered through wide nasal prongs without discomfort and mucosal injury. Physiological dead space washout of waste gases including carbon dioxide (CO2) i.e,It causes displacement of excess CO2 with excess O2.It Decrease work of breathing by decreasing airway resistance through the application of a positive pressure.It provides a Positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEP). Option C-It can decrease the need of intubation,which is a disadvantage,as we'll end up intubating the patient in a very late stage resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/2_1(157).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The Gate Control Theory of Pain is a mechanism, in the spinal cord in which pain signals can be sent up to the brain to be processed to accentuate the possible perceived pain, or attenuate it at the spinal cord itself. The 'gate' is the mechanism where pain signals can be let through or restricted. One of two things can happen, the gate can be 'open' or the gate can be 'closed': If the gate is open, pain signals can pass through and will be sent to the brain to perceive the pain. If the gate is closed, pain signals will be restricted from travelling up to the brain, and the sensation of pain won't be perceived. If someone experiences a painful (noxious) stimulus, the application of a non-noxious (soothing or light rubbing or Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) stimulus can help activate the gate control mechanism, and reduce the pain.",

Shout at them and shake them gently to assess if they are conscious. If they don’t respond, move to the next step. b) Call for help • Immediately call emergency services (or ask someone to do so). This step should be done right after checking for responsiveness to ensure help is on the way. a) Check pulse & respiration • Check for signs of life (pulse and breathing). This should be done as quickly as possible after calling for help. If there is no pulse and no breathing (or abnormal breathing like gasping), proceed to the next step. d) Start chest compressions • Start chest compressions immediately: 30 compressions at a depth of 2 inches (5 cm) at a rate of 100-120 per minute. Compressions are the priority to circulate oxygenated blood to vital organs. e) Start bag and mask (or rescue breaths) • After 30 compressions, if you're trained, provide 2 rescue breaths using a bag-mask or mouth-to-mouth. If you’re untrained, continue compressions only until professional help arrives or an AED is available.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Conventional oxygen therapy (COT) is the main supportive treatment administered to patients after planned extubation and has conventionally been delivered using nasal prongs, cannula or masks. However, the maximal oxygen flow rates that these devices can deliver are limited. The maximal oxygen flow rate delivered by COT is only 15 L/min, which is far lower than the demands of post extubation patients with acute respiratory failure. Furthermore, with oxygen delivered by COT, it is difficult to meet the requirements of heating and humidification in these patients. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can supply a mixture of air and oxygen via a heated and humidified circuit at a very high flow. It can provide almost pure oxygen with a FiO2 of approximately 100% and a maximal flow rate up to 60 L/min. The use of a HFNC may generate a positive airway pressure, ameliorate oxygenation and dyspnoea, reduce the respiratory rate and work of breathing, and improve comfort.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/23_1(58).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 2ND GENERATION LMA The AMBU Aura 40 is classified as a second-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Unlike first-generation LMAs, which lack advanced features like gastric access or reinforced tubing, second-generation LMAs such as the Aura 40 incorporate improvements like a preformed curved stem for easier insertion, a softer cuff for better sealing, and enhanced safety features to reduce the risk of airway obstruction. However, it does not have a dedicated gastric drainage channel, which is a hallmark of third-generation LMAs (e.g., LMA ProSeal or LMA Supreme). The AMBU Aura series is designed for single use and is widely utilized in anesthesia for its reliability and ease of placement, making it a standard second-generation LMA option in clinical practice.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In pediatric resuscitation, the depth of chest compressions is crucial for effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Current guidelines, such as those from the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Resuscitation Council (ERC), recommend that chest compressions should be at least one-third the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the chest for both infants and children. This depth ensures adequate compression of the heart to generate blood flow without causing excessive injury. Therefore, option (A) is the correct statement. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect: B. COMPRESSION TO VENTILATION RATIO IS 30:2 WITH 2 RESCUER: This statement is incorrect for pediatric resuscitation with two rescuers. For single-rescuer pediatric CPR, the ratio is indeed 30 compressions to 2 ventilations. However, when two or more rescuers are present for pediatric CPR, the recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio is 15 compressions to 2 ventilations. This higher compression rate aims to minimize interruptions in chest compressions. C. ADENOSINE IS PREFERRED DRUG BY INTRAOSSEOUS ROUTE: While adenosine can be administered via the intraosseous (IO) route, it is typically used for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), not as a general preferred drug for resuscitation in cardiac arrest. The primary drugs for pediatric cardiac arrest are adrenaline (epinephrine), and other medications are given based on the specific rhythm. The choice of route (IV or IO) depends on vascular access availability, but adenosine itself is not the \"preferred drug\" in the broad context of pediatric resuscitation. D. ADRENALINE IS USED AS 0.01 MG/KG IN A 1:1000 DILUTION: This statement is partially incorrect. The recommended dose of adrenaline (epinephrine) for pediatric cardiac arrest is indeed 0.01 mg/kg. However, this dose is given as a 1:10,000 dilution, not 1:1,000. Using a 1:1,000 dilution at 0.01 mg/kg would result in a dose ten times higher than recommended, which can be dangerous. The 1:1,000 dilution is typically used for intramuscular administration in anaphylaxis, not for intravenous/intraosseous administration in cardiac arrest.",
