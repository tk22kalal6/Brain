      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Under the national framework for malaria elimination, intensified malaria control is specifically targeted at states or regions with an Annual Parasite Incidence (API) greater than 1. The API measures the number of malaria cases per 1,000 population. Areas with an API > 1 are considered high-burden areas requiring intensified measures to control and eventually eliminate malaria. Option B. Zero incidence of malaria: While zero incidence is a goal in the final stages of malaria elimination, it is not the definition of intensified malaria control. Zero incidence refers to the absence of malaria transmission, which is a goal in the elimination phase, but intensified control is a preventive measure for areas with higher incidence. Option C. No longer a health problem: This is an aspirational goal for malaria elimination, indicating the complete eradication of malaria as a public health problem. However, it does not refer to the specific measures or strategies involved in intensified malaria control, which is focused on high-incidence areas to reduce malaria transmission. Option D. 3 consecutive years no local transmission in the state: While 3 consecutive years of no local transmission is a key criterion for declaring a region free from malaria, it is a goal post-elimination rather than a definition of intensified malaria control. Intensified control focuses on reducing transmission and controlling malaria in areas where it is still endemic.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/1(1086).png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The statement \"Incubation period: 2 weeks\" is not true for influenza. The typical incubation period for influenza is short, generally ranging from 1 to 4 days, with an average of 2 days. This means symptoms usually appear within a couple of days after exposure to the virus. A 2-week incubation period is far too long and is not consistent with the epidemiological behavior of influenza. Therefore, this option is false and is the correct choice for the \"not true\" statement. A. Virus shedding present before the patient presents with symptoms True. Influenza virus shedding starts 1 day before the onset of symptoms and can continue for about 5–7 days after illness begins. This pre-symptomatic shedding is a major reason why influenza is so contagious and spreads rapidly, especially in communities. B. More mortality in elderly True. The elderly population (particularly those above 65 years of age) has higher morbidity and mortality from influenza. This is due to a weaker immune response and higher likelihood of complications like pneumonia, heart failure, and secondary bacterial infections. D. Aquatic birds are reservoirs True. Wild aquatic birds (especially ducks) are the natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses. These birds often carry the virus in their intestines and can spread it to domestic poultry and other species, including humans, facilitating antigenic shift and pandemic potential.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The ideal management for a child born to an HIV-positive mother on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) involves two key components: infant antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and appropriate infant feeding. Option C correctly identifies that nevirapine (or another suitable ARV) should be given to the infant irrespective of their initial HIV status at birth. This is because HIV exposure has occurred, and prophylaxis is a crucial preventative measure to stop the virus from establishing itself in the infant, before their actual HIV status is confirmed. Furthermore, formula feeding, when safe and feasible, offers the highest certainty of preventing postnatal HIV transmission, as it completely removes the risk associated with breast milk. While recent guidelines support breastfeeding in mothers with sustained viral suppression on ART, formula feeding is still considered a definitive way to eliminate this transmission route. Incorrect Options: Option (A) Exclusively breast fed and nevirapine if HIV+ Explanation: This option is incorrect for two main reasons. Firstly, giving nevirapine (or any ARV prophylaxis) only if the infant is HIV+ is fundamentally flawed. Prophylaxis is given to all HIV-exposed infants as a preventive measure before their HIV status is known, to prevent transmission. Waiting for a positive test would be too late. Secondly, while breastfeeding with maternal viral suppression is now supported by some guidelines, it still carries a residual, albeit low, risk of transmission compared to formula feeding, which has zero transmission risk via this route. Option (B) Formula feed and nevirapine if HIV+ Explanation: This option correctly suggests formula feeding, which eliminates the risk of postnatal transmission. However, it makes the critical error of stating that nevirapine should be given only if the infant is HIV+. As explained for option A, infant ARV prophylaxis must be administered to all HIV-exposed infants regardless of their initial test results, as a primary preventive strategy. Option (D) Formula feed and no need of nevirapine, testing at 0, 6 weeks Explanation: This option is incorrect because it states \"no need of nevirapine.\" Antiretroviral prophylaxis for the infant is a cornerstone of preventing mother-to-child transmission and is universally recommended for all HIV-exposed infants. While formula feeding is a good feeding choice, it does not negate the need for infant prophylaxis. Testing at 0 and 6 weeks (or similar schedules) is part of early infant diagnosis to determine the child's HIV status, but it is complementary to, not a replacement for, ARV prophylaxis.",

Paired t-test: This is used when you have paired data — for example, measurements taken on the same subjects before and after treatment. Since the two stroke groups are independent, this test wouldn't apply here. C. Chi-square: This test is used for comparing categorical data (e.g., frequency of a certain event or condition). It wouldn't be appropriate if you're measuring a continuous parameter (like mean and SD). D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In this scenario, you're comparing the occurrence (frequency) of a disease in two independent groups of children during two different time periods (June–July vs. November–December). The aim is to determine whether seasonal variation (a categorical variable) is associated with disease occurrence (also a categorical outcome, such as presence or absence of disease). You are comparing proportions or frequencies (e.g., number of cases vs. non-cases) between two independent groups. Both variables (season and disease status) are categorical. The Chi square test is designed to assess the association between two categorical variables. Why Other Options Are Incorrect: B. Paired T Test: Used for comparing means of a quantitative variable in the same group before and after intervention — not for categorical data. C. ANOVA: Used to compare means across more than two groups with quantitative data, not frequencies. D. Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test: A non-parametric test for comparing medians of continuous/ordinal data between two independent groups — again, not suitable for comparing counts or proportions.",

OPEX (Operational expenditure) by private c. Staff: female MBBS MO, ANM, LT, Pharmacist, Driver d. Cost: 24 lakh/ unit and North east: 28 lakh/ unit In the case of a Mobile Medical Unit (MMU), CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) is typically private if the MMU is operated under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. Here’s the breakdown: Government: The government usually provides funding for drugs/medical supplies and may help in areas like policy, regulations, and funding operational subsidies. Private: The private sector typically handles CAPEX (for example, the construction or procurement of the mobile units, purchasing medical equipment, and setting up the infrastructure) and OPEX (which covers ongoing operational costs like staffing, maintenance, and day-to-day management).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Scrub typhus. Scrub typhus is a disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and is transmitted by the bite of infected larval trombiculid mites (chiggers), not by ticks. Therefore, the brown dog tick (or any tick, for that matter) is not a vector for Scrub typhus. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Babesiosis: Babesiosis is a parasitic disease caused by Babesia species and is transmitted by ticks, including the brown dog tick in some regions. Rhipicephalus sanguineus has been implicated in the transmission of Babesia canis in dogs and, less commonly, in humans. B. Anaplasmosis: Anaplasmosis is a bacterial disease caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophila) and Anaplasma platys. It is primarily transmitted by ticks, including the Ixodes species (deer tick) and can also be transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus in some cases. D. Ehrlichiosis: Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial disease caused by Ehrlichia species, primarily Ehrlichia canis in dogs and Ehrlichia chaffeensis in humans. The brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) is a well-known and significant vector for Ehrlichia canis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Culture involves the shared behaviors, practices, beliefs, values, customs, and traditions that individuals learn through their interactions with others in society. It is acquired socially, meaning that people learn cultural behaviors through family, peers, media, and other societal influences. Culture is not inherited or instinctive; it is learned from the environment and passed down through generations. • Culture includes all the learned behaviors and social practices that are shared by members of a group. • These behaviors are learned through socialization and are not biologically inherited. • Culture is dynamic, meaning it evolves and changes over time as society progresses and adapts. Why the other options are less accurate: A. Set of beliefs and which are dynamic: While culture does include beliefs and is dynamic, the definition is too narrow because culture involves much more than just beliefs, such as practices, language, customs, etc. C. Set of beliefs not related to health: Culture does encompass beliefs, but it’s not just limited to beliefs, nor is it necessarily disconnected from health. Health-related practices (like traditional medicine) are a significant part of culture in many societies. D. Religious belief and dynamic: Culture may include religious beliefs, but it is much broader than just religion. Culture also includes customs, language, art, and other aspects of life, not just religious elements.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) HRP 2 antigen At the community level, health workers commonly use Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for malaria diagnosis, especially in field conditions where microscopy is not feasible. These tests often detect the HRP2 (Histidine-Rich Protein 2) antigen, which is specific to Plasmodium falciparum, the most dangerous form of malaria. RDTs are quick, do not require laboratory equipment, and are easy to use by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) or ANMs during field visits. Therefore, HRP2-based RDTs are the most practical and widely used tool for malaria diagnosis in the community. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A. Thick smear Although a gold standard for malaria diagnosis, thick smear microscopy requires a microscope, staining, and trained personnel. It's typically performed at PHCs or laboratories, not at the point of care in the community by health workers. B. Thin smear This is primarily used to identify the species of Plasmodium, and like the thick smear, it requires laboratory infrastructure, making it unsuitable for field diagnosis by health workers. C. QBC (Quantitative Buffy Coat) QBC is an automated, high-cost technique requiring specialized equipment like a centrifuge and fluorescent microscope. It is used in well-equipped diagnostic centers, not at the community level.",

Contributing to the development of a community starts with understanding what the community members feel is important to improve their lives. By addressing their felt needs, any intervention or development effort becomes relevant, accepted, and sustainable. This approach ensures community participation and ownership, which are essential for effective development. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B. Contributing resources While helpful, simply contributing resources without understanding what the community actually needs may lead to misplaced or underutilized efforts. Resources should match the community’s expressed priorities (felt needs). C. Planning interventions Planning is a necessary step, but doing so without community input or awareness of their felt needs can result in ineffective or rejected programs. D. Providing resources of intervention This is more about implementation, and while valuable, it comes after understanding what the community actually wants.

      "solution": "Correct Answer(D) Tertiary prevention refers to the measures taken after a disease has already been diagnosed and treated, with the primary goal of reducing further complications, preventing disability, and improving the patient's quality of life. It is focused on managing chronic diseases, minimizing long-term impairments, and helping individuals adapt to their health conditions through rehabilitation and supportive care. This stage of prevention involves medical treatment, physiotherapy, psychological support, and lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing the progression of disease or recurrence. For example, providing physiotherapy after a stroke to restore movement, managing blood sugar in a diabetic patient to prevent kidney or nerve damage, or cardiac rehabilitation after a heart attack are all forms of tertiary prevention. In essence, tertiary prevention tries to soften the impact of an ongoing illness and support patients in leading as normal a life as possible.",
