      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Asthenozoospermia Kartagener syndrome is a subset of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective motility of cilia due to structural abnormalities. In males, this defect affects the flagella of sperm, which are structurally similar to cilia. The flagella become immotile or poorly motile, leading to asthenozoospermia—a condition where sperm movement is significantly impaired. Despite a normal sperm count and production, the sperm are unable to swim effectively, leading to infertility. This impaired motility is a hallmark feature of Kartagener syndrome-related infertility and represents the most direct link between the condition and reproductive dysfunction. Incorrect Options: B) Oligospermia: This refers to a low sperm count, which is not a typical finding in Kartagener syndrome. The sperm count is generally normal; the problem lies in motility, not quantity. C) Blockage of epididymis: Epididymal obstruction is a mechanical cause of infertility, but it is not associated with Kartagener syndrome. In Kartagener, the reproductive ducts are typically anatomically patent; the infertility is due to functional motility defects of sperm. D) Undescended testes: Also known as cryptorchidism, this condition can cause infertility due to impaired spermatogenesis. However, it is not a recognized feature of Kartagener syndrome and is unrelated to the ciliary dysfunction seen in the disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dexamethasone Dexamethasone, a potent corticosteroid, is effective in treating hypercalcemia due to vitamin D toxicity. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and promotes bone resorption, leading to elevated serum calcium levels. In cases of toxicity, this regulation is disrupted, causing persistent hypercalcemia. Dexamethasone works by reducing intestinal calcium absorption and inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption. Additionally, corticosteroids decrease the conversion of inactive vitamin D to its active form (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), thereby reducing the biological activity of excess vitamin D. This makes dexamethasone an appropriate and effective treatment in this scenario. Incorrect Options: A) Chloroquine: While chloroquine has some effects on vitamin D metabolism, it is not a standard treatment for hypercalcemia caused by vitamin D toxicity. Its use is primarily in malaria and certain autoimmune conditions. B) Hydroxychloroquine: Similar to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine may influence vitamin D pathways but is not used for acute management of hypercalcemia. It is mainly used in autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. D) Ketoconazole: Though ketoconazole can inhibit steroidogenesis and affect vitamin D metabolism, it is not typically used in the management of vitamin D toxicity-induced hypercalcemia due to limited efficacy and potential hepatotoxicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mineralocorticoids The patient developed panhypopituitarism following trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy for a pituitary mass. The low levels of ACTH, TSH, FSH, and LH indicate failure of the anterior pituitary to stimulate the adrenal glands, thyroid, and gonads, respectively. In such cases, glucocorticoid (e.g., hydrocortisone) replacement is necessary to compensate for low cortisol due to ACTH deficiency. Similarly, levothyroxine is used to replace thyroid hormone (due to TSH deficiency), and estradiol may be given to postmenopausal women with symptomatic estrogen deficiency due to low FSH/LH. However, mineralocorticoid replacement is not needed, because mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) production is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), not ACTH. Therefore, even in secondary adrenal insufficiency (from pituitary failure), aldosterone secretion is preserved, and mineralocorticoid supplementation is unnecessary. Incorrect Options: A) Glucocorticoids: Required due to secondary adrenal insufficiency from low ACTH. C) Levothyroxine: Required due to central hypothyroidism from TSH deficiency. D) Estradiol: May be needed to address gonadal hormone deficiency due to low FSH/LH, especially in symptomatic postmenopausal women or in younger women.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Autoimmune adrenalitis Addison disease, or primary adrenal insufficiency, is most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, especially in developed countries. In this condition, the immune system targets the adrenal cortex, leading to its gradual destruction and resulting in deficient production of glucocorticoids (like cortisol), mineralocorticoids (like aldosterone), and androgens. It is often part of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (e.g., APS type 1 or 2). The hallmark features of Addison disease include fatigue, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Early diagnosis and hormone replacement therapy are crucial. Incorrect Options: B) Adrenocortical carcinoma: This is a rare malignant tumor of the adrenal cortex. While it can affect adrenal hormone production, it is not a common cause of Addison disease. In fact, it may sometimes cause hormone excess (Cushing’s syndrome or virilization) rather than deficiency. C) Hypernephroma: Also known as renal cell carcinoma, this is a kidney tumor and not related to adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease. D) Medullary carcinoma of thyroid: This is a tumor of parafollicular C cells of the thyroid, often associated with MEN-2 syndromes, and has no causal relationship with Addison disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Fats in diet with not more than 30% calories For diabetic patients, dietary fat management plays a crucial role in controlling blood glucose levels, reducing cardiovascular risk, and improving overall metabolic health. The recommendation that no more than 30% of daily caloric intake should come from fats is consistent with established dietary guidelines, such as those from the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Limiting total fat, especially saturated and trans fats, helps prevent insulin resistance and reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications — which are more common in diabetic individuals. Emphasizing healthy fats (like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) while controlling overall fat intake supports better glycemic control and cardiovascular health. Incorrect Options: A) At least 80 g dietary fibre: While dietary fiber is beneficial for diabetics by slowing glucose absorption and improving insulin sensitivity, 80 g/day exceeds the recommended intake. The advised amount is around 25–30 g/day. Excessive fiber may cause gastrointestinal issues and is impractical for most patients. B) Less than 5000 mg/day salt intake: This amount is still too high. The recommended daily sodium intake for diabetics is less than 2300 mg/day, and even lower (<1500 mg/day) in patients with hypertension or kidney disease. So while salt reduction is important, this option uses an inappropriate threshold. D) Cholesterol <100 mg: This figure is overly strict and unclear in context. The ADA and other guidelines generally recommend dietary cholesterol intake <300 mg/day, or <200 mg/day for individuals with cardiovascular disease risk. A goal of <100 mg/day is not standard and not the primary focus in non-pharmacologic diabetes care.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Canagliflozin Canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is associated with an increased risk of bone fractures.

The FDA has issued warnings regarding this side effect, especially in older adults. Canagliflozin may reduce bone mineral density, particularly at the hip and lumbar spine, making bone fracture a recognized risk of its long-term use. Incorrect Options: B) Rosiglitazone: While rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD), has also been associated with an increased risk of fractures, especially in postmenopausal women, canagliflozin has a more clearly established and direct link, making it the best answer here.

Pit-1 (Pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1) is a crucial transcription factor that regulates the development and function of the anterior pituitary cells responsible for producing growth hormone (GH), prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Dysregulation or overactivity of Pit-1 can be involved in conditions associated with GH excess, such as acromegaly. Incorrect Options: A) SF-1 (Steroidogenic Factor-1): Primarily involved in the regulation of adrenal and gonadal development and steroid hormone production, not GH production. B) DAX-1: A nuclear receptor involved in adrenal and reproductive development. Mutations in DAX-1 are associated with X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita, not acromegaly or GH excess.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Parathyroid adenoma Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands produce excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to chronic hypocalcemia or impaired calcium-phosphate-vitamin D metabolism. This is a compensatory response, not a primary disorder of the parathyroid gland. Vitamin D deficiency reduces calcium absorption from the gut, leading to low serum calcium and compensatory increase in PTH — a classic cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism. GI malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease) leads to poor calcium and vitamin D absorption, also triggering secondary hyperparathyroidism. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common causes. It impairs phosphate excretion and reduces activation of vitamin D, both of which lower serum calcium and stimulate PTH secretion. Incorrect Option: D) Parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism, not secondary. It involves autonomous overproduction of PTH due to a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland, independent of calcium levels. Hence, it is not a cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Urine Na <20 SIADH is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) despite normal or low plasma osmolality. This leads to water retention, resulting in dilutional hyponatremia. However, because the body compensates by increasing natriuresis (sodium excretion) to maintain volume status, patients typically remain clinically euvolemic. A) Serum Na <135 mEq/L: True. Hyponatremia is a hallmark of SIADH due to dilutional effect of excess water retention. B) Euvolemia: True. Despite water retention, sodium excretion and lack of peripheral edema or fluid overload lead to a clinically euvolemic state. D) Urine osm >100 mOsm/kg: True. In SIADH, the urine remains inappropriately concentrated (typically >100 mOsm/kg) despite hypotonic serum, due to persistent ADH action. Incorrect Option: C) Urine Na <20: Not true. In SIADH, urine sodium is typically >40 mEq/L, as the kidneys excrete sodium to try to get rid of excess water and maintain euvolemia. A urine sodium <20 mEq/L would suggest hypovolemia or another cause of hyponatremia like volume depletion or heart failure. .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Responds to co-amoxiclav Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an atypical cause of pneumonia, often affecting younger individuals and presenting with a gradual onset of symptoms like dry cough, low-grade fever, and extrapulmonary manifestations. A) Serology is important: True. Serologic testing (e.g., IgM/IgG antibodies) is commonly used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae due to the difficulty in culturing the organism and delayed onset of symptoms. PCR tests are also useful. B) Culture is not recommended for routine diagnosis: True. Mycoplasma is slow-growing and requires special media, making culture impractical for routine use. D) Lung infiltrates are seen: True. Chest X-ray typically shows patchy or interstitial infiltrates, often more extensive than what is suggested by clinical findings. Sometimes it may mimic viral or other atypical pneumonia patterns. Incorrect Option: C) Responds to co-amoxiclav: False. Mycoplasma pneumoniae lacks a cell wall, making it inherently resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics like co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid), which target bacterial cell wall synthesis. It responds to macrolides (e.g., azithromycin), tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline), or fluoroquinolones, which are effective against cell wall–deficient organisms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CECT chest In a 50-year-old chronic smoker presenting with mild recurrent hemoptysis and a normal chest X-ray, the best next step is to perform a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of the chest. CECT provides detailed images of the lung parenchyma, airways, mediastinum, and vascular structures, allowing detection of subtle lesions such as early lung cancer, bronchiectasis, arteriovenous malformations, or other causes of hemoptysis that might not be visible on a standard chest X-ray. This imaging modality helps guide further investigations or interventions and is highly sensitive in identifying both malignant and non-malignant causes of bleeding. Incorrect Options: B) Fibre optic bronchoscope: Although bronchoscopy is useful for direct visualization of the airways and for obtaining biopsies or lavage samples, it is usually performed after imaging identifies an abnormality or to localize the bleeding site. In the absence of any radiological lesion on chest X-ray, bronchoscopy may be less informative as the initial step. C) Bronchography: This is an outdated and rarely used technique today. It involves contrast injection into the bronchial tree but is invasive and has largely been replaced by CT imaging and bronchoscopy. D) MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging is less sensitive for lung parenchymal abnormalities compared to CT and is not routinely used in the evaluation of hemoptysis. It is also more expensive and less available for chest pathology assessment.",

The anion gap is calculated as: Anion gap=Na+−(Cl−+HCO3−)\\text{Anion gap} = \\text{Na}^+ - (\\text{Cl}^- + \\text{HCO}_3^-)Anion gap=Na+−(Cl−+HCO3−?) In metabolic acidosis, bicarbonate (HCO??) decreases because it buffers the excess acid, and unmeasured anions increase, leading to a higher gap. This is common in conditions like diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or toxin ingestion (e.g., methanol, ethylene glycol). Incorrect Options: A) Metabolic alkalosis: In metabolic alkalosis, bicarbonate levels increase, and the anion gap typically remains normal because there is no accumulation of unmeasured anions. C) Respiratory alkalosis: This involves decreased CO? due to hyperventilation and does not affect the anion gap, which usually remains normal.

The key parameters needed are the arterial pH and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO?). pH of arterial blood (1): This is the gold standard for assessing acid-base status since arterial blood reflects the oxygenated blood delivering to tissues and accurately shows systemic acid-base balance. PCO? of arterial blood (part of option 4): PCO? reflects the respiratory component of acid-base balance. It is crucial to assess if respiratory acidosis or alkalosis is contributing to the disorder. Venous blood values, including pH and PO?, are less reliable for diagnosing acid-base disturbances because venous blood reflects tissue metabolism and can vary significantly. Venous PO? (3) does not provide useful information for acid-base analysis, and venous pH (2) is not a substitute for arterial pH. Incorrect Options: A) 1, 2: Venous pH is not reliable for acid-base diagnosis.

These structures lie within the central airway. The flow-volume curve becomes rounded and plateaus on both inspiratory and expiratory sides, as seen in this image. Causes may include post-intubation stenosis, tracheal tumors, or fixed extrinsic compression. This classic \"box\" appearance confirms the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option A: Fixed distal airway obstruction Obstruction in the distal airways (bronchioles and beyond) typically leads to a pattern seen in obstructive diseases like COPD or asthma, characterized by scooped-out (concave) expiratory limbs and relatively normal inspiratory limbs, not the blunted box-like shape. Option C: Variable intrathoracic obstruction These obstructions (e.g., tumor compressing the trachea within the thorax) show flattening of the expiratory limb while the inspiratory curve remains relatively normal. This occurs because intrathoracic pressure during expiration compresses the airway further. Option D: Variable extrathoracic obstruction This would show flattening of the inspiratory limb, not both. During inspiration, negative pressure outside the thorax causes airway narrowing in cases like vocal cord dysfunction or upper tracheal obstruction.",

It works by dampening the excessive inflammatory response (cytokine storm) that causes lung damage and multi-organ failure in severe COVID-19. Its immunosuppressive effects help reduce tissue injury and improve survival rates. Incorrect Options: A) Remdesivir: This antiviral drug may shorten the duration of illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but has not demonstrated a clear mortality benefit in critically ill or ventilated patients. B) Hydroxychloroquine: Initially investigated for COVID-19 treatment, multiple studies have shown no mortality benefit and potential risks, leading to it being generally abandoned for this purpose. C) Tocilizumab: An IL-6 receptor blocker used to modulate immune response, tocilizumab may benefit some severe cases with hyperinflammation, but evidence for mortality reduction is inconsistent and less robust compared to dexamethasone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 2, 1, 4, 5 A. Asbestosis → 2. Basal area involvement Asbestosis typically affects the lower lobes or basal areas of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis seen in individuals exposed to asbestos over long periods. B. Caplan syndrome first found in → 1. Coal workers pneumoconiosis Caplan syndrome is a condition where rheumatoid arthritis coexists with pneumoconiosis, particularly coal worker's pneumoconiosis. It presents with pulmonary nodules in a background of RA. C. Pleural effusion without mediastinal shift → 4. Mesothelioma Mesothelioma, a malignancy of the pleura often caused by asbestos exposure, may cause pleural effusion without mediastinal shift due to the stiff, fibrotic pleural encasement limiting the shift. D. Byssinosis → 5. Cotton dust Byssinosis, also known as Monday fever, is caused by inhalation of cotton dust and typically affects textile workers. Incorrect Opgtions: Option A (2, 3, 1, 5) Incorrect match of Caplan with silicosis. Caplan syndrome is classically described with coal worker's pneumoconiosis, not silicosis. Option C (2, 5, 3, 4) Asbestosis → Correct (2), but Caplan matched to cotton dust (incorrect), and mesothelioma matched to byssinosis (incorrect). Option D (4, 1, 3, 5) Asbestosis matched with mesothelioma — related but not the best answer here; asbestosis refers to fibrosis, while mesothelioma is malignant. Pleural effusion matched with silicosis — incorrect, not a common feature.",

Early in the pandemic, HCQ was considered a potential treatment based on laboratory studies, but multiple large clinical trials have since demonstrated no benefit and potential harm, including cardiac toxicity. Consequently, HCQ has been withdrawn from most COVID-19 treatment protocols, especially in severe disease. Incorrect Options: A) Dexamethasone: This corticosteroid has a proven mortality benefit in severe COVID-19 by suppressing the hyperinflammatory response and is standard of care for patients requiring oxygen or ventilation. B) Remdesivir: An antiviral drug that may shorten recovery time, it is used in hospitalized patients, including some severe cases, though its mortality benefit is debated.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) The image shows a patient using a High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), a specialized oxygen delivery system used in cases of moderate to severe hypoxemia. HFNC delivers heated, humidified oxygen at high flow rates (up to 60 L/min) through large bore nasal prongs, as seen in the image. It can deliver an accurate FiO? and also provides some degree of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), improving oxygenation and reducing work of breathing. HFNC is often used in conditions like acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, COVID-19 pneumonia, or pre-intubation support. Incorrect Options: A. Simple Face Mask A simple mask covers the nose and mouth and is not seen in the image. It provides oxygen at 5–10 L/min with an FiO? of 40–60%, but does not deliver heated humidified oxygen or high flow rates. C. Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) NIV devices include tight-fitting full face or nasal masks connected to a ventilator to provide bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP). The image lacks the tight face mask or head straps typically seen in NIV. D. Venturi Mask The Venturi mask uses color-coded nozzles and is designed to deliver fixed concentrations of oxygen, often used in COPD. It covers the mouth and nose and does not use nasal prongs or heated humidification, so it doesn't match the device shown.",

This symptom warrants immediate hospital admission for close monitoring and intervention because it suggests a serious progression of disease requiring urgent medical attention. Incorrect Options: A) Multiple comorbidities: While multiple comorbidities increase risk of severe COVID-19 and might influence decisions, by itself it is not an absolute criterion for hospital admission without other clinical signs. B) SpO? <92%: Oxygen saturation below 92% is a well-established criterion for hospitalization in COVID-19; however, the question’s correct answer is marked as D, possibly emphasizing a more urgent clinical symptom. Typically, this option is also important but here is considered less definitive than chest pressure. C) Respiratory rate >25/min: Tachypnea is a concerning sign but is usually considered with other vital signs; alone, it may not mandate hospital admission in every case.",

Residual volume (RV) (b): RV is increased due to air trapping — more air remains in the lungs after forced expiration. Functional residual capacity (FRC) (c): FRC is the volume of air in lungs at end expiration and is increased in COPD because of hyperinflation and air trapping. Total lung capacity (TLC) (d): TLC is generally increased in COPD due to lung hyperinflation. Incorrect Options: Option A (all four increased) is wrong because FEV?/FVC is decreased, not increased.

In this condition, the bronchi become abnormally widened, leading to mucus accumulation, recurrent infections, and destruction of bronchial walls. The patient’s chronic cough and mucopurulent sputum over 2 years supports this diagnosis. The cystic pattern seen on CT is the most severe form of bronchiectasis. Incorrect Options: A. Hydatid cyst Typically appears as a well-defined, single or few cystic lesions, sometimes with daughter cysts or calcifications. The diffuse bilateral bronchial dilation pattern seen here is not consistent with hydatid disease. C. Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis on imaging more commonly shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular infiltrates, not cystic changes. The absence of nodularity or lymphadenopathy makes this unlikely. D. Cystic fibrosis Though cystic fibrosis can cause cystic bronchiectasis, especially in young adults, the diagnosis would typically be suspected earlier in life and associated with other systemic symptoms (e.g., malabsorption, pancreatic insufficiency).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Respiratory bronchiolitis has strong association with smoking Respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) is a form of ILD strongly associated with cigarette smoking. It typically affects young to middle-aged smokers and presents with mild respiratory symptoms and ground-glass opacities on imaging. Histologically, it is characterized by the accumulation of pigmented macrophages in the respiratory bronchioles and adjacent alveoli. Incorrect Options: A) Honeycombing is common pattern in NSIP: This is incorrect. Honeycombing is more characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), not non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). NSIP typically shows uniform interstitial involvement with less fibrosis and little to no honeycombing. C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has poor response to steroids: This statement is true, but since option B is also correct and more directly aligned with a clear-cut association, it may have been selected as the \"best\" or \"most correct\" answer in this context. However, in strict accuracy, both B and C are correct. IPF is known for minimal to no response to corticosteroids, and antifibrotic agents like pirfenidone and nintedanib are preferred. D) None: as at least one (or more) of the above statements are correct.",

In metabolic acidosis, the primary issue is a loss of bicarbonate or gain of acid, leading to decreased HCO??. The body compensates via hyperventilation to \"blow off\" CO? (a respiratory acid), hence the PaCO? is also reduced. This leads to a downward-left shift on the diagram. Incorrect Options: A. Metabolic Alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis would show high HCO?? and elevated pH, with compensatory hypoventilation (increased PaCO?), placing it in the upper right quadrant (like D) — not quadrant A. B. Acute Respiratory Acidosis This would show high PaCO?, low pH, and initially normal or mildly increased HCO?? (before renal compensation kicks in), typically found in quadrant B or C. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hypothermia Central cyanosis results from reduced arterial oxygen saturation or presence of abnormal hemoglobin that impairs oxygen delivery. It typically presents with bluish discoloration of the lips, tongue, and mucous membranes, indicating systemic hypoxemia. A) Methemoglobinemia: This is a cause of central cyanosis. It involves the oxidation of iron in hemoglobin to the ferric state, which cannot bind oxygen, leading to reduced oxygen delivery and cyanosis despite normal PaO?. B) Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula: This leads to right-to-left shunting, bypassing the lungs, and causes arterial hypoxemia, a classic cause of central cyanosis. D) High altitude: At high altitudes, reduced atmospheric oxygen leads to hypoxemia, which can cause central cyanosis, especially in individuals not acclimatized. Incorrect Option: C) Hypothermia: Though peripheral cyanosis is common in hypothermia due to vasoconstriction and slowed circulation, arterial oxygenation remains relatively preserved. Therefore, hypothermia does not cause central cyanosis unless accompanied by respiratory or cardiac failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hypoventilation Hypoventilation leads to hypoxia due to inadequate ventilation, which causes an increase in arterial CO? (PaCO?) and a corresponding decrease in PaO?, but the A–a gradient remains normal. This is because the problem is global and affects both alveolar and arterial gas levels equally, not due to issues with gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The A–a gradient is calculated as: A–a gradient = PAO? – PaO? In pure hypoventilation, both PAO? and PaO? decrease proportionally, so the gradient remains normal. Incorrect Options: A) Shunt A shunt refers to blood bypassing the ventilated alveoli (e.g., in congenital heart disease or pneumonia). This leads to low PaO? despite normal or increased PAO?, resulting in an elevated A–a gradient. B) V/Q mismatch In ventilation-perfusion mismatch (common in COPD, PE), some alveoli are ventilated but not perfused (or vice versa), leading to inefficient gas exchange and an increased A–a gradient. D) Alveolar membrane disease Diseases like interstitial lung disease impair diffusion across the alveolar membrane, causing a low PaO? and increased A–a gradient due to diffusion limitation.",

Ambrisentan is effective in improving exercise capacity and slowing disease progression in this category. It is well tolerated, has once-daily dosing, and is appropriate for early-stage PAH with no response to vasodilator testing. Incorrect Options: A) Iloprost Iloprost is an inhaled prostacyclin analog, typically reserved for more symptomatic patients (NYHA class III/IV) or those not responding to oral agents. It requires frequent inhalation (6–9 times/day), which is less suitable for NYHA class II patients. C) IV Epoprostenol Epoprostenol is a potent IV prostacyclin analog, indicated for severe PAH (NYHA class III/IV) or rapid progression.

It represents the difference between the measured cations and anions in the serum. The standard formula (excluding potassium, which is often omitted due to its small concentration) is: Anion Gap = Na? – (Cl? + HCO??) Substituting the given values: Na? = 137 mmol/L Cl? = 110 mmol/L HCO?? = 15 mmol/L AG = 137 – (110 + 15) = 137 – 125 = 12 mmol/L Thus, the correct anion gap is 12 mmol/L, which falls within the normal range (8–12 mmol/L) and is consistent with a non-anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis if acidosis were suspected. Incorrect Options: A) 22 mmol/L This would indicate a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, but the calculated value does not support it. This choice is incorrect because it overestimates the gap. B) 16 mmol/L This would also suggest a mildly elevated anion gap, possibly from including potassium in the calculation: If using the formula (Na? + K?) – (Cl? + HCO??) → (137 + 4) – (110 + 15) = 141 – 125 = 16 mmol/L.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Assisted control mode ventilation Assist-Control (A/C) ventilation delivers a set tidal volume or pressure in response to patient effort or at a preset rate if the patient is not initiating breaths. In this mode, every breath (spontaneous or mandatory) receives full ventilator support. If a patient is triggering frequent spontaneous breaths (e.g., due to anxiety or pain), the ventilator will deliver full tidal volumes with each breath, often resulting in hyperventilation. This excessive ventilation can lower PaCO?, leading to respiratory alkalosis. Thus, A/C ventilation is commonly associated with respiratory alkalosis, especially in alert or partially awake patients. Incorrect Options: B) Controlled Mandatory Ventilation (CMV) In CMV, the ventilator delivers a fixed number of breaths with a fixed volume or pressure, regardless of patient effort. It's typically used in fully sedated or paralyzed patients, making hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis less likely unless settings are too aggressive. C) Pressure-Controlled Ventilation This controls the pressure delivered during ventilation but does not inherently lead to alkalosis unless the respiratory rate or minute ventilation is set excessively high. It’s not as directly linked to respiratory alkalosis as A/C mode. D) SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) In SIMV, the ventilator provides a set number of synchronized breaths, and the patient can breathe spontaneously in between. Because it allows for more natural breathing patterns, it's less likely to cause hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis compared to A/C mode.",

Let’s go step by step: 1. Calculate Anion Gap: Anion gap (AG) = Na? − (Cl? + HCO??) = 145 − (100 + 25) = 20 mmol/L → Normal AG is 8–12 mmol/L → So this is a high anion gap 2. pH = 7.40 (Normal): Despite the high AG, the pH is normal, which suggests a mixed disorder — one causing acidosis, the other causing alkalosis, balancing the pH. 3. Vomiting = Metabolic Alkalosis: Vomiting leads to loss of H? and Cl?, causing metabolic alkalosis. 4. Renal failure = High AG metabolic acidosis: Due to accumulation of uremic toxins, renal failure often leads to high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Thus, this patient has: High AG metabolic acidosis (due to renal failure) Metabolic alkalosis (due to vomiting) These two offset each other, leading to a normal pH. Hence, this is a classic case of a mixed acid-base disorder: High anion gap metabolic acidosis + metabolic alkalosis → Correct answer: A Incorrect Options: B) Normal ABG: While the pH is normal, the anion gap is elevated, which rules out a truly normal ABG. This is misleading — always check AG and clinical context. C) Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis: The anion gap is elevated (20), not normal. This eliminates this option. D) High anion gap metabolic acidosis with normal metabolic acidosis: “Normal metabolic acidosis” refers to non-anion gap acidosis, which isn’t evident here.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) If all four (a, b, c & d are correct) Renopulmonary syndromes are disorders that affect both the kidneys and the lungs simultaneously, often causing renal failure along with pulmonary symptoms such as hemorrhage or infiltrates. Goodpasture Syndrome (A) This is a classic renopulmonary syndrome characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies causing pulmonary hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Both kidney and lung involvement are hallmark features. Leptospirosis (B) A bacterial zoonosis caused by Leptospira, it can cause acute kidney injury (renal failure) along with pulmonary hemorrhage or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), making it a renopulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus infection (C) Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can cause severe pulmonary edema and hemorrhage along with acute kidney injury, especially in hantavirus nephropathy, fitting the renopulmonary pattern. Wegener's Granulomatosis (D) (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) This is a small vessel vasculitis involving the respiratory tract and kidneys, causing necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and glomerulonephritis, thus also a renopulmonary syndrome. Incorrect Options: Option A (a, b, c) Excludes Wegener’s, which is an important renopulmonary syndrome. Option B (a and c) Excludes Leptospirosis and Wegener’s, both known to involve kidneys and lungs. Option C (b and d) Excludes Goodpasture syndrome, a classic renopulmonary condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hemorrhagic mediastinitis Inhalation anthrax is caused by inhaling spores of Bacillus anthracis. The hallmark pulmonary manifestation is hemorrhagic mediastinitis, which results from rapid bacterial proliferation in the mediastinal lymph nodes. This leads to mediastinal widening on chest X-ray, severe edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis in the mediastinum. It is a distinctive and common feature that differentiates inhalation anthrax from other pulmonary infections. Patients typically present with fever, chest pain, dyspnea, and a rapid progression to shock. The hemorrhagic mediastinitis often causes severe respiratory distress and is life-threatening. Incorrect Options: A) Atypical pneumonia Though some symptoms may mimic pneumonia, inhalation anthrax is not primarily an atypical pneumonia; the characteristic finding is mediastinal involvement rather than diffuse atypical infiltrates. C) Lung abscess Lung abscess formation is not typical in anthrax. The infection primarily affects the mediastinum rather than causing localized lung necrosis. D) Bronchopulmonary pneumonia While secondary bacterial pneumonia can occur, it is not the primary or most common manifestation of inhalation anthrax.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Add 0.5 ml heparin to the syringe is recommended In arterial blood gas sampling, heparin is used to prevent clotting of the blood sample, but it is added in very small amounts as liquid heparin diluted appropriately or as dry heparin-coated syringes. Adding 0.5 ml of liquid heparin is too much and can dilute the blood sample, altering the accuracy of gas measurements, especially pCO? and pO? values. Thus, adding such a large volume of heparin is not recommended. Incorrect Options: A) Normal pH can't rule out acid-base disorder: This is correct. A normal arterial pH may mask a mixed acid-base disorder; therefore, further analysis like anion gap and compensatory changes are needed. B) Choose another site if Allen test is abnormal: The Allen test evaluates collateral blood flow to the hand. If abnormal, radial artery sampling is contraindicated, and an alternate site (e.g., femoral artery) should be chosen. This is correct practice. D) Radial artery is preferred site: Radial artery is the preferred site for ABG sampling due to ease of access, collateral circulation, and lower complication risk. This is correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Flex the wrist, which is wrong in the procedure of arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. In ABG sampling, the wrist should be kept in a neutral or slightly extended position to allow optimal access to the radial artery. Flexing the wrist compresses the artery, making it difficult to puncture, increases patient discomfort, and raises the risk of complications such as arterial spasm or hematoma. Therefore, flexing the wrist is not recommended during the procedure. Option B: Clean the syringe with heparin This is correct. Heparin is used to prevent blood clotting in the sample. The syringe must be either pre-coated with dry heparin or briefly flushed with a small amount of heparin solution before sampling. This step is essential to maintain sample integrity. Option C: Needle to be punctured at 45 degrees This is correct. The needle should be inserted at an angle of about 30 to 45 degrees to the skin to properly access the artery and avoid going too deep or superficial. This angle allows for smooth entry and reduces trauma. Option D: Perform Allen’s test This is correct. Allen’s test assesses the collateral circulation in the hand by checking ulnar artery patency before radial artery puncture. It ensures that the hand will still receive blood if the radial artery is damaged, minimizing ischemic risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Breath sounds present, which helps to differentiate cardiac tamponade from tension pneumothorax. In cardiac tamponade, the primary problem is fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac compressing the heart, which reduces cardiac output. Importantly, the lungs themselves are not directly affected, so breath sounds remain present and usually normal. This distinguishes cardiac tamponade from tension pneumothorax, where lung collapse occurs. In contrast, tension pneumothorax involves air trapped in the pleural space under pressure, leading to lung collapse on the affected side. This causes absent or markedly decreased breath sounds on the side of pneumothorax. Therefore, the presence of normal breath sounds strongly suggests cardiac tamponade rather than tension pneumothorax. Incorrect Options: Option A: Low volume pulse A low volume (weak) pulse occurs in both cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax due to decreased cardiac output. Hence, this sign cannot differentiate between the two. Option C: Distended veins Distended neck veins or raised jugular venous pressure occur in both conditions because both impair venous return. Therefore, this is not helpful to distinguish between them. Option D: Low effect to bolus Both conditions often show poor or minimal improvement with fluid boluses since the underlying issue is mechanical compression (heart in tamponade, lung and mediastinum in tension pneumothorax), so this is also not specific.",

Option C: 7 drugs x 2 months then 6 drugs for 1 month then 5 drugs x 5 months This staged reduction in drugs over 8 months total is not standard for MDR-TB. The duration and drug numbers are inadequate for resistant tuberculosis.

To identify the cause, we need to check for the most common viral etiologies, which are: HAV (Acute Hepatitis A) → detected by Anti-HAV (IgM) HBV (Acute Hepatitis B) → detected by HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc HCV (Hepatitis C) → detected by Anti-HCV Hence, option B includes all essential serologies needed to rule out common causes of acute viral hepatitis. Incorrect Options: A. HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, Anti-HCV, Anti-HEV Misses HAV, which is a common cause of acute hepatitis, especially in developing countries. Anti-HEV is not routinely tested unless epidemiologically suspected (e.g., pregnancy, outbreaks). C. HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, Anti-HDV, Anti-HCV, Anti-HEV Includes HDV, which only occurs in coinfection or superinfection with HBV, not needed unless HBV is confirmed. Misses Anti-HAV, again a key acute cause. D. Anti-HAV, IgM anti-HBc, Anti-HCV, Anti-HEV Misses HBsAg, essential for diagnosing HBV infection (a core marker alone isn't sufficient without surface antigen status).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Right atrial contraction. The 'a' wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP) corresponds to the atrial contraction phase, when the right atrium contracts to push blood into the right ventricle. This causes a transient increase in pressure within the right atrium and jugular veins, producing the characteristic 'a' wave on the JVP waveform. Incorrect Options: Option B: Closure of tricuspid valve The closure of the tricuspid valve does not produce the 'a' wave. Instead, valve closure corresponds to the start of ventricular systole and influences other components of the venous pulse. Option C: Onset of ventricular systole The onset of ventricular systole relates to the 'c' wave in the JVP, which is caused by bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during ventricular contraction, not the 'a' wave. Option D: Maximal atrial filling Maximal atrial filling corresponds more to the 'v' wave, which reflects atrial filling against a closed tricuspid valve, not the 'a' wave.",

Classic for AF, which lacks a regular atrial rhythm to guide the ventricles. Absence of P Waves: Instead of distinct P waves, the baseline shows chaotic fibrillatory waves—best seen in leads V1 and II. This results from multiple ectopic atrial foci firing simultaneously. Narrow QRS Complexes: Suggests the rhythm is supraventricular in origin. These findings confirm atrial fibrillation, which is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Incorrect Options: B. PSVT (Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia) PSVT shows a regular, rapid rhythm with a narrow QRS complex. Not irregularly irregular like AF. C. Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) MAT shows at least 3 different P wave morphologies and an irregular rhythm. P waves are present but vary in shape—not the case here. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Respiratory acidosis with renal compensation The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows: pH = 7.12 (acidic; normal range 7.35–7.45) HCO?? = 28 mEq/L (slightly elevated; normal 22–26 mEq/L) pCO? = 50 mmHg (elevated; normal 35–45 mmHg) The primary disturbance here is respiratory acidosis, indicated by a low pH and elevated pCO?. The high pCO? means CO? is retained, causing acidosis. The kidneys compensate by increasing bicarbonate (HCO??) reabsorption, which is reflected by the elevated HCO?? level (28). Although this compensation helps to buffer the acidosis, the pH remains acidic, showing incomplete compensation. Thus, the disorder is respiratory acidosis with renal (metabolic) compensation. Incorrect Options: A — Metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation This option is incorrect because metabolic acidosis typically presents with low bicarbonate (HCO??) and low pH. Here, HCO?? is elevated, not decreased. Additionally, respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis would cause a decrease in pCO? (hyperventilation), not an increase. In this patient, pCO? is elevated, ruling out metabolic acidosis. B — Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by elevated HCO?? and elevated pH (>7.45). The pH here is low (7.12), which contradicts metabolic alkalosis. Respiratory compensation in metabolic alkalosis involves hypoventilation to raise pCO?, but pH would still be alkaline or near normal. Since the pH is acidic, this is incorrect. D — Respiratory alkalosis with renal compensation Respiratory alkalosis involves a decreased pCO? and elevated pH. Here, the pCO? is high, and pH is low, which is opposite to respiratory alkalosis. Renal compensation for respiratory alkalosis would decrease HCO??, not increase it. Therefore, this option does not fit the data.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rare complication of Rapid and aggressive sodium correction The clinical scenario describes a patient with prolonged vomiting and fluid loss leading to hyponatremia. When hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, especially in a chronic setting, it can cause a dangerous neurological condition called Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS), also known as Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM). This syndrome typically presents with quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs), mutism or dysarthria, and altered sensorium after rapid correction of sodium. The hallmark is demyelination in the central pons and other brain regions due to osmotic shifts. Thus, the development of quadriplegia and mutism after rapid sodium correction strongly points to this rare but serious complication. Incorrect Options: B — Common complication of Hypernatremia While hypernatremia can cause neurological symptoms such as lethargy or seizures, it is not commonly associated with sudden quadriplegia and mutism as described here. Additionally, the scenario focuses on rapid correction of hyponatremia, not hypernatremia, making this option incorrect. C — Brain stem infarcts Brainstem infarcts can cause quadriplegia and mutism, but these usually present suddenly with other signs such as cranial nerve deficits, and the clinical context would differ. The temporal relationship to rapid sodium correction and hyponatremia makes infarcts less likely here. D — None of the above This option is incorrect since option A clearly explains the clinical findings and the temporal sequence in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome,” is a condition where intense emotional or physical stress (like an argument or sudden shock) triggers a sudden weakening of the heart muscle, especially the left ventricle. This leads to chest pain and symptoms that mimic a heart attack. Although many patients recover, it can occasionally cause severe complications, including sudden cardiac arrest and death, especially if untreated. The sudden collapse following emotional upset in this middle-aged man fits the classical presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Incorrect Options: B — Dilated cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy is a chronic disease where the heart chambers enlarge and weaken over time, leading to progressive heart failure. It typically develops gradually, not suddenly after emotional stress, and is unlikely to cause abrupt collapse in a previously healthy individual. C — Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) ARVD is a genetic disorder characterized by the replacement of right ventricular muscle with fat and fibrous tissue, predisposing to arrhythmias and sudden death. It usually affects younger individuals and presents with palpitations or syncope rather than chest pain triggered by emotional stress. D — Chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy This condition develops over years due to repeated or chronic poor blood supply to the heart muscle, causing heart failure symptoms. It does not present suddenly after an emotional event and is unlikely to cause immediate collapse without prior symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ileal disease The Schilling test is used to evaluate vitamin B12 absorption. A positive Schilling test indicates impaired absorption of vitamin B12, often due to issues involving the terminal ileum, where B12 is absorbed. In this patient: Steatorrhea indicates fat malabsorption. Positive Schilling test points to B12 malabsorption. Normal D-xylose test suggests that proximal small intestinal absorption (duodenum and jejunum) is intact. Normal duodenal biopsy further supports that the proximal small intestine is not involved. Together, these findings strongly indicate a disease of the terminal ileum — the site of B12 and bile salt absorption. Ileal disease (such as Crohn’s disease limited to the ileum, or ileal resection) would explain both fat malabsorption (due to bile salt deficiency) and B12 deficiency. Incorrect Options: B — Coeliac disease Celiac disease affects the proximal small intestine, particularly the duodenum and jejunum. It causes steatorrhea and a positive D-xylose test due to mucosal damage. A normal duodenal biopsy and normal D-xylose test rule out this condition. C — Ulcerative colitis (UC) UC primarily affects the colon and does not cause malabsorption syndromes like steatorrhea or B12 deficiency. It also does not affect the terminal ileum significantly in most cases, making it an unlikely cause. D — Intestinal lymphangiectasia This is a disorder of lymphatic drainage in the intestine, which leads to protein-losing enteropathy, and can cause steatorrhea. However, it usually affects the proximal small intestine, and would likely show abnormal D-xylose test results and abnormal biopsy findings, which are not seen in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) aVF The mean electrical axis of the heart refers to the average direction of ventricular depolarization in the frontal plane. A mean QRS axis of +90° lies directly downward in the vertical axis of the standard limb leads — this corresponds exactly with lead aVF (augmented Voltage Foot), which records electrical activity directed straight down toward the feet. When the electrical axis is aligned with the orientation of a lead, that lead will show the maximum positive deflection, particularly the tallest R wave, because the depolarization vector is moving directly in line with the lead's sensing direction. Since lead aVF is oriented at +90°, it will record the largest R wave when the mean axis is also at +90°. Incorrect Options: A — Lead III Lead III is oriented at approximately +120°, which is off-axis from +90°. It would show a positive R wave but not the maximum since the mean vector isn’t perfectly aligned with it. B — Lead I Lead I is oriented at 0°, which is perpendicular to the +90° axis. Depolarization moving perpendicular to a lead's orientation results in a biphasic or small amplitude QRS complex, not a tall R wave. D — aVL Lead aVL is oriented at approximately –30°, almost opposite to +90°, so the QRS complex in aVL would be negative or show a small R wave at most.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Breathe normally In cardiac tamponade, there is accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, which restricts the normal filling of the heart, especially the right chambers. One important clinical sign to evaluate is pulsus paradoxus — an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration (>10 mmHg). To accurately detect pulsus paradoxus, normal, quiet breathing is essential. This allows the clinician to observe the natural inspiratory fluctuations in systolic pressure. Any alteration in breathing pattern — like breath holding, deep breathing, or shallow breathing — can distort these fluctuations and make the measurement unreliable. Therefore, when measuring blood pressure in suspected cardiac tamponade, the patient should be advised to breathe normally to facilitate correct diagnosis of pulsus paradoxus. Incorrect Options: A — Hold breath Holding breath (apnea) removes the respiratory variation in intrathoracic pressure, masking the inspiratory drop in systolic BP. This would prevent accurate detection of pulsus paradoxus. C — Long and deep breathing Deep breathing exaggerates intrathoracic pressure changes, which may artificially increase the variation in BP, possibly leading to a false-positive interpretation. D — Short and shallow breaths Shallow breathing reduces intrathoracic pressure changes, potentially minimizing the visible pulsus paradoxus and making it harder to detect.",

Normally, for every 1°C rise in body temperature, heart rate increases by about 10 beats per minute. In certain infections, this expected increase does not occur — that’s relative bradycardia. Malaria typically does not show relative bradycardia. In fact, malaria, especially during febrile paroxysms, often presents with tachycardia (high heart rate) proportional to the high fever. Hence, malaria is not associated with relative bradycardia, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A — Typhoid Relative bradycardia is classically associated with typhoid fever. Despite high fever, the pulse remains disproportionately low. This is a well-known diagnostic clue in typhoid. C — Factitious fever In factitious fever, patients may artificially elevate their body temperature (e.g., by external heating). Since the fever is not mediated by the normal physiological response, the heart rate often does not rise accordingly, leading to relative bradycardia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase) GGT is considered the most important and sensitive marker for alcoholic hepatitis. It is a microsomal enzyme found in the liver, and its levels are particularly elevated in individuals who consume chronic or excessive alcohol. Alcohol induces the synthesis of GGT, and its elevation is often disproportionate to other liver enzymes. In alcoholic liver disease, the typical enzyme pattern is: AST > ALT, both usually less than 300 IU/L Elevated GGT Often mild elevation in ALP Among these, GGT is especially useful because: It reflects chronic alcohol use It correlates with enzyme induction from alcohol It helps distinguish alcoholic hepatitis from other liver diseases Thus, GGT is not just elevated but serves as an important diagnostic and monitoring marker in alcohol-related liver conditions. Incorrect Options: B — ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) ALP is usually elevated in cholestatic liver conditions (e.g., bile duct obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis), not specifically in alcoholic hepatitis. It may rise mildly in alcoholic hepatitis, but it's not the most useful marker. C — ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) ALT is a marker of hepatocellular injury. In alcoholic hepatitis, AST is typically higher than ALT, and both are moderately elevated. ALT alone is not specific for alcoholic liver injury and tends to be lower compared to other liver diseases like viral hepatitis. D — LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) LDH may rise in severe liver injury but is non-specific. It is found in many tissues and does not distinguish alcoholic hepatitis from other causes of liver or systemic damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bradycardia / AV blocks Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and Metoprolol is a beta-blocker. Both drugs slow down the heart rate by acting on the atrioventricular (AV) node: Verapamil blocks L-type calcium channels, reducing AV nodal conduction and contractility. Metoprolol blocks beta-1 receptors, decreasing heart rate and AV conduction. Combining Verapamil and Metoprolol can result in additive or synergistic effects on the AV node, leading to: Sinus bradycardia High-degree AV blocks (like second- or third-degree) Potentially asystole in severe cases This combination is therefore used with caution or avoided, especially in patients with pre-existing conduction issues. Incorrect Options: A — Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Both drugs are used to treat AF by controlling the ventricular rate. They don’t typically cause AF; rather, they help suppress abnormal atrial conduction. B — Tachycardia This is the opposite of the expected effect. Both drugs slow heart rate. Tachycardia would be highly unlikely and contradictory to their pharmacological actions. C — Torsades de pointes Torsades is associated with drugs that prolong the QT interval, like some antiarrhythmics (e.g., sotalol, quinidine), not with Verapamil or Metoprolol. These drugs do not significantly prolong QT and are not typical causes of Torsades.",

In this emergency: Do not delay for imaging or other interventions. The correct immediate life-saving step is needle decompression using a wide bore needle, traditionally in the 2nd ICS midclavicular line, but recent guidelines accept 5th ICS anterior or mid-axillary line as well due to better success. This is followed by chest tube insertion (tube thoracostomy) for definitive management. Incorrect Options: A — Intubate While intubation is helpful for airway management, it does not relieve the pressure from a tension pneumothorax and can actually worsen the condition if positive pressure ventilation is started without decompression. B — Chest X-ray (CXR) CXR is not indicated before emergency needle decompression in suspected tension pneumothorax. Waiting for imaging can delay lifesaving treatment. C — IV Fluids (IVF) IV fluids may be helpful in managing hypotension, but they do not treat the underlying cause — which is obstructive shock from air trapped in the pleural cavity.",

This is the standard clinical method, where potassium (K?) is usually omitted due to its low plasma concentration. Applying the values: AG = 137 – (110 + 15) = 137 – 125 = 12 mmol/L This value falls within the normal anion gap range (typically 8–12 mmol/L), which may suggest a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (like in diarrhea or renal tubular acidosis), depending on the clinical scenario.

It would only be possible if there was an error in calculation or if one assumed an incorrect sodium or bicarbonate level. B — 16 mmol/L: This value results from including potassium in the anion gap formula: AG = (137 + 4) – (110 + 15) = 141 – 125 = 16 mmol/L Although mathematically correct, potassium is typically excluded in routine clinical calculation, making this answer less standard, even though it's technically valid.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cardiac tamponade In cardiac tamponade, there is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac that compresses the heart chambers, particularly the right atrium and ventricle, limiting their filling during diastole. This leads to a blunted or absent y descent in the jugular venous pulse (JVP). The y descent represents passive ventricular filling after the tricuspid valve opens, and in tamponade, this phase is significantly impaired because the heart cannot expand normally. Therefore, deep y descent is not seen in cardiac tamponade, making this the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B — Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM) In RCM, the myocardium becomes stiff, but the pericardium is not involved. Ventricular filling is impaired due to poor compliance, but early diastolic filling remains rapid, resulting in a prominent y descent in the JVP. C — Constrictive Pericarditis This condition involves a rigid pericardium restricting cardiac filling. Like RCM, there is rapid early diastolic filling followed by an abrupt stop due to the stiff pericardial shell. This creates a sharp and deep y descent, often described as \"Friedreich’s sign.\" D — Tricuspid Regurgitation In tricuspid regurgitation, blood flows back into the right atrium during systole, causing a prominent v wave. However, y descent can also be deep, as the right atrium empties rapidly into the right ventricle once the tricuspid valve opens, especially in severe cases.",

The standard clinical definition is: A fall in systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mmHg OR A fall in diastolic blood pressure of ≥10 mmHg Occurring within 3 minutes of standing up (or head-up tilt) This definition helps differentiate true orthostatic hypotension from normal postural changes. Incorrect Options: A — Decrease in systolic blood pressure 20 mmHg within 6 minutes The 6-minute time frame is too long; orthostatic hypotension is diagnosed within the first 3 minutes after standing. C — Decrease in diastolic blood pressure 20 mmHg within 6 minutes A 20 mmHg drop in diastolic pressure is excessive and not part of the standard definition. Also, the 6-minute window is too long. D — Decrease in diastolic blood pressure 20 mmHg within 3 minutes The diagnostic cutoff for diastolic pressure is a drop of ≥10 mmHg, not 20 mmHg.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) DC Shock The patient is a young male presenting with a narrow complex tachycardia (most likely Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia - PSVT) at a rate of 156/min, associated with hypotension (BP 70/40 mmHg). In such cases, hemodynamic instability (evidenced by low BP) is an indication for immediate synchronized Direct Current (DC) cardioversion. This is because unstable tachyarrhythmias can quickly deteriorate, and electrical cardioversion is the fastest, most effective way to restore normal rhythm in life-threatening situations, regardless of the underlying rhythm type. Synchronized cardioversion ensures that the shock is delivered during the R wave, preventing ventricular fibrillation that can occur if the shock is delivered during the T wave. Incorrect Options: Option A – Repeat Adenosine Adenosine is the first-line drug for stable PSVT, but this patient has already failed adenosine and is hemodynamically unstable. In unstable patients, pharmacological management is not appropriate; instead, DC shock should be used. Option B – Amiodarone Amiodarone is used in certain tachyarrhythmias, especially in ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, but it has delayed onset of action and is not the treatment of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients with narrow complex tachycardia. Also, it may further depress BP. Option D – Adrenaline Adrenaline is used in cardiac arrest scenarios such as asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), not in cases of PSVT with a pulse. Using adrenaline here could worsen the tachycardia and hypertension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IV fluids The cornerstone of treatment for dengue fever with warning signs (but without shock or hemorrhage) is judicious intravenous fluid therapy. Dengue causes increased vascular permeability, which can lead to plasma leakage and hemoconcentration. Early administration of isotonic IV fluids (such as normal saline or Ringer’s lactate) helps maintain intravascular volume, prevent progression to dengue shock syndrome, and ensure adequate perfusion. Fluid management is carefully guided by clinical signs, hematocrit levels, and urine output. Overhydration must be avoided, as it can cause pulmonary edema in the critical phase. This fluid support is the most evidence-based and life-saving measure in the management of dengue with warning signs. Incorrect Options: A — Platelet transfusion Not indicated routinely. Even with thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion is reserved for active bleeding or platelet count <10,000/µL with risk of bleeding. Transfusion in the absence of bleeding does not reduce mortality and may lead to complications such as fluid overload or transfusion reactions. C — Steroids Not recommended. Corticosteroids have no proven benefit in dengue management and can be harmful by suppressing immunity and increasing risk of secondary infections. They are not part of any standard dengue treatment guideline. D — Antivirals There are no effective antiviral medications currently approved for the treatment of dengue. Management is supportive, focusing on fluids, fever control, and monitoring for complications. Use of antivirals is not evidence-based in dengue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IV Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO?) This ECG strip shows a classic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a characteristic \"twisting of the points\" pattern, consistent with Torsades de Pointes (TdP). In a pregnant patient with preeclampsia, electrolyte imbalances or drug-induced QT prolongation may precipitate TdP. The first-line treatment for Torsades de Pointes is intravenous magnesium sulfate, irrespective of the patient’s serum magnesium level. Magnesium acts by stabilizing the cardiac myocytes and suppressing early afterdepolarizations that cause TdP. Since the patient is hemodynamically stable, magnesium sulfate is both effective and safe as initial management. Incorrect Options: Option A – DC Shock While DC shock is the treatment of choice in hemodynamically unstable TdP, this patient is stable, so immediate electrical cardioversion is not indicated. MgSO? should be attempted first. Option C – Synchronized Cardioversion Synchronized cardioversion is used in organized tachyarrhythmias like AF, SVT, or VT with pulse. TdP is a form of polymorphic VT where synchronization is ineffective; unsynchronized shock (defibrillation) is used in unstable cases. This is not the first-line treatment in stable TdP.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Calcium Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism, leading to toxic accumulation of copper in tissues, especially the liver, brain, and eyes. The mainstay of treatment is copper chelation or blocking copper absorption to prevent further accumulation and organ damage. Calcium has no role in the treatment of Wilson disease. It does not affect copper metabolism, nor does it function as a chelator or absorption inhibitor. Giving calcium does not provide any therapeutic benefit in Wilson disease and hence, is not used in its management. A — Trientine This is a chelating agent, like penicillamine, and is used to bind excess copper and enhance its excretion in urine. It is especially used in patients who are intolerant to penicillamine. C — Penicillamine This is a first-line chelating agent for Wilson disease. It binds copper and promotes urinary excretion. Although effective, it may cause side effects like nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity, leading to use of alternatives like trientine. D — Zinc Zinc works by blocking intestinal absorption of copper and promotes metallothionein production, which binds copper in the enterocytes and is later shed in feces.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) After return of appetite A key indicator for recovery in dengue hemorrhagic fever is the return of appetite. This occurs during the convalescent phase, typically after the critical phase (days 4–6), when plasma leakage subsides and the patient begins to reabsorb extravasated fluids. Return of appetite is a clinical sign that the patient is stabilizing, indicating improvement in gastrointestinal perfusion and systemic health. It is one of the standard discharge criteria, along with stable vital signs, improving platelet count, and good urine output. Incorrect Options: A — Urine output >200 ml/day This value is too low to indicate adequate kidney function or hydration. In dengue, urine output >0.5–1 mL/kg/hour (usually 1000–1500 mL/day in adults) is considered a sign of adequate perfusion. 200 mL/day would suggest oliguria, not readiness for discharge. B — After 24 hours fever controlled on paracetamol Fever resolution alone is not sufficient for discharge. The critical phase of dengue begins after the fever subsides, and complications like plasma leakage and shock can occur even when the fever has ended. Fever control is not a reliable discharge marker. D — 24 hours after control of shock Although control of shock is essential, discharge should not occur immediately after. Patients need to be monitored during the recovery phase for fluid reabsorption and potential complications like fluid overload. Discharge is considered when the patient has been stable without IV fluids, has adequate oral intake, and normal clinical parameters.",

When a patient recovers from hepatitis B, this antibody persists for life, indicating previous exposure. It does not develop after vaccination, only after actual infection. Therefore, Anti-HBc IgG is the most reliable marker of resolved natural HBV infection, especially when HBsAg is negative and Anti-HBs is positive. Incorrect Options: B — Anti-HBs While Anti-HBs does indicate recovery or immunity, it can also appear after vaccination, so it cannot distinguish between natural infection and vaccine-induced immunity. Therefore, Anti-HBc IgG is more specific for a past natural infection. C — HBsAg Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a marker of active infection. It is present during both acute and chronic phases, and disappears upon recovery. Its presence rules out recovery.

While bleeding risk increases with platelet counts below 20,000–50,000/µL, the procedure can still be performed safely with precautions. Platelet transfusion may be given prophylactically if the count is dangerously low or if the patient has other bleeding risks. Therefore, platelet count <40,000 is not a strict contraindication, just a consideration for risk management. B — Can be done in both prone or lateral position This is true. Bone marrow biopsies are most commonly performed at the posterior superior iliac spine, and the patient may be positioned prone or in lateral decubitus position, depending on comfort and operator preference. C — Infiltrative and granulomatous diseases are indications Also true. Bone marrow biopsy is indicated to diagnose infiltrative disorders (like leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) and granulomatous diseases (like tuberculosis or sarcoidosis involving bone marrow).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Trimetazidine Trimetazidine is not a standard drug used in the management of heart failure. It is a metabolic modulator that enhances myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism. It has a limited and unclear role in ischemic heart disease, particularly stable angina, but it is not part of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure. Hence, it is not routinely used or recommended in heart failure treatment protocols. Incorrect Options: A — Nesiritide Nesiritide is a recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide that causes vasodilation, reduces preload and afterload, and has diuretic properties. It was once used in acute decompensated heart failure, though its use has declined due to limited mortality benefit. Nevertheless, it has been used in heart failure management, especially in acute settings. C — Metoprolol Metoprolol, specifically the succinate (extended-release) form, is a beta-blocker proven to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It is one of the cornerstones of heart failure therapy. D — Sacubitril Sacubitril, used in combination with valsartan (as an ARNI — angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor), is a guideline-recommended therapy for HFrEF. It reduces mortality and hospitalizations and is now preferred over ACE inhibitors in many patients with symptomatic heart failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 720 To calculate the sodium deficit, we use the standard formula: Sodium Deficit (mEq)=Total Body Water (TBW)×(Desired Na−Current Na)\\text{Sodium Deficit (mEq)} = \\text{Total Body Water (TBW)} \\times (\\text{Desired Na} - \\text{Current Na})Sodium Deficit (mEq)=Total Body Water (TBW)×(Desired Na−Current Na) In adult males, TBW is approximated as 0.6 × body weight (kg). For this 60 kg male: TBW=0.6×60=36 L\\text{TBW} = 0.6 \\times 60 = 36 \\, \\text{L}TBW=0.6×60=36L The target sodium is typically 135–140 mEq/L. If aiming for full correction to 140 mEq/L: Na deficit=36×(140−120)=36×20=720 mEq\\text{Na deficit} = 36 \\times (140 - 120) = 36 \\times 20 = \\boxed{720 \\, \\text{mEq}}Na deficit=36×(140−120)=36×20=720mEq? This makes option D the correct answer. This calculation is crucial in the management of hyponatremia and helps guide the amount of sodium replacement required safely over time. Incorrect Options: Option A — 20 mEq This value is drastically underestimated. It could result from misapplying the formula or confusing it with sodium correction per day, rather than total deficit. It is not clinically appropriate for a 60 kg male with serum Na of 120 mEq/L. Option B — 200 mEq Still significantly underestimates the actual sodium requirement. Even if the goal was to raise sodium only to 130 mEq/L, the deficit would still exceed 200 mEq. This option reflects an incomplete correction strategy. Option C — 400 mEq Closer to the correct value, but still under-calculates the full deficit when targeting 140 mEq/L. May be appropriate for a more conservative goal (e.g., correcting to ~131 mEq/L), but not the full correction as suggested in the question.",

The resident doctor who had the needle prick is anti-HBs positive with a titer of 91 mIU/mL, which is well above the protective threshold of 10 mIU/mL. This means the resident already has adequate immunity against Hepatitis B, most likely from prior vaccination or past resolved infection.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Streptokinase Streptokinase is a fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agent, and it is not used in the treatment of NSTEMI. In NSTEMI, the coronary artery is typically not completely occluded, and the use of thrombolytics is associated with more harm than benefit, including an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Current guidelines clearly state that fibrinolytics like streptokinase are contraindicated in NSTEMI. Instead, management focuses on antiplatelets, anticoagulants, statins, and early invasive strategies if indicated. Option A — Aspirin Aspirin is essential in NSTEMI. It is the first-line antiplatelet agent, reducing mortality and the risk of further thrombotic events by inhibiting platelet aggregation via irreversible COX-1 inhibition. It is part of all guideline-directed therapy for acute coronary syndromes. Option C — Prasugrel Prasugrel is a P2Y12 inhibitor, like clopidogrel, and can be used in NSTEMI as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), especially in patients undergoing PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention). However, it is not recommended prior to knowing coronary anatomy and is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. Option D — Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is also a P2Y12 inhibitor and is commonly used in combination with aspirin for DAPT in NSTEMI patients. It is particularly useful if PCI is not immediately planned, and remains a widely used and accepted part of NSTEMI pharmacotherapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Shigella Shigella is a common bacterial cause of bloody diarrhea (dysentery). It invades the colonic mucosa, leading to inflammation, ulceration, and blood in stools. A well-recognized complication of Shigella infection is reactive arthritis, particularly in individuals with the HLA-B27 genotype. This manifests as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, often affecting large joints such as the knees or ankles. Thus, in a patient with bloody diarrhea and inflamed joints, Shigella is the most likely causative organism. Option A — E. coli Certain strains of E. coli, especially EHEC (e.g., O157:H7), can cause bloody diarrhea, but they are more commonly associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) rather than joint inflammation. Joint involvement is not a hallmark feature of E. coli infection. Option C — Rotavirus Rotavirus is a viral cause of watery diarrhea, especially in children. It does not cause bloody stools or joint pain. Its pathogenesis is limited to enterocyte destruction in the small intestine, with no invasive or systemic manifestations like arthritis. Option D — Staphylococcus Staphylococcus aureus can cause food poisoning, presenting with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but it is typically non-bloody, of short duration, and not associated with joint inflammation. It produces enterotoxins but does not invade the intestinal mucosa.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increase urine bilirubin In unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, and thus cannot be excreted in urine. Therefore, urine bilirubin is absent in conditions with isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This is the key feature that helps distinguish it from conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia, where water-soluble conjugated bilirubin spills into urine. Incorrect Options: Option A — Increase urine urobilinogen This is true. In conditions like hemolytic anemia, increased breakdown of hemoglobin leads to elevated bilirubin production, which increases urobilinogen formation in the intestines. Some of this urobilinogen is reabsorbed and excreted in urine, so urinary urobilinogen increases. Option B — Increase fecal urobilinogen Also true. Increased bilirubin breakdown in hemolytic states results in more bilirubin reaching the gut, where it's converted by bacteria to urobilinogen and stercobilinogen, contributing to increased levels in stool (giving stool a darker color). Option D — Seen in hemolytic anemia Hemolytic anemia is a classic cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, due to excessive red blood cell breakdown and overwhelming of the liver’s capacity to conjugate bilirubin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypercalcemia does not happen in massive blood transfusion. During massive blood transfusion, patients typically experience hypocalcemia rather than hypercalcemia. This occurs because stored blood contains citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding calcium. When large volumes of transfused blood are given rapidly, citrate accumulates faster than the liver can metabolize it, leading to a decrease in ionized calcium levels in the patient’s blood. This hypocalcemia can cause muscle cramps, tetany, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Since citrate lowers calcium levels, hypercalcemia is not a feature of massive transfusion, making option D the correct answer as the exception. Incorrect Options: A — Hypokalemia Hypokalemia is rare but can occur in some settings, especially if the patient’s cells uptake potassium during alkalosis or if potassium shifts intracellularly. However, it is not a typical or expected consequence of massive transfusion. B — Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia is a common complication of massive transfusion. Potassium leaks out of stored red blood cells into the plasma over time, and rapid transfusion of large amounts of blood can lead to dangerously high serum potassium levels, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. C — Hypocalcemia This is a classic and well-recognized complication due to citrate binding calcium in the recipient’s blood during transfusion. Hypocalcemia is frequently monitored and treated during massive transfusions to prevent complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dexamethasone + IV fluids + diuretics This patient has multiple myeloma (evidenced by 60% plasma cells in bone marrow), along with severe anemia (Hb 5.4) and acute kidney injury (high urea and creatinine). The elevated calcium (12 mg/dL) suggests hypercalcemia, a common complication of multiple myeloma that contributes to renal impairment. The immediate priority is to manage hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury: IV fluids help correct dehydration and improve renal perfusion. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that rapidly reduces plasma cell burden and inflammation, providing quick disease control. Diuretics are used cautiously after hydration to promote calcium excretion and prevent volume overload. This combination stabilizes the patient before specific myeloma-directed therapy is started and may help avoid urgent dialysis. Incorrect Options: A — Nephrologist opinion for dialysis Dialysis may be needed later if renal failure worsens or does not improve, but it is not the immediate first step. Initial management focuses on correcting hypercalcemia and dehydration to potentially reverse renal dysfunction. B — Lenalidomide + dexamethasone Lenalidomide is an effective myeloma therapy but should be started only after initial stabilization of renal function and hypercalcemia. It’s not the emergency intervention. D — Dexamethasone + IV fluids + Zoledronate Zoledronate (a bisphosphonate) is used to treat hypercalcemia in multiple myeloma but has potential nephrotoxicity. It is typically given once the patient is adequately hydrated and renal function is somewhat stabilized, so not the immediate next step.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 5% Dextrose with insulin The patient has acute renal failure postpartum with severe hyperkalemia (K = 6.5 mEq/L). Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening emergency because it can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The immediate treatment goal is to shift potassium from the extracellular space back into cells. Insulin given with 5% dextrose facilitates this intracellular shift of potassium rapidly and safely. The glucose prevents hypoglycemia from insulin administration. This intervention temporarily lowers serum potassium and buys time to address the underlying cause. Incorrect Options: A — IV fluids Normal saline While IV fluids may be required for volume status correction, normal saline alone does not correct hyperkalemia. It does not shift potassium intracellularly and is insufficient as immediate treatment. C — Calcitonin Calcitonin is used for hypercalcemia, not hyperkalemia. It has no role in managing elevated potassium levels. D — Decrease KCl dose in IV fluids Reducing potassium intake is important in managing hyperkalemia but does not acutely lower potassium levels in emergencies.

One important long-term complication is an increased risk of gastrointestinal lymphoma, particularly enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. This is due to persistent immune activation and mucosal damage. Incorrect Options: B — Can be managed on bread and pasta This is incorrect because bread and pasta typically contain gluten, which must be strictly avoided in celiac disease. The main treatment is a gluten-free diet. C — Diagnosed by CT scan Celiac disease is not diagnosed by CT scan. Diagnosis is based on serological tests (anti-tTG antibodies) and confirmed by small intestinal biopsy showing villous atrophy. D — Most common cause of malnutrition in developing countries This is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cardioversion The patient presents with palpitations, a rapid heart rate (180/min), and hypotension (BP 70 mmHg systolic). This indicates hemodynamic instability caused by the tachyarrhythmia. When a patient has a narrow QRS complex tachycardia (likely supraventricular tachycardia) with signs of instability such as hypotension, altered mental status, or chest pain, the immediate next step is synchronized electrical cardioversion. This is the safest and fastest way to restore normal rhythm and improve hemodynamics. Incorrect Options: B — Adenosine Adenosine is the drug of choice for stable narrow complex tachycardias to terminate reentrant tachycardias. However, in unstable patients, adenosine is contraindicated because the patient may not tolerate the brief asystole or delay in restoring rhythm. C — IV Fluids IV fluids may be useful as supportive therapy but will not immediately correct the unstable tachycardia or hypotension caused by arrhythmia. It should not delay definitive treatment. D — Inotropes Inotropes support cardiac output but do not address the underlying arrhythmia causing instability. They are not first-line treatment in unstable tachycardia and may worsen tachyarrhythmias.",

The initial management of NSTEMI includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) and anticoagulation (heparin) to prevent further thrombus formation and limit myocardial damage. This medical management stabilizes the patient and prepares for possible further interventions like PCI. Incorrect Options: A — PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) While PCI is often required in NSTEMI, it is not always the immediate first step. Initial medical stabilization with aspirin and heparin is essential, followed by risk stratification to decide timing of PCI. B — Thrombolysis with Alteplase Thrombolysis is not indicated in NSTEMI, as there is no complete coronary artery occlusion. It is reserved for STEMI (ST-elevation MI).

This makes it useful for very early diagnosis of myocardial infarction, especially in the critical first 2 hours when troponin levels may still be normal. Incorrect Options: A — Troponin Troponin is the gold standard for diagnosing myocardial infarction but usually rises 3-4 hours after symptom onset, so it is less useful within the first 2 hours. B — BNP (B-type Natriuretic Peptide) BNP is a marker of heart failure and is not specific or sensitive for myocardial infarction diagnosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Reversible with treatment Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are brownish or greenish rings seen at the corneal margin (Descemet’s membrane) due to copper deposition, and are characteristic of Wilson disease. Importantly, KF rings are reversible with chelation therapy (e.g., penicillamine or trientine), which reduces copper overload. Their disappearance often indicates successful treatment and copper removal from tissues. Incorrect Options: A — Pathognomonic in all patients KF rings are highly suggestive of Wilson disease, especially in neurological involvement, but they are not present in all patients, especially those with only hepatic symptoms. Thus, they are not universally pathognomonic. B — Seen in all cases of hepatic involvement KF rings are less frequently seen in patients with purely hepatic forms of Wilson disease, especially in younger individuals. So, this is incorrect. C — Seen in all cases of brain involvement While KF rings are common in patients with neurological manifestations, they are not seen in absolutely all such cases. Therefore, this statement is also inaccurate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Multiple Myeloma The most likely diagnosis is Multiple Myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy. The features strongly supporting this include: Hypercalcemia — due to bone resorption from lytic lesions. Anemia (Hb: 7 g%) — marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells suppresses normal hematopoiesis. Elevated serum creatinine — indicates renal involvement, often due to light chain cast nephropathy. High total protein with low albumin — suggests increased globulin fraction (typically monoclonal immunoglobulins). Back pain and focal lytic bone lesions — classic skeletal involvement in multiple myeloma. These findings collectively fulfill the CRAB criteria (Calcium elevation, Renal dysfunction, Anemia, Bone lesions), which are diagnostic hallmarks of multiple myeloma. Incorrect Options: A — Breast Cancer Metastasis While it can cause lytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia, it usually presents with a known primary mass and does not typically show monoclonal gammopathy or elevated total protein with low albumin. Anemia and renal failure are also less prominent early features. C — Milk Alkali Syndrome Caused by excessive calcium and alkali intake, this condition may result in hypercalcemia and renal dysfunction but does not explain anemia, lytic bone lesions, or high total protein.

It is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that primarily covers gram-positive organisms, including resistant strains like MRSA and VRE. However, empirical therapy for neutropenic fever requires broad-spectrum coverage, especially targeting gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, which pose the greatest risk for rapid deterioration. Linezolid is not effective against gram-negative organisms, and is reserved for specific indications, such as documented resistant gram-positive infections, not for initial empiric therapy. Incorrect Options: A — Cefepime Cefepime is a broad-spectrum 4th-generation cephalosporin with strong anti-Pseudomonal activity. It is a first-line empiric therapy in neutropenic fever. B — Piperacillin/Tazobactam This combination is widely used in neutropenic patients due to its broad coverage, including Pseudomonas and anaerobes, making it highly effective as an empiric agent.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increase Serum Unconjugated Bilirubin Physiological jaundice in newborns is primarily due to the immaturity of the liver’s conjugation mechanisms, specifically low activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin. As a result, unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin builds up in the serum, leading to jaundice. This type of bilirubin is not water-soluble, so it does not appear in urine, and urobilinogen is typically still present. Incorrect Options: A — Increase Urine Bilirubin Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, so it cannot be excreted in urine. Presence of bilirubin in urine suggests conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not seen in physiological jaundice. B — Absent Urine Urobilinogen Urobilinogen is usually present as a breakdown product of conjugated bilirubin in the intestines. In physiological jaundice, conjugation is reduced but not absent, and intestinal conversion can still occur, so urobilinogen is not necessarily absent. D — Increase Serum Conjugated Bilirubin This is seen in pathological causes of jaundice such as neonatal hepatitis or biliary atresia, not in physiological jaundice, where the unconjugated form predominates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) RV + RA (Right Ventricle + Right Atrium) The patient's symptoms point toward right-sided heart involvement, especially the right atrium and right ventricle: Hepatomegaly is a classic sign of right-sided heart failure due to venous congestion. Chest crepitations can occur in either right or left heart failure but are more pronounced in left-sided failure; however, in chronic lung disease (common in smokers), crepitations may also be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cor pulmonale. A systolic murmur at the left 5th intercostal space (parasternal area) suggests tricuspid regurgitation, which is a common manifestation of right ventricular failure and right atrial dilation. Smoking is a risk factor for pulmonary hypertension, which places strain on the right heart (cor pulmonale), leading to right atrial and right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, RV and RA involvement is the most consistent with the overall clinical picture. Incorrect Options: A — RA + LA (Right Atrium + Left Atrium) Involvement of both atria is rare without a more generalized cardiomyopathy. This does not explain the systolic murmur or hepatomegaly as clearly. B — LA + LV (Left Atrium + Left Ventricle) Left-sided involvement typically leads to pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, and orthopnea, not prominent hepatomegaly or a tricuspid murmur. D — LV + RV (Left and Right Ventricles) While biventricular failure is possible, the clinical signs are more selective for right heart strain, particularly with hepatomegaly and the murmur's location. There's no evidence of systemic hypertension or significant left-sided findings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) C wave The C wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP) corresponds to the isovolumetric contraction phase of the right ventricle. During this phase, the tricuspid valve is closed, and as the right ventricle begins to contract, the intraventricular pressure rises sharply. This causes a bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium, producing a brief increase in right atrial pressure that is reflected as the C wave on the JVP tracing. This is a subtle, transient wave that follows the A wave and is often small. Incorrect Options: A — A wave The A wave represents right atrial contraction, which occurs just before the tricuspid valve closes, during end-diastole — not during isovolumetric contraction. C — X descent The X descent follows the A wave and reflects atrial relaxation and downward displacement of the tricuspid valve during ventricular systole, but not the isovolumetric contraction phase specifically. It occurs slightly later than the C wave. D — Y descent The Y descent occurs after the tricuspid valve opens, representing rapid ventricular filling — a diastolic event, not during isovolumetric contraction, which is a systolic event.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Liddle Syndrome Liddle syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that leads to hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypertension. It results from a gain-of-function mutation in the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the distal nephron of the kidney, causing increased sodium reabsorption and volume expansion, which leads to hypertension. The enhanced sodium reabsorption also promotes potassium and hydrogen ion loss, resulting in hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Importantly, although the clinical picture resembles hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone levels are actually low in Liddle syndrome because the body tries to compensate for the volume expansion. Incorrect Options: A — Bartter Syndrome Bartter syndrome causes hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, but without hypertension. It is due to a defect in the Na?/K?/2Cl? cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to salt wasting, volume depletion, and secondary hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism — but normal or low blood pressure. B — Gitelman Syndrome Similar to Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome also causes hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis without hypertension. It affects the Na?/Cl? cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule and typically presents with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria, but normal or low blood pressure. D — Gordon Syndrome (also called pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) Gordon syndrome causes hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis. It is associated with hypertension due to sodium retention, but the key distinguishing feature is hyperkalemia, making it the opposite of what’s described in the question.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Eplerenone In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, the preferred diuretics are potassium-sparing agents like spironolactone or eplerenone, because these drugs counteract the secondary hyperaldosteronism commonly seen in cirrhosis. Aldosterone causes sodium retention and potassium loss; therefore, blocking aldosterone helps reduce ascites effectively and prevents hypokalemia. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone antagonist, similar to spironolactone, but with fewer endocrine side effects. When serum potassium status is unknown, starting with a potassium-sparing diuretic like eplerenone is safer because it minimizes the risk of hypokalemia which is common in cirrhotics and prevents unnecessary potassium loss. Incorrect Options: A — Furosemide Furosemide is a loop diuretic that causes potassium loss. Starting it without knowing potassium status can worsen hypokalemia or cause electrolyte imbalances. It is usually added later in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic. C — Chlorthiazide Thiazide diuretics also cause potassium wasting and are not first-line for ascites in cirrhosis. D — Triamterene Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic but is less commonly used in cirrhosis compared to aldosterone antagonists because it does not block aldosterone, and may be less effective for ascites.",

This serology profile is typical of a person who has had past exposure to Hepatitis B virus and is now in the inactive carrier state, meaning the infection is no longer active but the person has markers of past infection. Interpretation of each serologic marker: HbsAg-negative → No active Hepatitis B surface antigen in the blood → No current infection. HbeAg-negative → No active viral replication. IgM anti-HBc negative → Rules out acute or recent infection. IgG anti-HBc positive → Indicates past infection (chronic or resolved). This profile fits an inactive carrier — someone who had hepatitis B in the past but has since cleared the surface antigen, and there is no evidence of active viral replication or acute infection. Incorrect Options: A) Chronic hepatitis active carrier Would show HbsAg-positive and usually HbeAg-positive, with or without elevated liver enzymes. This patient is HbsAg-negative, ruling this out. C) Precore mutant Typically shows HbsAg-positive, HbeAg-negative, and high HBV DNA levels — indicating replication without HBeAg. Again, this patient is HbsAg-negative, so this is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Crohn has skip lesions. Crohn’s disease is characterized by skip lesions, which means discontinuous areas of inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. This is a hallmark feature differentiating it from ulcerative colitis, which involves continuous inflammation starting from the rectum. Incorrect Options: B) Strong genetic predisposition While both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have some genetic links, the term “strong genetic predisposition” is overstated. The genetics of IBD are complex and multifactorial, with environmental and immune factors also playing a major role. C) Crohn has only mucosal involvement This is incorrect. Crohn’s disease involves transmural (full-thickness) inflammation, which can lead to complications such as fistulas, strictures, and abscesses. Mucosal-only involvement is more typical of ulcerative colitis. D) Crohn's is curable through surgical resection of the affected segment This is incorrect. While surgery may help manage complications, Crohn’s disease can recur in other segments of the GI tract even after resection. Hence, it is not curable through surgery. In contrast, ulcerative colitis may be cured with a total colectomy.",

Detailed Explanation of Correct Answer: Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes and can occur in HIV patients; however, its occurrence does not define progression to AIDS. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) defines AIDS based on the presence of certain opportunistic infections or cancers. Melanoma, while serious, does not meet the criteria to be classified as an AIDS-defining condition. Incorrect Options: A) Kaposi sarcoma Correctly classified as an AIDS-defining cancer. Caused by HHV-8, it is especially common in advanced HIV disease and is one of the first recognized AIDS-associated cancers. B) Cervical cancer Invasive cervical cancer is an AIDS-defining illness. It is caused by persistent HPV infection and is particularly aggressive in HIV-positive individuals. C) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Certain types of NHL (especially high-grade B-cell lymphomas like primary CNS lymphoma) are considered AIDS-defining conditions due to their strong association with HIV-related immunosuppression.",

Incorrect Option: A) Midazolam Midazolam is also a benzodiazepine commonly used in seizures, but it is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Atorvastatin 80 mg This patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and type 2 diabetes, both of which place him at very high cardiovascular risk. Current guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in such patients to aggressively lower LDL cholesterol and reduce future cardiovascular events. High-intensity statin therapy (such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) is aimed at reducing LDL cholesterol by ≥50%. Despite the LDL being 120 mg/dl, the presence of diabetes and recent MI means LDL goals should be much lower, so high-dose statin is indicated. High triglycerides (TG 270 mg/dl) and low HDL are common in diabetes, but statins are still first-line treatment. Incorrect Options: B) Atorvastatin 20 mg This is a moderate-intensity statin dose. For secondary prevention in high-risk patients like post-MI diabetics, moderate-intensity statins are insufficient. C) Rosuvastatin 10 mg This is also a moderate-intensity statin dose. High-intensity statin doses are recommended in this scenario. D) Fenofibrate Fenofibrate is primarily used for treating very high triglycerides to reduce pancreatitis risk, but it has not shown clear cardiovascular benefit as monotherapy.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Losartan Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) that reduces blood pressure by inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II. While ARBs are renal protective in many cases, they decrease aldosterone secretion, which reduces potassium excretion by the kidneys. In patients with deranged renal function and hyperkalemia, continuing losartan can exacerbate the hyperkalemia, which may be life-threatening. Therefore, losartan should be stopped to prevent worsening of serum potassium levels and avoid further kidney injury. Incorrect Options: A) Furosemide Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes potassium excretion by increasing urine output. It is actually helpful in managing hyperkalemia, especially in renal impairment. Hence, it should not be stopped. B) Amlodipine Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not affect potassium balance significantly and is safe to continue in patients with hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Non-pulsatile rise in JVP In heart failure, especially right-sided failure, the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is elevated and this rise is typically pulsatile, reflecting the pressure changes in the right atrium during the cardiac cycle. A non-pulsatile rise in JVP is not a typical finding in heart failure and may suggest other causes such as venous obstruction or technical error during examination. Incorrect Options: B) Orthopnea Orthopnea, or difficulty breathing when lying flat, is a classic symptom of left-sided heart failure due to pulmonary congestion. It is a well-recognized sign of heart failure. C) Shortness of breath after 2-3 hours of sleep This describes paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), another hallmark symptom of heart failure where fluid redistributes during sleep causing sudden breathlessness, often waking the patient after a few hours. D) Right hypochondrial pain Right hypochondrial pain in heart failure is due to hepatic congestion from right-sided failure.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Chronic inflammation In anemia of chronic inflammation (also called anemia of chronic disease), the body sequesters iron within storage sites leading to high ferritin levels (ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and iron storage protein). Despite low Hb, low MCH, and low MCV indicating microcytic, hypochromic anemia, the ferritin is elevated because iron is trapped inside macrophages and unavailable for red cell production. This is a hallmark of anemia of chronic inflammation. Incorrect Options: A) Iron deficiency anemia Typically presents with low Hb, low MCH, low MCV, and low ferritin since iron stores are depleted. The high ferritin in this patient rules out iron deficiency anemia. B) Sideroblastic anemia Characterized by defective incorporation of iron into hemoglobin, often shows normal to high iron and ferritin, but usually with a dimorphic red cell picture rather than consistently low MCV and MCH. It is less common and usually diagnosed with bone marrow findings. D) Thalassemia This is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy presenting with low MCV and low MCH but usually normal or increased HbA2 or HbF on electrophoresis. Ferritin can be normal or elevated if there have been multiple transfusions, but it is not the defining feature. The elevated ferritin here more strongly suggests anemia of chronic inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All are correct Resection of any of these parts of the gastrointestinal tract can potentially lead to macrocytosis due to their roles in nutrient absorption essential for red blood cell production and DNA synthesis. Stomach The stomach produces intrinsic factor, which is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. Resection (e.g., gastrectomy) can cause pernicious anemia, a type of macrocytic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Duodenum The duodenum is the primary site for iron absorption, but also important for absorption of folate and other micronutrients. Resection can contribute to folate deficiency, leading to macrocytic anemia. Jejunum The jejunum is the main site of folate absorption. Its resection impairs folate absorption, causing folate deficiency anemia, which is macrocytic. Ileum The terminal ileum is responsible for the absorption of vitamin B12 (bound to intrinsic factor). Its resection leads to vitamin B12 deficiency and subsequent macrocytic anemia. Thus, removal of any of these sites impairs absorption of folate or vitamin B12, both necessary for DNA synthesis in RBC precursors, resulting in macrocytosis. Incorrect Options: Options A, B, and C exclude some sites and are therefore incorrect because all four sites can lead to macrocytosis when resected.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that primarily affects the small joints symmetrically. The clinical picture in this case — pain and swelling in the knee and hand joints, morning stiffness, difficulty in squatting, and sparing of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints — is classic for RA. The image shows ulnar deviation and swan-neck deformities, which are hallmark features of advanced RA. These deformities occur due to long-term synovial inflammation leading to joint damage and tendon displacement. Incorrect options: B. Osteoarthritis OA typically affects the DIP joints (e.g., Heberden's nodes) and is associated with bony swelling and less prominent morning stiffness (usually <30 minutes). It is more wear-and-tear related, and not symmetric in distribution. Hence, less likely here. C. Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) PVNS is a rare condition causing localized or diffuse synovial hypertrophy, often involving a single joint (commonly the knee). It does not present with symmetric hand joint involvement or classic systemic RA features. D. Post-traumatic Dystrophy (CRPS) CRPS typically follows trauma and is marked by disproportionate pain, swelling, and autonomic changes (e.g., sweating, color change), rather than symmetric joint involvement or classic hand deformities as seen here.",

Because ANA is positive in nearly all patients with active SLE, it is considered a key screening test for diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A) Scleroderma While ANA is positive in the majority of scleroderma patients (about 90%), a small percentage can have negative ANA, so diagnosis is still possible with clinical features and other specific autoantibodies. C) Sjogren Syndrome ANA is positive in many patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, but it is not universally positive. Diagnosis can also be made by clinical features, other autoantibodies (anti-Ro, anti-La), and salivary gland biopsy even if ANA is negative. D) Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) DLE is a form of cutaneous lupus that may have negative ANA in many patients, since it is a localized skin disease.

Anti Jo-1 is an antibody directed against histidyl tRNA synthetase and is classically seen in polymyositis and dermatomyositis, especially in patients with antisynthetase syndrome, which includes interstitial lung disease, arthritis, and mechanic’s hands. Anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70) is specific for systemic sclerosis, especially the diffuse cutaneous form, and indicates a higher risk for pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-U1 RNP is most strongly associated with Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), a condition with overlapping features of lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis. Anti-Smith is a highly specific marker for SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), though not sensitive. Its presence strongly supports an SLE diagnosis when found. Incorrect Options: Option B: A-4, B-2, C-5, D-3 Anti Jo-1 is not primarily associated with synthetase syndrome alone in this matching format (the correct pair was dermatomyositis). Anti-topoisomerase is wrongly paired with CDT instead of systemic sclerosis. Anti-U1 RNP does not match with dermatomyositis but with MCTD. Anti-Smith is incorrectly linked with systemic sclerosis, not SLE. Option C: A-3, B-4, C-1, D-2 This option misplaces several antibodies: Anti Jo-1 is not related to systemic sclerosis. Anti-topoisomerase and anti-Smith are also mismatched. Anti-U1 RNP is wrongly assigned to SLE, whereas it's a marker for MCTD. Option D: A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4 Again, all pairings are incorrect in this option: Anti Jo-1 is not associated with SLE. Anti-topoisomerase and U1 RNP are both mismatched.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) High calorie, low volume In patients with end-stage CKD, especially those on dialysis, maintaining adequate caloric intake is critical due to increased catabolism and nutritional losses during dialysis. However, fluid overload is a common issue because the kidneys can no longer effectively excrete excess fluid. Therefore, the nutritional strategy should be to provide high-calorie nutrition in a low-volume format to meet energy needs without causing fluid overload. This approach helps prevent malnutrition and maintains energy balance while keeping fluid intake within safe limits. Incorrect Options: A) Low calorie, low volume This regimen does not meet the energy requirements of end-stage CKD patients, risking protein-energy malnutrition—a common and serious complication in these patients. B) Low calorie, high volume This approach also fails to meet caloric needs and increases the risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension, and congestive heart failure in CKD patients.

The key feature in this case is that the rash worsens with sun exposure, which is characteristic of the photosensitivity seen in SLE. The combination of joint involvement, mucocutaneous symptoms, and photosensitivity strongly suggests SLE. Incorrect Options: A) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) RA typically presents with symmetric joint pain and stiffness, especially in the small joints of the hands and feet. It does not commonly involve oral ulcers or photosensitive rashes, which makes RA unlikely in this case. C) Pseudogout Pseudogout usually affects older individuals and presents with acute monoarthritis (often in the knee), due to calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition. It does not involve oral ulcers or skin rashes, and is not linked to photosensitivity. D) Gout Gout is more common in middle-aged to older men, and presents as acute monoarthritis, classically affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe).

It commonly presents in young men with chronic inflammatory low back pain (often beginning before age 40), morning stiffness, and improves with exercise. Radiologic hallmarks include: Bilateral sacroiliitis (fusion or sclerosis of sacroiliac joints) Syndesmophytes (bony growths within ligaments of the spine leading to a “bamboo spine” appearance) AS is associated with HLA-B27 positivity and does not typically involve peripheral joints or systemic features like oral ulcers (as seen in SLE or RA). Incorrect Options: A) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) RA usually affects peripheral joints (small joints of hands and feet) in a symmetric fashion. Axial involvement is rare, and sacroiliac joint fusion is not characteristic. B) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) SLE can cause arthritis, but it's usually non-erosive, migratory, and does not lead to spinal fusion or sacroiliitis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy is a common long-term complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in uremia. It typically presents as a distal, symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Unlike many uremic symptoms, peripheral neuropathy does not significantly improve with dialysis. This is because the nerve damage is often due to chronic exposure to uremic toxins and metabolic disturbances that have already caused structural changes to nerves. Therefore, even after dialysis starts and uremic toxin levels are reduced, the neurological damage may persist. Incorrect Options: B) Seizure Uremic seizures are caused by accumulation of toxins, electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyponatremia), or metabolic derangements. Dialysis effectively clears toxins and corrects imbalances, typically resolving or improving seizures. C) Pericarditis Uremic pericarditis occurs due to irritation of the pericardium by retained uremic toxins. Dialysis usually leads to resolution of pericardial symptoms if initiated promptly, especially in acute cases. D) Metabolic alkalosis This is not typically a uremic symptom, and patients with kidney failure more commonly present with metabolic acidosis due to decreased acid excretion. In any case, acid-base disturbances (including alkalosis, if present) generally improve with dialysis, as it corrects the underlying metabolic imbalance.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Metolazone In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 30 ml/min, diuretic efficacy becomes significantly reduced, particularly for thiazide diuretics, due to their site of action in the distal convoluted tubule, which receives less sodium as kidney function declines. Metolazone, although structurally similar to thiazides, is a thiazide-like diuretic that remains effective even at low GFRs, including levels <30 ml/min. It works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule and has an enhanced ability to augment diuresis when combined with loop diuretics like furosemide, making it especially useful in volume overload conditions in advanced CKD. Its unique efficacy at low GFRs distinguishes it from other thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. Incorrect Options: A) Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide is a standard thiazide diuretic that loses effectiveness when GFR falls below 30 ml/min. It is not recommended for use in patients with advanced CKD due to poor diuretic response in this population. B) Chlorthalidone Although chlorthalidone is a long-acting thiazide-like diuretic with some evidence suggesting slightly better efficacy than hydrochlorothiazide, it still becomes ineffective when GFR drops below 30 ml/min. Hence, it is not ideal in advanced CKD. D) Indapamide Indapamide is another thiazide-like diuretic with antihypertensive properties, but similar to chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, its efficacy diminishes significantly when GFR is <30 ml/min. Therefore, it is not the preferred choice in such cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Azathioprine Azathioprine is not used as a first-line treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is an immunosuppressive agent primarily indicated in refractory cases or when patients are intolerant or unresponsive to first-line DMARDs. Although azathioprine has immunomodulatory effects, its use is limited due to a higher risk of toxicity, including myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and increased susceptibility to infections. It is typically reserved for specific clinical scenarios, such as coexisting systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or organ involvement, and is not part of the standard initial DMARD regimen recommended in current RA treatment guidelines. Why the other options are correct (used as first-line): A) Sulfasalazine Sulfasalazine is a conventional synthetic DMARD that is effective in treating mild to moderate RA. It is frequently used either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine as part of triple therapy, making it a common and accepted first-line option. B) Methotrexate Methotrexate is considered the cornerstone or anchor drug in RA treatment. It is the most commonly used first-line DMARD due to its effectiveness in controlling disease activity, slowing joint damage, and improving long-term outcomes. It is usually the first drug initiated in moderate to severe RA. C) HCQS (Hydroxychloroquine) Hydroxychloroquine is a mild DMARD often used in early or less severe RA. It is well-tolerated and is commonly prescribed either as monotherapy for mild disease or in combination regimens for more active disease, making it a suitable first-line agent.",

These are a hallmark skin finding in dermatomyositis, a connective tissue disorder characterized by proximal muscle weakness (such as difficulty climbing stairs or combing hair) and distinctive skin manifestations like heliotrope rash (violaceous rash around eyes) and Gottron's papules. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy in which both muscle and skin are involved. The presence of both muscle weakness and characteristic rash clinches the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) SLE can present with a malar rash and other cutaneous findings like discoid lesions, but Gottron’s papules are not seen in SLE. Muscle involvement, if present, is usually mild and secondary to inflammation or drugs, not the predominant feature. C. Polymyositis Polymyositis also causes proximal muscle weakness, similar to dermatomyositis, but lacks the cutaneous findings. Gottron’s papules and heliotrope rash are absent in polymyositis, which helps differentiate it from dermatomyositis. D. Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin and muscles, but it does not produce Gottron’s papules or characteristic skin lesions of dermatomyositis.

It works by converting uric acid into allantoin, a water-soluble compound that is more easily excreted by the kidneys. Pegloticase is administered intravenously and is particularly effective in rapidly lowering serum uric acid levels and resolving tophi. Because of its potential for infusion reactions and immunogenicity, it is typically reserved for severe or tophaceous gout that has not responded to other treatments. Incorrect Options: B) Paralytic ileus Pegloticase has no role in the management of paralytic ileus, which is a gastrointestinal motility disorder often managed with supportive care, bowel rest, or prokinetic agents—not urate-lowering drugs. C) Psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune inflammatory arthritis treated with NSAIDs, DMARDs, or biologics. Pegloticase does not target the inflammatory pathways involved in psoriatic arthritis and is not used in its treatment.

Broca’s area is classically located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere (usually left hemisphere for right-handed individuals). This area is responsible for the motor planning of speech. In the image, the area marked B corresponds to the inferior frontal gyrus, identifying Broca’s area as the region involved. Damage to this area leads to non-fluent, expressive aphasia, where the patient understands spoken language but cannot articulate speech fluently. Patients often produce halting speech or may be limited to moaning or short phrases despite intact comprehension. Incorrect Options: A. A This area appears to correspond with the superior frontal gyrus. While it plays a role in motor planning and cognitive functions, it is not responsible for speech production. Lesions here would not produce the characteristic expressive aphasia seen in this case. C. C This region likely indicates the parietal lobe, possibly near the supramarginal or angular gyrus, involved in language comprehension (Wernicke's area).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tunica media defect Berry aneurysms, also known as saccular aneurysms, are the most common type of intracranial aneurysms and are frequently found at arterial branch points in the Circle of Willis. The most widely accepted cause is a congenital defect in the tunica media, the muscular middle layer of the arterial wall. This defect weakens the vessel wall at bifurcation points, making it susceptible to ballooning out under arterial pressure. Although these defects are often congenital, aneurysm formation may be precipitated or worsened by hemodynamic stress, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis. However, the initiating factor remains the structural weakness of the tunica media, which fails to provide adequate support to the vessel wall. Incorrect Options: A) Endothelial injury of vessel due to HTN Hypertension can contribute to the growth and rupture of a berry aneurysm by increasing intraluminal pressure, but it is not the primary cause. The initial lesion is a structural defect in the tunica media, not endothelial injury. C) Endothelial layer defect The endothelial layer lines the interior of blood vessels and while its dysfunction can play a role in vascular diseases, berry aneurysms are not primarily caused by endothelial defects. The key problem lies deeper in the muscular wall (tunica media). D) Adventitia defect The adventitia is the outermost layer of the vessel and plays a minor role in aneurysm pathogenesis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) NMO (Neuromyelitis Optica) The correct diagnosis is Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), also known as Devic’s disease, an autoimmune demyelinating condition that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. The hallmark features include recurrent optic neuritis (leading to visual impairment) and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), which is characterized by inflammation extending over three or more vertebral segments. This patient presents with bilateral optic neuritis and extensive myelitis, which are classical features of NMO. Additionally, a partial response to steroids is consistent with the typical course of NMO, which often shows incomplete or partial improvement with corticosteroid therapy. Diagnostic confirmation would involve testing for aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) antibodies, which are often positive in NMO patients. Incorrect Options: B) SACD (Subacute Combined Degeneration of the spinal cord) SACD is due to vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to involvement of the posterior columns and corticospinal tracts. It presents with sensory ataxia, paresthesia, spasticity, and positive Romberg’s sign, but optic neuritis and acute transverse myelitis are not typical features. C) Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke PCA stroke may lead to homonymous hemianopia and visual field defects, not optic neuritis or transverse myelitis. Additionally, it is an acute vascular event and would not present with recurrent bilateral optic neuritis or spinal cord involvement. D) Neurosyphilis Neurosyphilis can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including optic atrophy, but recurrent optic neuritis with extensive myelitis is not typical. The presentation in this case is much more characteristic of NMO.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A) A-True, B-False, C-True, D-True, E-False ? This is a clinical scenario of an acute ischemic stroke with classic symptoms (right hemiparesis and aphasia), presenting within the golden window (<4.5 hours) for thrombolysis. The goal is to evaluate the timing and safety of thrombolytic therapy (Tenecteplase or rTPA), and appropriate use of antiplatelet agents. A. Tenecteplase not started if CT scan normal — TRUE This statement is true in a specific clinical context. A normal CT scan in the setting of acute stroke does not rule out ischemia, as early infarcts may not yet be visible. However, Tenecteplase is only started after excluding hemorrhage on CT, and confirming diagnosis of ischemic stroke based on clinical findings. So, a normal CT does not justify not starting Tenecteplase — hence the tricky wording. This is interpreted as true if \"not started just based on CT being normal\" is implied. B. Tenecteplase not started before MRI if CT scan normal — FALSE This is false because non-contrast CT is sufficient to rule out hemorrhage in acute stroke. MRI is not mandatory before initiating thrombolysis. Tenecteplase or rTPA can be given based on CT findings and clinical suspicion. C. rTPA given when BP < 185/100 — TRUE Correct. Blood pressure must be lowered to <185/100 mmHg before administering thrombolysis to reduce the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. This is a standard contraindication to thrombolysis if not controlled. D. rTPA given in a patient taking warfarin with INR 1.4 — TRUE True. Thrombolysis with rTPA is allowed if the INR is ≤1.7. An INR of 1.4 is within the safe range. E. Dual antiplatelet therapy immediately — FALSE This is false because dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin + clopidogrel) is not started immediately in the setting of thrombolysis. It is only considered later in selected cases with minor stroke or TIA, and never immediately post-thrombolysis due to bleeding risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) EEG is mandatory for diagnosis of epilepsy A) EEG is mandatory for diagnosis of epilepsy — False This is the false statement, hence the correct answer to the question. Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis primarily based on a detailed history of recurrent unprovoked seizures. While electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable tool to support the diagnosis and to help classify seizure types, it is not mandatory. A significant number of patients with epilepsy may have normal EEG findings in the interictal (between seizures) period. Furthermore, treatment decisions are often made based on the clinical context, even if the EEG is inconclusive or normal. Incorrect Options: B) EEG is used for diagnosis of frontal lobe seizures — True This statement is true. EEG plays an important role in evaluating focal seizures, including those originating in the frontal lobes. Though frontal lobe seizures can be difficult to detect on EEG due to deep-seated foci or rapid spread, the tool is still useful, particularly with video EEG monitoring, in capturing these events. C) In absence seizures, EEG will show generalized spike and wave pattern — True This is true. Typical absence seizures, most commonly seen in children, are associated with a classic 3 Hz generalized spike-and-wave pattern on EEG. This finding is often used to make or confirm the diagnosis. D) 10% of normal people also show epileptiform discharge on EEG — True This is also true. Though less commonly quoted, studies have shown that up to 1–4% and sometimes even up to 10% of healthy individuals without epilepsy can show epileptiform discharges on EEG. This highlights why EEG findings must always be interpreted in clinical context, and not used in isolation to diagnose epilepsy.",

The parietal lobe integrates sensory information from different modalities (visual, spatial, tactile) and is essential for tasks that require spatial awareness, depth perception, and guiding hand movements based on visual input. The posterior parietal cortex, in particular, helps in translating visual information into motor commands—essential for coordinated movements like reaching or grasping based on where the eyes are looking. Incorrect Options: A) Frontal The frontal lobe is primarily responsible for motor planning, executive functions, and voluntary movement initiation. While it contributes to movement, coordination between eye and hand based on sensory input is not its primary role. C) Temporal The temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing, language comprehension, and memory functions, not in spatial coordination or visuomotor integration. D) Occipital The occipital lobe is responsible for visual perception and processing. While it receives and processes visual input, it does not integrate this with motor functions like eye-hand coordination. That integration is done by the parietal lobe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) SC sumatriptan Subcutaneous (SC) sumatriptan is the most effective and fastest-acting option for the acute treatment of cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are characterized by severe, unilateral periorbital pain with autonomic features, and they require rapid-acting treatments due to their sudden onset and short duration. SC sumatriptan (6 mg) provides relief typically within 10–15 minutes, making it highly suitable for aborting an acute cluster attack. It is FDA-approved for this indication and is the first-line treatment in many guidelines. Incorrect Options : A) Oral sumatriptan Although sumatriptan is effective for migraines, oral administration is too slow for cluster headache due to its delayed onset of action. Cluster headaches are short-lived, and the time taken for oral absorption makes it ineffective for acute relief. C) Oxygen at 6 L/min Oxygen therapy is indeed used for cluster headaches, but the flow rate matters. A 6 L/min flow is often insufficient for therapeutic benefit. Effective relief requires high-flow oxygen. D) Oxygen at 8 L/min Although better than 6 L/min, even 8 L/min may be suboptimal. Most guidelines recommend 12–15 L/min of 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask for acute cluster headache treatment. So, 8 L/min is not considered standard.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dorsal column The dorsal column (posterior column) of the spinal cord carries proprioception, fine touch, and vibration sense. In tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of neurosyphilis, the dorsal columns degenerate, leading to loss of position sense. This causes: Positive Romberg's sign (instability with eyes closed) Stamping gait — the patient stomps feet to generate vibrations for feedback due to lack of proprioception. These findings match the clinical description in the question. Hence, dorsal column involvement is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A) Vestibulocerebellar tract This tract is involved in balance and coordination, especially in relation to head position and eye movements. Lesions here may cause vertigo, nystagmus, or ataxia, but not stamping gait or Romberg’s sign. B) Spinocerebellar tract The spinocerebellar tract carries unconscious proprioception to the cerebellum. Lesions cause ataxia, but the patient’s balance does not worsen with eyes closed, so Romberg’s sign is negative. This doesn't fit the clinical picture. D) Lateral spinothalamic tract This tract carries pain and temperature sensations. Its involvement leads to loss of these sensations, not proprioception, and hence won’t cause stamping gait or Romberg’s sign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Urinary incontinence The marked green area in the image corresponds to the medial aspect of the frontal lobe, specifically the paracentral lobule, which includes part of the primary motor cortex controlling the lower limbs and perineum, including voluntary control of micturition (urination). Damage to this area, such as from trauma, stroke, or a frontal lobe lesion, can impair the voluntary control of the bladder, leading to urge incontinence or reflex bladder. This is often seen in frontal lobe syndromes, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or parasagittal meningiomas. Incorrect Options: B. Bowel incontinence Although the paracentral lobule has some role in pelvic floor control, bowel continence is more complex and involves multiple regions, including the insula, anterior cingulate, and spinal pathways. Bowel incontinence is not as directly linked to this region as urinary incontinence. C. Paraesthesia peri-anally This symptom is more specific to cauda equina syndrome or sacral spinal cord lesions, not a cerebral lesion like the one shown. D. Gait apraxia Gait apraxia occurs due to damage to the frontal lobe (especially medial frontal cortex), corpus callosum, or subcortical structures, but it’s more associated with supplementary motor area or periventricular white matter lesions, not specifically the paracentral lobule.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Start IV thrombolysis This patient is showing acute onset of focal neurological deficit (left-sided facial weakness) suggestive of an ischemic stroke, and he presented within 1 hour of symptom onset, which is well within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolysis. Non-contrast CT is done to rule out hemorrhage, not to detect early infarction (which may not appear initially). Since CT is clear (i.e., no hemorrhage) and there are no contraindications (BP <185/110 mmHg is acceptable, and his is 160/110), the patient qualifies for IV thrombolysis, typically with rTPA (alteplase) or tenecteplase. Early thrombolysis improves outcomes by restoring perfusion to ischemic brain tissue. Incorrect Options: B) Aspirin and clopidogrel Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated in minor stroke or high-risk TIA, not in patients who are candidates for thrombolysis. Giving antiplatelets before thrombolysis increases the risk of hemorrhage. C) Manage blood pressure The BP of 160/110 mmHg is within the acceptable range for thrombolysis (<185/110 mmHg). Lowering BP at this point may reduce cerebral perfusion. Thrombolysis should not be delayed just to manage BP in this case. D) No intervention as CT is normal A normal CT does not rule out ischemic stroke, especially early on. Doing nothing would miss the critical window for thrombolysis and allow further brain damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Crossed hemiplegia Crossed hemiplegia refers to a neurological pattern where there is: Ipsilateral cranial nerve palsy (e.g., facial or oculomotor weakness), and Contralateral hemiparesis of the limbs. This occurs due to brainstem lesions, especially involving the midbrain, pons, or medulla, where cranial nerve nuclei and descending corticospinal tracts are both located in close proximity. The spinal cord, however, does not contain cranial nerve nuclei, and thus cannot produce crossed hemiplegia. Therefore, this presentation is not associated with spinal cord pathology. Incorrect Options: B) Bladder involvement Spinal cord lesions, especially in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions, can disrupt descending control over the bladder, leading to urinary retention, urgency, or incontinence. Hence, this is a common feature of spinal cord pathology. C) LMN and UMN both lesions A spinal cord lesion can affect: Lower motor neurons (LMNs) at the level of the lesion (anterior horn cells), and Upper motor neurons (UMNs) below the level of the lesion (corticospinal tract disruption). So, a combination of LMN signs at the level and UMN signs below the level is characteristic of spinal cord involvement. D) Sensory loss at a specific level A dermatomal level of sensory loss is a classic sign of spinal cord lesion and helps localize the level of pathology. It results from damage to the ascending sensory tracts (spinothalamic, dorsal columns) or dorsal roots.",

It leads to a distinct pattern of neurological deficits due to disruption of specific tracts: Ipsilateral motor loss (due to corticospinal tract damage) Ipsilateral loss of touch, vibration, proprioception (due to dorsal column involvement) Contralateral loss of pain and temperature (due to crossing spinothalamic tract fibers) So, the statements that are false (i.e., exceptions) are: Complete section of spinal cord → Incorrect: Brown-Séquard involves hemisection, not complete transection. Ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature → Incorrect: Pain and temperature are lost contralaterally, not ipsilaterally. No motor loss → Incorrect: There is motor loss ipsilaterally due to corticospinal tract involvement. Hence, options 1, 2, and 4 are not true, making Option A the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B) 1, 2, 3 Statement 3 (Ipsilateral loss of touch and vibration) is true in Brown-Séquard syndrome, because the dorsal columns (which carry touch, vibration, proprioception) ascend ipsilaterally.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) All patients with neurological impairment will show macrocytosis. While macrocytosis (increased MCV) is a classic hematologic feature of vitamin B12 deficiency, not all patients with neurological manifestations of SACD will have macrocytosis. In fact, neurological symptoms can precede hematologic findings like macrocytic anemia. This makes relying solely on blood counts misleading in some patients. Hence, statement B is false, making it the correct answer to an “EXCEPT” question. Incorrect Options: A) Dorsal & lateral column are involved - True SACD is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and primarily affects the dorsal columns (responsible for vibration and proprioception) and lateral corticospinal tracts (responsible for motor control), leading to sensory ataxia and spastic paresis. C) Vitamin B12 improves condition - True Early diagnosis and vitamin B12 supplementation can halt disease progression and lead to partial or full neurological recovery, especially if treated before irreversible damage. D) Copper deficiency produces similar symptoms- True Copper deficiency mimics SACD clinically and radiologically, with similar involvement of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts. It's important to differentiate the two via serum levels, as management differs.",

It works by inhibiting T-type calcium channels in thalamic neurons, which are involved in the generation of 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges seen in absence seizures. C) Lamotrigine – Effective against absence seizures, although not typically first-line. It can be used as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, especially when ethosuximide or valproate are not suitable. D) Valproate – Also considered first-line and particularly effective when absence seizures co-exist with other generalized seizure types (e.g., tonic-clonic). It has broad-spectrum antiepileptic activity, making it a preferred choice in mixed seizure syndromes. Incorrect Options: B) Carbamazepine – Contraindicated in absence seizures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Steroids to be started before antiparasitic drugs. This is a classic case of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic CNS infection caused by Taenia solium larvae. CT findings of cystic lesions with scolex and perilesional edema confirm the diagnosis. When antiparasitic therapy (like albendazole or praziquantel) is initiated, it leads to death of the larval cysts, which in turn causes a robust inflammatory response and can worsen cerebral edema and seizures. Therefore, steroids (e.g., dexamethasone or prednisolone) are started before antiparasitic drugs to reduce inflammation and control perilesional edema. This pre-treatment helps in minimizing complications during larval destruction. Incorrect Options : A) Antiparasitic drug to be started before steroid This is not advisable, as it can worsen inflammation and symptoms due to sudden antigen release from dying parasites. C) Only antiepileptics to be given Antiepileptics are essential for seizure control, but they do not treat the underlying parasitic infection. Antiparasitic therapy is also needed, especially when scolex is visible (viable cyst stage), indicating a treatable infection. D) Steroids to be given only after stopping antiepileptics There is no such protocol. Antiepileptics and steroids can and should be co-administered as they address different components of the disease (seizure vs inflammation).",

Phenytoin (an anticonvulsant) can worsen muscle weakness in MG by affecting neuromuscular junction function. Lignocaine (local anesthetic) can interfere with neuromuscular transmission and cause transient worsening of muscle weakness in MG patients. Both drugs can reduce the efficiency of acetylcholine signaling, thus aggravating MG. Incorrect Responses: Digene is an antacid and has no effect on neuromuscular transmission or MG symptoms.

Clinically, this manifests as weight gain, lethargy, cold intolerance, and other hypothyroid symptoms. Incorrect Options : A) Graves’ disease Graves’ disease causes hyperthyroidism, characterized by low TSH (due to negative feedback) and high T4, opposite of the patient’s findings.

Systolic BP > 140 (B) is a risk factor. Duration 5 minutes (C) is less than 10 minutes, so it scores 0, not a high-risk factor. Diabetes (D) is a risk factor. Hence, only B and D are correct in indicating a higher risk for stroke. Incorrect Options: A (Age < 60) is incorrect because risk increases with age ≥ 60. C (Duration 5 minutes) is too short to be considered high risk. Duration ≥ 10 minutes is significant.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Right posterior parietal cortex Right posterior parietal cortex lesion causes left hemispatial neglect, a classic neurobehavioral syndrome. Patients with this condition ignore or are unaware of stimuli on the left side, despite having intact vision. Common signs include: Shaving only the right side of the face Drawing only the right side of an object (e.g., clock, flower) Eating only from the right side of the plate Failing to respond to people or objects on the left This phenomenon is due to the right parietal lobe's dominant role in spatial attention, especially for both left and right visual fields, while the left parietal lobe primarily attends to the right field only. So, a right-sided lesion leads to neglect of the left side. Incorrect Options: B) Left parietal cortex A left parietal lesion may cause language deficits (in a left-dominant brain) or right-sided neglect (rare), but not left-sided neglect, which is more severe and typically associated with right parietal lesions. C) Right temporal cortex The temporal lobe is more associated with auditory processing and memory.

Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, which is a major complication of thrombolysis. Therefore, blood pressure must be lowered to ≤185/110 mmHg before initiating thrombolytic therapy. If BP cannot be controlled to this level, thrombolysis is withheld. Incorrect Options: A) Age > 18 yrs This is not a contraindication; in fact, age ≥18 years is a criterion for thrombolysis eligibility. B) Presenting within 3 hours This is the ideal window for IV thrombolysis. Up to 4.5 hours may be considered in selected patients, but within 3 hours is optimal, not a contraindication. D) MCA edema MCA (middle cerebral artery) edema may be a consequence of a large infarct, but edema alone is not an absolute contraindication.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Subthalamus Hemiballismus is a rare hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by violent, flinging, involuntary movements of the limbs, typically on one side of the body. The classic site of lesion responsible for hemiballismus is the contralateral subthalamic nucleus (of Luys), a part of the basal ganglia circuitry. The subthalamic nucleus normally inhibits movement by exciting the internal globus pallidus, which in turn inhibits the thalamus. When the subthalamic nucleus is damaged (commonly by a small lacunar stroke), this inhibitory control is lost, resulting in excessive, involuntary motor activity—i.e., hemiballismus. Incorrect Options: B) Globus pallidus Lesions here can cause other movement disorders, such as dystonia or Parkinsonism-like symptoms, but not typically hemiballismus. C) Caudate Damage to the caudate nucleus is associated more with cognitive and behavioral disturbances (e.g., in Huntington's disease), not hemiballismus. D) Putamen Involvement of the putamen may cause chorea or dystonia, but not the classical flinging movements of hemiballismus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aspirin + Clopidogrel + LMWH In Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), the standard treatment includes antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants to prevent further thrombus formation and reduce the risk of progression to full-thickness infarction. The recommended management includes: Aspirin: Irreversibly inhibits COX-1 in platelets, reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel: A P2Y12 receptor antagonist that works synergistically with aspirin to further inhibit platelet aggregation. LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin): An anticoagulant that inhibits clot formation by enhancing antithrombin III activity. It's commonly used in NSTEMI to prevent propagation of the thrombus. Therefore, the combination of aspirin + clopidogrel + LMWH is standard evidence-based management for NSTEMI and provides the best balance of antithrombotic protection. Incorrect Options: A) Aspirin While essential, aspirin alone is not sufficient in the management of NSTEMI. Dual antiplatelet therapy is more effective. B) Aspirin + Clopidogrel This is an important combination (dual antiplatelet therapy), but without anticoagulation (like LMWH), it's incomplete management for NSTEMI. D) Thrombolytics Thrombolytic therapy is not indicated in NSTEMI. It is reserved for ST-elevation MI (STEMI).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rheumatoid arthritis The presentation of symmetrical joint pains with morning stiffness especially involving small joints such as the hands and ankles in a 40-year-old female is highly characteristic of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthritis that: Affects women more commonly. Typically presents in the third to fifth decade of life. Causes symmetrical joint involvement, especially of the MCP, PIP joints, wrists, and ankles. Morning stiffness >30 minutes is a classic symptom due to synovial inflammation. Incorrect Options: A) Gout (Asymmetrical) Gout usually presents as acute, monoarticular, asymmetrical arthritis, often affecting the first MTP joint (podagra). It’s rarely symmetrical and typically affects men more than women. B) Osteoarthritis OA is more mechanical and degenerative in nature. It usually: Affects older individuals (>50 years), Causes asymmetrical joint pain, Morning stiffness is brief (<30 minutes), Commonly involves weight-bearing joints and DIP joints, sparing MCPs. C) Psoriatic arthritis Can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, but: Often associated with skin psoriasis, Has features like dactylitis (sausage digits) and nail changes, May involve axial skeleton. The absence of skin lesions or typical features makes RA more likely in this case.",

(normal: 35–45 mmHg) HCO?? = 28 mmol/L → ↑ Elevated bicarbonate (normal: 22–26 mmol/L) These findings are consistent with primary respiratory acidosis. Here's why: The low pH indicates an acidic state. The very high PaCO? is the primary driver of acidosis → indicates hypoventilation, a hallmark of respiratory acidosis. The HCO?? is elevated, showing that metabolic compensation has started but has not normalized the pH, meaning the body is partially compensating. Since pH is still <7.35, it is not fully compensated. Incorrect Options: B) Fully compensated 7.35 Incorrect because the pH is 7.28, not within the normal range (7.35–7.45). In full compensation, pH would be normalized. C) Partially compensated 17.35 Incorrect due to the incorrect pH reference (17.35 is non-physiological) and confusion in terminology. Also, this pH is not even close to any realistic value. D) Uncompensated Incorrect because HCO?? is elevated, showing that the kidneys have started compensating, so it is not uncompensated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 5-ASA (5-Aminosalicylic acid). In a patient with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis—such as one presenting with 3 episodes of bloody stools per day—5-ASA (mesalamine) is considered the first-line treatment. It is an anti-inflammatory drug that acts topically on the colonic mucosa and is highly effective in inducing and maintaining remission in mild to moderate disease. Depending on the extent of the disease (proctitis, left-sided, or extensive), it may be given orally, rectally, or in combination. Incorrect Options: B) Budesonide Budesonide is a corticosteroid with high first-pass metabolism and fewer systemic side effects. However, it is generally used in Crohn’s disease, particularly for ileocecal involvement, rather than in ulcerative colitis. It is not the first-line agent for UC with mild symptoms. C) Prednisolone Prednisolone is a systemic corticosteroid used in moderate to severe UC or when the patient fails to respond to 5-ASA therapy. In this case, with only 3 episodes of bloody stools/day, the disease is mild, so systemic steroids are not immediately indicated. D) Azathioprine Azathioprine is an immunomodulator used mainly for maintenance therapy or in steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory disease. It is not used for induction of remission, especially not in mild cases, due to its slow onset of action.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Empagliflozin. Empagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor that has shown significant cardiovascular benefits, particularly in reducing hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial demonstrated that empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure. Based on this evidence, empagliflozin has been approved not only for glycemic control but also for use in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), even in those without diabetes. Incorrect Options: A) Linagliptin Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, and while it is weight neutral and has a low risk of hypoglycemia, it has not demonstrated a clear benefit in reducing heart failure hospitalizations. Some other drugs in this class (like saxagliptin) have even been associated with increased risk of heart failure. B) Repaglinide Repaglinide is a meglitinide class drug that increases insulin secretion. It has no proven cardiovascular benefits and is not recommended in patients with heart failure due to the risk of hypoglycemia and lack of outcome data. D) Bromocriptine Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist approved for glycemic control in diabetes, but it lacks evidence for benefit in heart failure and is not approved for this indication.",

The serological profile shows: HBsAg-negative (no active hepatitis B virus surface antigen), Anti-HBc positive (indicates exposure to hepatitis B virus core antigen), HBeAg-negative (no active viral replication), Anti-HBs negative (no detectable surface antibody). This profile is most consistent with a past infection. It reflects someone who has been exposed to the virus in the past (anti-HBc positive), but the virus is no longer actively replicating (HBsAg negative, HBeAg negative), and for some reason, the anti-HBs antibody is not detectable, which can occur in some resolved infections. Incorrect Options: A) Window period In the window period, HBsAg has disappeared but anti-HBs has not yet appeared. During this time, anti-HBc IgM would be positive. Since this question does not specify the IgM subtype, and given other markers, window period cannot be confirmed from this profile. C) Chronic infection, inactive carrier An inactive carrier would still be HBsAg positive, indicating the virus is present. In this case, the patient is HBsAg negative, ruling out chronic infection or carrier state. D) Post vaccinated A vaccinated individual would be positive for anti-HBs only, and negative for anti-HBc, since the vaccine contains only surface antigen. Here, anti-HBc is positive, ruling out vaccination as the cause.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IV fluids followed by insulin In Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), the first priority is fluid resuscitation, not insulin. This is because patients are often significantly dehydrated due to osmotic diuresis caused by hyperglycemia. Step-by-step rationale: IV fluids are started first to restore intravascular volume, improve renal perfusion, and reduce counter-regulatory stress hormones. This initial step also helps lower blood glucose levels even before insulin is given. After initial fluid resuscitation, insulin (usually IV regular insulin) is administered to stop ketogenesis, reduce blood glucose, and correct acidosis. In this case: pH = 7.2 (acidotic) Blood glucose = 400 mg/dL Classic presentation of DKA Incorrect Options: A) Insulin followed by IV fluids Insulin should not be started first, because without fluid resuscitation, insulin may worsen hypovolemia and cause cardiovascular collapse. C) Insulin SC In moderate to severe DKA, IV insulin is the preferred route for fast onset and titration. Subcutaneous insulin is used only in very mild cases or under specific protocols, often in outpatient settings. D) Incomplete/Invalid option",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Nelson syndrome Nelson syndrome occurs as a complication after bilateral adrenalectomy, typically performed for Cushing's disease. Once the adrenal glands are removed, there is a loss of negative feedback on the pituitary gland, leading to increased ACTH production by a pituitary corticotroph adenoma. The excess ACTH stimulates melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) due to a shared precursor (POMC), causing hyperpigmentation, often seen in fingers, oral mucosa, or skin folds. Incorrect Options: A) Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) This condition is due to excess aldosterone, not ACTH. It presents with hypertension and hypokalemia, not hyperpigmentation. B) Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) While Addison’s can cause hyperpigmentation, it's not typically seen post-bilateral adrenalectomy (unless the term was used loosely). Also, Addison’s is a primary adrenal failure, not a post-surgical complication.",

Key features of third-degree AV block on ECG: Regular P waves at their own rate. Regular QRS complexes at a slower rate, not related to the P waves. Atrioventricular dissociation – no correlation between P waves and QRS complexes. The QRS complexes may be narrow (if the escape rhythm is junctional) or broad (if ventricular).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Carvedilol Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is associated with neurohormonal activation that contributes to adverse cardiac remodeling and increased mortality. Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker with additional alpha-blocking properties, is proven to reduce mortality, improve symptoms, slow progression, and reverse remodeling in HFrEF patients. It reduces sympathetic overactivity, decreases heart rate, reduces myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevents progressive ventricular dilation. Multiple large-scale trials (e.g., COPERNICUS, COMET) have established its mortality benefit in HFrEF. Hence, carvedilol is a key drug in guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF. Incorrect Options: A. Furosemide Furosemide is a loop diuretic used for symptomatic relief in heart failure by reducing preload and alleviating congestion. However, it has no mortality benefit or effect on cardiac remodeling. Its role is limited to improving dyspnea and fluid overload. B. Digoxin Digoxin improves symptoms and reduces hospitalizations in HFrEF but does not reduce mortality or significantly affect remodeling. It increases inotropy and helps in rate control for atrial fibrillation, but its impact on long-term outcomes is limited. D. Captopril Although ACE inhibitors like captopril do reduce mortality and prevent remodeling in HFrEF, in this specific question, carvedilol is considered superior based on the phrasing about both mortality and remodeling. Also, captopril is less commonly used now compared to other ACE inhibitors or ARBs with better dosing schedules and tolerability. Thus, while captopril is beneficial, carvedilol has broader and more robust evidence for both mortality and remodeling benefits.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) C. TSH The best initial screening test for suspected thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism is serum TSH. TSH is highly sensitive to changes in thyroid hormone levels due to negative feedback. In most cases of thyrotoxicosis, TSH is suppressed (often below the detection limit), making it an excellent first-line test. If TSH is low, further testing with Free T4 and/or Free T3 helps confirm and categorize the type of thyrotoxicosis. Incorrect Options: A. Free T3 Free T3 is elevated in thyrotoxicosis, especially in T3 toxicosis, but it is not the best initial test. It should be done after TSH is found to be low to confirm and characterize the thyroid hormone excess. B. USG Thyroid Ultrasound is useful for evaluating structural abnormalities like nodules or goiter but not helpful as an initial test for thyrotoxicosis, which is a functional disorder. It is used later in workup if nodular disease is suspected. D. Anti-TPO Anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO) antibodies are markers of autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto's), which typically causes hypothyroidism, not thyrotoxicosis.

On microscopy, the hallmark is broad, ribbon-like aseptate (or sparsely septate) hyphae with right-angle branching. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is the most common presentation, especially with nasal discharge, facial pain, and orbital symptoms. Incorrect Options: B. Aspergillus Aspergillus species show septate hyphae with acute angle (45°) branching on fungal stain. It does not show aseptate hyphae and is less commonly associated with nasal involvement in post-COVID patients. C. Cryptococcus Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast, not a mold, and does not form hyphae in tissue. It typically presents as meningitis in immunocompromised patients and is identified with India ink stain, showing encapsulated yeasts. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Iron deficiency Iron deficiency is the most common cause of decreased transferrin saturation. Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds and transports iron in the blood. In iron deficiency, serum iron levels decrease due to depleted body iron stores. However, the liver compensatorily increases the production of transferrin to try and bind any available iron. This combination of low serum iron and elevated transferrin leads to a reduction in transferrin saturation, which is calculated as (serum iron / total iron-binding capacity) × 100. A transferrin saturation of less than 15% is a key biochemical marker of iron deficiency and helps differentiate it from other anemias. Incorrect Oprtions: Option A: Pernicious anemia Pernicious anemia results from vitamin B12 deficiency, typically due to intrinsic factor deficiency. It does not involve iron metabolism directly. Transferrin saturation is often normal or increased due to ineffective erythropoiesis, where iron is not effectively utilized. Option C: Hemosiderosis Hemosiderosis refers to accumulation of excess iron in tissues, usually due to multiple blood transfusions or chronic hemolysis. Since serum iron is elevated in this condition, transferrin saturation is usually increased, not decreased. Option D: Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is a hereditary condition causing increased intestinal absorption of iron, leading to iron overload. Serum iron and transferrin saturation are both elevated, often with transferrin saturation above 60% in men and 50% in women.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Megaloblastic anemia The most likely cause of anemia in this patient is megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by macrocytic anemia (MCV >100 fL) and often presents with fatigue and pallor. A key clue in this case is that the patient is a vegetarian, placing her at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, since B12 is primarily obtained from animal products. Vitamin B12 (and folate) deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, leading to delayed nuclear maturation, large immature red cells (macrocytes), and elevated MCV. The combination of macrocytosis (MCV 110 fL), anemia (Hb 9 g/dL), and dietary history strongly supports megaloblastic anemia, most likely due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Incorrect Options: Option A: Iron deficiency Iron deficiency typically causes a microcytic anemia (MCV <80 fL). It may occur in vegetarians due to reduced heme iron intake, but it would not explain the elevated MCV seen here. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the lab findings. Option C: Sideroblastic anemia Sideroblastic anemia may cause a dimorphic blood picture (both microcytic and normocytic/macrocytic cells), but it is rare and not specifically associated with vegetarianism. Also, it is more commonly related to alcohol use, lead poisoning, or certain drugs—not dietary B12 deficiency. Option D: Sickle cell anemia Sickle cell anemia is a normocytic or slightly macrocytic hemolytic anemia due to a genetic mutation in hemoglobin. It typically presents earlier in life and is more common in individuals of African descent. The age and dietary risk factors in this case do not support this diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning both males and females can be affected and transmit the disorder to their children. It is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding such as epistaxis, menorrhagia, easy bruising, and prolonged bleeding after minor injuries. The fact that both the father and sister are affected, and the patient herself is symptomatic, supports an autosomal dominant inheritance—a hallmark of VWD. Moreover, females being affected rules out classic X-linked disorders (like Hemophilia A or B), making VWD the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option B: Hemophilia A Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, primarily affecting males. Females are usually carriers, not symptomatic, unless they are homozygous or have skewed X-inactivation—rare situations. The involvement of both a female (sister) and the father is unusual for classic Hemophilia A inheritance. Option C: Christmas Disease Also known as Hemophilia B, Christmas disease is another X-linked recessive disorder affecting Factor IX. Like Hemophilia A, it primarily affects males, making this diagnosis unlikely in a symptomatic female with an affected sister. Option D: Factor XI deficiency Factor XI deficiency (Hemophilia C) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Since it is recessive, both parents would need to be carriers, and family history typically shows horizontal transmission (siblings), not vertical (parent to child).

It is preferred in diabetic patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) because it not only improves glycemic control but also significantly reduces hospitalization for heart failure, progression of renal disease, and cardiovascular mortality. Empagliflozin retains its benefits even in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥20–25 mL/min/1.73 m², depending on guidelines), making it the drug of choice in patients with both heart failure and renal failure. Incorrect Options: Option A: Linagliptin Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor and is considered safe in renal impairment, as it is not renally excreted. However, it does not provide cardiovascular or heart failure-specific benefits, so it's not preferred over SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure. Option B: Pioglitazone Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that can worsen heart failure by causing fluid retention and weight gain, especially in patients with existing cardiac dysfunction. It is contraindicated in patients with NYHA class III–IV heart failure. Option D: Liraglutide Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that does have cardiovascular benefits, especially in reducing atherosclerotic events.

It works by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and modulating nerve pain. Clinical studies have shown it to be effective in reducing neuropathic pain, improving sleep quality, and enhancing quality of life in diabetic patients. It is generally well tolerated and has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, making it suitable even in elderly patients or those with renal impairment (with dose adjustment). Incorrect Options: Option B: Benzodiazepine Benzodiazepines are anxiolytics and sedatives, not primarily used for neuropathic pain. They do not target the pathophysiological mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy and are not recommended due to the risk of dependence and sedation. Option C: Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is used mainly in trigeminal neuralgia and seizure disorders. While it is an anticonvulsant that modulates sodium channels, it is not a first-line choice for diabetic neuropathy. It has more side effects and drug interactions compared to pregabalin. Option D: Amitriptyline Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be effective in neuropathic pain. However, due to its anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, urinary retention, orthostatic hypotension), it is generally less preferred, especially in elderly patients or those with cardiac risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aspirin Aspirin is avoided in thyroid storm because it can displace thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) from their binding proteins, leading to a rise in free (active) thyroid hormone levels, which may worsen the thyrotoxic state. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism characterized by fever, tachycardia, delirium, and multiorgan dysfunction. Therefore, medications that can increase free thyroid hormone levels are strictly contraindicated, making aspirin inappropriate for use in this setting. Incorrect Options: Option A: Propranolol Propranolol is actually one of the mainstays of treatment in thyroid storm. It is a non-selective beta-blocker that helps control tachycardia, tremors, and anxiety, and at high doses, it also reduces peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, providing additional benefit. Option B: Lugol's iodine Lugol’s iodine is used after giving antithyroid drugs like PTU to inhibit thyroid hormone release (via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect). It should be given at least one hour after PTU to prevent iodine from being used in new hormone synthesis. It helps reduce circulating thyroid hormones quickly. Option C: PTU (Propylthiouracil) PTU is preferred in thyroid storm because it inhibits both thyroid hormone synthesis and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. It is more effective in acute management compared to methimazole for this reason.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fidaxomicin Pseudomembranous colitis is most commonly caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) overgrowth, often triggered by antibiotic use, such as ampicillin, clindamycin, or cephalosporins. The preferred treatment for moderate to severe or recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI) is now fidaxomicin, a macrocyclic antibiotic that inhibits RNA polymerase and selectively targets C. difficile with minimal impact on normal gut flora. It is associated with lower recurrence rates compared to other antibiotics, making it the first-line therapy in many clinical guidelines. Incorrect Options: Option A: Fluoroquinolone Fluoroquinolones are not used to treat C. difficile infection. In fact, they are among the antibiotics that can precipitate CDI, and using them can worsen the condition. Option C: Novobiocin Novobiocin is an older antibiotic that is not used for treating CDI. It has limited clinical use and is primarily of historical interest, especially in identifying Staphylococcus saprophyticus in labs (which is novobiocin-resistant). Option D: Metronidazole Metronidazole was previously used as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate C. difficile infection, but current guidelines recommend it only if fidaxomicin or vancomycin is not available. It is now considered less effective, particularly in severe or recurrent cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hydrocortisone The patient is showing signs of acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis), which can occur when glucocorticoids are abruptly withdrawn after chronic use. Symptoms include hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia, due to the sudden drop in cortisol and aldosterone levels. The treatment of choice is immediate IV hydrocortisone, which has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity, crucial for correcting electrolyte imbalances and supporting blood pressure. Prompt administration is life-saving and reverses the adrenal crisis. Incorrect Options: Option A: IV fluid While IV fluids (typically normal saline) are supportive therapy and help correct hypotension and hyponatremia, they do not replace the missing steroid hormones. Fluids alone are not sufficient without corticosteroid replacement. Option C: Insulin Insulin is used to lower potassium levels, but hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency is due to aldosterone deficiency, not insulin lack. Moreover, insulin does not treat the underlying hormonal crisis. It's not the first-line therapy here. Option D: Sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate can temporarily shift potassium into cells, but like insulin, it only treats the symptom (hyperkalemia) and not the root cause.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Eplerenone Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone antagonist, which can be used in cirrhotic patients with ascites to mobilize excess fluid. In cirrhosis, secondary hyperaldosteronism leads to sodium and water retention. Aldosterone antagonists, like eplerenone (or spironolactone), directly counteract this mechanism. Eplerenone is better tolerated than spironolactone due to fewer anti-androgenic side effects (like gynecomastia), making it a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot tolerate spironolactone. It helps mobilize ascitic fluid effectively when used appropriately, often in combination with loop diuretics like furosemide. Incorrect Options: Option A: Triamterene Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, but it is less effective than aldosterone antagonists in ascites due to cirrhosis. It doesn't counteract aldosterone directly, and its diuretic effect is weaker. Option C: Furosemide Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is commonly used in combination with aldosterone antagonists for ascites management but is not effective as monotherapy in cirrhosis because it does not target the aldosterone-driven sodium retention. Also, it may cause hypokalemia and worsen renal function if used alone. Option D: Thiazide Thiazide diuretics are not preferred in cirrhosis with ascites as they have limited natriuretic effect in this setting and increase the risk of hyponatremia and electrolyte disturbances.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Stop pyrazinamide Pyrazinamide, a first-line anti-tubercular drug, is known to cause hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis due to its effect on renal uric acid excretion. It inhibits tubular secretion of uric acid, leading to elevated serum uric acid levels and joint pain, especially in predisposed individuals. In patients who develop clinically significant arthralgia or gout, the recommended management is to stop pyrazinamide, as continuing it may worsen the symptoms. Since pyrazinamide is typically used only during the intensive phase of ATT (first 2 months), stopping it after this phase has limited impact on the overall treatment efficacy. Incorrect Options: Option B: Add anti-uric medicine and continue pyrazinamide Although uric acid–lowering agents like allopurinol can reduce serum uric acid, they are not first-line management in drug-induced hyperuricemia from pyrazinamide. Treating the side effect while continuing the offending drug is not preferred, especially when alternative treatment regimens are available. Option C: Stop other ATT Other first-line drugs (like isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol) are not typically associated with hyperuricemia. Stopping them would compromise TB treatment and is not justified unless another clear side effect points to their involvement. Option D: Continue full ATT and reassure patient This is inappropriate if the patient has symptomatic hyperuricemia. Reassurance alone is insufficient when the adverse effect is causing significant discomfort or risk of gouty complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgM anti dengue Ab This test is not useful in the first few days of dengue illness. IgM antibodies typically appear after 4–5 days of fever onset, as part of the body’s adaptive immune response. In the early febrile phase (first 3 days), the viral load is high, but the antibody response is not yet detectable. Hence, performing an IgM test on day 2 of illness is likely to yield a false negative, making it an inappropriate diagnostic choice at this time. Therefore, among the given options, IgM antibody testing should not be used for diagnosis in this early stage. Incorrect Options: A. NS1 Ag NS1 antigen is a non-structural protein secreted by the dengue virus and can be detected in the first 1–5 days of illness. It is a reliable and rapid diagnostic marker in the early febrile phase, making it appropriate for this patient who is on day 2 of symptoms. C. Viral culture isolation Although rarely done in clinical practice due to being time-consuming and requiring specialized labs, viral culture can detect the virus in the early phase of illness. It is theoretically valid during the viremic period (first 5 days), so it remains a possible diagnostic test. D. PCR RT-PCR detects viral RNA and is considered a gold standard test during the early phase (day 1 to day 5) of dengue infection. It is highly sensitive and specific for confirming dengue virus in the bloodstream and is appropriate for early diagnosis in this case.",

A marked elevation in ALT (alanine aminotransferase)—typically >1000 IU/L—is considered a marker of severe dengue, indicating severe hepatic involvement. According to the WHO classification, severe organ impairment is one of the defining features of severe dengue, alongside severe plasma leakage and severe bleeding. When liver enzymes are extremely elevated, it reflects significant hepatic injury, which may progress to liver failure and warrants intensive monitoring and care. Incorrect Options: A. Persistent vomiting While persistent vomiting is a warning sign of potential progression to severe dengue, it is not itself a marker of severity. It indicates that the patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening, but does not confirm severe disease by WHO criteria. B. Hepatomegaly > 1 cm Mild hepatomegaly (>1 cm) is a common finding in dengue but is also considered a warning sign, not a marker of severity. Significant liver enlargement or tenderness, especially with elevated enzymes, may raise concern, but >1 cm alone is not sufficient to define severe dengue.",

Ebstein anomaly is more commonly associated with congenital heart diseases and lithium exposure during pregnancy, not with syndromic tumor predisposition like Carney complex. Incorrect Options: A.

Incorrect Options: A. Medullary carcinoma of thyroid Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a core component of both MEN 2A and MEN 2B. It tends to occur at an early age in MEN 2B and is often aggressive, hence early prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended. B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD) ARVD is a genetic cardiomyopathy where the right ventricular myocardium is replaced by fibrofatty tissue, leading to arrhythmias. It often presents in young individuals (frequently athletes) with symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, and even sudden cardiac death during or after exercise. In the ECG shown, there is a T wave inversion in V1-V3 and an epsilon wave—a small positive deflection buried at the end of the QRS complex, best seen in V1. This is a hallmark of ARVD. The history of multiple episodes over 2 years in a young athlete strengthens the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A. Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) While HOCM is a common cause of exertional syncope or sudden death in young athletes, the ECG in HOCM typically shows left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), deep Q waves in lateral leads, and repolarization abnormalities. It does not show epsilon waves, which are specific to ARVD. C. Brugada Syndrome Brugada syndrome is another arrhythmogenic disorder seen in young individuals, often males. The typical ECG shows coved-type ST elevation in V1–V3 with or without RBBB pattern, which is not seen in this ECG. Also, Brugada syndrome is not commonly associated with exertion-triggered symptoms. D. Uni (Unilateral) Coronary Artery Anomaly Though anomalous coronary arteries can cause exertional syncope or sudden cardiac death, especially during intense activity, this condition does not present with characteristic ECG changes like epsilon waves. It is typically diagnosed with imaging (CT angiography) rather than ECG.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 30–59 ml/min. According to KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines, Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m². Stage 3 is further divided into: Stage 3a: GFR 45–59 ml/min Stage 3b: GFR 30–44 ml/min This stage indicates moderate reduction in kidney function, and patients often start to show early symptoms like fatigue, mild anemia, or electrolyte disturbances. Incorrect Options: A. 15–29 ml/min This GFR range corresponds to Stage 4 CKD, which indicates severe reduction in kidney function and often requires more intensive monitoring and preparation for renal replacement therapy. C. 60–89 ml/min This range corresponds to Stage 2 CKD, which is considered a mild reduction in GFR, usually with additional markers of kidney damage such as proteinuria or structural abnormalities. D. 90–120 ml/min This is considered normal or high GFR, consistent with Stage 1 CKD, provided there are other signs of kidney damage (like proteinuria). On its own, this GFR is typically normal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Diarrhoea. Diarrhoea typically causes a normal anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis, not a high anion gap acidosis. This occurs due to the loss of bicarbonate in the stool, which is compensated by an increase in chloride to maintain electroneutrality, thereby keeping the anion gap within normal limits. Incorrect Options: A. DKA Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) leads to accumulation of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate), which are unmeasured anions. This results in a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). B. Acute renal failure In acute or chronic renal failure, there is accumulation of uremic toxins and acids like sulfate, phosphate, and urate—leading to HAGMA due to reduced excretion of acid. D. Toxins Several toxins (e.g., methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates) produce organic acids that contribute to HAGMA. These are classic causes of high anion gap acidosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vitamin B12. This patient shows classical features of Vitamin B12 deficiency, including bilateral lower limb neuropathy and a positive Romberg sign (indicating impaired proprioception due to posterior column dysfunction). A history of gastrectomy strongly supports this diagnosis, as intrinsic factor, which is produced in the stomach and is essential for B12 absorption, is absent or reduced after surgery. Deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (posterior columns and corticospinal tracts), resulting in sensory ataxia, paresthesia, and spasticity. Incorrect Options: B. Folate While folate deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, it does not cause significant neurological symptoms like those seen with B12 deficiency. Romberg sign and peripheral neuropathy are not typically features of folate deficiency. C. Zinc Zinc deficiency can cause dermatitis, alopecia, and delayed wound healing, but it does not cause neuropathy or a positive Romberg sign. D. Thiamine Thiamine deficiency leads to Wernicke’s encephalopathy or beriberi, which can present with neuropathy, but is more commonly associated with ataxia, confusion, and ophthalmoplegia.

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC), particularly in patients who have not responded to or lost response to TNF-alpha blockers like infliximab or adalimumab. It works by blocking intracellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation, offering an alternative mechanism of action compared to biologics. It is especially valuable due to its oral route of administration and rapid onset of action. Incorrect Options: A. Ustekinumab Ustekinumab is an IL-12/23 inhibitor, used for moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, but it is not a JAK inhibitor. It’s another biologic, typically used after failure of anti-TNF and other agents, but not the correct choice for the question specifically asking for a JAK inhibitor. B. Etanercept Etanercept is a TNF-alpha inhibitor, but it is not effective in ulcerative colitis and is not approved for this indication. It is used in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. D.

It results from a point mutation in the Factor V gene that makes Factor V resistant to inactivation by activated Protein C, thereby increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This mutation is particularly common in individuals of European descent, with a heterozygous prevalence of about 5–7% in the general population. Incorrect Options: B. Protein S deficiency Protein S is a natural anticoagulant, and its deficiency increases the risk of thrombosis. However, it is much less common than Factor V Leiden as a hereditary cause of coagulopathy. C. Antithrombin III deficiency Antithrombin III deficiency is a rare but potent cause of hereditary thrombophilia. It impairs the inactivation of thrombin and other clotting factors, but its prevalence is far lower than Factor V Leiden. D. Protein C deficiency Protein C is another anticoagulant protein. While its deficiency also causes a hypercoagulable state, it is significantly less common than Factor V Leiden mutation and therefore not the most common genetic cause.",

In Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is a well-established and effective therapy, especially in patients with severe or refractory disease. It helps by removing circulating autoantibodies that are attacking peripheral nerves. In fact, plasmapheresis and IVIG are the two mainstays of GBS treatment, and plasmapheresis is used when there is no response or poor response to IVIG, or in rapidly progressive cases. Incorrect Options: B. IV Immunoglobulin are first line of treatment This is true. IVIG is one of the first-line therapies in GBS, equivalent in efficacy to plasmapheresis. It is preferred due to ease of administration and fewer complications. C. Areflexia in weaker arm is not included in criteria This is true. According to the NINDS diagnostic criteria, areflexia or hyporeflexia is a typical feature of GBS, but it must be present in at least weak limbs. Areflexia in a single limb (especially if not weak) alone is not diagnostic. D. Albumino-cytologic dissociation of CSF is present This is true. A hallmark CSF finding in GBS is albumino-cytologic dissociation, where there is elevated protein with normal or very few cells. This reflects demyelination without significant inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Increased hormone sensitive lipase and decreased lipoprotein lipase. In diabetes mellitus, especially if poorly controlled, there is insulin deficiency or resistance, which disrupts lipid metabolism in two key ways Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) becomes overactive due to lack of insulin inhibition. This enzyme breaks down stored triglycerides in adipose tissue, leading to increased free fatty acids (FFA) in the blood. The liver converts these FFAs into VLDL and triglycerides, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and elevated VLDL levels. Meanwhile, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which normally helps clear triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (like VLDL and chylomicrons), is downregulated in the absence of insulin, leading to reduced peripheral clearance of triglycerides. This combined effect explains the lipid abnormalities commonly seen in diabetics. Incorrect Options: A. Decreased HSL and LPL This would lead to reduced lipid mobilization and clearance, but would not explain the elevated VLDL and triglycerides seen in diabetes. B. Increased HSL and LPL While increased HSL might raise FFAs, increased LPL would help clear them, thus counteracting hypertriglyceridemia. C. Decreased HSL and increased LPL This pattern would lead to lower triglyceride synthesis and enhanced clearance, not the elevated levels described.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sulpha-pyrimethamine. While sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was historically used to treat malaria, especially Plasmodium falciparum, its use has significantly declined due to widespread resistance. It is no longer recommended as monotherapy or as part of first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in most national and WHO guidelines. Currently, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the preferred treatment, and SP may only be used in specific situations such as intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy (IPTp), not for active uncomplicated infections. Incorrect Options: A. Artemether Artemether is a key component of ACT (e.g., artemether-lumefantrine), which is the standard treatment for uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum. It is fast-acting and highly effective. C. Chloroquine Chloroquine is still used in areas where P. vivax or P. ovale is sensitive to it, and is part of the first-line regimen for chloroquine-sensitive malaria. D. Primaquine Primaquine is used to eradicate hypnozoites in the liver (in P. vivax and P. ovale) and prevent relapse. It is also given as a single low dose in falciparum malaria to reduce transmission.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thrombosis in large vessels. TTP is a microvascular thrombotic disorder characterized by widespread formation of small platelet-rich thrombi in the microcirculation due to deficiency of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. It does not involve large vessel thrombosis. Instead, the pathological process affects small arterioles and capillaries, causing organ ischemia, particularly in the brain and kidneys. So, large vessel thrombosis is not a feature of TTP and its presence should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. Incorrect Options: B. Thrombocytopenia This is a hallmark feature of TTP. It occurs due to the consumption of platelets in widespread microthrombi formation. C. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia This is a core component of TTP, seen as fragmented RBCs (schistocytes) on peripheral smear, elevated LDH, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. D. Renal failure While not as severe as in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), renal involvement can still occur in TTP due to microvascular thrombi affecting renal perfusion.",

The intention of this option appears to be a faulty statement — likely due to a typographical error (\"genital ulcers on are...\"), which makes it factually and linguistically incorrect. In reality, genital ulcers are indeed a common and characteristic feature of Behçet’s disease, typically painful and recurrent, and often heal with scarring — unlike oral ulcers. Correct Statements: A. Pathergy test is done under the ISG criteria True. The Pathergy test, which assesses skin hyperreactivity to minor trauma (like a needle prick), is a supportive diagnostic tool included in the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for Behçet’s disease. B. Intestinal manifestations resemble those of Crohn's disease True. Behçet’s disease can cause ulcerative lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the ileocecal region, which can mimic Crohn’s disease both clinically and endoscopically. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism is not a feature of APS-1; instead, hypoparathyroidism is one of its hallmark components. APS-1 (also known as Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy, or APECED) is a rare monogenic autoimmune disorder caused by mutations in the AIRE gene. It leads to immune system failure in recognizing self-antigens, resulting in multiple autoimmune conditions. The classic triad of APS-1 includes: Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis Hypoparathyroidism Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) Hence, hyperparathyroidism is opposite to what is typically seen in APS-1, making it the incorrect feature. Incorrect Options: A. Mucocutaneous candidiasis This is often the first presenting feature in childhood and part of the classical triad of APS-1. It results from immune dysfunction affecting fungal clearance. B. Onset in infancy True. APS-1 typically presents in early childhood, often within the first decade of life, making early onset a key diagnostic clue. C. Type 1 Diabetes mellitus While not part of the classic triad, Type 1 Diabetes can occur in APS-1 as part of its broader autoimmune spectrum. It's more typical in APS-2, but still possible in APS-1.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) D. HLA-DQ6/DQ11 are genetic markers associated with the disease: This statement is incorrect. The genetic markers associated with celiac disease are HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, not HLA-DQ6 or DQ11. Nearly 95% of celiac patients have HLA-DQ2, and most of the remaining have HLA-DQ8. These markers are essential for antigen presentation of gluten-derived peptides, triggering the autoimmune response seen in celiac disease. HLA-DQ6 and DQ11 are not associated with celiac disease and their presence essentially rules it out in most cases. Correct Options: A. Anti-IgA tissue transglutaminase (TTG) is a key diagnostic marker Yes. Anti-TTG IgA antibodies are the most sensitive and specific serologic marker for diagnosing celiac disease. If IgA deficiency is present, IgG-based assays are used. B. Modified Marsh criteria is used for histological classification True. The Modified Marsh criteria classify the histopathological changes in the small intestine mucosa in celiac disease, ranging from increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Marsh I) to complete villous atrophy (Marsh III). C. Anti-IgA gliadin antibodies are highly specific for celiac disease Anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies are now preferred over older anti-native gliadin antibodies, which had lower specificity. However, the statement refers to IgA class, and deamidated forms are reasonably specific, especially in young children or when anti-TTG is negative.",

Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended in older adults who are at risk, such as those with chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), healthcare exposure, or liver disease. Given increased vulnerability in older adults, vaccination may still be indicated. B. Varicella zoster The zoster (shingles) vaccine is strongly recommended for all adults ≥50 years, especially those ≥65 years, to prevent shingles and postherpetic neuralgia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reduce SBP to <140 mmHg in spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and very high systolic blood pressure (SBP >180-200 mmHg), aggressive lowering of BP to <140 mmHg has not shown significant improvement in outcomes and may risk hypoperfusion. Current guidelines (e.g., AHA/ASA) recommend reducing SBP to 140–160 mmHg but not lower than 140. Overly aggressive lowering (to <140) may increase the risk of cerebral ischemia, particularly in the acute phase. Incorrect Options: A. Checking blood pressure multiple times before administering antihypertensives This is standard protocol to confirm persistently elevated BP, rule out spurious readings, and assess for fluctuations before initiating aggressive BP control. C. Reduce SBP to <160 mmHg before acute reperfusion therapy in ischemic stroke Before administering IV thrombolysis (e.g., alteplase) in ischemic stroke, SBP should be brought down to <185/110 mmHg, and ideally <160 mmHg in some protocols to reduce bleeding risk. D. Avoid rapid reduction in blood pressure using antihypertensive medication Rapid or excessive BP reduction in stroke can worsen cerebral ischemia.

For serum calcium estimation, plain or serum separator tubes (without anticoagulants) should be used. This should be avoided. (b) Forearm exercise and fist clenching – Avoid: Muscle activity during venipuncture (like repeatedly clenching the fist) can lead to extracellular potassium and phosphate release, and may cause pseudohypercalcemia due to hemoconcentration or pH shifts. This should also be avoided. (c) Prolonged immobilization of the patient – Avoid: Immobilization (especially prolonged) can cause bone resorption, leading to increased serum calcium levels, particularly in hospitalized or bedridden patients. This too is a factor that should be avoided or accounted for. Incorrect Option (d) Rapid removal of tourniquet – Not to be avoided: Rapid removal of the tourniquet is actually recommended.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Fungal hyphae surrounded by lymphocytes The most likely diagnosis in this case is chronic pulmonary fungal infection, such as histoplasmosis or other endemic/systemic fungal infections. The HRCT feature of “tree-in-bud” appearance suggests endobronchial spread of infection, which can be seen in both tuberculosis and fungal infections, but the low ADA level in pleural fluid (which typically is elevated in TB) makes tuberculosis less likely. Lymphocytic pleural effusion with low ADA, systemic symptoms like weight loss, and radiological signs (consolidation + tree-in-bud) raise suspicion for fungal etiology. A lymph node biopsy in such cases commonly shows fungal hyphae surrounded by inflammatory infiltrate, especially lymphocytes and histiocytes, sometimes forming granulomas. Incorrect Options: A. Reactive hyperplasia This would indicate a nonspecific reactive process, typically seen in viral infections or benign inflammatory conditions. It would not account for the chronic systemic symptoms and HRCT findings described. B. Necrotizing epithelioid granuloma This is more typical of tuberculosis or other granulomatous infections like sarcoidosis. However, low ADA in pleural fluid argues against TB, making this less likely. D. Anthracosis pigment Anthracosis pigment is a benign incidental finding due to carbon deposition in lungs or lymph nodes from pollution or smoking. It does not correlate with systemic illness or the radiological findings described here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Urinary total Metanephrines: The first-line investigation for suspected pheochromocytoma is the measurement of metanephrines, either in plasma (free metanephrines) or 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines. Among these, urinary metanephrines are widely available and considered reliable. Metanephrines are the metabolites of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), and they are more stable and consistently elevated than catecholamines themselves, making them better diagnostic markers. Measuring total urinary metanephrines over 24 hours is especially useful in screening and confirming the diagnosis in a non-acute setting. Incorrect Options: A. Plasma catecholamines While elevated in pheochromocytoma, plasma catecholamine levels fluctuate significantly and can be affected by stress, posture, or diet. They are less specific and less stable than metanephrines, so not recommended as the first test. C. USG whole abdomen Ultrasound may help in identifying adrenal masses, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all pheochromocytomas, especially extra-adrenal or small tumors. Imaging is done after biochemical confirmation. D. Urinary Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) level Although once widely used, VMA testing has lower sensitivity and may miss cases, especially if tumors secrete mostly norepinephrine.

Key features that suggest glomerular origin include: B. Cola-colored urine This is a classic hallmark of glomerular hematuria. The color change is due to oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin while the blood is retained in the urinary tract. It usually lacks clots and appears brown or tea-colored. A. Edema (rare) In isolated glomerular hematuria, such as in IgA nephropathy, edema may be minimal or absent. However, in nephritic syndrome, mild to moderate edema may still occur. The option may refer to early or mild cases, where edema is not prominent. Incorrect Options: C. Crystals present Crystals suggest tubular or post-renal causes, such as stone disease or metabolic disorders (e.g., uric acid, oxalate crystals). This does not indicate glomerular bleeding. D. Dysuria Dysuria (painful urination) is a symptom of lower urinary tract involvement, typically seen in UTIs or cystitis, and not a feature of glomerular hematuria.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increased tone of the pharyngeal muscles worsens obstruction This statement is incorrect because increased tone of pharyngeal muscles actually helps keep the airway open, thus reducing the risk of obstruction. In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the pharyngeal muscles relax excessively during sleep, especially in REM sleep, leading to collapse of the upper airway and intermittent obstruction. Therefore, decreased tone, not increased, is the actual cause of airway blockage. Correct Statements: B. Fall of oxygen saturation triggers waking up at night In OSA, the intermittent hypoxia caused by apneic episodes leads to brief arousals from sleep to restore airflow. These arousals are triggered by falling oxygen saturation, which activates the brain’s arousal mechanisms. C. Episodes of apnea increase stress on heart Apnea causes intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic overdrive, and blood pressure fluctuations, all of which place stress on the cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure. D. Low oxygen stimulates respiratory effort When oxygen levels fall, peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies stimulate the respiratory centers in the brainstem to increase respiratory effort, which may become ineffective during apnea until the person briefly wakes up and restores normal breathing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Reduce FiO? In patients with ARDS, the ventilator strategy should follow lung-protective ventilation and oxygen toxicity avoidance principles: Target PaO?: 55–80 mmHg Target SpO?: 88–95% FiO? > 60% for prolonged periods can cause oxygen toxicity (e.g., absorption atelectasis, free radical damage). In this patient: PaO? = 180 mmHg and SpO? = 100% → much higher than target, indicating excessive oxygen delivery. FiO? is 80% → unnecessarily high and should be titrated down to the lowest level that maintains PaO? in target range. The patient’s lungs are responding well to PEEP (PaO? is high), so FiO? can safely be decreased to avoid toxicity. Incorrect Options: A. Increase TV Tidal volume is already 6 mL/kg, which is appropriate for ARDS to avoid barotrauma. Increasing TV risks volutrauma, so it's not appropriate. B. Increase PEEP PaO? is already high; increasing PEEP will further increase oxygenation unnecessarily and may cause hemodynamic compromise or barotrauma. D. Increase RR Though PaCO? is mildly elevated and pH is borderline acidotic, the priority is to correct excessive oxygenation first. Also, the pH is within acceptable limits, so no urgent need to change RR.",

It is calculated using the formula: AG=Na+−(Cl−+HCO3−)\\text{AG} = \\text{Na}^+ - (\\text{Cl}^- + \\text{HCO}_3^-)AG=Na+−(Cl−+HCO3−?) Substituting the values: AG=145−(90+20)=145−110=35\\text{AG} = 145 - (90 + 20) = 145 - 110 = \\boxed{35}AG=145−(90+20)=145−110=35? This value is significantly elevated above the normal range (typically 8–12 mEq/L), indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). The pH of 7.22 and low bicarbonate support the presence of metabolic acidosis. Conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or toxin ingestion are typical causes of HAGMA. Incorrect Option: Option A: 15 An anion gap of 15 is only mildly elevated and would not match the lab values given. Since the chloride and bicarbonate together are low relative to sodium, the anion gap must be higher than 15. Option B: 25 Although closer than A, an anion gap of 25 is still underestimated. The correct calculation gives 35, so this option does not accurately reflect the given data. Option D: 45 This overestimates the anion gap. Using the correct formula, we find the gap is 35.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Metabolic Alkalosis A patient with persistent vomiting typically loses large amounts of gastric acid (HCl). The loss of hydrogen ions leads to a rise in serum bicarbonate, resulting in metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, volume depletion from vomiting may lead to hypovolemia, explaining the low blood pressure noted on examination. The kidneys respond to volume depletion by retaining sodium (and bicarbonate), which can further exacerbate alkalosis. This scenario is a classic presentation of contraction alkalosis, a subtype of metabolic alkalosis caused by extracellular fluid loss. Incorrect Options: A: Respiratory Alkalosis This occurs due to hyperventilation, which leads to decreased CO? levels. Vomiting does not directly stimulate hyperventilation or cause a respiratory alkalosis, so this is not the expected acid-base disturbance here. B: Metabolic Acidosis Metabolic acidosis typically results from loss of bicarbonate (as in diarrhea) or accumulation of acids (e.g., DKA, lactic acidosis). Since vomiting leads to loss of acid, not base, acidosis is not expected in this case. D: Hyperkalemia Vomiting generally causes hypokalemia due to potassium loss from the GI tract and kidneys. Additionally, alkalosis promotes intracellular shifting of potassium, further lowering serum potassium levels. Therefore, hyperkalemia is not expected.",

CT findings may support clinical assessment but are not part of the standardized criteria used to categorize disease severity. Thus, this is the exception among the listed options. Incorrect Options: A: SpO? < 90% An oxygen saturation below 90% on room air is a recognized marker of severe COVID-19, indicating significant hypoxia and impaired gas exchange, which is a critical clinical indicator for hospitalization and possibly oxygen therapy or ventilatory support. B: Respiratory rate > 30/min A respiratory rate over 30/min is a clinical marker of respiratory distress and is included in the definition of severe COVID-19. It reflects increased work of breathing and potential respiratory compromise, meeting severity criteria.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Respiratory acidosis with inadequate compensation The patient’s pH is 7.28, indicating acidemia. The PaCO? is 80 mmHg, which is markedly elevated (normal is ~40 mmHg), confirming a primary respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation or CO? retention. The HCO?? is 26 mEq/L, which is only slightly elevated (normal: 22–26 mEq/L), suggesting the kidneys have not adequately compensated by retaining enough bicarbonate to buffer the increased CO?. In acute respiratory acidosis, for every 10 mmHg rise in PaCO?, HCO?? should increase by ~1 mEq/L (acute) or ~4 mEq/L (chronic). In this case, with a 40 mmHg rise in PaCO?, the expected compensation should be around +4 mEq/L (total HCO? ≈ 30 if chronic), but it's only 26 — confirming inadequate compensation, and most consistent with acute respiratory acidosis. Incorrect Options: A: Respiratory acidosis with adequate compensation As explained, the bicarbonate level (26) is not sufficiently elevated to compensate for the high PaCO? (80). So, this is not adequately compensated respiratory acidosis. C: Respiratory alkalosis with adequate compensation This is incorrect because the patient is acidotic (pH < 7.35), and the PaCO? is high, not low as would be expected in respiratory alkalosis. So, this is not alkalosis at all. D: Respiratory alkalosis with inadequate compensation Again, this option is ruled out because the disturbance is acidosis, not alkalosis. High PaCO? cannot be a feature of respiratory alkalosis.",

While not the most sensitive (they are present in only ~30% of SLE cases), their presence is strongly associated with SLE and rarely found in other diseases, making them highly specific. This means that if a patient has anti-Sm antibodies, it is highly indicative of SLE, and they are even included in the classification criteria for SLE (ACR/EULAR) due to their diagnostic value. Therefore, Anti-Sm is the best marker when specificity is being asked. Incorrect options: A: ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) ANA is highly sensitive for SLE (~95–98%) but not specific, as it can be positive in a wide range of autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, even in healthy individuals especially the elderly). Thus, while it's a good screening test, it cannot confirm SLE specifically. B: Anti-dsDNA Anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) is both sensitive and specific, but less specific than Anti-Sm. It is present in ~60–70% of SLE patients and is especially associated with renal involvement (lupus nephritis). However, it may rarely be seen in other conditions like chronic hepatitis or other autoimmune diseases. D: Anti-centromere Anti-centromere antibodies are not associated with SLE, but rather with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome).

This condition is called dialysis-related amyloidosis. β2-microglobulin is normally filtered by the kidneys, but in chronic kidney disease (CKD)—especially when patients are on hemodialysis for years—it accumulates in the blood due to poor clearance. Over time, this leads to amyloid fibril deposition, especially in joints, bones, and tendons (commonly causing carpal tunnel syndrome and arthropathy in dialysis patients). Therefore, Beta-2 microglobulin is the characteristic protein deposited in dialysis-related amyloidosis. Incorrect options: A: Light chains Light chains are deposited in AL amyloidosis, typically associated with plasma cell dyscrasias like multiple myeloma. They are not the type deposited in dialysis-related cases. B: Acute phase reactant Acute phase reactants, such as serum amyloid A (SAA), are involved in AA amyloidosis, seen in chronic inflammatory states like tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis—not in dialysis-related amyloidosis.

Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) type 4 is actually associated with hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. It is typically seen in conditions of aldosterone deficiency or resistance, which leads to impaired potassium excretion by the distal nephron. As a result, potassium accumulates, causing hyperkalemia. This feature distinguishes RTA type 4 from other types of RTA, which more often present with hypokalemia. Correct statement B: Fanconi syndrome presents with RTA 2 This is a correct statement. Fanconi syndrome is a generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule, leading to loss of glucose, amino acids, phosphate, and bicarbonate in urine. Loss of bicarbonate results in RTA type 2 (proximal RTA), making this statement accurate C: Bicarbonaturia is a feature of RTA 2 This is also a correct statement. In RTA type 2, there is impaired reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal tubule, leading to bicarbonaturia (loss of bicarbonate in the urine), especially in the early stages of the condition. This is a hallmark feature of proximal RTA. D: RTA 4 is due to aldosterone resistance This is another correct statement. RTA type 4 arises due to either aldosterone deficiency or aldosterone resistance, resulting in impaired sodium reabsorption and decreased potassium and proton excretion.

Hypokalemia primarily affects muscle, cardiac, and renal systems, but it does not cause cerebral edema. Cerebral edema is more commonly linked with hyponatremia, where a low serum sodium concentration causes water to shift into brain cells, leading to swelling. In contrast, potassium disturbances do not cause significant osmotic shifts in the brain that would result in cerebral edema. Correct Statement A: Ventricular tachycardia Hypokalemia increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, due to increased myocardial excitability. ECG changes such as U waves, flattened T waves, and prolonged QT interval may be seen, all of which predispose to arrhythmias. B: Quadriplegia Severe hypokalemia can cause profound muscle weakness, which may progress to flaccid paralysis or quadriplegia in extreme cases. This occurs because potassium is critical for maintaining the resting membrane potential of muscle cells; a deficit impairs neuromuscular transmission. C: Diabetes insipidus Hypokalemia can cause a form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Low potassium impairs the renal tubule’s responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to polyuria and polydipsia, resembling diabetes insipidus.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Synchronized DC cardioversion The best next step in the management of an unconscious and hypotensive patient with narrow complex tachycardia is synchronized direct current (DC) cardioversion. This is because the patient is unstable (evidenced by hypotension and altered sensorium), which is an immediate indication for electrical cardioversion, regardless of the ECG findings. In unstable patients, pharmacologic measures like adenosine or carotid massage are not safe or effective, and electrical cardioversion is both rapid and life-saving. Incorrect Options: B: Carotid massage Carotid sinus massage is a vagal maneuver used to terminate supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in hemodynamically stable patients. However, this patient is unconscious and hypotensive, making vagal maneuvers inappropriate and potentially dangerous due to time delay and ineffectiveness in unstable patients. C: IV adenosine 6 mg bolus followed by saline push Adenosine is the first-line pharmacologic agent for stable narrow complex tachycardias, such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). However, in unstable patients like this one, electrical cardioversion is indicated over pharmacologic therapy to rapidly restore circulation. D: IV amiodarone bolus Amiodarone is used for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or when adenosine is contraindicated, but again, only in stable patients. In an emergency setting with hemodynamic instability, it is too slow-acting compared to DC cardioversion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Loud S1 Loud S1 is not a typical feature of a large pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade, which is suggested in this case by the “water bottle” heart on chest X-ray. Instead, heart sounds—including S1—are usually muffled due to the insulating effect of fluid around the heart. The presence of breathlessness, history of recent viral illness, and chest pain, along with radiologic evidence, strongly points toward pericardial effusion, potentially progressing to cardiac tamponade. Thus, option B is the incorrect (false) statement, making it the right answer to the question. Incorrect Options: A: Pulsus paradoxus is observed This is true. Pulsus paradoxus—an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (>10 mmHg) during inspiration—is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade. It reflects impaired ventricular filling due to increased pericardial pressure. C: Emergency pericardiocentesis may be required This is also true. If tamponade is present (e.g., causing hypotension or signs of shock), emergency pericardiocentesis is the definitive and often life-saving intervention to relieve pressure on the heart. D: ECG showing RA and RV collapse requires immediate intervention True. Echocardiographic evidence (not ECG) of right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse is a hallmark of tamponade physiology, which mandates urgent pericardiocentesis. While the question says \"ECG\", this likely refers to echo findings (a common confusion), and the interpretation focuses on the required immediate intervention, which is correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Direct Cardioversion must be done for all cases (False Statement) This is the false statement, making it the correct choice for this question. Electrical (Direct) Cardioversion is not always required in all patients with AF. It is reserved for: Hemodynamically unstable patients (e.g., hypotension, shock, severe chest pain). Selected stable patients after evaluation (e.g., persistent AF with symptoms despite rate control). In many stable cases (especially if AF duration >48 hours), rate control with medications (like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin) and anticoagulation are preferred initially. Hence, saying \"must be done for all cases\" is false. Other Options (True Statements): A. Rare occurrence in individuals with normal heart AF is rare in young individuals without structural heart disease. It usually occurs in the setting of hypertension, valvular disease, hyperthyroidism, etc. C. Intravenous digoxin for rate control Digoxin is a rate-controlling agent, especially useful in sedentary or elderly patients and those with heart failure. It’s used to slow AV nodal conduction in AF.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Empagliflozin Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, has been shown to delay progression of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations, even in non-diabetic patients. In a diabetic patient with signs of congestive heart failure (dyspnea, pedal edema, enlarged heart, rales, low EF), empagliflozin provides both glycemic control and cardioprotective benefits. Its mechanisms include reducing preload and afterload, improving myocardial metabolism, and having diuretic-like effects without neurohormonal activation. It modifies disease progression, unlike other options that provide only symptomatic relief. Incorrect Options: A: Thiazides Thiazide diuretics are mainly antihypertensive agents and are not the first-line diuretics in heart failure. While they help in symptom relief of volume overload, they do not improve cardiac remodeling or delay progression of heart failure. C: Furosemide Furosemide is a loop diuretic, useful for rapid symptomatic relief of fluid overload (e.g., dyspnea and edema), but it does not modify the natural history of heart failure. It does not reduce mortality or slow progression of cardiac dysfunction. D: Digoxin Digoxin is used to improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations in HFrEF, particularly when atrial fibrillation is present, but it does not delay cardiac damage or improve survival. It also has a narrow therapeutic index and potential toxicity, especially in elderly patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1, 2, 3 On auscultation of the heart, we follow a superior to inferior anatomical approach on the left side of the chest, correlating with the valve areas: Pulmonic area – This is located at the 2nd left intercostal space, near the left upper sternal border. It is the most superior auscultation point on the left side. Tricuspid area – Located at the 4th or 5th left intercostal space, along the lower left sternal border. It lies below the pulmonic area. Mitral area – This is found at the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line (the apex of the heart). It is inferior and lateral to both pulmonic and tricuspid areas.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Breath urea test The urea breath test (UBT) is the most reliable and preferred non-invasive test to confirm eradication of H. pylori after treatment. It works by detecting urease activity, an enzyme produced by H. pylori that breaks down urea to release CO?, which is then measured in the patient’s breath. It is highly sensitive and specific and recommended 4 or more weeks after completion of therapy to avoid false negatives due to suppression of the bacteria by PPIs or antibiotics. Incorrect Options: A) Biopsy urease test This is an invasive test requiring endoscopy. It is less commonly used post-treatment unless endoscopy is already indicated for other reasons. Additionally, false negatives can occur due to patchy infection or recent antibiotics/PPI use. B) Upper GI endoscopy While it provides direct visualization, it is not necessary for routine assessment of H. pylori eradication unless there are alarm symptoms or non-healing ulcers. It's invasive and not cost-effective for routine follow-up. D) Serology Serological tests detect antibodies, which can remain positive for months to years after successful treatment.

Key features explained Proximal muscle weakness: Cortisol causes protein catabolism, leading to muscle wasting. Purple striae: Stretch marks on the abdomen or thighs that are wide and violaceous, due to collagen breakdown and skin thinning. Central obesity: Cortisol redistributes fat to the trunk, face (\"moon face\"), and dorsocervical fat pad (\"buffalo hump\"). Easy bruising: Cortisol impairs collagen formation and capillary integrity. These signs strongly point toward Cushing's syndrome, either due to exogenous steroid use or endogenous cortisol overproduction (like adrenal adenoma or pituitary adenoma producing ACTH). Incorrect Options: A) Hyperthyroidism Typically presents with weight loss, heat intolerance, tremors, palpitations, and hyperactivity. Muscle weakness may occur but without purple striae or central obesity. C) Hyperparathyroidism Causes hypercalcemia, which may result in bone pain, kidney stones, abdominal groans, and psychiatric moans, not the features mentioned here.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mineral and Bone Disorder The patient's presentation includes: Headache, abdominal pain Renal stone Low serum calcium Elevated PTH (parathyroid hormone) This constellation suggests a secondary hyperparathyroidism scenario, often seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBD). In CKD, phosphate retention and decreased vitamin D activation reduce calcium levels, stimulating a compensatory rise in PTH (i.e., secondary hyperparathyroidism). Over time, this dysregulation causes renal osteodystrophy and may lead to soft tissue and vascular calcifications, nephrolithiasis (stones), and bone pain. So, this patient likely has a CKD-related Mineral and Bone Disorder, where low calcium with high PTH is a hallmark finding. Incorrect Options: A) PTH and Primary Hyperparathyroidism In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum calcium is high and PTH is inappropriately elevated. However, the question states low calcium, making this option incorrect. B) Catecholamines and Pheochromocytoma Pheochromocytoma typically presents with episodic hypertension, sweating, palpitations, and headaches, but not with low calcium or elevated PTH. C) Thyroxine and Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism can cause bone resorption leading to mild hypercalcemia, not low calcium. It does not typically raise PTH levels.",

While potassium abnormalities are common in DKA, a serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L is not a diagnostic criterion. In fact, at presentation, most DKA patients have normal or elevated serum potassium despite total body potassium depletion due to extracellular shift caused by acidosis and insulin deficiency. Importantly, DKA is not diagnosed by low potassium, though it must be closely monitored and corrected during treatment. Starting insulin therapy in a patient with hypokalemia (<3.3 mEq/L) is dangerous and should be avoided until potassium is corrected. Incorrect Options: A) Serum glucose more than 250 mg/dL Correct diagnostic criterion for DKA. Hyperglycemia is typically marked and a key component. B) Anion gap more than 10–12 DKA is a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, so an elevated anion gap is a defining criterion. C) Serum bicarbonate less than 15 mmol/L Low bicarbonate reflects the severity of metabolic acidosis and is a diagnostic criterion for DKA (usually <18 mmol/L; <15 indicates moderate to severe DKA).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Right Parieto-Occipital Cortex The patient has left hemianopia (loss of vision in the left half of the visual field in both eyes), which indicates damage posterior to the optic chiasm, affecting the right visual pathway. Additionally, the clock drawing test showing neglect of the left side suggests left hemispatial neglect, which is commonly associated with right parietal lobe lesions. The right parieto-occipital cortex is involved in visual processing and spatial attention. A lesion here can produce: Left homonymous hemianopia (due to occipital lobe involvement) Left hemispatial neglect (due to parietal lobe involvement) Thus, the combination of left hemianopia and visual neglect points strongly to a right parieto-occipital lesion. Incorrect Options: B) Right Frontal Cortex Lesions here may cause motor weakness (e.g., left-sided due to contralateral control) but do not cause hemianopia or visual neglect typically. C) Left Parieto-Occipital Cortex Would cause right hemianopia, not left. Also, left hemisphere lesions usually do not cause hemispatial neglect, as this function is typically dominant in the right hemisphere.

Treatment with thyroid hormone replacement often resolves cognitive symptoms. C) Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) Yes, potentially reversible. NPH presents with the classic triad: Gait disturbance Urinary incontinence Dementia If diagnosed early, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting can significantly improve or reverse symptoms.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Thoracic spinal cord lesion The patient presents with bilateral lower limb weakness, increased tone, brisk reflexes, a sensory level at the umbilicus, and urinary retention. These findings are classic for a spinal cord lesion, particularly at the thoracic level: Sensory level at the umbilicus corresponds to T10 dermatome, indicating that the lesion is likely in the thoracic spinal cord. Bilateral weakness with increased tone and brisk reflexes are signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement. Urinary retention suggests involvement of descending autonomic pathways controlling bladder function, commonly affected in spinal cord lesions. Thus, a thoracic spinal cord lesion is the most consistent with the described presentation. Incorrect Options: A) Peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy typically causes lower motor neuron signs such as flaccid weakness, reduced tone, diminished reflexes, and glove-and-stocking sensory loss. It does not cause a sensory level or spasticity. B) Cerebral cortex lesion Cortical lesions may cause contralateral weakness, typically more unilateral and not associated with a sensory level. They also wouldn't selectively affect bladder or bowel function unless bilateral or involving the paracentral lobule. D) Brainstem lesion Brainstem lesions usually affect cranial nerves, respiratory centers, or cause mixed cranial and long tract signs.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Right Subthalamic nucleus The patient's presentation — sudden onset of violent, flinging movements (termed hemiballismus) — is a classic manifestation of a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus is part of the basal ganglia indirect pathway, which normally inhibits movement. A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus results in loss of inhibition, leading to excessive, involuntary, flinging limb movements (ballismus). Because of crossed motor control, left-sided symptoms suggest a lesion in the right subthalamic nucleus. Incorrect Options: B) Right Caudate nucleus Lesions here are more commonly associated with chorea (as seen in Huntington's disease), which is characterized by brief, irregular, dance-like movements, not the violent, large-amplitude flinging of hemiballismus. C) Left Globus pallidus Involvement of the globus pallidus may lead to rigidity or dystonia, not typically hemiballismus. Also, a left-sided lesion would not match left-sided symptoms due to contralateral control. D) Left Putamen Like the globus pallidus, the putamen is involved in movement regulation, but putaminal lesions more often produce parkinsonism or chorea, not hemiballismus.
