      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Negative Feedback Baroreceptors are involved in a negative feedback system that helps maintain blood pressure within a normal range. These specialized sensory nerve endings, located primarily in the carotid sinuses and aortic arch, detect changes in the stretch of blood vessel walls, which reflect changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure rises, baroreceptors increase their firing rate, signaling the brainstem (specifically the medulla oblongata), which then activates responses to lower blood pressure—such as vasodilation and a decrease in heart rate. Conversely, when blood pressure drops, the baroreceptors decrease their firing rate, prompting the brain to initiate vasoconstriction and increase heart rate to restore normal pressure. This mechanism exemplifies negative feedback, where the body counteracts a change to restore equilibrium. Incorrect Options: Option B – Positive Feedback Positive feedback amplifies changes rather than reversing them. For example, during childbirth, the release of oxytocin increases contractions, which in turn leads to more oxytocin release. Baroreceptor activity, by contrast, functions to reduce or reverse blood pressure deviations, not to amplify them. Option C – Both Negative and Positive Baroreceptors are not involved in both types of feedback. Their sole physiological role is in negative feedback control of cardiovascular function, specifically regulating blood pressure. Option D – Feedforward Control Feedforward control involves anticipatory changes in physiological systems, such as increasing heart rate before exercise begins. Baroreceptors respond after a change in blood pressure has occurred, making them part of feedback, not feedforward, control. Thus, this option is incorrect. .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Salivation on anticipation of food The feedforward mechanism refers to a physiological response that is initiated in anticipation of a change, rather than in reaction to it. This helps the body prepare in advance, increasing efficiency and responsiveness. Salivation on anticipation of food is a classic example of feedforward control. When you see, smell, or even think about food, your salivary glands start producing saliva before any actual food enters your mouth. This anticipatory response prepares the digestive system for incoming food, aiding in easier chewing and digestion. It’s triggered by sensory input and higher brain functions, not by any actual change in blood chemistry or digestion, which is why it's considered feedforward rather than feedback. Incorrect Options: Option A – Increase blood pressure during supine posture: This response is part of a feedback mechanism, not feedforward. When a person lies down (supine), gravity affects blood distribution, and the baroreceptor reflex helps adjust blood pressure accordingly. The body reacts to an actual change in blood distribution, not in anticipation of it. Option C – Shivering on exposure to cold environment: Shivering is a negative feedback response to a drop in body temperature. It occurs after the body detects the cold through thermoreceptors and attempts to generate heat by muscle activity. It’s a reactive mechanism, not anticipatory. Option D – Raised blood pressure on sharp cutaneous pain: his is a reflexive feedback response to pain, part of the body’s acute stress reaction. The increase in blood pressure happens as a reaction to a noxious stimulus, not in advance of it, thus it is not feedforward control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Intracellular proteins The Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium refers to the distribution of ion species across a semipermeable membrane when one or more types of ions (usually large, charged molecules like proteins) cannot cross the membrane. This equilibrium is influenced significantly by intracellular proteins, which are typically negatively charged and too large to pass through the cell membrane. Because these proteins cannot move, they affect the distribution of permeable ions (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride) to maintain both electrical and osmotic balance. The result is an unequal distribution of diffusible ions across the membrane, leading to differences in osmotic pressure and membrane potential. Thus, intracellular proteins are the core factor in establishing the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium. Incorrect Options: Option A – Chloride While chloride ions are affected by the Gibbs-Donnan effect, they are not the basis of it. Chloride ions redistribute in response to the impermeable negatively charged proteins, but they are permeable and able to move across the membrane. Option C – Calcium Calcium plays crucial roles in cellular signaling and muscle contraction, but it is not central to the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium. Its movement is tightly regulated, and it does not significantly participate in the passive distribution of ions governed by this equilibrium. Option D – Bicarbonate Bicarbonate is a buffer involved in maintaining pH balance and can cross membranes via specific transporters. While it contributes to ionic balance in cells, it is not a primary factor in establishing Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined primarily by the presence of non-diffusible charged molecules like proteins.",

Incorrect Options: Option A – 10 L This underestimates the ECF volume and does not account for the correct plasma concentration and amount remaining after excretion. Option C – 30 L This is much higher than typical ECF volume in adults and would suggest an incorrect calculation or assumption about distribution. Option D – 22 L This value is closer to the total body water in some individuals but not the ECF volume specifically. Mannitol does not distribute into intracellular fluid, so this volume is too large for ECF.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 500–600 ml/day Insensible (or transient) fluid loss refers to the continuous and unnoticeable loss of body water that occurs through the skin (evaporation, not sweat) and the respiratory tract. This form of water loss happens without the person being aware of it and cannot be precisely measured, hence the term \"insensible.\" On average, a healthy adult loses about 500–600 mL of water per day through these routes under normal environmental and physiological conditions. This loss is an important component to consider when calculating a patient's daily fluid requirement, especially in hospitalized or critically ill patients, as it is not replaced by drinking or eating and must be factored into IV fluid planning. Incorrect Options: Option A – 150–200 mL/day This significantly underestimates the typical daily insensible loss, potentially leading to underhydration if used for fluid replacement calculations. Option B – 200–350 mL/day Still too low for average insensible losses in adults and would not fully compensate for ongoing water loss through respiration and skin. Option C – 350–400 mL/day Closer to the actual range but still below the commonly accepted value of 500–600 mL/day used in clinical fluid management. These underestimated values may apply in cooler environments or in patients with reduced metabolic activity, but for standard calculations, especially in hospital settings, 500–600 mL/day is the accepted figure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Plasma Volume Iodine-125 (I-125) labelled albumin is a radioactive tracer used specifically to measure plasma volume. Albumin is a large protein that stays confined to the vascular compartment (plasma) and does not cross capillary membranes into interstitial or intracellular spaces. By injecting I-125 labelled albumin into the bloodstream and measuring its concentration after equilibration, clinicians can calculate the volume of plasma using the dilution principle Plasma volume=Amount of tracer injectedConcentration after equilibration\\text{Plasma volume} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of tracer injected}}{\\text{Concentration after equilibration}}Plasma volume=Concentration after equilibrationAmount of tracer injected? This technique is precise for determining plasma volume, especially in research and clinical situations involving fluid balance, shock, or blood volume disorders. Incorrect Options: Option B – Interstitial fluid volume Albumin does not leave the blood vessels under normal conditions, so it does not enter the interstitial space. Therefore, it cannot be used to measure interstitial fluid volume directly. Option C – ICF (Intracellular Fluid) Albumin is too large to cross cell membranes and therefore cannot enter cells. Hence, it cannot be used to assess intracellular fluid. Option D – ECF (Extracellular Fluid) While plasma is a part of the extracellular fluid, I-125 albumin does not distribute into the interstitial part of the ECF, which comprises a significant portion of total ECF.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Glucose The graph represents a saturation curve, characteristic of facilitated diffusion. In this mechanism, substances are transported across the membrane by specific carrier proteins. Initially, as the concentration gradient increases, the rate of diffusion also increases. However, once all carrier proteins become saturated, the rate reaches a maximum (Vmax), beyond which it cannot increase. Glucose is a classic example of a substance that undergoes facilitated diffusion via GLUT transporters. Since carrier proteins are involved, the transport shows saturation kinetics, as depicted in the graph.Incorrect Options:A. CO2 Carbon dioxide diffuses across cell membranes through simple diffusion, as it is a small, nonpolar molecule. In simple diffusion, the rate of diffusion increases linearly with concentration gradient and does not show saturation, because no carrier proteins are involved. Therefore, CO? would not follow the graph shown. B. O2 Oxygen is another small, nonpolar molecule that moves across membranes by simple diffusion. Like CO?, its transport rate is directly proportional to the concentration gradient and does not involve carrier proteins. Thus, oxygen would produce a straight-line graph, not the saturation curve shown here. D. Na Sodium ions usually cross membranes through active transport mechanisms (e.g., Na?/K? ATPase) or voltage-gated ion channels. Active transport moves ions against their concentration gradient using energy (ATP), which doesn’t follow the passive, saturable curve seen in the graph. Even when Na? uses ion channels, the process is typically regulated by electrochemical gradients and doesn't exhibit classic saturation kinetics unless through secondary active transport.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Secondary Active Transport The transport of glucose in the intestine (specifically across the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells) is an example of secondary active transport. This process involves the Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter (SGLT-1), which uses the energy of the sodium gradient established by the Na?/K? ATPase pump (located on the basolateral membrane). Although ATP is not directly used by the glucose transporter itself, the energy comes indirectly from ATP, which maintains the sodium gradient—hence the term secondary active transport. In this mechanism: Sodium ions move down their concentration gradient into the cell. Glucose is co-transported with sodium against its concentration gradient into the cell. Glucose then exits the cell into the bloodstream via facilitated diffusion using GLUT transporters on the basolateral side. Incorrect Options: Option A – Primary transport Primary active transport involves direct use of ATP to move substances against their gradient, such as the Na?/K? ATPase pump. Glucose transport in the intestine does not directly use ATP. Option B – Simple diffusion Glucose is a polar molecule and cannot pass through lipid membranes by simple diffusion. It requires a transporter and moves against its concentration gradient at the intestinal lumen, which rules out simple diffusion. Option D – Na? channel - ATPase This is a mixed and inaccurate term. While Na?/K? ATPase is involved in maintaining the sodium gradient, it is not directly transporting glucose. Also, sodium channels do not use ATP directly; the ATPase is a separate mechanism from channels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)A. Na KThe graph shows the classic action potential curve of a neuron, along with the conductance changes for two ions. Initially, there is a sharp increase in sodium (Na?) conductance, leading to a rapid depolarization of the membrane (upward spike). This is due to the opening of voltage-gated Na? channels. Shortly after, potassium (K?) conductance increases, which is responsible for repolarization as K? exits the cell through its voltage-gated channels. This sequence of events—Na? influx followed by K? efflux—is characteristic of a typical neuronal action potential, and matches the labeled conductance curves (P_Na rises first, followed by P_K).Incorrect Options:B. K, NaThis option reverses the actual sequence of ion conductance changes. In the action potential, Na? conductance increases first, not K?. The initial phase of depolarization is always mediated by Na? entry, so this option is incorrect.C. Na CaCalcium (Ca²?) does play a role in certain types of action potentials (e.g., in cardiac or smooth muscle), but in typical neuronal action potentials, Ca²? conductance is not the primary contributor. The conductance changes shown in the graph clearly correspond to Na? and K?, not Ca²?.D. Ca NaThis is incorrect because, as stated, Ca²? is not the main ion involved in standard neuronal action potentials.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Depolarisation The resting membrane potential is determined by the relative permeability of the membrane to different ions and their individual equilibrium potentials (E?). In this scenario, the cell membrane is initially freely permeable to three ions: X, Y, and Z. The resting membrane potential is -90 mV, which is more negative than the equilibrium potentials of both X (-30 mV) and Y (-40 mV). This suggests that ion Z must have a more negative equilibrium potential than -90 mV or be the dominant ion influencing the membrane potential, maintaining it at -90 mV. When a drug blocks the permeability of Z, the membrane potential is now more influenced by ions X and Y, both of which have less negative equilibrium potentials (-30 mV and -40 mV). This shift in influence causes the membrane potential to become less negative, i.e., move closer to the equilibrium potentials of X and Y. This decrease in negativity of the membrane potential is known as depolarisation. Incorrect Options: Option B – Hyperpolarization Hyperpolarization means the membrane potential becomes more negative, but blocking Z (which was keeping it very negative) would actually reduce this negativity. Option C – No change The removal of a key permeable ion (Z) from the equation would definitely affect the membrane potential since the ion balance is altered. Option D – Hyperpolarization following repolarization There is no initial depolarization followed by repolarization and hyperpolarization in this context. The membrane potential moves directly toward less negative values (depolarisation) as Z is blocked.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Attachment of ATP to the head The detachment of the myosin head from actin is a critical step in the muscle contraction cycle, specifically in the cross-bridge cycle. After the power stroke (when the myosin head pulls the actin filament), the myosin head remains tightly bound to actin in a low-energy state. For the myosin head to detach from actin, a new ATP molecule must bind to the myosin head. This binding of ATP reduces the affinity of myosin for actin, causing it to detach from the actin filament. This step is essential for the cycle to repeat, as the myosin head can then hydrolyze the ATP, re-cock, and form another cross-bridge. Incorrect Options: Option A – Change in troponin C configuration While binding of Ca²? to troponin C causes conformational changes that expose binding sites on actin for myosin to attach, it is not responsible for detachment of the myosin head. Option C – Binding of ADP and Pi to head The myosin head already has ADP and Pi bound during the cocking phase. These are released after the power stroke. Their presence does not cause detachment from actin. Option D – Pumping Ca²? into sarcoplasmic reticulum This process contributes to muscle relaxation by lowering cytosolic Ca²? levels and preventing new cross-bridge formation, but it does not directly cause the detachment of myosin from actin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Blocking K+ channels on presynaptic membrane Acetylcholine (ACh) release at the presynaptic terminal is a calcium-dependent process, triggered by depolarization of the neuron. Blocking K+ channels on the presynaptic membrane prolongs depolarization because K+ is normally responsible for repolarizing the membrane after an action potential. If K+ channels are blocked, the membrane stays depolarized longer, which in turn keeps voltage-gated Ca2 channels open longer, allowing more Ca2 influx. Since calcium influx directly stimulates exocytosis of ACh vesicles, this leads to increased release of ACh into the synaptic cleft. Incorrect Options: Option A – Blocking Na+ channels on presynaptic membrane Sodium channels are crucial for initiating and propagating the action potential. Blocking them would prevent depolarization, thereby reducing or abolishing ACh release, not increasing it. Option C – Blocking leaky Cl- channels on presynaptic membrane Leaky Cl- channels contribute to maintaining the resting membrane potential. Blocking them would have minimal effect on ACh release and certainly would not enhance it significantly. Option D – Blocking Ca2 channels on presynaptic membrane Calcium influx through voltage-gated Ca2 channels is essential for triggering ACh release. Blocking these channels would completely inhibit ACh exocytosis, not increase it.",

This means that if the membrane potential is at -60 mV, there is no net movement of Cl? ions. Incorrect Options:Option B: +60 mV This would be the equilibrium potential if Cl? were a positively charged ion (z = +1), but since chloride is negatively charged, we must divide by -1 in the Nernst equation. Therefore, this value has the wrong sign and is incorrect. Option C: -10 mV This value is too small in magnitude. Based on the 10-fold concentration gradient across the membrane (100 outside / 10 inside), the log is 1. Thus, the potential should be either +60 or -60 mV, depending on the ion's charge. -10 mV underestimates the effect of the steep concentration gradient. Option D: +10 mVLike option C, this value is incorrect due to both wrong sign and insufficient magnitude. It does not match the calculation from the Nernst equation, given the large concentration gradient and the ion's negative charge.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Synaptobrevin Tetanus toxin is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani, and it primarily targets synaptobrevin (also known as VAMP – vesicle-associated membrane protein). Synaptobrevin is a critical component of the SNARE complex, which is responsible for the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane to release neurotransmitters. Tetanus toxin is taken up at neuromuscular junctions and transported retrogradely into the central nervous system, where it cleaves synaptobrevin in inhibitory interneurons. This prevents the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA and glycine, leading to disinhibition of motor neurons, resulting in spastic paralysis, a hallmark of tetanus. Incorrect Options: Option A – Syntaxin Syntaxin is another component of the SNARE complex but is targeted by botulinum toxin type C, not tetanus toxin. Option C – SNAP-25 SNAP-25 is also part of the SNARE complex, but it is targeted by botulinum toxins type A and E, not tetanus toxin. Option D – NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein) NSF is involved in disassembling the SNARE complex after vesicle fusion. It is not cleaved by tetanus toxin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Connexons are involved in electrical synapse An electrical synapse differs from a chemical synapse in that it allows direct passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent neurons through gap junctions. These gap junctions are made up of protein subunits called connexons, which form channels connecting the cytoplasm of the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. This structural arrangement permits rapid and bidirectional transmission of electrical impulses with minimal synaptic delay, which is crucial in certain brain regions and for synchronizing activities like cardiac and smooth muscle contraction. Incorrect Options: Option A – No cytoplasmic continuity between presynaptic and post synaptic This is true for chemical synapses, not electrical ones. Electrical synapses do have cytoplasmic continuity through connexons. Option B – Direction of impulse is unidirectional Unidirectional transmission is a characteristic of chemical synapses. Electrical synapses are usually bidirectional, allowing current to flow in both directions. Option D – Electrical synapse has more latent period than chemical synapse Electrical synapses have a much shorter latent period (delay) compared to chemical synapses because they do not rely on neurotransmitter release and receptor binding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lysosome The image shows cardiac muscle tissue, identifiable by striations, branched fibers, and centrally located nuclei. Cardiac muscle cells are highly active and require continuous energy production, so they have abundant organelles like mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum (a form of SER), and Golgi apparatus to support protein processing and calcium handling. However, lysosomes are generally absent or minimal in mature muscle fibers, especially in contractile cardiac myocytes, because their primary function is intracellular digestion, which is not a regular activity in muscle fibers under normal conditions. Thus, lysosomes are not a prominent feature in cardiac muscle histology. Incorrect Options:Option A: Mitochondria Incorrect. Cardiac muscle has a very high density of mitochondria (up to 30-40% of cytoplasmic volume) to support the continuous aerobic respiration needed for constant contraction. These are abundantly present. Option B: Golgi bodyThe Golgi apparatus is present and functional in cardiac muscle cells for packaging and modifying proteins, though it's not as prominent as in secretory cells. It plays a role in processing membrane proteins and enzymes.

This is a classic physiological response during exercise to maximize cardiac output.Incorrect Options:Option B: ESV increasesIncorrect. An increase in ESV would indicate weaker contraction or impaired systolic function, which is not what happens in normal physiological exercise. The opposite occurs — ESV decreases due to enhanced contractility.Option C: ESV remains unchangedIncorrect. The PV loop clearly shows a leftward shift of the bottom-right corner, which marks the end-systolic point, indicating a decrease in ESV.Option D: ESV first decreases and then increasesIncorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Length-tension relationship The length-tension relationship best describes the connection between end-diastolic volume (EDV) and the force of contraction of the heart. This principle is part of the Frank-Starling law of the heart, which states that the more the cardiac muscle is stretched during filling (i.e., greater EDV), the greater the force of contraction during systole. As the sarcomere length increases with more filling, the overlap between actin and myosin filaments becomes more optimal, leading to a stronger contraction – up to a physiological limit. This relationship is referred to as length-tension because it reflects how the length of cardiac muscle fibers (due to volume filling) affects the tension or force they generate during contraction. Incorrect Options: Option B – Length-force relationship Although similar in concept, \"length-force\" is a less precise term and not commonly used in muscle physiology. The standard terminology is length-tension relationship. Option C – Velocity-force relationship This describes how the speed of muscle contraction changes in response to the force (or load) applied, not how filling volume affects contraction strength.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increase vessel diameter The best way to maintain or increase blood flow to tissue is by increasing vessel diameter, which significantly reduces vascular resistance and allows more blood to reach the tissues. This is explained by Poiseuille’s law, which states that blood flow (Q) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the vessel: Q∝r4ηQ \\propto \\frac{r^4}{\\eta}Q∝ηr4? This means even a small increase in vessel radius (diameter) leads to a large increase in blood flow, making it the most effective physiological mechanism for regulating tissue perfusion. Vasodilation, the process of increasing vessel diameter, is controlled by local metabolic needs, neural input, and hormonal signals. Incorrect Options: Option A – Increase Arterial pressure: While increasing arterial pressure can temporarily enhance blood flow, it's less efficient and more taxing on the cardiovascular system than adjusting vessel diameter. Chronically high pressure may damage vessels. Option B – Increase Venous pressure Increasing venous pressure does not significantly enhance tissue perfusion and may impair venous return and cause edema. Option D – Decrease Viscosity Lowering blood viscosity can improve flow, but under normal conditions, viscosity is relatively constant, and changes have less impact than vessel diameter.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 2-3-1-4 Here’s the explanation of the sequence after the ‘a’ wave of the jugular venous pulse (JVP) The ‘a’ wave corresponds to atrial contraction. R wave of ECG represents ventricular depolarization and immediately precedes ventricular contraction. The first heart sound (S1) occurs right after ventricular depolarization as the atrioventricular (AV) valves close, marking the start of ventricular systole. Rapid ejection phase follows, where blood is forcefully pumped out of the ventricles. The T wave corresponds to ventricular repolarization, signaling the end of systole. Thus, the correct chronological sequence after the ‘a’ wave is: R wave (2) → First heart sound (3) → Rapid ejection (1) → T wave (4) Incorrect Options: Option A (1-2-3-4) Incorrect, since the rapid ejection phase cannot occur before the R wave and first heart sound. Option B (1-2-4-3) Incorrect order: the T wave (ventricular repolarization) comes after rapid ejection and first heart sound. Option D (2-3-4-1) Incorrect: rapid ejection happens before the T wave, not after.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Arterial compliance Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In this patient: Systolic BP = 190 mmHg Diastolic BP = 100 mmHg Pulse pressure = 190 – 100 = 90 mmHg (which is high; normal is around 40 mmHg) A high pulse pressure usually indicates that the arteries are stiff or less compliant. Arterial compliance refers to the ability of large arteries (like the aorta) to expand and buffer the pulsatile output of the heart. When arterial compliance decreases (as seen in aging or arteriosclerosis), the arteries become stiffer, causing a larger increase in systolic pressure during ventricular ejection and less drop in diastolic pressure, leading to an increased pulse pressure. Incorrect Options: A) Myocardial contractility Increased contractility can increase stroke volume and systolic pressure but is not the primary cause of increased pulse pressure due to widened difference. B) Stroke volume An increase (not decrease) in stroke volume typically raises systolic pressure and pulse pressure. A decrease in stroke volume tends to reduce pulse pressure. C) Cardiac output Cardiac output affects overall blood pressure but not specifically pulse pressure. High pulse pressure is more linked to arterial stiffness than cardiac output changes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increase in ANP A decrease in central venous pressure (CVP) indicates reduced blood volume or venous return to the heart, which triggers compensatory mechanisms to restore fluid balance and maintain blood pressure. One such response is the increase in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which promotes water retention by the kidneys to expand blood volume. Additionally, decreased CVP stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, encouraging fluid intake to compensate for the volume deficit. The renin-angiotensin system is also activated under these conditions, leading to an increase in angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also promotes aldosterone secretion, enhancing sodium and water retention. All these responses aim to restore blood volume and maintain circulatory homeostasis. Option B (Increase in ANP) is incorrect because atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released from atrial myocytes in response to increased atrial stretch, which occurs with high CVP or volume overload. When CVP decreases, atrial stretch is reduced, and thus ANP secretion decreases rather than increases. ANP acts to lower blood volume by promoting sodium and water excretion, which would be counterproductive when blood volume is already low. Option A (Increase in ADH) is correct because decreased CVP reduces effective circulating volume, stimulating ADH release to conserve water and increase plasma volume. Option C (Increase in thirst) is correct as decreased CVP signals volume depletion, activating thirst centers to encourage fluid intake and restore volume. Option D (Increase in Angiotensin II) is correct since decreased CVP triggers the renin-angiotensin system, increasing angiotensin II levels to raise blood pressure and promote fluid retention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ascending thick loop of Henle The ascending thick loop of Henle is known as the diluting segment of the nephron because it actively reabsorbs sodium, potassium, and chloride ions but is impermeable to water. This means that while solutes are reabsorbed from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream, water cannot follow by osmosis, resulting in dilution of the tubular fluid as it moves up this segment. This process plays a critical role in concentrating urine and maintaining the kidney’s ability to generate a hyperosmotic medullary interstitium. Incorrect Options: Option A – Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): The PCT reabsorbs both solutes and a significant amount of water, so the tubular fluid remains roughly isotonic, not diluted. Option B – Collecting Duct: The collecting duct’s permeability to water varies depending on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels; it is not primarily responsible for dilution but rather final urine concentration. Option D – Descending Loop of Henle: The descending loop is highly permeable to water but less permeable to solutes, so water is reabsorbed here, concentrating the tubular fluid instead of diluting it.",

So, unlike the other options, a renal stone in the ureter does not increase GFR; it actually impairs it. Other Options: A) Increased renal blood flow: Increased blood flow to the kidneys raises hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, thereby increasing GFR. B) Efferent arteriole constriction: Constriction of the efferent arteriole increases resistance to outflow from the glomerulus, raising glomerular capillary pressure and thus increasing GFR. D) Decreased oncotic pressure: Oncotic pressure within glomerular capillaries opposes filtration.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A-F, B-F, C-T, D-F A) Mesangial cell contraction increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure – False Mesangial cells are specialized cells surrounding the glomerular capillaries that contract to reduce the surface area available for filtration, which decreases GFR. Their contraction does not increase glomerular hydrostatic pressure; rather, it limits filtration by reducing filtration surface area. B) Mild constriction of efferent arteriole decreases GFR – False Mild constriction of the efferent arteriole actually increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure by restricting outflow, which tends to increase GFR. Only severe constriction would reduce GFR by reducing renal blood flow too much. C) Efferent arteriolar constriction decreases renal blood flow (RBF) – True Constriction of the efferent arteriole increases resistance to blood leaving the glomerulus, thus reducing overall renal blood flow, even though it increases glomerular pressure initially. D) Mesangial cell contraction increases Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure – False Mesangial cells do not affect Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure; this pressure depends mainly on urine flow and downstream resistance, not mesangial contraction. Incorrect Options: Option B: because B is false (mild efferent constriction increases, not decreases, GFR). Option C: because B is false. Option D: because D is false.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Potassium In the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, a positive lumen potential is essential for the paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations like calcium (Ca²) and magnesium (Mg²). This positive transepithelial voltage is primarily generated and maintained by the recycling of potassium ions (K+). Here’s how it works: Na, K+ and 2Cl are transported into the tubular cells from the lumen via the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2). Most K that enters the cell is recycled back into the tubular lumen via ROMK channels (Renal Outer Medullary Potassium channels). This back-leak of K+ into the lumen creates a positive charge in the tubular fluid relative to the interstitium. The resulting positive lumen potential drives paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations (Ca², Mg²) through the tight junctions. Incorrect Options: A) Chloride Chloride is reabsorbed along with Na and K+ but it moves from the lumen into the cell and does not contribute to a positive lumen potential. In fact, Cl- reabsorption helps reduce lumen positivity. B) Sodium Sodium is reabsorbed via NKCC2 and Na/K+ ATPase but does not recycle back into the lumen, so it does not directly maintain the positive lumen potential. D) Ammonium Ammonium may substitute for K+ in NKCC2 transport but plays no significant role in creating or maintaining the positive lumen voltage needed for divalent ion reabsorption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chloride At the end of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), the tubular fluid concentration of chloride (Cl?) is higher relative to water compared to other substances. This is because, in the early PCT, chloride reabsorption is less efficient than that of sodium and water. As water is reabsorbed more quickly, the relative concentration of chloride increases in the tubular fluid. Later in the PCT, chloride is reabsorbed to some extent, but not enough to reduce its concentration below its original level, so its concentration remains relatively unchanged or even elevated. Thus, chloride is the exception—its tubular fluid concentration does not decrease significantly by the end of the PCT. Incorrect Options: A) Amino acids: Amino acids are almost completely reabsorbed in the early PCT via secondary active transport mechanisms. Their concentration in tubular fluid falls dramatically, nearing zero by the end of the PCT. B) Glucose: Like amino acids, glucose is almost entirely reabsorbed in the early PCT via sodium-dependent transporters, so its tubular concentration decreases significantly and is nearly zero in normal conditions.

These cells are part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) and play a key role in tubuloglomerular feedback, a mechanism that helps regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood pressure. Macula densa cells sense the sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration in the tubular fluid.

Prolactin: The primary control of prolactin is inhibitory, mediated by dopamine (also called prolactin-inhibiting hormone). Dopamine is secreted by the hypothalamus and continuously inhibits prolactin release. If the hypothalamic influence is removed (e.g., by stalk section or hypothalamic damage), prolactin levels increase, indicating strong inhibitory control. Growth Hormone (GH): GH secretion is regulated by two hypothalamic hormones: GHRH (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone) – stimulates GH release Somatostatin (also called GHIH, Growth Hormone-Inhibiting Hormone) – inhibits GH release Thus, GH is under both stimulatory and inhibitory control, but inhibition by somatostatin is a significant regulatory mechanism. Because both prolactin and GH are influenced by inhibitory hypothalamic hormones, the correct answer is C. Incorrect Options: A) Prolactin: Partially correct, but incomplete.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Thyroxine Thyroxine (T?) is a lipid-soluble hormone derived from the amino acid tyrosine, and it behaves like a steroid hormone in terms of its mechanism of action. To exert its effects, thyroxine must cross the plasma membrane of target cells and enter the nucleus, where it binds to nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptors) that regulate gene transcription. Although thyroxine is lipophilic, its entry into cells is facilitated by specific transporters rather than passive diffusion, due to its binding to plasma proteins in circulation. Once inside the cell, it is often converted to T? (triiodothyronine), the more active form, which then binds to the nuclear receptor to influence gene expression. Incorrect Options: A) Epinephrine Epinephrine is a water-soluble catecholamine. It does not cross the plasma membrane. Instead, it binds to cell surface receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors), initiating second messenger cascades (e.g., cAMP). C) Glucagon Glucagon is a peptide hormone that acts via cell membrane receptors, primarily on the liver, using second messengers like cAMP. It does not enter the cell. D) Insulin Insulin is also a peptide hormone and acts by binding to membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptors.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) DHEA-S (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) DHEA-S is a sulfated form of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and is exclusively secreted by the adrenal cortex, particularly the zona reticularis. It is an androgen precursor and contributes to the androgen pool in both males and females. In females, DHEA-S plays a role in the development of secondary sexual characteristics and can be converted peripherally into more potent androgens or estrogens. Importantly, DHEA-S is not secreted by the ovaries or other glands—only the adrenal glands produce it, making it a key marker in diagnosing adrenal androgen excess (e.g., adrenal tumors, congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Incorrect Options: A) Progesterone Progesterone is primarily secreted by the ovaries (corpus luteum) and placenta during pregnancy. While small amounts may be produced in the adrenal glands, it is not exclusive to them. B) Testosterone Testosterone is produced by the ovaries in females and by peripheral conversion of adrenal androgens, but not exclusively by the adrenal glands.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Downregulation of Aquaporin 2 receptors In SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion), vasopressin (ADH) levels remain inappropriately elevated, causing excessive water reabsorption through Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) channels in the collecting ducts. This leads to hyponatremia due to dilution of plasma sodium. However, the body has a protective mechanism known as \"vasopressin escape\", which limits further water reabsorption despite continued high ADH levels. This adaptation involves: Downregulation of Aquaporin 2 receptors (channels) in the collecting duct cells, thereby reducing the water permeability of the nephron and blunting the effect of ADH. This allows more water to be excreted, preventing worsening of hyponatremia. Thus, in vasopressin escape, the kidney resists the antidiuretic effect of ADH by reducing AQP2 expression or insertion in the apical membrane. Incorrect Options: A) Decreased ADH secretions Incorrect. In SIADH, ADH secretion is abnormally high and continues despite low plasma osmolality. There is no reduction in ADH levels during vasopressin escape. B) Increased osmolality of urine Incorrect. While urine osmolality is initially high in SIADH, vasopressin escape aims to reduce water reabsorption, eventually causing decreased urine osmolality, not increased. C) Upregulation of Aquaporin 2 production Incorrect. This would enhance water reabsorption and worsen hyponatremia, which is the opposite of what happens during vasopressin escape.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Leptin Leptin is a hormone primarily secreted by adipose tissue, and it plays a permissive role in the initiation of puberty. Leptin signals the hypothalamus that the body has accumulated sufficient energy (fat stores) to support reproductive function. This hormonal signal is necessary for the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which controls puberty. In leptin deficiency (as seen in rare genetic disorders or severe malnutrition), puberty is delayed or absent, highlighting leptin’s critical permissive function—it does not directly trigger puberty but allows the process to proceed by ensuring metabolic readiness. Incorrect Options: B) GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone): GnRH is directly responsible for initiating puberty by stimulating the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. However, it is not permissive—it is a central driver of puberty. Leptin acts upstream to permit GnRH secretion. C) Insulin: While insulin has metabolic effects and plays a role in growth, it does not have a direct permissive or regulatory role in the initiation of puberty. D) GH (Growth Hormone): GH contributes to the growth spurt seen during puberty, but it is a downstream effect and does not initiate or permit puberty.",

These climbing fibers are one of only two afferent fiber systems that synapse directly on Purkinje cells (the other being parallel fibers from granule cells, which are an indirect pathway). Each climbing fiber wraps around the Purkinje cell dendrites, forming powerful excitatory synapses. This connection is crucial for motor learning and timing, and it plays a role in error correction during movement coordination. Incorrect Options: A) Vestibular nucleus Fibers from the vestibular nucleus influence the cerebellum, particularly the flocculonodular lobe, but they do so through mossy fibers, which do not directly synapse on Purkinje cells. Instead, they first synapse on granule cells, whose axons (parallel fibers) then connect to Purkinje cells.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)AThe area marked A represents the Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) in the midbrain, which plays a critical role in descending pain modulation. PAG is activated by non-painful stimuli such as massage, acupuncture, and touch, and it initiates descending inhibitory pathways that suppress pain transmission in the spinal cord. It does this by projecting to the nucleus raphe magnus and the locus coeruleus, which release serotonin and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters act on inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, leading to the release of endogenous opioids like enkephalins and endorphins, which block pain signals. This mechanism underlies the pain-relieving effects of tactile stimuli, making A (PAG) the correct answer.Incorrect Options:Option BThis region likely represents part of the thalamus, which is involved in sensory relay and pain perception, not modulation. The thalamus processes incoming sensory information but does not initiate descending inhibitory control in response to massage or other stimuli.Option CThis area may correspond to the somatosensory cortex, which helps in conscious perception and localization of pain, but it is not involved in descending inhibition. While it interprets pain, it does not suppress it.Option DThis likely refers to the spinal cord dorsal horn, which is the site where pain signals are modulated by descending pathways. However, it is a target, not a source, of modulation. The origin of the descending control lies in higher centers like the PAG (A).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Gating at spinal cord Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) works primarily through the \"gate control theory\" of pain. According to this theory, stimulation of large diameter A-beta sensory fibers by electrical impulses from TENS activates inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This \"gates\" or blocks the transmission of pain signals carried by smaller diameter nociceptive fibers (A-delta and C fibers) to the brain, thus reducing the perception of pain. This gating mechanism happens at the spinal cord level, making the spinal cord the critical site of TENS action. Incorrect Options: A) Adrenergic receptor stimulation: TENS does not primarily act through adrenergic receptors. While the autonomic nervous system may modulate pain, this is not the main mechanism of TENS. B) Descending pain inhibiting pathway: Though descending pathways do modulate pain, the primary and immediate effect of TENS is at the spinal cord level via gating. Descending pathways may play a secondary or modulatory role. C) Supraspinal mechanism of pain inhibition: Supraspinal (brain level) mechanisms can influence pain perception, but TENS’s primary mechanism is spinal gating, not direct supraspinal inhibition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Meissner’s corpuscle Discriminative touch refers to the ability to detect fine touch details such as texture, shape, and vibration, and to localize the exact point of contact on the skin. This sensation is primarily mediated by Meissner’s corpuscles, which are specialized mechanoreceptors located in the dermal papillae of glabrous (hairless) skin, such as the fingertips. Meissner’s corpuscles are highly sensitive to light touch and low-frequency vibrations, making them essential for fine tactile discrimination and texture perception. They transmit signals rapidly through large myelinated A-beta fibers to the brain. Incorrect Options: B) Merkel’s disc Merkel’s discs also contribute to touch sensation but are more involved in sensing pressure and texture with sustained touch, rather than the fine discriminative touch mediated by Meissner’s corpuscles. C) Ruffini’s ending Ruffini endings are slow-adapting mechanoreceptors that respond to skin stretch and contribute to the perception of joint position and sustained pressure, but not primarily discriminative touch. D) Pacinian corpuscle Pacinian corpuscles respond to deep pressure and high-frequency vibration, not fine discriminative touch.",

Due to their location and sensitivity, Pacinian corpuscles are essential for sensing deep mechanical stimuli, such as pressure changes and vibration, helping the body respond to external forces.

According to this law, the sensation felt is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. In simpler terms, as the stimulus intensity increases, the perceived sensation increases, but not linearly; it follows a logarithmic scale. This means that to perceive a noticeable difference in sensation, the stimulus intensity must increase by a certain proportional amount, rather than a fixed amount. Incorrect Options: B) Number of stimulus The law concerns the intensity or magnitude of a single stimulus rather than the number of stimuli. C) Number of nerves While the number of nerves may affect the total input, the Weber-Fechner law focuses on stimulus intensity, not the number of neurons activated.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Vaporization (sweating) At an ambient temperature of 47°C, which is higher than normal body temperature (~37°C), heat loss by conduction, convection, or radiation becomes ineffective because heat tends to flow from hotter to cooler areas. Since the environment is hotter than the body, these passive mechanisms cannot cool the body. Under such conditions, the primary mechanism for heat loss is vaporization (sweating). Sweating allows heat to be lost through the evaporation of water from the skin surface, which requires energy (latent heat of vaporization), thus cooling the body even when the environment is hotter than the skin. Incorrect Options: A) Conduction Conduction transfers heat between two objects in direct contact. If the ambient temperature is higher than body temperature, conduction will actually cause heat gain, not loss. B) Convection Convection involves heat transfer through moving air or fluid. Again, if the surrounding air is hotter than the body, convection adds heat instead of removing it. C) Radiation Radiation involves emission of infrared heat. If the surroundings are hotter, the body will absorb radiant heat instead of losing it.",

The size of each body part's representation in the homunculus correlates with the degree of fine motor control and precision required for movements of that body part, not simply its size or strength. A larger cortical area means that the body part requires more precise and skilled control. For example, the hands and face have the largest representation because they perform intricate and delicate movements. Incorrect Options: A) Low control and skilled movements: This is the opposite of the correct interpretation. Larger cortical areas are associated with high control and high skill. B) High control and less skilled movements: High control generally goes hand-in-hand with skilled, precise movements, not less skilled ones.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anemic hypoxia In a smoke-filled closed room, death is most commonly due to anemic hypoxia, primarily caused by carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with an affinity about 200-250 times greater than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which prevents oxygen binding and transport. This significantly reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to tissue hypoxia despite normal oxygen levels in the air or blood. Because hemoglobin is occupied by CO, oxygen delivery to tissues is impaired, resulting in anemic hypoxia (hypoxia due to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood). Incorrect Options: B) Hypoxemia Hypoxemia refers to low oxygen content in the blood. In CO poisoning, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) may remain normal because oxygen is still present in plasma, but it cannot bind effectively to hemoglobin. C) Ischemic hypoxia Ischemic hypoxia is caused by inadequate blood flow (perfusion) to tissues. In this scenario, blood flow is generally normal; the problem lies with oxygen transport, not delivery. D) All three occurs While multiple types of hypoxia can coexist in some conditions, anemic hypoxia is the primary mechanism in smoke inhalation due to CO poisoning.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bronchus Airway resistance depends on the diameter of the airway and the total cross-sectional area of the airway segment. Although small bronchioles are narrower, the total cross-sectional area of the large bronchi is smaller, and the airflow velocity is higher in larger airways like the bronchus, leading to maximum resistance occurring in the bronchi. The bronchi are relatively narrow tubes that serve as the major conduits for airflow, and the major drop in airflow velocity and increase in resistance happens here. Resistance decreases in smaller airways due to their much larger cumulative cross-sectional area, even though individually they are smaller. Incorrect Options: A) Small bronchioles Though narrower individually, they have a much larger total cross-sectional area, so resistance is lower. B) Respiratory bronchioles These are even smaller but contribute very little to resistance due to large combined cross-sectional area. C) Alveolar duct These are part of the gas exchange units with very large cross-sectional area and thus very low resistance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (D)A drop in pH from 7.4 to 7.3 indicates increased acidity (i.e., metabolic acidosis or respiratory acidosis). This acidosis stimulates central and peripheral chemoreceptors, which in turn stimulate the respiratory centers in the medulla. As a result, alveolar ventilation increases to remove excess CO? and help raise the pH back toward normal.In the graph of alveolar ventilation vs. arterial PCO?, this increased sensitivity causes a leftward shift of the curve — for any given PCO?, ventilation is higher than normal. Hence, the original line (N) shifts left and upwards, which is represented by point D. Incorrect Options:Option A: E E likely represents a shift to the right, which would occur in alkalosis (higher pH), where the ventilatory response is suppressed — opposite of what's expected in acidosis. Option C: FF does not align with the expected increased ventilatory drive. It may be a downward shift, implying lower ventilation, which doesn’t occur in acidosis.Option D: GG may represent a flattened response, possibly due to chronic CO? retention like in COPD, where sensitivity to CO? is blunted — not relevant to an acute drop in pH.",

Factors that cause a rightward shift include: Acidosis (low pH): H? ions reduce hemoglobin's oxygen affinity (Bohr effect). High 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG): Binds to hemoglobin and decreases oxygen affinity. High PCO?: Elevated carbon dioxide increases H? (via carbonic anhydrase), lowering affinity. HbF (Fetal Hemoglobin), however, has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, causing a leftward shift of the OHDC. This means HbF holds on to oxygen more tightly, which helps transfer oxygen from mother to fetus. Incorrect Options: A) Acidosis: Causes a right shift by reducing oxygen affinity. B) High 2,3-BPG: Decreases hemoglobin’s oxygen affinity, causing a right shift. C) High PCO?: Also causes right shift by increasing H? and decreasing affinity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Minimal volume The lung has an intrinsic elastic recoil that causes it to collapse if not held open by the chest wall. Normally, the chest wall’s outward recoil balances the lung’s inward recoil at the Functional Residual Capacity (FRC). If the chest wall is removed and the lung is allowed to recoil freely during expiration, it will collapse to its minimal volume — the smallest volume the lung can have without external pressure. This volume is less than the residual volume (RV) and represents the lung’s recoil limit. Incorrect Options: A) Residual volume (RV): RV is the volume of air remaining after maximal expiration with an intact chest wall. Without the chest wall, the lung collapses further, so volume would be less than RV. B) Functional Residual Capacity (FRC): FRC is the equilibrium volume when the chest wall and lung recoil forces balance each other; without the chest wall, the lung cannot maintain FRC.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypoventilation Hypoxemia refers to low oxygen levels in arterial blood. One important diagnostic tool is the alveolar-arterial (A–a) oxygen gradient, which compares the oxygen content in the alveoli (PAO?) to that in arterial blood (PaO?). A normal A–a gradient suggests that oxygen is being transferred normally from alveoli to blood. In hypoventilation, alveolar ventilation is reduced, leading to a decrease in both alveolar and arterial oxygen pressures. However, because the reduction in PaO? is proportional to the reduction in PAO?, the A–a gradient remains normal. Thus, the gas exchange mechanism across the alveolar-capillary membrane remains intact, and the issue is simply inadequate air reaching the alveoli. Incorrect Options: B) V/Q mismatch In ventilation/perfusion mismatch, some areas of the lung are well-perfused but poorly ventilated, or vice versa. This results in an increased A–a gradient due to inefficient gas exchange. C) Right-to-left (R–L) shunt Blood bypasses ventilated alveoli, leading to poor oxygenation despite normal ventilation, which also causes an increased A–a gradient. D) Increased thickness of alveolar membrane Seen in interstitial lung diseases, this impairs diffusion, especially of oxygen, resulting in a widened A–a gradient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterograde relaxation by VIP release When a bolus of food travels through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the smooth muscle ahead of the bolus must relax to allow its passage. This relaxation ahead of the bolus is called anterograde (or descending) relaxation and is an essential part of peristalsis. This process is mediated by the enteric nervous system, specifically through the release of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Nitric Oxide (NO) by inhibitory motor neurons. These neurotransmitters cause smooth muscle relaxation ahead of the bolus, allowing the gut to dilate and accommodate the moving contents. Although NO also plays a role in relaxation, VIP is specifically associated with anterograde relaxation, which is why it is the most accurate answer here. Incorrect Options: B) Anterograde relaxation by adrenaline release: Adrenaline (epinephrine) can cause smooth muscle relaxation, but it's not the primary neurotransmitter in physiological peristalsis; it's part of the systemic sympathetic response, not enteric control. C) Retrograde relaxation by NO release: NO does cause relaxation, but retrograde (behind the bolus) relaxation is not physiologically accurate during forward movement of food. NO is involved in both directions, but in the context of peristalsis, VIP better explains anterograde (ahead of bolus) relaxation. D) Retrograde relaxation by Ach release: Acetylcholine (ACh) is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the gut, promoting contraction, not relaxation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Serotonin Gastric acid secretion by the parietal cells of the stomach is stimulated primarily by three major substances: gastrin, histamine, and acetylcholine (ACh). These act synergistically to promote HCl secretion, each via different receptors and signaling pathways. Gastrin (from G cells) stimulates parietal cells directly and also promotes histamine release from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. Histamine (from ECL cells) binds to H? receptors on parietal cells, significantly increasing acid secretion. Acetylcholine (from vagal nerve endings) binds to M3 receptors, enhancing HCl secretion. On the other hand, serotonin (5-HT), although involved in GI motility and other regulatory functions, does not directly stimulate gastric acid secretion. In fact, in some contexts, serotonin may inhibit acid secretion or have neutral effects. Incorrect Options: A) Gastrin Stimulates acid secretion both directly and indirectly by acting on ECL cells to release histamine. B) Histamine A potent stimulator of acid secretion via H? receptors on parietal cells. D) Acetylcholine Stimulates parietal cells directly via M3 receptors and promotes gastrin release.",

Leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes (fat cells), acts via the JAK-STAT pathway.

These STATs then translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription, influencing appetite control and energy expenditure.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CCK: I cells of duodenum and pancreas The incorrect match is Option C, because Cholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted by I cells located in the duodenum and jejunum, not in the pancreas. The pancreas does not produce CCK, but rather responds to it. CCK stimulates the pancreas to secrete digestive enzymes and the gallbladder to release bile. The inclusion of “pancreas” as a source of CCK in this option is factually incorrect, making it the right answer to the “incorrect match” question. Incorrect Options: A) Gastrin – G cells of stomach This is a correct match. Gastrin is secreted by G cells located primarily in the antrum of the stomach. It plays a key role in stimulating gastric acid secretion and promoting mucosal growth. B) Motilin – M cells of duodenum and jejunum This is also correct. Motilin is secreted by M cells in the duodenum and jejunum, and it regulates the migrating motor complex (MMC) during fasting, promoting gastric and intestinal motility. D) Secretin – S cells of duodenum and jejunum This match is accurate. Secretin is released by S cells, mainly in the duodenum and to a lesser extent in the jejunum, in response to acidic chyme. It stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate-rich fluid to neutralize gastric acid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Radial artery The Windkessel effect refers to the elastic reservoir function of large, elastic arteries, which helps to maintain continuous blood flow during diastole by stretching during systole and recoiling during diastole. This effect is most prominent in large elastic arteries like the aorta and carotid artery. The radial artery, however, is a muscular artery with less elastic tissue and therefore does not exhibit a significant Windkessel effect. Hence, option D is the correct answer because it does not show the Windkessel effect. Incorrect Options: A) Carotid artery The carotid artery is a large elastic artery with abundant elastic fibers in its wall. It exhibits the Windkessel effect, helping to smooth out pulsatile blood flow from the heart. B) Renal artery Although somewhat smaller than the aorta, the renal artery is still a relatively large artery with elastic properties and thus contributes to the Windkessel effect. C) Aorta The aorta is the classic example of the Windkessel vessel. Its high elasticity stores energy during systole and releases it during diastole to maintain steady blood flow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increase in intrathoracic pressure adds to aortic pressure At the beginning of the Valsalva maneuver (Phase I), the individual forcefully exhales against a closed glottis, which leads to a sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure. This rise in pressure is transmitted to the thoracic aorta, causing an immediate rise in aortic pressure even before any changes in cardiac output occur. This transient increase in aortic (and thus systemic arterial) pressure is responsible for the brief increase in blood pressure observed at the onset of the Valsalva maneuver. This pressure increase is mechanical in nature — not due to increased blood volume or flow, but rather due to external compression of the thoracic aorta by raised intrathoracic pressure. Incorrect Options : A) Increase in intrathoracic pressure adds to LVP: While intrathoracic pressure does influence left ventricular pressure (LVP), it’s the aortic pressure that determines the systemic BP measured externally. LVP alone does not explain the initial rise in measurable BP during Phase I. C) Increase in left atrial pressure: Left atrial pressure may be affected later during the maneuver due to venous return changes, but it does not cause the initial BP rise at the start of the Valsalva maneuver. D) Increase in left ventricular volume: Left ventricular volume may actually decrease due to reduced venous return during subsequent phases. It does not increase at the onset and therefore does not account for the BP rise.",

It extends from one Z line (or Z disc) to the next and contains various structural regions organized symmetrically from the periphery (Z line) toward the center (M line). Here’s the arrangement from periphery to center: Z line – Marks the boundary between adjacent sarcomeres. It anchors actin (thin) filaments. A band – Dark region that corresponds to the entire length of thick (myosin) filaments, including the zone where thin and thick filaments overlap. H zone – The central region of the A band where only thick filaments are present (no overlap with thin filaments).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 1, 4 In skeletal muscle, contraction is triggered by a rapid release of calcium ions (Ca²?) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) — an internal calcium store — and not from the extracellular fluid. This key feature distinguishes skeletal muscle from cardiac and smooth muscle. Extracellular Ca²? is not important for contraction Skeletal muscle contraction relies primarily on Ca²? released from the SR, not on calcium influx from the extracellular space. Blocking extracellular calcium does not significantly affect skeletal muscle contraction, unlike cardiac muscle where extracellular Ca²? influx is essential. Ca²? is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum This is the main source of calcium in skeletal muscle contraction. Upon depolarization of the muscle fiber, the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) mechanically activate ryanodine receptors (RyR1) on the SR membrane, causing calcium release. Incorrect Options: Ca² is released from mitochondria Mitochondria in muscle cells help in ATP production but do not serve as a major source of calcium for contraction. The SR is the principal calcium store in skeletal muscle. Voltage-gated Ca² channel opening is required – (in skeletal muscle) In skeletal muscle, the L-type calcium channels (DHPRs) act more as voltage sensors than calcium channels. Calcium influx through these channels is not required for triggering contraction. This is different from cardiac muscle, where calcium entry through DHPRs is necessary.",

At this point, the inward elastic recoil of the lungs is exactly balanced by the outward recoil of the chest wall. Because these opposing forces are equal and opposite, there is no net pressure being generated across the airway, making the airway pressure equal to atmospheric pressure (zero relative pressure). This is considered a mechanical equilibrium point of the respiratory system, and no airflow occurs at this volume because there is no pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Incorrect Options: A) Residual Volume (RV) At RV, the lungs are at their minimal volume after a maximal expiration. The chest wall is recoiled inward, and the airway pressure is negative, not zero. C) Total Lung Capacity (TLC) At TLC (maximum inspiration), the lungs are maximally inflated, and there is positive pressure in the airways, not zero, due to high elastic recoil forces trying to collapse the lungs.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Anemic hypoxiaCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning causes anemic hypoxia, a condition where the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced. CO has a 200–250 times greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which prevents hemoglobin from binding to and transporting oxygen. Although the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO?) in arterial blood may remain normal, the oxygen content (CaO?) is significantly decreased due to the reduced amount of hemoglobin available to carry oxygen. This results in impaired delivery of oxygen to tissues, characteristic of anemic hypoxia. Incorrect Options: A) Hypoxic hypoxia This occurs when there is low PaO? in arterial blood, such as in high altitudes or respiratory disorders. In CO poisoning, PaO? is typically normal, so this is not the correct type.B) Stagnant hypoxia Also known as circulatory hypoxia, this results from reduced blood flow (e.g., heart failure, shock), not from impaired oxygen-carrying capacity. Therefore, it's not applicable here. D) Histotoxic hypoxia This occurs when tissues are unable to utilize oxygen despite adequate delivery, such as in cyanide poisoning. In CO poisoning, the issue is with oxygen transport, not utilization. .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)TetanyTetany refers to a sustained, fused muscle contraction caused by repeated high-frequency stimulation. This is a characteristic of skeletal muscle, not cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle has a long absolute refractory period (~200–250 ms), which overlaps with most of the contraction phase. This makes it impossible to summate contractions or induce tetany. The heart’s inability to undergo tetany is vital for survival, as tetanic contraction would prevent rhythmic pumping and lead to cardiac arrest. Hence, tetany is NOT a property of cardiac muscle, making it the correct exception.Option A: Large refractory period Cardiac muscle has a prolonged refractory period due to the plateau phase of the action potential (caused by calcium influx). This prevents re-excitation during contraction and protects the heart from tetanic contractions.Option C: All-or-none law Cardiac muscle fibers follow the all-or-none law, especially at the whole-heart level. If a stimulus reaches threshold, the entire myocardium contracts as a unit; if not, there's no contraction at all.Option D: Length–tension relationship Cardiac muscle also follows the Frank-Starling law, which is a version of the length–tension relationship. Greater end-diastolic volume (i.e., stretch) increases contractile force — within physiological limits.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Acetylcholine When blood pressure increases, it activates baroreceptors (primarily in the carotid sinus and aortic arch). These receptors send signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem, which then activates the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibits the sympathetic system. The parasympathetic response is mediated through the vagus nerve, which releases acetylcholine (ACh) at the sinoatrial (SA) node. Acetylcholine acts on muscarinic receptors in the SA node to slow down heart rate (negative chronotropy) by increasing potassium permeability and reducing the rate of depolarization. This is a homeostatic response to lower cardiac output and reduce blood pressure. Incorrect Options : A) Nor-epinephrine This is a sympathetic neurotransmitter that increases heart rate and contractility. It would be active in response to low blood pressure, not high. So, it’s not involved in the SA node response to increased BP. B) Epinephrine Also a sympathomimetic hormone, it stimulates the SA node to increase heart rate. Like norepinephrine, it is part of the sympathetic response, not the baroreceptor-mediated response to high BP. C) Dopamine Dopamine can affect heart rate and vascular tone but is not the primary neurotransmitter involved in baroreceptor-mediated modulation of the SA node. It is not directly involved in this reflex pathway.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is primarily determined by the net filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, which depends on: Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC) – pushes fluid out of capillaries Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure (PBC) – opposes filtration Glomerular oncotic pressure (?GC) – also opposes filtration An increase in Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure (e.g., due to obstruction of the urinary tract or presence of kidney stones) opposes filtration and leads to a reduction in GFR. This is because the pressure in the capsule resists the flow of fluid from the glomerulus, reducing the net driving force for filtration. Incorrect Options: A) Increased RBF (Renal Blood Flow): An increase in RBF usually increases GFR (by raising hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus), not decreases it. Therefore, this would not lead to reduced GFR. B) Increased Glomerular hydrostatic pressure: This is the main driving force for filtration. An increase in this pressure would enhance GFR, not decrease it. D) Decreased Glomerular oncotic pressure: A lower oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries would reduce the opposing force to filtration and thus increase GFR.

It is primarily produced in response to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the body. The kidney is the main site of EPO production in adults, accounting for approximately 85–90% of total erythropoietin synthesis. It is secreted by peritubular interstitial cells in the renal cortex. The liver is a secondary site of erythropoietin production, particularly during the fetal stage of development. In fetuses, the liver is the major source of EPO, and while its role declines after birth, it continues to produce small amounts in adults. Thus, both liver and kidney contribute to erythropoietin production, especially during different life stages, Incorrect Options: B) Kidney and Muscle (BC) Muscle does not produce erythropoietin, so this combination is incorrect. C) Liver, Kidney, and Muscle (ABC) Muscle is not involved in erythropoietin secretion, so including it makes this option incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) B – Adenyl cyclase ? cAMP ? PKA The correct signaling sequence for many G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways, especially those involving the Gs protein, is: Adenyl cyclase (AC) is activated by a G-protein. Activated adenyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP (cyclic AMP). cAMP then acts as a second messenger and activates Protein Kinase A (PKA). So, the proper flow of events is: Adenyl cyclase ? cAMP ? PKA This cascade is fundamental in many hormonal signal transduction pathways (e.g., adrenaline, glucagon). Incorrect Options: A) cAMP ? PKA ? Adenyl cyclase This reverses the initial step. cAMP is produced by adenyl cyclase, not before it. C) cAMP ? Adenyl cyclase ? PKA Again, this reverses the order. Adenyl cyclase must act first to form cAMP. D) Adenyl cyclase ? PKA ? cAMP PKA activation comes after cAMP is formed, not before.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hypercortisolemia The patient's symptoms — thin skin, purple striae, and non-healing wounds — are classical features of hypercortisolemia, most commonly seen in Cushing’s syndrome. Hypercortisolemia refers to an excess of cortisol, either due to endogenous overproduction (e.g., pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor) or exogenous steroid use Cortisol has catabolic effects on skin and connective tissue, leading to: Thinning of the skin Fragile blood vessels, resulting in purple striae Poor wound healing due to impaired fibroblast function and collagen synthesis These hallmark features strongly point to cortisol excess. Incorrect Options: A) Hypothyroidism May cause dry, coarse skin and bradycardia, but not thin skin or purple striae. Wound healing is slowed, but not to the same extent as in cortisol excess. B) Hypercholesterolemia High cholesterol may be associated with xanthomas or cardiovascular disease but not skin thinning or striae. D) Insulin resistance This may cause acanthosis nigricans and increase the risk for poor wound healing, but purple striae and thin skin are not characteristic features.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ca only The Zero phase (Phase 0) of the SA node action potential is the depolarization phase, and it is primarily mediated by the influx of calcium ions (Ca²?). In contrast to ventricular myocytes, which rely on fast Na? channels for rapid depolarization, SA node cells lack these fast Na? channels. Instead, they use L-type (long-lasting) voltage-gated Ca²? channels, which open when the membrane potential reaches a threshold (around –40 mV), causing a slow depolarization (Phase 0) due to Ca²? influx. Thus, the upstroke (Phase 0) in SA node cells is Ca²?-dependent, not Na?-dependent. Incorrect Options: B) Na Fast Na? channels are not present in SA node cells. Sodium does contribute to pacemaker potential (Phase 4), but not to Phase 0. C) K Potassium (K?) efflux is primarily involved in repolarization (Phase 3), not depolarization. D) Ca and Na While Na? plays a role in pacemaker current (If) during Phase 4, the Phase 0 upstroke is due solely to Ca²? influx.",

Forceful expiration against a closed glottis, followed by sudden opening (Note: The statement in the option seems slightly imprecise as it says \"open glottis,\" but in context, it refers to the phase just after glottis reopens — this is often a point of confusion in questions.) 4. Remove harmful substances – This is the purpose of coughing. Thus, statements 1 and 4 together accurately represent the mechanical process and purpose of coughing. Incorrect Options:B) 1,2,3 2 (Expiration against open glottis): This alone is not sufficient for a cough reflex. 3 (Deep inspiration against closed glottis): This describes part of Valsalva maneuver, but it's not specific to the cough mechanism unless followed by forceful expiration.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bronchiectasis The flow-volume loop in bronchiectasis typically shows an obstructive pattern — characterized by a scooped-out or concave expiratory limb due to airflow limitation in the medium and small airways. Bronchiectasis is a chronic obstructive lung disease marked by irreversible dilation of bronchi, often due to repeated infections, cystic fibrosis, or immune deficiencies. This leads to: Mucus plugging Airflow obstruction Reduced peak expiratory flow A concave descending limb on the expiratory part of the loop Such a loop pattern helps distinguish bronchiectasis from restrictive diseases. Incorrect Options:Option A: Chest wall neuromuscular diseaseThese conditions (like muscular dystrophy or kyphoscoliosis) cause a restrictive pattern, which shows a narrowed and small flow-volume loop with reduced lung volumes, but normal loop shape, unlike the scooped expiratory limb seen in bronchiectasis. Option B: SarcoidosiSarcoidosis usually causes a restrictive pattern, with a small but proportionally shaped flow-volume loop. It does not show scooping or airflow obstruction as seen in bronchiectasis.Option C: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)IPF is also a restrictive lung disease, and the flow-volume loop appears tall and narrow with reduced total lung capacity (TLC), but no obstruction pattern or expiratory scooping.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Addison's disease Addison's disease is a form of primary adrenal insufficiency, where the adrenal cortex fails to produce adequate amounts of cortisol and aldosterone. When a patient undergoes bilateral adrenalectomy, they lose the source of these hormones, which can result in: Fatigue and weakness – due to cortisol deficiency Hyperpigmentation – due to increased secretion of ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone). In primary adrenal insufficiency, the lack of cortisol leads to loss of negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, resulting in increased ACTH. ACTH shares a precursor (POMC) with melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which causes skin pigmentation. These symptoms strongly point to Addison’s disease following adrenal removal. Incorrect Options: A) Conn’s syndrome This is primary hyperaldosteronism, characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and alkalosis, not pigmentation or fatigue after adrenalectomy. B) Sheehan syndrome A form of hypopituitarism due to postpartum pituitary infarction, not related to adrenalectomy. Also, it typically leads to secondary adrenal insufficiency, which does not cause pigmentation (ACTH is low). D) Metabolic alkalosis While possible in adrenal disorders (e.g., Conn's), it is a lab finding, not a diagnosis, and doesn’t explain pigmentation and fatigue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adipose tissue Glucose entry into cells occurs via glucose transporters (GLUTs). Some tissues rely on insulin-dependent transporters (like GLUT4), while others use insulin-independent transporters (like GLUT1, GLUT3). Adipose tissue primarily uses GLUT4, which is insulin-dependent. Therefore, glucose uptake into adipose tissue requires insulin, and in its absence (e.g., in type 1 diabetes), glucose entry is significantly reduced. Incorrect Options: A) Heart Although the heart expresses GLUT4 (insulin-dependent), it also expresses GLUT1, which is insulin-independent, ensuring some glucose entry even without insulin. B) Brain The brain uses GLUT1 and GLUT3, which are insulin-independent. Glucose uptake in the brain is not regulated by insulin, ensuring a constant energy supply. D) Skeletal muscle Skeletal muscle predominantly uses GLUT4, which is insulin-dependent, like adipose tissue. However, during exercise, glucose uptake can occur independently of insulin, due to muscle contraction stimulating GLUT4 translocation. So while skeletal muscle and adipose are both insulin-dependent under resting conditions, adipose tissue lacks the exercise-mediated insulin-independent pathway present in muscle, making adipose the best answer for \"not insulin-independent.\"",

This binding stabilizes the T (tense) state of hemoglobin, thereby reducing its affinity for oxygen and facilitating oxygen release to tissues. Incorrect Options: A) Heme part of hemoglobin – Incorrect: 2,3-BPG does not bind to the heme group, which is where oxygen binds. It binds to the globin chains, not the porphyrin ring or central iron. C) Heme part of myoglobin – Incorrect: Myoglobin is a monomeric protein, and 2,3-BPG does not interact with it. It lacks the quaternary structure and central cavity needed for 2,3-BPG binding.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) raises blood calcium levels primarily by stimulating osteoclasts to break down bone matrix, releasing calcium into the bloodstream. Additionally, PTH reduces calcium excretion by the kidneys by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubules, thus conserving calcium. These combined effects lead to an overall increase in serum calcium levels. Incorrect Options: Option A: Increased osteoclast activity This is partially correct but incomplete because PTH not only stimulates osteoclasts to increase bone resorption but also reduces renal calcium excretion, which significantly contributes to raising blood calcium. Option C: Stimulation of osteoblast activity This is incorrect since osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation and calcium deposition into bone, which would lower blood calcium, opposite to PTH’s effect. Option D: Calcium release from osteoblast This is incorrect because osteoblasts do not release calcium; they deposit calcium into bone during formation.

This ability allows us to distinguish two closely spaced points touching the skin, a key function for tactile acuity. Incorrect Options: Option A: Meissner's corpuscles This is incorrect for static two-point discrimination because Meissner's corpuscles are primarily responsible for dynamic touch and detecting light fluttering or movement across the skin, not static discrimination. Option C: Pacinian corpuscles This is incorrect since Pacinian corpuscles detect deep pressure and high-frequency vibration, but they do not contribute to static two-point discrimination. Option D: Ruffini ending / all of the above This is incorrect because Ruffini endings mainly detect skin stretch and sustained pressure, not fine spatial resolution necessary for two-point discrimination.",

Decompression sickness (DCS) occurs when dissolved inert gases (mainly nitrogen) come out of solution and form bubbles in blood and tissues due to rapid decompression. These bubbles can cause mechanical obstruction and trigger inflammatory and coagulation cascades. Hemodilution, which means a decrease in blood concentration or thinning of blood, is not a feature of DCS. In fact, blood viscosity or coagulation abnormalities like thrombosis are more commonly seen. Options: Option A: Hearing loss This is seen in decompression sickness. Inner ear involvement due to bubbles can cause symptoms such as hearing loss or vertigo. Option C: Thrombosis/Coagulopathy This is seen in DCS. Gas bubbles can damage endothelium, activate platelets, and promote coagulation leading to thrombosis and coagulopathy. Option D: Visual disturbance This is seen in DCS due to bubbles affecting the retina or visual pathways.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Increased Bowman Oncotic Pressure does NOT decrease GFR Bowman’s space normally contains almost no proteins, so oncotic pressure here is negligible. Because of this, increased Bowman’s oncotic pressure is physiologically insignificant in affecting GFR. Normally, the oncotic pressure gradient favors filtration, and any increase in Bowman’s oncotic pressure (which is very rare or minimal) does not meaningfully oppose filtration, hence it does not decrease GFR. Thus, unlike the other parameters that clearly reduce filtration pressure or permeability, increased Bowman’s oncotic pressure is not a factor that decreases GFR. Incorrect Options: A. Decreased glomerular coefficient Kf decreases GFR Kf (filtration coefficient) represents the permeability and surface area of the glomerular capillaries. A decrease in Kf (due to damage or loss of filtration surface) lowers GFR by reducing the capacity for fluid to filter through the membrane. Therefore, this decreases GFR and is not the correct answer. B. Increased glomerular oncotic pressure decreases GFR Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure opposes filtration by pulling fluid back into the capillaries. If this oncotic pressure increases (e.g., due to increased plasma proteins), it reduces the net filtration pressure and thereby decreases GFR. C. Reduced glomerular hydrostatic pressure decreases GFR Glomerular hydrostatic pressure drives filtration. Any reduction in this pressure, such as from decreased arterial pressure or dilation of the efferent arteriole, reduces the force pushing fluid into Bowman’s space and thus decreases GFR.",

In the absence or reduction of 2,3-BPG (as in stored blood), hemoglobin holds on to oxygen more tightly, meaning it doesn’t release oxygen to tissues as readily. This causes a leftward shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.Curve B most likely represents this left-shifted curve — indicating:Increased oxygen affinityDecreased oxygen unloading at tissuesThis phenomenon explains why stored blood may have impaired oxygen delivery when transfused.Incorrect Options:Option A: Curve AIncorrect. Likely represents the normal curve — with standard oxygen affinity and tissue delivery, seen in fresh blood with normal 2,3-BPG levels.Option C: Curve CIncorrect. Suggests a right-shifted curve, seen in conditions like anemia, exercise, high altitude, or acidosis, where increased 2,3-BPG enhances oxygen release.

The pinprick (B) produces brief, sharp spikes, characteristic of nociceptor activation (likely A-delta fibers for sharp pain). The pinch with serrated forceps (C) shows sustained mechanical receptor activation without the specific sharp spike activity seen with nociceptors — indicating stimulation of mechanoreceptors, not nociceptors.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Excitation-contraction coupling, Opening of sodium channels on NMJ, and Transmission of impulse from site of stimulus to NMJ all contribute to the latent period The latent period is the brief time between the application of the stimulus and the beginning of muscle contraction. This delay occurs due to several physiological processes that must happen before contraction can start. Transmission of impulse from site of stimulus to NMJ (c): The nerve impulse generated at the stimulation site takes some time to travel along the motor neuron to reach the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Opening of sodium channels on NMJ (b): At the NMJ, the arrival of the nerve impulse causes opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to depolarization of the muscle membrane. This step is crucial before the muscle fiber can respond. Excitation-contraction coupling (a): This refers to the sequence of events following depolarization, including release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which ultimately leads to cross-bridge cycling and muscle contraction. All these steps occur during the latent period, causing the delay before visible contraction begins. Incorrect Options: D) Including pumping of calcium back to sarcoplasmic reticulum (d) is incorrect Pumping calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum happens during relaxation, after contraction has occurred. It is involved in terminating the contraction, not the initiation phase. Therefore, it does not contribute to the latent period.",

      "solution": "Correct answer (A) B12 deficiency After gastrectomy, the patient is at high risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because the stomach produces intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin B12 absorption in the terminal ileum. Lack of intrinsic factor leads to poor absorption of B12, resulting in deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which affects the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts. This leads to sensory ataxia (positive Romberg sign), decreased proprioception and vibration sense, and peripheral neuropathy manifesting as numbness and paresthesia, especially in the lower limbs. The neurological signs described—Romberg positive and sensory deficits—are classic for B12 deficiency neuropathy, making it the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Optons: B) Iron deficiency anemia Iron deficiency primarily causes microcytic anemia and does not typically cause neurological symptoms such as positive Romberg sign or peripheral neuropathy. C) Diabetic peripheral neuropathy While diabetic neuropathy can cause numbness and sensory loss, the question specifically mentions gastrectomy and Romberg positivity, which is more indicative of dorsal column involvement seen in B12 deficiency. Also, diabetic neuropathy rarely causes a positive Romberg. D) Folate deficiency Folate deficiency can cause anemia similar to B12 deficiency but does not cause neurological symptoms. Neuropathy and positive Romberg are not features of folate deficiency.",

They are most sensitive to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and play a critical role in stimulating ventilation when arterial oxygen tension (PaO?) falls, especially below about 60 mmHg. When oxygen levels drop, these receptors rapidly increase their firing rate, signaling the respiratory centers in the brainstem to increase breathing rate and depth to restore oxygen levels. Incorrect Options: B) Hypercapnia Although peripheral chemoreceptors respond to increased CO? levels (hypercapnia), the central chemoreceptors located in the medulla are more sensitive to changes in CO? and pH levels. Thus, central chemoreceptors play the dominant role in detecting hypercapnia. C) Alkalosis Alkalosis (high blood pH) tends to depress ventilation. Peripheral chemoreceptors do not primarily respond to alkalosis. D) Acidosis Peripheral chemoreceptors do respond to acidosis (low pH), but their sensitivity to hypoxia is greater. Central chemoreceptors mainly sense changes in pH related to CO?.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inadequately perfused alveoli Physiological dead space includes the total volume of the lungs that does not participate in gas exchange. It consists of the anatomical dead space (airways where no gas exchange occurs, like the trachea and bronchi) plus any alveoli that are ventilated but not adequately perfused with blood. These alveoli receive air but no or insufficient blood flow, so gas exchange cannot happen effectively. Hence, physiological dead space is mainly due to alveoli that are ventilated but poorly perfused, making option B correct. Incorrect Options: A) Inadequately ventilated alveoli This describes alveoli that are poorly ventilated but may still be perfused. These contribute to shunt or V/Q mismatch but not dead space because dead space requires ventilation without perfusion. C) Less than anatomical dead space Physiological dead space is usually equal to or greater than anatomical dead space because it includes anatomical dead space plus any alveoli that are not perfused. It cannot be less than anatomical dead space. D) Can be measured by spirometry Spirometry measures volumes and flow but cannot directly measure dead space. Physiological dead space is typically measured using the Bohr equation which requires analysis of expired CO?, not just spirometry.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Myenteric plexus is in lamina propria The myenteric plexus (Auerbach’s plexus) is actually located between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract, not in the lamina propria. The lamina propria is a layer of loose connective tissue found within the mucosa, which lies more internally and contains blood vessels, immune cells, and some nerve fibers but does not house the myenteric plexus. This makes option D the wrong statement and thus the correct answer for the “except” question. Incorrect Options: A. Interstitial cells of Cajal are pacemaker cells – True These specialized cells act as electrical pacemakers in the gastrointestinal tract. They generate slow-wave potentials that coordinate smooth muscle contractions, regulating gut motility. Their role as pacemakers is well established. B. It can act independently – True The enteric nervous system (ENS) is often called the \"second brain\" because it can operate independently of the central nervous system. It can regulate motility, secretion, and blood flow within the gut autonomously, though it also receives modulatory input from the autonomic nervous system. C. All afferents are vagi – False This is actually incorrect as a standalone statement, but here it is presented as a true statement for this question’s format. Not all afferent fibers of the ENS come from the vagus nerve; some afferents originate from spinal sensory neurons. However, this option is generally accepted as true in a simplified context because the majority of parasympathetic afferent input to the gut is carried by the vagus nerve. The question is about which is not true, and D is clearly the wrong statement about the location of the myenteric plexus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Decreased arterial compliance Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In old age, arteries, especially the large elastic arteries like the aorta, lose their elasticity and become stiffer, a phenomenon known as decreased arterial compliance. This stiffening causes the arteries to be less able to expand during systole when the heart ejects blood, resulting in a higher systolic pressure. At the same time, the diastolic pressure may not rise correspondingly, leading to an increased pulse pressure. This increased pulse pressure is a hallmark of arterial aging and is linked to cardiovascular risks such as left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Incorrect Options: Since options B, C, and D are not specified, typical incorrect causes might include factors like changes in stroke volume or heart rate, which have lesser impact on pulse pressure changes in elderly compared to arterial compliance. B) (e.g., Increased stroke volume): While an increased stroke volume can increase pulse pressure, this is generally not the primary cause in the elderly population where arterial stiffness dominates. C) (e.g., Increased peripheral resistance): Peripheral resistance primarily affects diastolic pressure rather than pulse pressure directly, and it tends to rise slowly with age but is not the main driver of increased pulse pressure. D) (e.g., Decreased heart rate): Changes in heart rate affect cardiac output and systolic pressure but are not the key determinants of the widened pulse pressure seen with aging.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Evaporation At high ambient temperatures close to or exceeding body temperature (around 37°C), traditional heat loss methods like radiation, conduction, and convection become less effective or may even cause heat gain rather than loss. In hot and dry environments like Jaisalmer (40°C and low humidity of 20%), evaporation becomes the primary mechanism for heat loss. The body loses heat by sweating, where water from sweat evaporates from the skin surface, taking heat energy with it. The low humidity in the air favors efficient evaporation, making this the main way the body cools down in such conditions. Incorrect Options: A) Radiation: Heat loss by radiation depends on the temperature gradient between the body and the environment. At 40°C ambient temperature, the body is roughly the same temperature or cooler than the surroundings, so radiation is minimal or heat gain occurs instead. B) Conduction: This requires direct contact with a cooler surface to transfer heat. In a hot desert environment, surfaces are often hot, so conduction does not contribute significantly to heat loss. C) Convection: This relies on cooler air moving over the skin to carry away heat. However, when air temperature is very high (40°C), convection is ineffective or may even result in heat gain from the surrounding air.",

While beta 1 agonists increase systolic blood pressure by enhancing cardiac output, they generally do not decrease diastolic blood pressure. In fact, their effect on diastolic pressure is minimal or can sometimes slightly increase due to increased cardiac output. Beta 1 agonists do not cause vasodilation and thus do not lower peripheral vascular resistance, which is the main determinant of diastolic blood pressure. Incorrect Options: A) Vascular smooth muscle relaxant: These agents cause vasodilation by relaxing the vascular smooth muscle, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, thereby lowering diastolic blood pressure. B) Alpha 1 blocker: Alpha 1 receptors mediate vasoconstriction. Blocking these receptors results in vasodilation and decreased peripheral resistance, which lowers diastolic blood pressure.

While catecholamines can increase blood glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, hyperglycemia does not feed back to cause adrenal medullary secretion. Incorrect Options: A) Standing up When a person stands up suddenly, gravity causes pooling of blood in the lower extremities, leading to a transient drop in blood pressure. This activates the sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the adrenal medulla to release catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) to increase heart rate and vasoconstriction, thus maintaining blood pressure. C) Smoking Nicotine in cigarette smoke stimulates nicotinic receptors in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia, leading to increased catecholamine release. D) Exercise Exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system to meet increased metabolic demand, triggering the adrenal medulla to secrete catecholamines which increase heart rate, cardiac output, and mobilize energy substrates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ca²? influx only In the SA node, the upstroke of the action potential (Phase 0) is primarily caused by the influx of calcium ions through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Unlike typical cardiac myocytes where Phase 0 is due to rapid sodium influx, the SA node cells have very few fast sodium channels. Instead, the slower calcium influx leads to a slower, more gradual depolarization phase, which is characteristic of pacemaker cells. This calcium influx triggers the action potential and initiates the heartbeat. Incorrect Options: B) Na? influx via voltage-gated sodium channels This is true for ventricular and atrial myocytes where Phase 0 is a rapid depolarization caused by fast sodium channels. However, in the SA node, these sodium channels are largely absent or inactive, so Na? influx does not contribute significantly to the upstroke. C) K? efflux Potassium efflux contributes mainly to repolarization phases (Phase 3) of the cardiac action potential, not to the depolarization or upstroke phase. D) Influx of both Ca²? and Na? In the SA node, the upstroke is almost exclusively due to calcium influx. Sodium influx plays a minimal role in pacemaker cell depolarization; thus, this option is incorrect.",

The phase labeled C to D represents repolarization, which occurs immediately after the peak of depolarization (point C).During this phase, voltage-gated potassium (K?) channels open, allowing K? to exit the cell. This outward movement of positively charged potassium ions causes the membrane potential to become more negative, bringing it back toward the resting state. Hence, K? efflux (going outside) is the key event in this phase.Incorrect Options:Option A: Na? coming inside the cellIncorrect. This occurs during depolarization (B to C), not during repolarization. It is responsible for the rising phase of the action potential, not its fall.Option B: Na? going outside the cellIncorrect. Sodium does not exit the cell actively during this phase. Na? influx stops, but the active efflux is via Na?/K? ATPase over longer durations, not the immediate cause of this phase.Option D: K? coming inside the cellIncorrect.

Hence, adipose tissue does not have insulin-independent glucose transporters. Incorrect Options: A) Pancreas Certain pancreatic cells, like beta cells, express insulin-independent glucose transporters (mainly GLUT1 and GLUT2), allowing glucose to enter the cells without insulin. This is important for glucose sensing and insulin secretion. B) Brain The brain uses GLUT1 (in the blood-brain barrier) and GLUT3 (in neurons), both of which are insulin-independent.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Is inside thick muscle layer This statement is incorrect, making it the correct choice for this question. Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus are located in the adventitia (outermost layer of the blood vessel), not within the thick muscular layer (media). Their superficial location allows them to be sensitive to changes in arterial wall stretch or pressure, which would be dampened if they were embedded deep within thick muscle. This anatomical positioning is essential for their function as pressure sensors. Incorrect Options: A) Express several non-selective cation channels This is correct. Baroreceptors express mechanosensitive, non-selective cation channels such as Piezo1 and Piezo2, which help transduce mechanical stretch into electrical signals. B) Glossopharyngeal nerve branch is the afferent This is correct. Afferent signals from carotid sinus baroreceptors travel via the Hering’s nerve, a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). C) Needs mechanical transducer This is correct.

The assertion is true because the resting membrane potential is influenced by the distribution of various ions, including large anionic intracellular proteins and phosphate ions, which cannot cross the membrane. These contribute to the negative charge inside the cell, stabilizing the RMP along with the influence of permeable ions like K?, Na?, and Cl?. The reason is also true: the Nernst equation is used to calculate the equilibrium potential (diffusion potential) for a single ion based on its concentration gradient across the membrane. However, this does not explain how proteins and phosphate ions contribute to the RMP, because the Nernst equation applies only to ions that can diffuse across the membrane. Since proteins and phosphate ions are impermeable, their effect on membrane potential is indirect and not modeled by the Nernst equation. Therefore, while both statements are true, the reason does not explain the assertion, making option B the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A) Both are true, reason is the correct explanation Incorrect because the Nernst equation does not account for impermeable anions like proteins or phosphates, and therefore doesn't explain their contribution to RMP.

(as in exercising muscle), the curve rises steeply and saturates quickly. This makes myoglobin an effective oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue.Incorrect Options:Option A: Fetal HbIncorrect. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has a left-shifted sigmoid curve compared to adult hemoglobin due to its higher affinity for oxygen, but it still displays cooperativity, so the curve would not be hyperbolic.Option C: CarboxyhemoglobinIncorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) ABCD The ventricular action potential has five phases (0–4), and the events occur in the following order: Phase 0 – Rapid Depolarization (A) The opening of voltage-gated sodium channels allows a sudden influx of Na?, rapidly depolarizing the cell. Phase 1 – Initial Repolarization (B) This is caused by the transient outward flow of K? through transient outward (I_to) K? channels, creating a brief, partial repolarization. Phase 2 – Plateau Phase (C) Voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type) open, allowing Ca²? influx, which is balanced by delayed K? efflux, resulting in a plateau in membrane potential. Phase 3 – Final Repolarization (D) The repolarizing K? currents (through delayed rectifier K? channels) dominate, restoring the resting membrane potential. Incorrect Options: A) CDAB This starts with calcium influx (plateau phase) before depolarization—incorrect order of events. C) CADB Begins with calcium influx, then depolarization by sodium—this is out of physiological sequence. D) BACD Starts with potassium efflux (initial repolarization) before sodium channel opening, which reverses the natural initiation of the action potential.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) is a metabolite produced in red blood cells that plays a key role in regulating oxygen delivery by hemoglobin. It binds specifically to the beta chains of deoxyhemoglobin (the T or tense state). This binding stabilizes the T state, thereby reducing hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen. As a result, oxygen is more readily released to the tissues — a critical adaptation during conditions like high altitude or hypoxia. 2,3-BPG fits into the central cavity formed between the two beta chains of the hemoglobin tetramer. By doing this, it shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, promoting oxygen release. Incorrect Options: A) Bind alpha chain 2,3-BPG does not bind to the alpha chains. The central cavity where 2,3-BPG binds is formed between the beta chains. C) Bind gamma chain The gamma chains are present in fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which has a lower affinity for 2,3-BPG. This helps HbF retain oxygen more efficiently — the opposite of what 2,3-BPG does in adult hemoglobin (HbA). D) Bind both alpha and beta 2,3-BPG specifically binds only to beta chains in the central pocket of HbA and does not interact with alpha chains.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The fluid leaving the PCT is isotonic, regardless of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) presence. The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) reabsorbs approximately 65-70% of the filtered water and solutes (like sodium, chloride, glucose, and amino acids) in equal proportion, maintaining the same osmolality as the plasma — i.e., it remains isotonic (~300 mOsm/kg). Although ADH plays a critical role in water reabsorption later in the nephron (mainly in the collecting ducts), it has no significant influence on PCT function. Thus, the absence or presence of ADH does not affect the tonicity of the fluid exiting the PCT. Incorrect Options: B) Hypertonic Fluid does not become hypertonic in the PCT because water and solutes are reabsorbed proportionally. Hypertonicity occurs in the deeper parts of the medulla, particularly in the loop of Henle and collecting ducts, under influence of ADH. C) Hypotonic Hypotonic fluid is seen after the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which reabsorbs Na? without water. The PCT, however, reabsorbs water and solutes equally, resulting in isotonic fluid. D) Depends on fluid intake Fluid intake influences ADH levels and urine concentration, but it does not change the tonicity of fluid leaving the PCT. The PCT consistently maintains isotonicity regardless of hydration status.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The macula densa is a specialized group of epithelial cells located at the junction of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). This area is part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), which helps regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood pressure through tubuloglomerular feedback. These cells sense sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration in the tubular fluid. When NaCl levels are low, macula densa cells signal the juxtaglomerular cells in the adjacent afferent arteriole to release renin, thereby activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Incorrect Options: B) Between collecting duct and descending limb This option is anatomically incorrect. The collecting duct is far downstream of both the loop of Henle and DCT, and the descending limb is part of the loop of Henle that is higher up in the nephron's structure. There is no functional interaction between these segments relevant to macula densa. C) Between PCT and ascending limb The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is located before the loop of Henle begins. While these two segments are sequential, macula densa is not located at their junction. D) Between DCT and CD (collecting duct) While DCT and collecting duct are anatomically adjacent, the macula densa is not located here.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cardiac output (CO) refers to the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is a critical parameter for assessing cardiovascular function. The following methods are used to measure or estimate it: 1. Echocardiography (ECHO): A non-invasive method using ultrasound. By calculating stroke volume (volume of blood ejected per beat) through imaging and multiplying by heart rate, cardiac output can be derived. 2. Fick’s Principle: This principle calculates cardiac output based on the measurement of oxygen consumption and the difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood. It is considered a gold standard but is invasive. 3. Dye Dilution Method: This involves injecting a dye into the bloodstream and measuring its concentration downstream over time. The area under the dilution curve helps estimate cardiac output. It is a type of indicator dilution technique. These three techniques are validated and widely used in clinical or research settings to measure cardiac output Incorrect Options: 4. Ventilation-Perfusion Scan This is primarily used in pulmonary medicine to assess lung ventilation and perfusion, especially to detect pulmonary embolism. It does not measure cardiac output, making it the incorrect choice. Option A (1 & 4): Incorrect because option 4 (V/Q scan) does not calculate cardiac output. Option B (2 & 3): While correct, it is not complete since ECHO (option 1) is also a valid method. Option D (1, 3 & 4): Again, includes the incorrect V/Q scan (option 4), which invalidates the choice.",

The sequence is carefully regulated and involves the following steps: B. Inspiration against the closed glottis – This increases intra-abdominal pressure and is a preparatory step in vomiting. It helps build the necessary pressure in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. D. Reverse peristalsis in the small intestine – Contents from the small intestine are moved backward into the stomach as part of the retching phase. This movement helps in bringing the contents closer to the esophagus. A. Contraction of diaphragm and abdominal muscles – These contractions further increase intra-abdominal pressure, aiding in the expulsion of gastric contents. C. LES (Lower esophageal sphincter) and UES (Upper esophageal sphincter) open – The final step allows the contents to move from the stomach through the esophagus and out of the mouth.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) During muscle contraction, the detachment of the myosin head from the actin filament occurs when a new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head. This binding induces a conformational change in the myosin head, reducing its affinity for actin and causing it to release from the actin-binding site. This is a critical step in the cross-bridge cycle, allowing the cycle to continue and the muscle to relax or re-contract. Without ATP, the myosin remains tightly bound to actin, which is what happens in rigor mortis—a post-mortem condition where ATP levels drop and muscles stiffen due to the inability of myosin to detach from actin. Incorrect Options: B) Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi Hydrolysis of ATP re-energizes the myosin head, preparing it for the next power stroke, but it does not cause detachment from actin. C) Decrease in sarcoplasmic calcium A drop in calcium leads to inactivation of troponin, which prevents further binding of myosin to actin, but it doesn’t directly cause detachment once myosin is already bound. D) Power stroke The power stroke is the force-generating step where myosin pulls actin inward after releasing Pi. It occurs after the myosin has already bound to actin, not during detachment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gate control mechanism The primary physiological basis of TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) is the Gate Control Theory of Pain, proposed by Melzack and Wall in 1965. According to this theory, non-painful input (such as electrical stimulation of large diameter afferent Aβ fibers) can inhibit the transmission of pain signals from small diameter nociceptive fibers (Aδ and C fibers) at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. By \"closing the gate\" at this spinal level, the perception of pain is reduced or blocked before it reaches the brain. TENS machines stimulate the sensory nerves without activating pain pathways, leveraging this mechanism to relieve pain effectively. Incorrect Options: B) Descending pain inhibiting tract While TENS may have some secondary influence on descending inhibitory systems (e.g., serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways), this is not the primary mechanism. Gate control remains the main physiological explanation. C) Sensitization of nerves TENS reduces rather than induces sensitization. Sensitization (particularly central or peripheral) refers to heightened sensitivity to pain and is associated with chronic pain, not a mechanism of pain relief. D) Central inhibition Central inhibition refers more to brain-level modulation of pain perception, such as that seen with opioids or cognitive factors.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) b, c, d, e are correct Countercurrent mechanisms are physiological processes where two fluids flow in opposite directions to exchange heat, ions, or gases efficiently. This mechanism is present in several body systems: B) Testes The pampiniform plexus acts as a countercurrent heat exchanger, helping to cool arterial blood entering the testes by transferring heat to the venous blood leaving the testis. This maintains the optimal temperature for spermatogenesis. C) Gut In the villi of the small intestine, a countercurrent exchange of oxygen between arterioles and venules can occur, which may lead to hypoxia at the villus tip under certain conditions, affecting nutrient absorption. D) Kidney The classic example of a countercurrent mechanism. In the loop of Henle, the descending and ascending limbs create a countercurrent multiplier system which is essential for urine concentration. Additionally, the vasa recta acts as a countercurrent exchanger to maintain the osmotic gradient in the renal medulla. E) Lungs Although not a \"true\" countercurrent system like in fish gills, some microvascular arrangements in the lung, especially in gas exchange at the alveolar-capillary interface, can exhibit functional similarities to countercurrent exchange under certain pathological or compensatory conditions. Incorrect Option: A) Eye The eye does not exhibit a countercurrent exchange system for physiological processes. Heat, nutrient, or gas exchange in ocular tissues occurs via conventional capillary flow and diffusion, not via countercurrent arrangements.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Respiratory acidosis At high altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere is significantly reduced, leading to hypobaric hypoxia. The body initiates several physiological adaptations to cope with the low oxygen availability. However, respiratory acidosis is not one of them. At high altitudes, the body responds by increasing ventilation (hyperventilation) to improve oxygen uptake. This leads to increased exhalation of CO?, resulting in a decrease in arterial CO? (PaCO?). The drop in CO? causes a respiratory alkalosis, not acidosis. Hence, respiratory acidosis does not occur as part of high-altitude adaptation. Incorrect Options: A) Pulmonary vasoconstriction Correct physiological response In response to alveolar hypoxia, pulmonary arteries constrict, a phenomenon known as hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. While this helps redirect blood to better-ventilated areas of the lung, it can also lead to pulmonary hypertension at high altitudes. B) Increased heart rate Correct physiological response To compensate for reduced oxygen delivery, the sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate (tachycardia) to maintain oxygen perfusion to vital organs. C) Polycythemia Correct long-term adaptation With prolonged exposure to high altitude, the body increases erythropoietin secretion, stimulating the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, leading to polycythemia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All the mechanisms listed for the substances are accurate. Oxygen (O?) crosses biological membranes by simple diffusion because it is a small, nonpolar molecule that can freely diffuse down its concentration gradient. Glucose enters cells via facilitated diffusion using specific carrier proteins like GLUT transporters, as glucose is polar and cannot pass through lipid bilayers unaided. Sodium ion (Na?) often moves via secondary active transport, where its electrochemical gradient drives the transport of other molecules (e.g., glucose-sodium cotransport). Calcium ion (Ca²?) is moved out of the cell or into organelles via primary active transport pumps like the Ca²?-ATPase, which directly use ATP to move Ca²? against its gradient. Na? voltage gated channels are protein channels that open in response to changes in membrane potential, allowing rapid influx of Na? during action potentials—this is a form of passive transport through gated ion channels. Incorrect Options: Option A: Excludes glucose and Na? voltage gated channels which are correctly matched, so it is incomplete.

Plasma volume depletion This is incorrect because heat acclimatization actually leads to plasma volume expansion (an increase in plasma volume) rather than depletion.

The thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus remains responsive and continues to regulate body temperature effectively; it does not stop responding. C.

As a result, surfactant molecules become more concentrated. Although surfactant works to reduce surface tension, when alveoli shrink, the relative effectiveness of surfactant is reduced, leading to a slight increase in surface tension.Additionally, Laplace's law states that smaller alveoli (like during expiration) would experience greater inward pressure due to surface tension. This is why surfactant is especially important in preventing alveolar collapse during expiration, but surface tension does increase compared to inspiration.Incorrect Options:B. Inspiration Incorrect. During inspiration, alveoli expand, and surfactant molecules are more evenly distributed across a larger surface area. This results in a reduction in surface tension.C. Standing Incorrect. Body posture may affect lung volumes and ventilation-perfusion ratios, but it does not directly influence alveolar surface tension like the phases of respiration do.D. Supine Incorrect.

This reflex causes a triad of effects:Hypopnea (? respiratory rate) The reflex inhibits respiratory centers, leading to shallow or reduced breathing.Bradycardia (? heart rate) Due to vagal stimulation, the heart rate decreases.Hypotension (? blood pressure) Caused by vasodilation and decreased cardiac output due to reduced sympathetic tone and bradycardia.These features help protect the heart during ischemic or volume-depleted states by lowering its workload.Incorrect Option:2. Tachycardia This is not a feature of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. In fact, bradycardia is the hallmark. Tachycardia would be expected in reflexes like Bainbridge reflex (atrial stretch-induced).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)Alpha wavesAlpha waves are brain waves seen on an EEG in a normal awake person who is relaxed with eyes closed. They typically have a frequency of 8–13 Hz and are most prominent in the occipital cortex.When a person opens their eyes, becomes alert, or starts engaging with the environment, alpha wave activity diminishes. This phenomenon is known as “alpha block” or desynchronization.The EEG shifts toward beta wave activity (higher frequency, lower amplitude) associated with alertness and active thought.Incorrect Options:A. Beta waves Beta waves (13–30 Hz) are associated with active mental concentration and alertness. These waves increase, not decrease, when eyes are opened or during mental activity.B. Theta waves Theta waves (4–7 Hz) are seen during drowsiness, light sleep (NREM 1 stage), or in children. Not typically prominent in a normal relaxed adult at rest with eyes closed.D. Delta waves Delta waves (0.5–4 Hz) are associated with deep sleep (NREM 3/4). These are not affected by eye opening in the awake state because they are not normally present.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)25 HzThe tetanizing frequency is the minimum frequency at which repeated stimuli result in fused, sustained muscle contraction (complete tetanus) rather than discrete twitches. To calculate it, we first determine the total time of a single muscle twitch:Latent period: 10 msContraction period: 40 msRelaxation period: 40 msTotal twitch time = 90 msTo produce complete tetanus, stimuli must occur faster than this 90 ms cycle, typically 2–3 times per twitch. Thus, the tetanizing frequency is: <math>Tetanizing frequency?100090×2.5?25–30 Hz\\text{Tetanizing frequency} ? \\frac{1000}{90} \\times 2.5 ? 25–30 \\text{ Hz}</math>Tetanizing frequency?901000×2.5?25–30 Hz Among the choices, 25 Hz is the best approximation and the correct answer.Incorrect options:Option A: 20 Hz This frequency corresponds to one stimulus every 50 ms, which is longer than the contraction-relaxation cycle, leading only to incomplete (unfused) tetanus, not full tetanus. Hence, it is too low. Option B: 30 Hz This is a possible tetanizing frequency, but it is higher than the minimum required. While still physiologically acceptable, 25 Hz is the more accurate minimum frequency, making 30 Hz an incorrect choice based on this question’s context. Option C: 40 Hz Similar to 30 Hz, this frequency is well above the required level to achieve tetanus. Although effective, it's not the best answer since the question asks for the calculated tetanizing frequency, and 25 Hz is a better match based on the twitch duration.",

These mechanisms are proactive, unlike feedback systems which are reactive.An example is temperature regulation, especially when the body prepares for heat loss or gain in advance—likeShivering before the core temperature has dropped significantlyVasodilation/sweating initiated before the core gets overheated (based on skin temperature)Such anticipatory adjustments are made based on external cues or early signs to prevent a larger disturbance, which is the essence of feedforward control.Incorrect Options:A. HR increases from supine to standingThis is a feedback response. Baroreceptors detect a drop in blood pressure due to gravity and then adjust the heart rate to maintain perfusion. It's a reactive correction.B. Vasoconstriction in response to coolingAlso a feedback mechanism. The body detects a drop in temperature and reacts by conserving heat through vasoconstriction. This happens after the stimulus is sensed.C. Increase in cardiac output in response to anemiaThis is also feedback. The reduced oxygen-carrying capacity is detected, and in response, the heart pumps faster/harder to compensate. It is a compensatory adjustment, not anticipatory.",
