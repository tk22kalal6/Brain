      "map_id": 34892117,
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 2 years This is the correct answer because, in a patient with a first episode of schizophrenia who is now stable, current psychiatric guidelines recommend continuing antipsychotic medication for at least 1 to 2 years after symptom remission. This reduces the risk of relapse and helps consolidate recovery. Since this patient has no family history and is doing well on treatment, 2 years is an appropriate and evidence-based duration. Option A. 5 years This duration is usually reserved for patients who have multiple episodes, poor response to treatment, frequent relapses, or other risk factors like a strong family history or poor medication adherence. Continuing treatment for 5 years in a patient with a first episode and low relapse risk may expose the patient to unnecessary long-term side effects of antipsychotics without clear added benefit. Option B. 6 months This is too short for maintenance treatment after a first episode of schizophrenia. Stopping antipsychotics after just 6 months is associated with a high risk of relapse, even if the patient seems stable. Guidelines do not recommend discontinuation this early, especially in the first episode. Option D. 12 months While 12 months (1 year) of treatment may be considered in some low-risk cases, it is generally considered the minimum threshold. However, most experts and guidelines prefer extending to 2 years to further reduce the risk of relapse. Therefore, while this is not entirely wrong, it is less optimal than 2 years.",

Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects more women than men and has its onset between ages 20 and 50 years. The psychiatric symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, lability of mood, depression, and psychosis. Symptoms of thisdisease also predominately include psychosis, apathy, or depression, along with intermittent abdominal pain, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.

This is inferred by what the patient spontaneously expresses, as well as responses to specific questions aimed at eliciting particular pathology. Some patients may perseverate or ruminate on specific content or thoughts. They may focus on material that is considered obsessive or compulsive. Obsessional thoughts are unwelcome and repetitive thoughts that intrude into the patient’s consciousness. They are generally ego alien, ego dystonic and are resisted by the patient. Compulsions are repetitive, ritualized behaviors that patients feel compelled to perform to avoid an increase in anxiety or some dreaded outcome. Another large category of thought content pathology is delusions. Delusions are false, fixed ideas that are not shared by others and can be divided into bizarre and nonbizarre (nonbizarre delusions refer to thought content that is not true but is not out of the realm of possibility). Common delusions include grandiose, erotomanic, jealous, somatic, and persecutory.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Digit Span Forward Digit span forward is a standard and reliable test for assessing immediate memory. In this test, the examiner reads a sequence of numbers, and the individual is asked to repeat them in the exact order. Since the task only requires the person to recall the information immediately without manipulating it, it directly evaluates the brain's capacity for short-term storage and recall. Immediate memory is concerned with holding a small amount of information for a brief time, typically a few seconds. This makes digit span forward the correct and most appropriate test for this specific type of memory. Incorrect Option: B. Digit Span Backward While digit span backward is similar in format to digit span forward, it is not a test of immediate memory. In this variation, the individual is required to repeat the digits in reverse order, which introduces a level of complexity. This additional cognitive load means the task is testing working memory rather than immediate memory. Working memory involves both storing and manipulating information temporarily, which distinguishes it from immediate memory. Therefore, although related, digit span backward is not appropriate when the goal is to assess immediate memory specifically. C. Subtraction Test 20–1 The subtraction test 20–1 involves repeatedly subtracting 1 from 20 and is used to assess attention, concentration, and mental calculation abilities. It does not directly evaluate a person’s ability to recall recently presented information. Instead, the task measures the person’s ability to focus and perform simple arithmetic operations under mental strain. This is a task of sustained attention rather than memory. Therefore, it is not suitable for testing immediate memory. D. Subtraction Test 100–7 (Serial Sevens) The serial sevens task involves repeatedly subtracting 7 from 100 and is often used in mental status examinations to evaluate concentration, attention, and working memory. Like option C, it is a task that requires continuous focus and mental processing. The individual needs to hold the current number in mind while performing a new calculation, which engages working memory. This test does not measure the immediate recall of information that was just heard or seen, and hence, it does not assess immediate memory. Therefore, this option is incorrect in the context of the question.",

      "solution": "A. Hypersexual behavior (Ref: Kaplan Synopsis of Psychiatry 11th edn) “The average age of onset of conduct disorder is younger in boys than in girls. Boys most commonly meet the diagnostic criteria by 10 to 12 years of age, whereas girls often reach 14 to 16 years of age before the criteria are met. Children who meet the criteria for conduct disorder express their overt aggressive behavior in various forms. Aggressive antisocial behavior can take the form of bullying, physical aggression, and cruel behavior toward peers. Children may be hostile, verbally abusive, impudent, defiant, and negativistic toward adults. Persistent lying, frequent truancy, and vandalism are common. In severe cases,destructiveness, stealing, and physical violence often occur. Some adolescents with conduct disorder make little attempt to conceal theirantisocial behavior. Sexual behavior and regular use of tobacco, liquor, or illicit psychoactive substances begin unusually early for suchchildren and adolescents. Suicidal thoughts, gestures, and acts are frequent in children and adolescents with conduct disorder who are inconflict with peers, family members, or the law and are unable to problem solve their difficulties. Some children with aggressive behavioral patterns have impaired social attachments, as evinced by their diffculties with peerrelationships. Some may befriend a much older or younger person or have superficial relationships with other antisocial youngsters. Manychildren with conduct problems have poor self-esteem, although they may project an image of toughness. They may lack the skills tocommunicate in socially acceptable ways and appear to have little regard for the feelings, wishes, and welfare of others. Children andadolescents with conduct disorders often feel guilt or remorse for some of their behaviors, but try to blame others to stay out of trouble. Many children and adolescents with conduct disorder suffer from the deprivation of having few of their dependency needs met and mayhave had either overly harsh parenting or a lack of appropriate supervision. The deficient socialization of many children and adolescentswith conduct disorder can be expressed in physical violation of others and, for some, in sexual violation of others. Severe punishments forbehavior in children with conduct disorder almost invariably increases their maladaptive expression of rage and frustration rather thanameliorating the problem. In evaluation interviews, children with aggressive conduct disorders are typically uncooperative, hostile, and provocative. Some have asuperficial charm and compliance until they are urged to talk about their problem behaviors. Then, they often deny any problems. If theinterviewer persists, the child may attempt to justify misbehavior or become suspicious and angry about the source of the examiner’sinformation and perhaps bolt from the room. Most often, the child becomes angry with the examiner and expresses resentment of the examination with open belligerence or sullen withdrawal. Their hostility is not limited to adult authority figures, but is expressed with equal venom toward their age-mates and younger children. In fact, they often bully those who are smaller and weaker. By boasting, lying, and expressing little interest in a listener’s responses, such children reveal their lack of trust in adults to understand their position. Evaluation of the family situation often reveals severe marital disharmony, which initially may center on disagreements about management of the child. Because of a tendency toward family instability, parent surrogates are often in the picture. Children with conduct disorder are more likely to be unplanned or unwanted babies. The parents of children with conduct disorder, especially the father, havehigher rates of antisocial personality disorder or alcohol dependence. Aggressive children and their family show a stereotyped pattern of impulsive and unpredictable verbal and physical hostility. A child’s aggressive behavior rarely seems directed toward any definable goal and offers little pleasure, success, or even sustained advantages with peers or authority figures. In other cases, conduct disorder includes repeated truancy, vandalism, and serious physical aggression or assault against others by a gang, such as mugging, gang fighting, and beating. Children who become part of a gang usually have the skills for age-appropriate friendships. They are likely to show concern for the welfare of their friends or their own gang members and are unlikely to blame them or inform on them. In most cases, gang members have a history of adequate or even excessive conformity during early childhood that ended when the youngster became a member of the delinquent peer group, usually in preadolescence or during adolescence. Also present in the history is some evidence of early problems, such as marginal or poor school performance, mild behavior problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Some family social or psychological pathology is usually evident. Patterns of paternal discipline are rarely ideal and can vary from harshness and excessive strictness to inconsistency or relative absence of supervision and control. The mother has often protected the child from the consequences of early mild misbehavior, but does not seem to encourage delinquency actively. Delinquency, also called juveniledelinquency, is most often associated with conduct disorder but can also result from other psychological or neurological disorders.”",

Author information Abstract OBJECTIVE: Toassess whether antisocial children are characterized by low heart rate. METHOD: A meta-analysis was conducted on 45 independent effect sizes of the resting heart rate-antisocial behaviour relationship obtained from 40 meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were conducted between 1971 to 2002 using a total of 5,868 children. A secondary meta-analysis was also conducted on heart rate during a stressor. RESULTS: Significant overall effect sizes were found for both resting heart rate (d=-0.44, p<0001) and heart during a stressor (d= -0.76, p<.0001). Gender, age, method of recording, use of psychiatric control group, recruitment source, concurrent versus prospective nature of testing, and source of behavioral rating all failed to moderate this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Low resting heart rate appears to be the best-replicated biplogical correlate to date of antisocial behavior in children and adolescents, Several theroretical interpretations of this relationship are outline dthat should be examined in future studies.",

In addition, there is emerging evidence that treatment of ADHD may reduce the risk of SUD.

      "solution": "A, B (Ref : Kaplan Synopsis of Psychiatry 11th edn) “TCA SIDE EFFECTS: Anticholinergic Effects: Anticholinergic effects often limit the tolerable dosage to relatively low ranges. Some persons may develop a tolerance for the anticholinergic effects with continued treatment. Anticholinergic effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, delirium, and urinary retention. Sugarless gum, candy, or fluoride lozenges can alleviate dry mouth. Bethanechol, 25 to 50 mg three or four times a day, may reduce urinary hesitancy and may be helpful in erectile dysfunction when the drug is taken 30 minutes before sexual intercourse. Narrow-angle glaucoma can also be aggravated by anticholinergic drugs, and the precipitation of glaucoma requires emergency treatment with a miotic agent. The TCAs should be avoided in persons with narrow-angle glaucoma, and an SSRI should be substituted. Severe anticholinergic effects can lead to a CNS anticholinergic syndrome with confusion and delirium, especially if the TCAs are administered with dopamine receptor antagonists (DRAs) or anticholinergic drugs. IM or IV physostigmine is used to diagnose and treat anticholinergic delirium. Cardiac Effects: When administered in their usual therapeutic dosages, the TCAs may cause tachycardia, flattened T waves, prolonged QT intervals, and depressed ST segments in the electrocardiographic (EKG) recording. Imipramine has a quinidine-like effect at therapeutic plasma concentrations and may reduce the number of premature ventricular contractions. Because the drugs prolong conduction time, their use in persons with preexisting conduction defects is contraindicated. In persons with a history of any type of heart disease, the TCAs should be used only after SSRIs or other newer antidepressants have been found ineffective, and if used, they should be introduced at low dosages, with gradual increases in dosage and monitoring of cardiac functions. All of the TCAs can cause tachycardia, which may persist for months and is one of the most common reasons for drug discontinuation, especially in younger persons. At high plasma concentrations, as seen in overdoses, the drugs become arrhythmogenic. Autonomic Effects: Orthostatic hypotension is the most common cardiovascular autonomic severe effect and the most common reason TCAs are discontinued. It can result in falls and injuries in affected persons. Nortriptyline may be the drug least likely to cause this problem. Other possible autonomic effects are profuse sweating, palpitations, and increased blood pressure (BP). The TCAs' use should be discontinued several days before elective surgery because of the occurrence of hypertensive episodes during surgery in persons receiving TCAs. Sedation: Sedation is a common effect of the TCAs and may be welcomed if sleeplessness has been a problem. The sedative effect of the TCAs is a result of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activities. Amitriptyline, trimipramine, and doxepin are the most sedating agents; imipramine, amoxapine, nortriptyline, and maprotiline are less sedating; and desipramine and protriptyline are the least sedating agents. Neurologic Effects: A fine, rapid tremor may occur, Myoclonic twitched and tremors of the tongue and the upper extremities are common. Rare effects include speech blockage, paresthesia, peroneal, palsies, and ataxia. Amoxapine is unique in causing parkinsonian symptoms, akathisia, and even dyskinesia because of the dopaminergic blocking activity of one of its metabolites. Amoxapine may also cause neuroleptic syndrome in rare case. Maprotiline may cause seizzures when the dosage is increased too quickly or is kept at high levels for too long. Clomipramine and amoxapine may lower the seizure threshould more than other drugs in the class. As a class, however, the TCAs have a relatively low risk for inducing seizures except in persons who are at risk for seizures (e.g., persons with epilepsy and those with brain lesions). Although the TCAs can still be used by such persons, the initial dosages should be lower than usual, and subsequent dosages increases should be gradual. Allergic and Hematologic Effects: Exanthematous reshes are seen in 4 to 5 percent of all persons treated with marprotiline. Jaundice is rare. Agranulocytosis, leukocytosis, leucopenia, and eosinophilia are rare complications of TCA treatment. However, a person who has a sore throat or a fever during the first few months of TCA treatment should have a complete blood count (CBC) done immediately. Hepatic Effects: Mild and sefl-limited increase in serum transminase concentrations may occur and should be monitored. The TCAs can also produce a fulminant acute hepatitis in 0.1 to 1 percent of persons. This can be life threatening, and the antidepressant should be discontinued. Other Adverse Effects: Modest weight gain is common. Amoxapine exerts a DRA effect and may cause hyperrolactinemia, impotence, galactorrhea, anorgasmia, and ejaculatory disturbances. Other TCAs have also been associated with gynecomastia and amenorrhea.",
