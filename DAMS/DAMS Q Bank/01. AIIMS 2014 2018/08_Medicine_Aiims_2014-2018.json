Acidosis may also develop. Acute renal failure occurs frequently. TLS is most often associated with the treatment of Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and other rapidly proliferating lymphomas, but it also may be seen with chronic leukemias and, rarely, with solid tumors. This syndrome has been seen in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia after treatment with nucleosides like fludarabine. TLS has been observed with administration of glucocorticoids,hormonal agents such as letrozole and tamoxifen, and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and gemtuzumab. TLS usually occursduring or shortly (1–5 days) after chemotherapy.",

Blood relation alone does not determine reliability, as being a family member does not necessarily mean the person is observant, educated, or aware of the patient's behavior. A. Time of cohabitation Explanation: This does affect reliability — someone who has lived with the patient for a longer time is more likely to have direct and frequent observation of the patient’s behavior, making them a more reliable informant. C. Education status Explanation: An informant’s education level can influence their ability to understand questions, communicate effectively, and report symptoms accurately, which directly impacts reliability. D. Observational ability Explanation: This is a core factor in assessing reliability. A person who is naturally more observant and attentive will provide a more accurate history, regardless of their relationship to the patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Yoghurt is the least likely to cause symptoms of lactose intolerance. It contains lactobacillus that produces lactase and is generally well tolerated . Lactase is a brush border enzyme that hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose . In lactase deficiency, patients have great variability in clinical symptoms ,depending on both the severity of lactase deficiency and the amount of lactose ingested . Lactose intolerance is known to cause osmotic diarrhoea. Important feature of osmotic diarrhoea is it presents with • abdominal distention with pain abdomen • stops with fasting • stool osmotic gap is more than 50 treatment is to avoid milk and milk products. Among the above options, the least likely to cause lactose intolerance is yoghurt.",

They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed on sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have reached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses.TheFarnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and has emerged as a key player in the control of multiple metabolic pathways. On its activation by bile acids, FXR regulates bile acid synthesis, conjugation, and transport, as well as various aspects of lipid and glucose metabolism.vanilloid receptors transduction of noxious chemical and thermal stimuli by peripheral nociceptors. TRPV1 is a non-selective cation channel gated by noxious heat, vanilloids and extracellular protons. TRPV1 channel activity is remarkably potentiated by pro-inflammatory agents, a phenomenon that is thought to underlie the peripheral sensitisation of nociceptors that leads to thermal hyperalgesia.GRP stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells of the stomach.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lung contusion (LC) is caused by blunt chest trauma, explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. These injuries damage alveolar capillaries, so blood and other fluids accumulate in the lung tissue, but it does not involve a cut or a tear of the lung tissue. The excess fluid interferes with gas exchange leading to hypoxia.Clinically, patients have hypoxiemia, hypercarbia and increase in labored breathing of varying severity and duration [7]. Patients are treated with supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation as necessary.50-60% of patients with significant pulmonary contusions develop bilateral ARDS. Most significant pulmonary contusions are diagnosed on plain chest X-ray, but the chest X-ray often underestimate the size of contusion and usually lags behind the clinical picture. Sometimes the true extent of contusion is not apparent on plain film until 24-48 hours following injury. Computed tomography(CT) is very sensitive for diagnosing pulmonary contusion, its size and 3-dimensional assessment.",

It affects 20-30% of renal transplant patients: This is partially true, but not the most accurate answer. The BK virus can indeed affect renal transplant recipients, but the actual prevalence is variable. It is generally reported that 5–10% of renal transplant patients may develop BK virus nephropathy, not 20–30%. B. Foscarnet is used for treatment: This is incorrect. The first-line treatment for BK virus-related complications in kidney transplant recipients typically involves leflunomide (and sometimes sirolimus) to reduce the viral load. Foscarnet is generally used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, not for BK virus infections. So, B is not the correct answer. C. In children, it causes in general fever, malaise: This is not correct in the context of BK virus. While BK virus can cause mild symptoms, including fever and malaise, it tends to primarily affect immunocompromised patients (like kidney transplant recipients) rather than healthy children. The virus is not typically associated with significant clinical disease in healthy children. This makes C somewhat misleading in this context. D. It may cause hemorrhagic cystitis: This is the correct answer. BK virus is well known to cause hemorrhagic cystitis, especially in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This is because HSCT recipients often have severely suppressed immune systems, which increases the risk of BK virus reactivation, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. While it can also cause nephropathy in kidney transplant recipients, hemorrhagic cystitis is a hallmark complication in HSCT patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In patients with recurrent hemoptysis, angiographic evaluation is often needed to locate and control the bleeding source. While most cases of hemoptysis are due to bleeding from the bronchial arteries (which are systemic arteries), when those aren't listed among the options, the pulmonary artery is the next most relevant vessel. Pulmonary artery abnormalities such as pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can cause significant hemoptysis and require angiographic assessment. Thus, among the given choices, pulmonary artery is the most appropriate vessel to evaluate. B. Pulmonary vein Explanation: Pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium. They are not typically involved in bleeding and are not evaluated in angiography for hemoptysis. C. Brachial artery Explanation: This artery supplies the upper limb, not the lungs. It is unrelated to pulmonary circulation and has no role in hemoptysis evaluation. D. Brachial vein Explanation: The brachial vein also serves the upper limb and has no anatomical or clinical connection to pulmonary bleeding or hemoptysis. E. Superior vena cava Explanation: The superior vena cava drains venous blood from the upper body into the heart. It is not a source of bleeding into the airways and is not a target during angiographic workup for hemoptysis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Weils disease is icterohemorrhagic fever caused by leptospira. Icteric leptospirosis may mimic viral hepatitis and haemorrhagic form can mimic other haemorrhagic fevers. The usual incubation period is one to two weeks, but could be in the range of 2 to 30 days. Vascular endothelial damage is the primary lesion and this leads to capillary leakage,haemorrhage, vasculitis and localised ischaemia in organs. Insevere disease coagulation cascade is activated leading todisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Pro-inflammatory cytokines released as a result of immune-killing of leptospires mediate tissue inflammation and damage. TNF-? is also believed to play a key role in disease progression. The leptospiraemic phase begins with remittent fever (38°C to 40°C), chills, rigors, headache, myalgias, nausea and vomiting.The immune phase, which coincides with the appearance of antibodies and disappearance of the organisms from blood, is characterised by manifestations of organ dysfunctions. Pathogenic strains of leptospira are susceptible to a range of anti-microbial drugs including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones.",

Drugs like vincristine, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide may also cause SIADH. The cardinal features of SIADH are water intoxication and hyponatraemia including decreased serum osmolality, euvolaemia, inappropriate elevation of urine osmolality with elevated urine sodium with normal renal, thyroid and adrenal function. Many patients are asymptomatic. Those with sodium level of <125 mEq/L and developing hyponatraemia rapidly are more likely to be symptomatic. Water restriction (500 to 1000 mL per day) is the most important measure in treating SIADH. Hypertonic saline and diuretics are reserved for patients who have life-threatening convulsions or coma. It is important to raise the sodium level gradually. Demeclocycline is used for patients where fluid restriction and treatment of the malignancy are ineffective.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B, C, E) MS is the most common inflammatory-demyelinating disease of the CNS and the most frequent cause of non-traumatic neurologic disability in young and middle-aged adults. Four clinical types of MS have been described: 1. Relapsing/remitting MS (RRMS) – accounts for 85% of cases at onset and is characterised by discrete attacks with often complete recovery over ensuing weeks to months. 2. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) – always begins as RRMS.At some point, however, the clinical course changes so that the patient experiences a steady deterioration in function associated with acute attacks. For a patient with RRMS, the risk of developing SPMS is ~2.5% each year. 3. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) – accounts for ~15% of cases.These patients experience a steady functional decline from onset. 4. Progressive/relapsing MS (PRMS) – accounts for ~5% cases.These patients experience a steady deterioration from disease onset, along with occasional attacks super-imposed. TREATMENT • Interferon beta • Glatiramir acetate • Mitoxantrone ( useful in secondary progressive MS) • Natalizumab • Fingolimod • Teriflunomide • Daflampridine ( improves walking) • Dimetyly fumarate • Ocrelizumab ( useful in primary progressive MS)",

Increasing oxygen level increases perfusion. • Chronic asthma : there is obstruction of airways during expiration. Oxygen is less likely to improve the condition. • Sub-glottic stenosis: there is narrowing of lumen of cricoid cartilage. Amount of air going to lung is decreased. Hence increasing oxygen concentration causes more oxygen entry into lungs improving the condition. • Central apnoea is sleep related condition. There is apnoea for 10 to 30 seconds as is associated with reduction of oxygen saturation. Hence giving oxygen witll improve blood saturation of oxygen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excess copper stored in various body tissues, particularly the liver, brain, and corneas of the eyes. The disease is progressive and, if left untreated, it may cause liver (hepatic) disease, central nervous system dysfunction, and death. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent serious long-term disability and life threatening complications. Wilson disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Wilson disease is caused by disruption or changes (mutations) of the ATP7B gene, which plays an important role in the movement of excess copper from the liver to the bile to eventually be excreted from the body through the intestines. More than 300 different mutations of the ATP7B gene have been identified.",
