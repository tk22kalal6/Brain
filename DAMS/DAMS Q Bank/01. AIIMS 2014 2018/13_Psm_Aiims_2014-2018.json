The Haddon Matrix is the most commonly used paradigm in the injury prevention field.Developed by William Haddon in 1970, the matrix looks at factors related to personal attributes, vector or agent attributes and environmental attributes; before, during and after an injury or death. By utilizing this framework, one can then think about evaluating the relative importance of different factors and design interventions.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image(1100).png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

It systematically analyzes injury events by considering the interplay of various factors—host, agent, and environment—across three distinct phases: pre-event, event, and post-event. This structured approach allows public health professionals and safety experts to identify multiple points for intervention, thereby developing comprehensive strategies to prevent injuries from occurring or to mitigate their severity once they do. For instance, in a car crash, it would consider factors like driver behavior (host), vehicle design (agent), road conditions (environment) before, during, and after the impact, leading to diverse prevention measures.",

DHS Survey Types There are two types of DHS surveys: • Standard DHS Surveys have large sample sizes (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households) and typically are conducted about every 5 years, to allow comparisons over time. • Interim DHS Surveys focus on the collection of information on key performance monitoring indicators but may not include data for all impact evaluation measures (such as mortality rates). These surveys are conducted between rounds of DHS surveys and have shorter questionnaires than DHS surveys. Although nationally representative, these surveys generally have smaller samples than DHS surveys.",

In this question, it is assumed that 100 women tested negative. If 80 out of these 100 women truly did not have ovarian cancer, then: NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives) = 80 / (80 + 20) = 80 / 100 = 80%. Hence, the negative predictive value is 80 out of 100. Incorrect options: A. 20/100 This would represent the false negatives, not the NPV. It tells how many people tested negative but actually had the disease, which is not what NPV measures. B. 40/100 This value corresponds to the false positives from the test-positive group and is not related to the NPV calculation. C. 60/100 This is the true positives among those who tested positive, which represents the positive predictive value (PPV), not NPV.",

The number diseased has decreased from 6 to 1. There is no temporal relationship or reason explained for this decrease. So it Is a Sporadic.",
