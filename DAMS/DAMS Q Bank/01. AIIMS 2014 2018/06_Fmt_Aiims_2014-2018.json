      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Force of explosion is mostlly directional In a typical open-air explosion, such as a high-order detonation, the blast wave propagates radially — that means it spreads equally in all directions from the point of detonation, forming a spherical or cylindrical shock wave. The primary blast force in such cases is non-directional by nature and follows the physical laws of pressure wave propagation. The intensity of the force decreases rapidly with increasing distance from the center — a well-established principle in blast physics. In case of bomb blast the force of explosion decreases rapidly. The injuries may be due to burns or air blast (Shock waves and blast wind). Bruises, lacerations and abrasions are the main injuries (Marshal’s triad) seen in case of bomb blast. The force of explosion is concentrical and not directional..",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) -The concept of \"contributory negligence\" applies when the plaintiff's own negligence contributes to their injury or damages. In this case, the patient's failure to follow the doctor's advice and get the dressing done on time resulted in the worsening of the wound and later development of osteomyelitis. Therefore, the patient should be considered to have contributed to their own injury. The \"last clear chance\" doctrine is a legal principle that applies to cases of contributory negligence, where both the plaintiff and defendant were negligent, but the defendant had the last clear chance to avoid harm. However, in this situation, the doctor did not have the last clear chance to prevent harm, as the patient had the opportunity to take care of the wound by getting the dressing done on time",

It is a clear, colorless, odourless, non-volatile liquid with a bitter-sweet taste. MOA – Toxicity through metabolites, i.e. glycolic and oxalic acids which inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. CLINICAL FEATURES • Tachycardia, tachypnoea and congestive heart failure • Hypocalcemia, electrolyte imbalance and metabolic acidosis (due to glycolic acid) • Oxaluria, acute tubular necrosis, renal failure and Calcium oxalate crystals (due to oxalic acid). TREATMENT (SIMILAR TO METHANOL POSIONING) • Gastric lavage, sodium bicarbonate (to combat acidosis), calcium gluconate (to correct hypocalcemia) • Ethanol or 4 methyl pyrazole (fomepizole) as antidote • Hemodialysis in cases of severe poisoning. PM APPEARANCE • Oxalate crystals are seen in the brain, spinal cord and kidneys (Note: Metabolic acidosis also seen with methanol but calcium oxalate crystals with renal failure are characteristic of Ethylene glycol)",

TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA: Traumatic asphyxia is defined as a form of asphyxia resulting from trauma of the chest leading to forceful compression of chest preventing respiratory movements (Note: Many International Authors recognize Jack knife position as Positional or postural asphyxia. However almost all Indian Authors (including the Most Standard Referred Books) consider it as Traumatic Asphyxia. Hence, the answer is marked as such. Other similar books may give different answer.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) When a bullet is fired, it passes through the rifled barrel of the gun, which has spiral grooves and lands. These grooves leave distinct marks (called rifling marks) on the surface of the bullet. These marks are unique to each firearm due to: Imperfections in the barrel. The manufacturing process of the firearm. These rifling marks are used to match a bullet to a specific gun, making them the \"fingerprint\" of the firearm. Forensic ballistics experts analyze these marks to identify the weapon used to fire the bullet, which is the primary basis for bullet fingerprinting. Option A. Primary character: Explanation: The term \"primary character\" is not specific to forensic ballistics or bullet identification. There is no concept of \"primary character\" used in the context of bullet fingerprinting. Therefore, it is not a correct option for identifying bullets. Option B. Secondary marking: Explanation: \"Secondary markings\" could refer to external marks left on the bullet when it contacts other surfaces (e.g., the casing or during handling). These are not the unique ballistic markers used for identifying the firearm. Secondary markings are not as specific or reliable for identification compared to rifling marks left by the barrel of the gun. Option C. Range of firearm: Explanation: The range of the firearm refers to how far a bullet travels when fired and is more relevant in determining shooting distance or ballistic trajectory. While this information can help in crime scene reconstruction, it does not help in identifying a bullet or matching it to a firearm, making this option irrelevant in bullet fingerprinting.",

Bolam holds thatthe law imposes a duty of care between a doctor and his patient, but the standard of that care is a matter of medicaljudgement. Under Bolam, the plaintiff seeking to prove medical negligence needs to (1) show that there was a duty of care between thedoctor or nurse and the patient, which is usually a straightforward exercise, and (2) that the act or omission of the doctor ornurse breached the duty of care. In Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957], the court held that there is nobreach of standard of care if responsible body of similar professionals support the practice that caused the injury, even ifthe practice was not the standard of care. The ruling meant that the accused doctor need only to find an expert who wouldtestify to having done the same thing. Thus, Bolam was criticised for its overreliance on medical testimony and personaljudgement of experts chosen by the defendant.",
