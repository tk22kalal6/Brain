      "solution": "A Definition of a day care case is “A surgical day case is a patient who is admitted for investigation or operation on a planned non-resident basis and who none the less requires facilities for recovery. The whole procedure should not require an overnight stay in a hospital bed.” Because the patient gets admitted , operated and discharged on the same day , therefore the basic idea of doing a case of day care surgery is to administer drugs with short duration of action, predictable effect, no respiratory depression or CNS depression and no or little nausea and vomiting. So for day care surgery general anesthesia is preferred over regional. Drugs used in day care surgery are: Premediation: oral \\ iv midazolam Induction : intravenous > inhalational Intravenous agent: propofol Inhalational agent :sevoflurane>desflurane Opiods: remifentanil>alfentanil> fentanyl Neuromuscular blocking agents: rocuronium Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia 8th edition chapter 89 page 2625",

Ketamine causes sympathetic stimulation and thus is the agent of choice in acute shock. Propofol causes hypotension as a side effect and therefore has to be avoided in shock. Spinal anesthesia causes sudden and intense fall in blood pressure due to sympathetic ablation below the level of block and thus contraindicated in shock Epidural anesthesia causes less intense hypotension but activating the epidural takes time because of slower onset of action and thus can’t be used in acute shock.

Puncture: Structures pierced are skin, subcutaneous tissue, and supraspinous ligament to reach the substance of the interspinous ligament. The needle, with its bevel parallel to the midline, is advanced slowly to heighten the sense of tissue planes traversed and to prevent skewing of nerve roots, until the characteristic change in resistance is noted as the needle passes through the ligamentumflavum and dura. On passing through the dura, there is often a slight “click” or “pop” sensation. The stylet is then removed, and CSF should appear at the needle hub.

Vapor pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the vapors of the volatile liquid on the walls of the closed container it is kept in at a particular temperature. This property of the volatile liquid agent is dependent only on the agent and the ambient temperature and therefore vaporizers are vapor pressure specific. Agents with same vapor pressure will generate same amount of vapors in a closed containers and thus will deliver same output.

RAPID SEQUENCE INDUCTION( RSI) The primary objective of RSI is to minimize the time interval between loss of consciousness and tracheal intubation. The essential features of RSI include preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, administration of a predetermined induction dose (usuallythiopentone 200 mg and succinylcholine 100 mg), application of effective Cricoid Pressure, and avoidance of positive-pressure ventilation until the airway is secured with a cuffed tracheal tube. Modified RSI: In certain clinical situations some aspects of original RSI can be modified depending the type of patient. Induction agent and dose can be changed Positive ventilation can be given keeping the pressure below 20cms of water. Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia 8th edition chapter 55 page 1656",

      "solution": "C Bezoldjarish reflex Bezold-Jarisch Reflex The Bezold-Jarisch reflex responds to noxious ventricular stimuli sensed by chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors within the left ventricular wall by inducing the triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and coronary artery dilatation. The activated receptors communicate along unmyelinated vagal afferent type C fibers. These fibers reflexively increase parasympathetic tone. Because it invokes bradycardia, the Bezold-Jarisch reflexis thought of as a cardioprotective reflex. This reflex has been implicated in the physiologic response to a range of cardiovascular conditions such as myocardial ischemia or infarction, thrombolysis, or revascularization and syncope. It has also been proposed as a mechanism of sudden severe bradycardia in a post spinal anesthesia patient when the level of blockade is below T4. About other options The Bainbridge reflex is elicited by stretch receptorslocated in the right atrial wall and the cavoatrial junction. An increase in right-sided filling pressure(increase in venous return) sends vagal afferent signals to the cardiovascular center in the medulla. These afferent signals inhibit parasympathetic activity, thereby increasing the heart rate. Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia 8th edition chapter 20 page 490",

The laryngoscope is held in the right hand introduced from the right side of the patient We will discuss all options one by one Option A: This also called as BURP maneuver where in a Backward Upward Rightward Pressure is applied at the thyroid cartilage to improve the laryngeal view. Option C: The optimal position for laryngoscopy is called a “sniffing the morning air position” where there is flexion at the neck and extension at the atlanto occipital joint. Positioning the patient in the sniffing position approximates the alignment of oral, pharengeal and laryngeal axis. Cervical flexion aligns the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes, and maximal head extension at the atlantooccipital joint brings the oral axis closer into alignment Option D: The technique of laryngoscopy involves insertion of the blade of the scope from the right side of the mouth and sweeping the tongue on left side and placing the top of the blade just at the base of epiglottis and then lifting the epiglottis at an angle of 45 degree and at the same time levering the handle on the upper incisors. Option B: The laryngoscope handle is to be held in the left hand, and the flange on the left side that is used to retract the tongue laterally and the epiglottis is lifted.

High-quality CPR includes: o Perform compressions at a rate between 100 and 120 per minute, regardless of the age of the victim o Chest compressions should be between 2 and 2.4 inches (5 to 6 cm) for adults and adolescents o Chest compressions should be given to a depth of 1/3 the diameter of the chest in infants and children up to puberty. This is about 1.5 inches (4 cm) in infants and 2 inches (5 cm) in children o Allow the chest to completely recoil between compressions so that the heart can completely refill o Do not interrupt compressions except to use an AED or change providers o Interruptions should be limited to no more than 10 seconds at a time o Chest compressions should make up at least 60% of the rescue time o Deliver each breath over 1 second, regardless of victim age o Prevent over-inflation of the lungs by avoiding rapid ventilations o Perform CPR as a team to perform activities more quickly and efficiently o When no advanced airway in place that the ratio of chest compression to ventilation is 30:2 o When an advanced airway is in place, ventilate at 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute).

Penetration into the subarachnoid space Complications Associated with Needle or Catheter Insertion Inadequate Anesthesia or Analgesia Movement of the needle during injection incomplete entry of the needle opening into the subarachnoid space, subdural injection loss of potency of the local anesthetic solution may be responsible B. Intravascular Injection Accidental intravascular injection of the local anesthetic for epidural and caudal anesthesia can produce very high serum levels. Extremely high levels of local anesthetics affect the central nervous system (seizure and unconsciousness) and the cardiovascular system (hypotension, arrhythmias, and depressed contractility). Because the dosage of medication for spinal anesthesia is relatively small, this complication is seen after epidural and caudal (but not spinal) blocks. The incidence of intravascular injection can be minimized by carefully aspirating the needle (or catheter) before every injection, using a test dose, always injecting local anesthetic in incremental doses, and close observation for early signs of intravascular injection (tinnitus, lingual sensations). Treatment is resuscitative, and lipid rescueshould be employed C. Total Spinal Anesthesia Total spinal anesthesia can occur followingattempted epidural/caudal anesthesia if there isaccidental intrathecal injection. Onset is usuallyrapid, because the amount of anestheticrequiredfor epidural and caudal anesthesia is 5–10 times thatrequired for spinal anesthesia. Careful aspiration,use of a test dose, and incremental injection techniquesduring epidural and caudal anesthesiacanhelp avoid this complication. D. Subdural Injection The spinal subdural space is a potential space between the dura and the arachnoid containing a small amount of serous fluid. This space extends intracranially, so that anesthetic injected into the spinal subdural space can ascend to higher levels than epidural medications Clinical presentationsimilar to that of high spinal anesthesia, withthe exception that the onset may be delayed for15–30 min and the block may be “patchy”.

      "solution": "3 mins Preoxygenation is typically performed via a facemask attached to either the anesthesia machine or a Mapleson circuit. To ensure adequate preoxygenation, 100% oxygen must be provided at a flow rate high enough to prevent rebreathing (10 to 12 L/min), and no leaks around the facemask must be present. An end-tidal concentration of oxygen greater than 90% is considered to maximize apnea time. Two primary methods are used to accomplish preoxygenation. The first method uses tidal volume ventilation through the facemask for 3 minutes, which allows the exchange of 95% of the gas in the lungs. The second method uses vital capacity breaths to achieve adequate preoxygenation more rapidly. Four breaths over 30 seconds is not as effective as the tidal volume method but may be acceptable in certain clinical situations; eight breaths over 60 seconds has been shown to be more effective. Head-up positioning has been shown to improve the quality of preoxygenation in both obese and nonobese patients. Ref: millers 8th edition page 1653",

      "solution": "B Balanced resuscitation, which includes permissive hypotension, limiting crystalloid use, and the transfusion of blood products in ratios similar to whole blood. Prompt initiation of massive transfusion and the protocolled use of 1:1:1 product ratios have improved the morbidity and mortality of patients with trauma in hemorrhagic shock. Balanced resuscitation minimizes the impact of trauma-induced coagulopathy, limits blood product waste, and reduces the complications that occur with aggressive crystalloid resuscitation. Permissive hypotension—also known as \"hypotensive\" or \"balanced\" resuscitation—is a strategy of deferring or restricting fluid administration until haemorrhage is controlled, while accepting a limited period of suboptimum end-organ perfusion.

CNS symptoms appears first and then followed by CVS symptoms. • CNS symptoms are excitatory> depressive symptoms • CVS symptoms are of two types (a) Direct : when large doses of cardiotoxic drugs like bupivacaine affect transmission of neuronal impulses in myocardium. This leads to bradyarrythmia whch can cause cardiac arrest. Treatment for bupivacaine induced cadiotoxicity is intralipid which acts as reservoir of lipid in blood. This leads to increased dissociation of local anesthetic in heart. (b) Indirect: when higher level of blockade ( higher than T4) is given in spinal or epidural anesthesia, the cardio acceleratory fibres are blocked. This leads to profound hypotension and bradycardia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A. Drug dose and airway size is calculated based upon the child’s weight In pediatric anesthesiology, drug dosages are typically calculated on a weight-based (mg/kg) system. Similarly, the size of airway devices like endotracheal tubes is often determined using the child’s weight and age. This ensures both safety and effectiveness when selecting doses and airway equipment. C. Halothane is not a favoured agent in pediatric anesthesia This is true in current practice. Although halothane was historically used in children due to its non-irritant properties and smooth induction, it is no longer favored because of its association with hepatotoxicity, cardiac arrhythmias, and slow recovery. Modern agents like sevoflurane and desflurane are preferred for their safety profiles and faster onset and recovery. D. Most preferred mode of induction in a child is inhalational Inhalational induction is typically the preferred method in pediatric patients, especially younger children who may be uncooperative with intravenous access. Sevoflurane is the most commonly used agent due to its rapid onset, minimal airway irritation, and pleasant odor. Incorrect options: B. Spinal anesthesia is contraindicated below 6 months of age This is incorrect. Spinal anesthesia is not contraindicated below 6 months. In fact, it is considered safe in neonates and young infants for lower abdominal or lower limb surgeries. Though technically challenging, it is used in neonatology and pediatric anesthesia when appropriately indicated. E. Induction agent of choice in a child with tetralogy of Fallot is etomidate This is false. Ketamine is the induction agent of choice in tetralogy of Fallot because it maintains or increases systemic vascular resistance, which helps reduce right-to-left shunting and improves oxygenation. Etomidate lacks this benefit and is not preferred in such cases.",
