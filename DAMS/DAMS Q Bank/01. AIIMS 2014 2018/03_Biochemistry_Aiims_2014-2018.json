      "solution": "Correct Answer :- (B) Ref.: Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flow_cytometryhttp;// bitesizebio.com/13695/basic- measurements-of flow cytometer - forward - side scatter-quantitative-flow-cytometry When the laser beam strikes the stream, the majority of the photons will pass through unobstructed. Some of these photons will diverge slightly, primarily via light diffraction, from their path as they contact the membranes of passing cells. A detector is placed in line with the laser path (on the opposite side of the stream) and this “scattered” light is collected. Because of the nature of its collection, this parameter is referred to as Small Angle Light Scatter (SALS), Forward Angle Lights Scatter (FALS), or, most commonly, Forward Scatter (FSC). Forward scatter is proportional to cell size; the bigger the cell, the more light is scattered, the higher the detected signal. As cells are translucent, many photons will pass through the cytoplasm. If the photon strikes an organelle (ER, nucleus, etc), the photon will be reflected at a larger angle than those generated by the forward scatter phenomenon. In a typical cytometer, a second detector is placed perpendicular to the laser path to collect light scattered in this manner. This is known as Wide Angle Light Scatter (WALS), Orthogonal Light Scatter (OLS), 90° Lights Scatter, or, commonly, Side Scatter (SSC). Side scatter is proportional to cell complexity; the more organelles/bits inside the cytoplasm, the more light scatter, the higher the detected signal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cre-Lox recombination is a site-specific recombinase technology, used to carry out deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions at specific sites in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification to be targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. It is implemented both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. The Cre-lox recombination system has been particularly useful to help neuroscientists to study the brain in which complex cell types and neural circuits come together to generate cognition and behaviors. NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research has created several hundreds of Cre driver mouse lines which are currently used by the worldwide neuroscience community. The system consists of a single enzyme, Cre recombinase, that recombines a pair of short target sequences called the Lox sequences. This system can be implemented without inserting any extra supporting proteins or sequences. The Cre enzyme and the original Lox site called the LoxP sequence are derived from bacteriophage P1. Placing Lox sequences appropriately allows genes to be activated, repressed, or exchanged for other genes. At a DNA level many types of manipulations can be carried out. The activity of the Cre enzyme can be controlled so that it is expressed in a particular cell type or triggered by an external stimulus like a chemical signal or a heat shock. These targeted DNA changes are useful in cell lineage tracing and when mutants are lethal if expressed globally.",

As its name implies, a selenium atom replaces the sulfur of its structural analog, cysteine. The pK3 of selenocysteine, 5.2, is 3 units lower than that of cysteine. Since selenocysteine is inserted into polypeptides during translation, it is commonly referred to as the “21st amino acid.” selenocysteine arises co-translationally during its incorporation into peptides. The UGA anticodon of the unusual tRNA designated tRNASec normally signals STOP. The ability of the protein synthetic apparatus to identify a selenocysteine-specific UGA codon involves the selenocysteine insertion element, a stem-loop structure in the untranslated region of the mRNA.",

A holocarboxylase synthetase catalyzes the transfer of biotin onto a lysine residue of the apo-enzyme to form the bioctin residue of the holoenzyme. The reactive intermediate is 1-N-carboxy biocytin, formed from bicarbonate in an ATP dependent reaction. The carboxyl group is then transferred to the substrate for carboxylation Biotin also has a role in regulation of the cell cycle, acting to biotinylate key nuclear proteins,",

This vitamin B12-dependent enzyme catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in humans. Mutations in MUT gene may lead to various types of methylmalonic aciduria. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is expressed in high concentrations in the kidney, in intermediate concentrations in the heart, ovaries, brain, muscle, and liver, and in low concentrations in the spleen. The enzyme can be found all throughout the central nervous system (CNS). MCM resides in the mitochondria, where a number of substances, including the branched-chain amino acids isoleucine and valine, as well as methionine, threonine, thymine and odd-chain fatty acids, are metabolized via methylmalonate semialdehyde (MMlSA) or propionyl-CoA (Pr-CoA) to a common compound - methylmalonyl-CoA (MMl-CoA).

Such studies have revealed that the numbers of OR genes are highly variable among organisms depending on their living environments. Because OR genes are intronless, it is possible to find all OR genes by conducting homology searches against the genome sequences using known OR genes as queries.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery571.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) cGMP Ref: Harper:Illustratedbiochemistry30/ep660 Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a cyclic nucleotide derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP acts as a second messenger much like cyclic AMP. Its most likely mechanism of action is activation of intracellular protein kinases in response to the binding of membrane-impermeable peptide hormones to the external cell surface. cGMP is a common regulator of ion channel conductance, glycogenolysis, and cellular apoptosis. It also relaxes smooth muscle tissues. In blood vessels, relaxation of vascular smooth muscles lead to vasodilation and increased blood flow.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery572.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

The addition of acetyl-CoA results in a change in the tertiary structure of the protein, lowering the Km for bicarbonate. This means that as acetyl-CoA is formed from pyruvate, it automatically ensures the provision of oxaloacetate and, therefore, its further oxidation in the citric acid cycle, by activating pyruvate carboxylase. The activation of pyruvate carboxylase and the reciprocal inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by acetyl-CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids explain the action of fatty acid oxidation in sparing the oxidation of pyruvate (and hence glucose) and in stimulating gluconeogenesis.",

The test is performed by administering NBT-PABA to patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis and measuring the amount of PABA excreted in the urine. In patients with chronic pancreatitis, chymotrypsin is not released by the exocrine pancreas into the gastrointestinal tract; NBT is not cleaved from PABA, and thus the excretion of PABA in the urine is diminished.",

Since amide bond synthesis is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi, the reaction strongly favors glutamine synthesis. During catalysis, glutamate attacks the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP, forming γ-glutamyl phosphate and ADP. Following deprotonation of NH4 +, NH3 attacks γ-glutamyl phosphate, and glutamine and Pi are released. In addition to providing glutamine to serve as a carrier of nitrogen, carbon and energy between organs, glutamine synthase plays a major role in ammonia detoxification and acid-base homeostasis. A rare deficiency in neonate glutamine synthase results in severe brain damage, multiorgan failure, and death.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Under anaerobic metabolism, the body generates energy without using oxygen, primarily through a process called glycolysis. In this process, glucose is broken down into pyruvate and then converted to lactate, producing a net gain of 2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose or galactose. However, when glycogen is used instead of glucose, the situation is slightly different. Glycogen is a stored form of glucose found in the liver and muscles. When glycogen is broken down for energy, it enters glycolysis as glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate without using ATP. This bypasses the first step of glycolysis that normally consumes one ATP. As a result, the breakdown of glycogen under anaerobic conditions yields a net gain of 3 ATP molecules per glucose unit. Amino acids, on the other hand, are not a primary energy source during anaerobic metabolism, as they require oxygen-dependent pathways for efficient ATP production. Therefore, among the options given, glycogen is the only substrate that yields 3 molecules of ATP under anaerobic conditions.",

The main determinant of DIT is the energy content of the food, followed by the protein fraction of the food. The thermic effect of alcohol is similar to the thermic effect of protein.Reported DIT values for separate nutrients are 0 to 3% for fat, 5 to 10% for carbohydrate, 20 to 30% for protein, and 10 to 30% for alcohol.

HSL is activated when the body needs to mobilize energy stores, and so responds positively to catecholamines, ACTH. It is inhibited by insulin.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) An increase in hydrogen ion concentration (H?) leads to a decrease in pH (more acidic environment). This promotes the Bohr effect, which decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, allowing more oxygen to be released to the tissues. This is crucial during high metabolic activity when tissues produce more CO? and H?. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Reduced 2,3 DPG Incorrect. 2,3-DPG (diphosphoglycerate) binds to hemoglobin and lowers its oxygen affinity. If 2,3-DPG is reduced, oxygen affinity actually increases, making it harder for hemoglobin to release oxygen. C. Increase in temperature Incorrect in the context of the question wording — because increased temperature also decreases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity. So this could seem correct, but A is more direct and fundamental via the Bohr effect. However, if multiple correct options were allowed, C would also be correct. D. High Altitudes Incorrect. At high altitudes, the body increases 2,3-DPG to help release oxygen more readily, but high altitude itself doesn't directly decrease oxygen affinity — it's the body's adaptive response that affects affinity. So it's not the most direct cause.",

Biochemical findings include an accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids, abnormalities of the synthesis of bile acids, and a marked reduction of plasmalogens.

This mutant form of protein however may return fully to its active tetrameric state in the presence of an N-terminal fragment of the protein, the α-peptide.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Affinity chromatography Affinity chromatography is considered one of the most accurate and commonly used methods for measuring HbA1c. It separates glycated hemoglobin from non-glycated hemoglobin based on the specific interaction between the glycated hemoglobin and the chromatographic medium, making it a highly specific and reliable method. Why the others are less appropriate: A. Isoelectric focusing: This method separates proteins based on their charge and is not as precise for measuring HbA1c compared to affinity chromatography, as it is more used for separating different hemoglobin variants or other proteins. C. Ion exchange chromatography: This method can also be used for HbA1c testing but is less specific than affinity chromatography and may have some limitations in separating HbA1c from other forms of hemoglobin or dealing with hemoglobin variants. D. Electrophoresis: This method separates proteins based on their charge and is not typically used for HbA1c quantification. While electrophoresis can detect HbA1c, it is not as reliable or accurate for routine measurement as affinity chromatography.",

Therefore, it is a source of cytosolic NADPH. B. ATP citrate lyase: This enzyme is found in the cytosol and cleaves citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, a crucial step for fatty acid synthesis. While it provides acetyl-CoA, which is eventually used in a pathway that consumes NADPH (fatty acid synthesis), ATP citrate lyase itself does not directly produce NADPH. Instead, the oxaloacetate produced can be converted to malate and then by malic enzyme (Option C) to pyruvate, generating NADPH. However, ATP citrate lyase is not the direct generator of NADPH. C. Malic enzyme: The cytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate, generating NADPH and carbon dioxide. This enzyme is a significant source of cytosolic NADPH, particularly in lipogenic tissues. Therefore, it is a source of cytosolic NADPH. D. G6PD (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase): This is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which occurs in the cytosol. G6PD catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, reducing NADP+ to NADPH. The PPP is a major source of cytosolic NADPH. Therefore, it is a source of cytosolic NADPH.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery588.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) One effect of ammonia is the inhibition of the rate limiting TCA cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alphaKGDH) and possibly also pyruvate dehydrogenase, but this has been regarded to be of no quantitative importance. However, recent studies justify a revision of this point of view. Based on published data, the following sequence of events is proposed. Inhibition of alphaKGDH both enhances the detoxification of ammonia by formation of glutamine from alpha-ketoglutarate and reduces the rate of NADH and oxidative ATP production in astrocytic mitochondria. In the astrocytic cytosol this will lead to formation of lactate even in the presence of sufficient oxygen supply<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery589.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In LCAT (Lecithin–Cholesterol Acyltransferase) deficiency, the enzyme responsible for converting free cholesterol into cholesteryl esters is absent or non-functional. This disrupts the normal maturation of HDL particles, leading to a marked decrease in HDL levels. LDL levels are typically normal or reduced, since the conversion of VLDL to LDL is also affected. However, due to impaired metabolism and clearance, VLDL levels tend to increase. This occurs because LCAT plays a role in remodeling triglyceride-rich lipoproteins like VLDL, and without it, VLDL clearance is inefficient, leading to its accumulation. Chylomicrons are usually not significantly affected in LCAT deficiency. Therefore, among the given options, the most likely to be increased is VLDL.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery593.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",
