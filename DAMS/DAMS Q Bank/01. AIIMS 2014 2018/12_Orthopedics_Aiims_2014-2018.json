Principles of bone and joint injures and therir healing. Srugery (Oxford). 33 (1), pg 7-14. Fracture healing : A) Primary B) Secondary Primary fracture healing: Primary healing occurs when bone ends are in approximation to each other - No movement at #site - No callus seen . Takes time. Secondary Fracture healing: - Callus is formed - Micromovement stimulates callus formation. -Small amount of motion ( micromovements ) and weight bearing at the fracture causes a soft callus to form leading on to secondary bone formation.",

The legs bow outwards with variable deformity of the hips (both coxa vara and coxa valga are seen 1). Other bone deformities are also noted such as genu valga and vara as well as protrusio acetabuli 6.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gallow’s traction, also known as Bryant’s traction, is a form of skin traction primarily used in young children — typically under the age of 2 years or weighing less than 12–14 kg — for the management of fracture shaft of the femur. In this technique, both legs are suspended vertically at a 90-degree angle from the hips, allowing the child’s body weight to provide the counter-traction needed to align the fractured femur. This method is particularly suitable for infants and toddlers, whose smaller size and lighter weight make skin traction effective and safe. It is important to note that Gallow’s traction is not used for fracture neck of femur, which requires more rigid immobilization and is usually managed by surgical fixation or spica casting, depending on the age. In adults, fracture neck of femur is treated surgically and sometimes temporarily managed with Buck’s traction, not Gallow’s. Therefore, Gallow’s traction is specifically indicated for fracture shaft of femur in very young children.",

This finding is said to be pathognomonic for a simple (unicameral) bone cyst following a pathological fracture. Although it has occasionally been reported with other cystic lesions, e.g. eosinophilic granuloma. The finding exists because a simple bone cyst is fluid filled, and therefore a bony fragment may descend through the fluid uninhibited. In contrast, the common differential lesions for a pathologic fracture through a lucent bone lesion (such as a lytic tumor, fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst or enchondroma) have a solid interior matrix and therefore would not permit such downward fragment migration.",

They should not be confused with lunate dislocations where the lunate is dislocated in a volar direction and no longer has normal radiolunate articulation. Typical history is of a fall onto a dorsiflexed wrist. There may or may not be obvious clinical deformity. Occasionally median nerve injury, arterial compromise or compartment syndrome may be evident due to the dislocation. The majority of cases involve dorsal dislocation of the capitate and carpus relative to the lunate which remains in near-normal alignment with the radius. Volar perilunate dislocation is rare",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pott puffy tumor refers to a non-neoplastic complication of acute sinusitis. It is characterized by a primarily subgaleal collection, subperiosteal abscess, and osteomyelitis. It is usually related to the frontal sinus but is sometimes secondary to mastoid pathology. Radiographic features CT CT typically demonstrates an opacified frontal sinus with stranding and swelling of the overlying scalp. Bone algorithm will often demonstrate a defect in the anterior wall of the sinus. Contrast may demonstrate a focal abscess, and may also allow intracranial complications to be better delineated. MRI Subtle intracranial involvement is more easily seen at MR imaging. With the injection of gadolinium-based contrast material, one may see early linear enhancement of the dura mater, an extra-axial fluid collection, or an area of cerebritis or focal cerebral abscess formation. In the scalp, peripheral or rim contrast enhancement may be seen when an organized fluid collection is present. Treatment and prognosis Treatment is typically surgical with drainage of the abscess and at least 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics.",

It is particularly associated with tendonitis of the supraspinatus muscle. This can result in pain, weakness, and loss of movement at the shoulder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Brodie abscess is an intraosseous abscess related to a focus of subacute pyogenic osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way radiographically to exclude a focus of osteomyelitis. It has a protean radiographic appearance and can occur at any location and in a patient of any age. It might or might not be expansile, have a sclerotic or nonsclerotic border, or have associated periostitis. Radiographic features Plain radiograph lytic lesion often in an oval configuration that is oriented along the long axis of the bone surrounded by a thick dense rim of reactive sclerosis that fades imperceptibly into surrounding bone lucent tortuous channel extending toward growth plate prior to physeal closure (pathognomonic) periosteal new-bone formation +/- adjacent soft-tissue swelling may persist for many months CT central intramedullary hypodense cystic lesion with thick rim ossification extensive thick well-circumscribed periosteal reaction and bone sclerosis around the lesion could be seen MRI The “penumbra sign” on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is useful for discriminating subacute osteomyelitis from other bone lesions. The penumbra sign is a rim lining of an abscess cavity with higher signal intensity than that of the main abscess on T1-weighted images with strongly and rapidly enhance after contrast.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) No explanation is given so pls add: - Sciatic nerve consists of two distinct anatomical components: A) Tibial Nerve component B) Common Peroneal nerve component Tibial Nerve is in the centre of Sciatic nerve while the common Peroneal nerve is in the Peripheral of Sciatic nerve. So common Peroneal nerve component is most likely to be injured during Sciatic nerve injury . Common Peroneal nerve wraps around the neck of fibula where it is likely to get injured during fracture. Common Peroneal nerve supplies Ankle dorsiflexors , toes Extensors and evertors of foot . So when Peroneal nerve is injured , foot will go into plantar flexion & inversion. This is known as foot drop. The deformity will get as Equino Varus deformity. When such a patient walks , he drags the toes along the grounds . So while walking patient has to lift the foot high in order to clear the ground . This is known as high step Gait .",
