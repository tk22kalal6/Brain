      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dermatitis herpetiformis is an immunobullous disease which targets tissue transglutaminase. It presents as excoriated papules over elbows, knees and buttocks. The lesions are very itchy. Dapone is an effective therapy. On HPE we get neutrophilic microabcess on tips of dermal papillae. On DIF we get granular IgA deposits. An underlying genetic predisposition to the development of dermatitis herpetiformis has been demonstrated. Both dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease (CD) are associated with an increased expression of HLA-A1, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes. Environmental factors are also important; monozygotic twins may have dermatitis herpetiformis, celiac disease, and/or gluten-sensitive enteropathy with variable symptomatology.",

      "map_id": 34386804,
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Isotretinoin is a highly teratogenic drug, meaning it can cause severe birth defects if a woman becomes pregnant while taking it or shortly after stopping it. Because of this, strict contraception is required during treatment and for some time afterward to ensure there is no risk of teratogenic effects. The drug has a half-life of 10-20 hours, but its metabolites (such as 4-oxo-isotretinoin) can remain in the body much longer. Therefore, while the drug clears relatively quickly from the system, the safety margin for contraception extends beyond the drug's immediate elimination. Clinical guidelines, including those from the iPLEDGE program (in the U.S.) and the European Medicines Agency, recommend at least 1 month of contraception after stopping isotretinoin to ensure that any residual drug does not impact a potential pregnancy. However, for the most ideal safety, especially in long-term or high-dose users, the recommendation is extended to 3 months. This 3-month period is seen as providing the necessary time for the drug and its metabolites to be fully cleared from the body, significantly reducing the risk of teratogenic effects if pregnancy occurs. This 3-month duration is now widely accepted as the best practice for preventing fetal harm and is consistent with 2025 guidelines, making C. 3 months the most accurate answer in the current context.",
