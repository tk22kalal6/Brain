      "solution": "Ans.: A. Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus • This virus causes T-cell leukemia in humans. It also causes an autoimmune disease called tropical spastic paraparesis. • There are two human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) isolates so far, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, both of which are associated with leukemias and lymphomas. • HTLV-1 was isolated in 1980 from the cells of a patient with a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. • Its RNA and proteins are different from those of all other retroviruses. • In addition to cancer, HTLV is the cause of tropical spastic paraparesis, an autoimmune disease in which progressive weakness of the legs occurs.

In females, it leads to pruritic vaginitis with greenish yellow discharge, strawberry mucosa and dysuria. • Diagnosis: By wet mount microscopy of vaginal or urethral discharge, Culture (gold standard), PCR, and by demonstration of antigen in vaginal smear by ELISA. • Treatment: Metronidazole is the drug of choice and simultaneous treatment of both partners is recommended.

By then, membraneprotuberances appear in erythrocyte’s surface, 12–15hours after cell invasion. • These knobs extrude a high molecular weight, antigenically variant strain-specificerythrocyte membrane adhesive protein, Pf MP1, thatmediates attachment to receptors on venular capillary endothelium, an event termed ‘cytoadherence’. • Severalvascular receptors have been identified of whichintracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) is probablymost important in the brain, chondroitin sulfate B in theplacenta, and CD36 in most other organs. • The infected erythrocytes stick inside and eventuallyblock capillaries and venules. At the same stage, these P.falciparuminfected RBCs adhere to uninfected RBCs toform rosettes. The process of cytoadherence, resetting,and agglutination are central to pathogenesis offalciparum malaria. • They result in sequestration of RBCscontaining mature form of the parasite in vital organs like brain, kidney, heart, lungs, spleen, intestine, bone marrow,and placenta, where they interfere with microcirculatoryflow and metabolism and are responsible for many ofthe serious complications of falciparum malaria, such ascerebral malaria Ref: Paniker’stextbook of medical parasitology 7/e P- 71",

ELISA for antibody against Dengue virus. • Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)-based methods are available for rapid identification and serotyping of dengue virus inacute-phase serum, roughly during the period of fever. • Isolation of the virus is difficult. • The current favored approach is inoculation of a mosquito cell line with patient serum coupledwith nucleic acid assays to identify a recovered virus. • Serologic diagnosis is complicated by cross-reactivity ofIgG antibodies to heterologous flavivirus antigens. • A variety of methods are available; the most commonly used methods are envelope/membrane viral protein-specific capture IgM or IgG ELISA and the HI test. IgM antibodies develop withina few days of illness and peak in 10th day. • Neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies appear within a week after the onset ofdengue fever. • Analysis of paired acute and convalescent sera to show a significant rise in antibody titre is the most reliableevidence of an active dengue infection.

Hepatitis B virus • The replicative cycle of HBV • After entry of the virion into the cell and its uncoating, the nucleocapsid moves to the nucleus. • In the nucleus, the virion DNA polymerase synthesizes the missing portion of DNA, and a double-stranded circular DNA is formed. • This DNA serves as a template for mRNA synthesis by cellular RNA polymerase. • After the individual mRNAs are made, a full-length positive-strand RNA is made, which is the template for the minus strand of the progeny DNA. • The minus strand then serves as the template for the plus strand of the genome DNA. • This RNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by reverse transcriptase encoded by HBV takes place within the newly assembled virion nucleocapsid core in the cytoplasm. • The RNA-dependent DNA synthesis that produces the genome and the DNA- dependent DNA synthesis that fills in the missing portion of DNA soon after infection of the next cell are carried out by the same enzyme Ref: Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Warren Levinson, 14th Ed, Page No : 345",

Urine • The preferred approach involves culturing in special tubes called shell vials coupled with the use of immunofluorescent antibody, which can make a diagnosis in 72 hours. • Other diagnostic methods include fluorescent antibody and histologic staining of inclusion bodies in giant cells in urine and in tissue. • The inclusion bodies are intranuclear and have an oval owl’s eye shape • PCR-based assays for CMV DNA or RNA in urine is also very useful.

Affected microbial metabolism, extracellular virulence factors produced, and decreased susceptibility to biocides, antimicrobial agents, and host defence molecules and cells are all effects of biofilm growth. • After the bacteria attach, they often form a protective matrix called a biofilm consisting of various polysaccharides and proteins. • Biofilms form especially on foreign bodies such as prosthetic joints, prosthetic heart valves, and intravenous catheters, but they also form on native structures such as heart valves. • Biofilms protect bacteria from both antibiotics and host immune defenses such as antibodies and neutrophils. • They also retard wound healing resulting in chronic wound infections, especially in diabetics.

The stools often contain mucus, blood, and leukocytes (white blood cells) due to invasion of the intestinal mucosa, leading to inflammation. A. Giardia lamblia Causes greasy, foul-smelling, bulky stools (steatorrhea), not typically associated with leukocytes in stool. It leads to malabsorption but not mucosal invasion. C. Clostridium perfringens Typically causes food poisoning with watery diarrhea. It doesn't usually result in leukocytes in the stool since it doesn’t invade the mucosa significantly. D. Staphylococcus aureus Causes food poisoning via a preformed toxin. It leads to watery, non-inflammatory diarrhea, often without fever or leukocytes in the stool.",

      "solution": "Ans. B Under light microscopy, C. jejuni has a characteristic \"sea-gull\" shape as a consequence of its helical form. Campylobacter is grown on specially selective \"CAMP\" agar plates at 42 °C, the normal avian body temperature, rather than at 37 °C, the temperature at which most other pathogenic bacteria are grown. Since the colonies are oxidase positive, they usually only grow in scanty amounts on the plates. Microaerophilic conditions are required for luxurious growth. A selective blood agar medium (Skirrow's medium) can be used. Greater selectivity can be gained with an infusion of a cocktail of antibiotics: vancomycin, polymixin-B, trimethoprim, and actidione ([Preston's agar]),and growth under microaerophilic conditions at 42 °C.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Enteroinvasive E. coli – Shigella-like dysentery Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) causes a form of diarrhea that closely resembles Shigella infection, both clinically and pathogenetically. EIEC invades and destroys colonic epithelial cells, leading to bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever, mimicking dysentery. Like Shigella, EIEC is non-lactose fermenting and non-motile in culture and shares similar virulence mechanisms such as intracellular spread. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) EAEC is typically associated with persistent diarrhea, especially in children and HIV-positive patients. It does not invade mucosa, and diarrhea is generally non-bloody, making it unlike Shigella. B. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) ETEC is the most common cause of traveler’s diarrhea and produces heat-labile and/or heat-stable toxins, leading to watery, non-bloody diarrhea. It does not cause mucosal invasion, so it does not mimic Shigella. D. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) EHEC (especially strain O157:H7) can cause bloody diarrhea and is associated with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), but unlike Shigella, it does not invade epithelial cells. It releases Shiga-like toxins that cause vascular damage, not direct mucosal destruction.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Answer: D types of bacterial resistence 1. Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of penicillin G in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of ?-lactamases. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis. 2. Alteration of target- or binding site: for example, alteration of PBP—the binding target site of penicillins—in MRSA and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell's ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis. 3. Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of folic acid and nucleic acids in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid. 4. Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug permeability or increasing active efflux (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface. These pumps within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage. They are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibiotic as in fluoroquinolone resistance. 5. Ribosome splitting and recycling: for example, drug-mediated stalling of the ribosome by lincomycin and erythromycin unstalled by a heat shock protein found in Listeria monocytogenes, which is an homologous of HflX from other bacteria. Liberation of the ribosome from the drug allows further translation and consequent resistance to the drug.",

Hemorrhage occurs infrequently. The common causative agents include a) Arenaviruses: The most important arenaviruses causing VHF areJunin virus, Lassa virus, and Machupo virus. b) Bunyaviruses: The most important VHF-causing bunyaviruses areCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, hantaviruses, Rift Valleyfever virus, and “severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus. c) Flaviviruses: The most important flaviviruses that cause VHF are themosquito-borne dengue viruses 1–4, yellow fever viruses, Kyasanur Forest disease virus and Omsk hemorrhagicfever virus.",

There is a defect/ mutation in LYST gene (lysosomal trafficking regulator) . patients has recurrent bacterial infections, defects in blood clotting, pigmentation and neurologic dysfunction, neutropenia, oculocutaneous albinism. There is impairment in the function of T cells, NK cells and granulocytes. • Pearson syndrome: rare disorder in which bone marrow fails to produce neutrophils. It also presents with pancytopenia. It is a mitochondrial disease due to defective mitochondrial DNA. Other abnormalities found are: pancreatic fibrosis, insulin dependent diabetes, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, defective muscle function, sideroblastic anaemia and neurological infection. The child dies after birth due to failure to thrive • Chronic idiopathic neutropenia: it is predominantly seen in females. Blood neutrophil count is less than 1.5 x 109 /L. bone marrow examination shows modest decrease in metamyelocytes and neutrophils. If count falls less than 0.5x 109 /ll, it results in fever and minor infections which should be treated by administering G-CSF. • Kostmann syndrome: it is a congenital form of neutropenia, which manifests early in infancy with life threatening bacterial infections. Treatment is with filgrastim (G-CSF)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) A. Associated with CMV False. While both can occur in immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV/AIDS, Pneumocystis jiroveci and CMV are not directly associated. They may co-occur, but one doesn't cause or require the other. B. Diagnosis is by sputum microscopy Partially true, but not the most accurate method. Induced sputum can sometimes help, but bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is more sensitive and preferred for diagnosis. So this is not the best answer. C. Seen only in immunocompromised patients True. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) primarily affects immunocompromised individuals – like those with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients, or those on immunosuppressive therapy. It is rare in immunocompetent people. D. Always associated with pneumatocele False. Pneumatoceles can occur in some cases, especially in children, but they are not always present and not a defining feature",
