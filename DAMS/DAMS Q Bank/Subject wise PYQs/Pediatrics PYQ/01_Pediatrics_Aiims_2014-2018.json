People with severe MPS I generally begin to show other signs and symptoms of the disorder within the first year of life, while those with the attenuated form have milder features that develop later in childhood. Individuals with MPS I may have a large head (macrocephaly), a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), heart valve abnormalities, distinctive-looking facial features that are described as \"coarse,\" an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and a large tongue (macroglossia). Vocal cords can also enlarge, resulting in a deep, hoarse voice.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ref.: Nelson textbook of pediatrics 19/e chap74 Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency can become evident at any age. The most severe form occurs in the first few days of life. This neonatal-onset form of the disorder usually affects males; it is very rare in females. An infant with the neonatal-onset form of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have a poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Infants with this disorder may be described as \"floppy\" and can experience seizures or coma. Complications from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may include developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage may also occur. In some affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may be less severe, and may not appear until later in life. The late-onset form of the disorder occurs in both males and females. People with late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency may experience episodes of altered mental status, such as delirium, erratic behavior, or a reduced level of consciousness. Headaches, vomiting, aversion to protein foods, and seizures can also occur in this form of the disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ref.: Nelson textbook of pediatrics 19/e chap 519 Minimal change disease (MCD) is a major cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS), characterized by intense proteinuria leading to edema and intravascular volume depletion. In adults, it accounts for approximately 15% of patients with idiopathic NS, reaching a much higher percentage at younger ages, up to 70%–90% in children >1 year of age. In the pediatric setting, a renal biopsy is usually not performed if presentation is typical and the patient responds to therapy with oral prednisone at conventional doses. Therefore, in this setting steroid-sensitive NS can be considered synonymous with MCD. The pathologic hallmark of disease is absence of visible alterations by light microscopy and effacement of foot processes by electron microscopy. Although the cause is unknown and it is likely that different subgroups of disease recognize a different pathogenesis, immunologic dysregulation and modifications of the podocyte are thought to synergize in altering the integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and therefore determining proteinuria. The mainstay of therapy is prednisone, but steroid-sensitive forms frequently relapse and this leads to a percentage of patients requiring second-line steroid-sparing immunosuppression. The outcome is variable, but forms of MCD that respond to steroids usually do not lead to chronic renal damage, whereas forms that are unresponsive to steroids may subsequently reveal themselves as FSGS. However, in a substantial number of patients the disease is recurrent and requires long-term immunosuppression, with significant morbidity because of side effects. Recent therapeutic advances, such as the use of anti-CD20 antibodies, have provided long-term remission off-therapy and suggest new hypotheses for disease pathogenesis",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis Ref: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 20/e p 852- 2119 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare pulmonary disease characterised by alveolar accumulation of surfactant. It may result from mutations in surfactant proteins or granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor genes, it may be secondary to toxic inhalation or haematological disorders, or it may be auto-immune, with anti-GM-CSF antibodies blocking activation of alveolar macrophages. Auto-immune alveolar proteinosis is the most frequent form of PAP, representing 90% of cases. Although not specific, high-resolution computed tomography shows a characteristic “crazy paving” pattern. In most cases, bronchoalveolar lavage findings establish the diagnosis. Whole lung lavage is the most effective therapy, especially for auto-immune disease. Novel therapies targeting alveolar macrophages (recombinant GM-CSF therapy) or anti-GM-CSF antibodies (rituximab and plasmapheresis) are being investigated. Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of PAP has improved in the past 20 yrs, but therapy for PAP still needs improvement. Diagnosis of PAP is initiated by computed tomography (CT) scan and confirmed by staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Diagnosis of PAP rarely requires lung biopsy. Three main categories of PAP have been defined depending on the aetiology: auto-immune (previously named primary or idiopathic), secondary and genetic. Genetic PAP is seen especially in children, and radio-clinical presentation depends on the mutated gene. Adult forms are mostly auto-immune (with anti-granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies) and/or secondary to toxic inhalation or haematological disorders, without anti-GM-CSF antibodies.",

Nelson textbook of Pediatrics, 20th edition, Page 1592 Explanation: MATERNAL CMV INFECTION Primary CMV infection occurs in 1% to 3% of pregnant women. It is estimated that 30% to 40% of foetuses of women with primary infection will become infected with CMV, and approximately 15% of these foetuses will develop significant disease. Infection during early gestation likely carries a higher risk of severe fetal disease. Maternal CMV tends to be asymptomatic and patients will rarely be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone. CONGENITAL CMV INFECTION Among congenital infection 10% cases are symptomatic 90% cases are asymptomatic Severe multi organ disease is infrequent and occurs in less than 5% of infants with congenital CMV infections. Classical manifestations Hepatosplenomegaly Petechial rashes Jaundice Microcephaly Intracranial calcification Neutropenia Laboratory Findings Direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevation of hepatic transaminases, CBC findings: Reduced platelets, anemia, Abnormal findings on cranial USG. CSF Analysis Elevation of mono-nuclear cells and protein levels in CSF Chorioretinitis is seen in some of the affected infants (<10%) Hearing loss is the most common long-term sequel of congenital CMW infection Diagnosis The diagnosis is made if CMV is identified in urine, saliva, blood, or respiratory secretions and defined as congenital infection if found within the first 2 weeks of life and as perinatal infection if after 4 weeks of life Spin-enhanced culture or “shell vial.” CMV antigen. CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CMV IgG and IgM. Universal newborn hearing screening is recommended to detect hearing loss as early as possible. HEARING LOSS Genetic Approximately 50% of congenital hearing loss is thought to be of genetic origin, 70% recessive, 15% autosomal dominant and 15% with other types of genetic transmission Most common genetic cause of hearing loss is a mutation in the connexion 26(Cx26) gene, located on chromosome 13q11-12 Approximately 30% of infants with hearing loss have other associated medical problems that are part of a syndrome (Alport, Pierre Robin, Usher, Waardenburg Syndrome, Trisomy 21) Nongenetic CMV is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss Persistence of IGg after six month is diagnostic.

It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system. Additional signs and symptoms include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa) is a less severe form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Brain death is a clinical diagnosis where there is irreversible loss of all brain functions, including the brainstem. It is important to recognize signs that are consistent with brain death and differentiate them from conditions that might appear similar but are not indicative of brain death. Here’s why A. Normal BP without pharmacological support is incorrect as a sign of brain death: • In brain death, autonomic functions such as blood pressure regulation are no longer functioning because the brainstem is non-functional. Therefore, a patient who is brain dead usually has unstable blood pressure, often requiring pharmacological support to maintain it. • Normal blood pressure without pharmacological support would not be consistent with brain death, as brainstem failure typically leads to instability in blood pressure. Why the other options are signs of brain death: B. Positive spinal reflexes on stimulation: Even though the brain is dead, spinal reflexes (like the spinal cord's response to stimulation) can still be present. These reflexes are mediated by the spinal cord, which can function independently of the brain after brain death. C. Sweating and tachycardia: Sweating and tachycardia can occur due to the loss of brainstem regulation, leading to autonomic dysfunction. These signs can still be seen in brain-dead patients. D. Decorticate and decerebrate posturing: These types of posturing are reflex movements that occur when the brain is still functioning at some level, especially the brainstem. However, decerebrate posturing can still occur in a brain-dead patient because reflex movements mediated by the spinal cord may be observed.",
