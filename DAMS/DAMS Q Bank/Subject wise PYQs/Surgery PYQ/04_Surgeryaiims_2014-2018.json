It is less common and less severe after laparoscopic surgery. Different types of pain have been described but the most severe is neuralgic pain due to nerve irritation. This may be the result of nerve injury at the time of operation or chronic irritation of nerves by suture material or mesh. Careful identification and protection of all three nerves passing along the inguinal canal reduces the incidence of neuralgic pain. This type of pain is also very uncommon after laparoscopic surgery which is performed at a deeper level away from the nerves. Some contribution to chronic pain may be due to the mesh which can become embedded in a dense collagenous reaction with shrinkage. This causes tissue tension and rigidity.",

In this situation, early defibrillation is the key to returning the victim's heart back to a normal rhythm. When a defibrillator is not readily available, a rescuer or bystander should keep the blood flowing by performing chest compressions and rescue breaths at an age-appropriate rate until it is. Respiratory Arrest Respiratory arrest is when there is no measurable breathing in a victim. It tends to occur in conjunction with cardiac arrest, but this is not always the case. Respiratory arrest is the most common indication of BLS in infants and toddlers. The most critical factor in restoring breathing in the victim is to provide high quality rescue breaths. Drowning In cases of drowning, rescuers should provide CPR as soon as an unresponsive victim is removed from the water. In particular, rescue breathing is important in this situation. A lone rescuer is typically advised to give CPR for a short time before leaving the victim to call emergency medical services. Since the primary cause of cardiac arrest and death in drowning and choking victims is hypoxemia, it is recommended to start with rescue breaths before proceeding to chest compressions (if pulseless). If the victim presents in a shockable rhythm, early defibrillation is still recommended. Ref: BLS/ACLS Guidelines: https:// www.resus.org.uk/resuscittion-guidelines/adult-advanced-life-support/",

      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Malignant obstruction A bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL is an extraordinarily high value in the context of obstructive jaundice. Normal bilirubin levels are typically below 1.2 mg/dL. While any severe obstruction can raise bilirubin, levels reaching 20 mg/dL or higher, and especially as high as 40 mg/dL, are highly suggestive of a malignant (cancerous) cause. Malignant obstructions (e.g., pancreatic head cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary carcinoma) tend to cause a complete, rigid, and unrelenting blockage of the common bile duct. This results in maximum impedance to bile flow and thus the highest possible bilirubin accumulation, as the obstruction is typically progressive and unrelieved. Incorrect Options: Option (B) Complete obstruction of common bile duct Explanation: While a complete obstruction is necessary to achieve such high bilirubin levels, this option describes the nature of the obstruction rather than its cause. Both benign (e.g., a very large, impacted gallstone) and malignant causes can lead to complete obstruction. However, malignant obstructions are far more likely to produce such persistently and profoundly high bilirubin levels because they are often more severe, less amenable to spontaneous resolution, and can progressively worsen the blockage. Therefore, while true that it's a complete obstruction, \"malignant obstruction\" is a more specific and statistically probable etiology for a bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL. Option (C) Renal failure Explanation: Renal failure (kidney failure) primarily affects the excretion of waste products by the kidneys. Bilirubin is processed by the liver and primarily excreted in bile via the gastrointestinal tract, with only a very small amount excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, isolated renal failure would not cause a bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL. While patients with severe multi-organ failure (which could include both liver and kidney failure) might have high bilirubin, renal failure itself is not the primary explanation for such a high bilirubin level in the context of obstructive jaundice. Option (D) Liver failure Explanation: Liver failure means the liver cells themselves are damaged and unable to conjugate (process) or excrete bilirubin effectively. In severe liver failure, bilirubin levels can indeed become very high. However, the question specifies \"obstructive jaundice,\" indicating that the primary problem is a blockage of bile flow, not a primary failure of the liver cells to produce or metabolize bile. While prolonged, severe obstructive jaundice can secondarily lead to liver damage over time, a bilirubin level of 40 mg/dL primarily suggests an extremely severe obstruction, with malignancy being the most common cause of such a profound and unremitting blockage. If it were primary liver failure, other signs of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., coagulopathy, encephalopathy) would be more prominent, and the jaundice would not necessarily be classified as purely \"obstructive.\"",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The thyroid function test (TFT) results show: TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) much higher than normal: This indicates that the pituitary gland is working overtime, trying to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones. Free T4 (Thyroxine) subnormal: This indicates that the thyroid gland itself is not producing enough thyroid hormone. This specific combination of a high TSH and a low Free T4 is the hallmark of primary hypothyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid gland is the primary problem; it is underactive and cannot produce sufficient thyroid hormones. The pituitary gland then compensates by increasing TSH secretion in an attempt to \"kick-start\" the failing thyroid. Incorrect Options: Option B. Hyperthyroidism: Explanation: Hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid, would present with the opposite laboratory findings: a low TSH (because the pituitary gland reduces stimulation to an overactive thyroid) and a high Free T4 (due to excessive thyroid hormone production). Option C. Subclinical hypothyroidism: Explanation: Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a high TSH (indicating mild thyroid underactivity) but a normal Free T4. The thyroid is just beginning to become underactive, and the pituitary is working harder to maintain T4 levels within the normal range. The \"subnormal\" Free T4 in the question rules out subclinical hypothyroidism. Option D. Secondary hypothyroidism: Explanation: Secondary hypothyroidism is a rare condition where the problem lies with the pituitary gland itself, which fails to produce enough TSH. This would result in a low TSH (due to pituitary dysfunction) and consequently a low Free T4 (because the thyroid isn't receiving enough stimulation). The \"much higher than normal\" TSH in the question contradicts this diagnosis.",

The most common sites of metastasis are the axillary lymph nodes (LNs). Moreover, the number of metastasis-positive LNs is considered the most powerful predictor of patient prognosis. Despite screening tests, approximately 8% to 30% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are at an advanced stage, with extensive LN metastasis. Although the development of multimodal treatments has improved survival outcomes in breast cancer patients, outcomes remain unsatisfactory in patients with multiple axillary LN metastases. Older treatment regimens resulted in 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of approximately 40%, more recent advanced treatment modalities have resulted in 5-year OS rates of 66% and 81%. Despite these improvements, however, factors prognostic of survival in patients with extensive LN metastasis remain unclear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) E2VNTM3 The patient's GCS score is E2VNTM3. This is determined by assessing each component based on the patient's presentation: Eye (E) Response: E2 The patient exhibits \"eye opening to pain.\" According to the GCS criteria, eye opening in response to a pain stimulus is assigned a score of 2. Verbal (V) Response: VNT The patient is \"intubated.\" This means a true verbal response cannot be assessed, as their airway is compromised by the tube. In such cases, the verbal component is marked as \"Not Testable\" (NT) or \"T\" (for tube), indicating that the physical limitation prevents evaluation. Therefore, VNT is the appropriate designation. Motor (M) Response: M3 The patient displays \"abnormal flexion.\" This refers to decorticate posturing, a specific motor response to pain characterized by internal rotation of the shoulder, flexion of the forearm and wrist with a clenched fist, and leg extension with plantarflexion of the foot. According to GCS motor criteria, this response is assigned a score of 3. Incorrect Options: B. E2VTM3: While VTM3 is also a common and acceptable way to denote \"verbal not testable\" for an intubated patient (where 'T' stands for tube), VNT explicitly spells out \"Not Testable\" which aligns perfectly with the inability to assess. Both convey the same information about the verbal component. However, given the option set, and the clear \"Not Testable\" implication, A is a highly precise representation. C. E2V1M3: Assigning a V1 score (\"No verbal response\") to an intubated patient is incorrect. A V1 implies the patient could speak but chose not to or was unable to produce any sound, which isn't the case here. The verbal component cannot be assessed at all due to the physical presence of the endotracheal tube, making it \"not testable.\" D. E2VTM4: This option is incorrect because the motor response of \"abnormal flexion\" (decorticate posturing) corresponds to an M3 score, not M4. An M4 response indicates \"Withdrawal from pain,\" where the patient pulls away from the painful stimulus but without abnormal posturing.",

GISTs may present with trouble swallowing, gastrointestinal bleeding, or metastases (mainly in the liver). Intestinal obstruction is rare, due to the tumor's outward pattern of growth.

The obturator sign or Cope's obturator test is an indicator of irritation to the obturator internus muscle. The technique for detecting the obturator sign, called the obturator test, is carried out on each leg in succession. The patient lies on her/his back with the hip and knee both flexed at ninety degrees. The examiner holds the patient's ankle with one hand and knee with the other hand. The examiner internally rotates the hip by moving the patient's ankle away from the patient's body while allowing the knee to move only inward. This is flexion and internal rotation of the hip. In the clinical context, it is performed when acute appendicitis is suspected Carnett's test is a simple clinical test in which abdominal tenderness is evaluated in supine position while the patient tenses the abdominal muscles. It is useful for differentiating abdominal wall pain from intra-abdominal pain Ballance sign: A dull percussion resonance sound heard on the right flank of a patient lying in the left decubitus position, an indication ofa ruptured spleen. The sound is caused by an accumulation of liquid blood on the right side and coagulated blood on theleft.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In the epigastric area: In infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the classic finding is a palpable “olive-shaped” mass in the epigastric region, specifically in the right upper quadrant near the midline. This mass represents the hypertrophied pylorus. It is best felt after vomiting or when the stomach is relatively empty but the child is calm, not during active feeding. The epigastric location corresponds to the anatomical position of the pylorus. Incorrect Options: A. During feeding: While symptoms like projectile non-bilious vomiting are often seen during or shortly after feeding, the abdominal mass is not best palpated during feeding, because the baby may be tense or crying, making palpation more difficult. B. In the umbilical area: This is not the typical location. The pylorus lies above and to the right of the umbilicus — specifically in the epigastric/right upper quadrant. D. In the right hypochondriac quadrant: This area is too far lateral and superior. The pyloric mass is usually more medial and in the epigastric area, not under the ribs in the hypochondriac region.",

They appear encapsulated and well-circumscribed however the pseudocapsule is delicate and incomplete with microscopic extensions reaching beyond it, accounting for the high risk of recurrence when these tumors are enucleated. The gross appearance depends upon the relative proportion of epithelial elements and a stromal component which may range from myxoid to cartilage. Tumors with a prominent cartilaginous matrix have a bluish-grey opalescent appearance. Three histological types have been described: • myxoid (hypocellular): most common, highest rate of recurrence • cellular • classic",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The parathyroid glands were identified, resected and stored in iced saline until completion of the operation. Part of the extracted supposed parathyroid glands and the surrounding fat tissue was sent for frozen section examination to confirm being parathyroid glands and to exclude malignant invasion. Each parathyroid gland was sliced into 1–3 mm slices and three or four grafts were implanted into separated muscle pockets in the anterior forearm muscles (in brachioradialis muscle), then the muscle is closed with non absorbable sutures However in our study we preferred transplantation of the parathyroid gland in the forearm instead of the neck as this site has many advantages. First, it is easy to assess the function of the graft by assessment of PTH level of antecubital vein of the grafted limb. Secondly, most of our patients have advanced tumor and most of them are in need for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy or have already received preoperative radiotherapy which has an adverse effect on function and vascularity of grafted parathyroid gland. Another factor is that the sternomastoid muscle may be resected with radical neck dissection during the primary surgery or surgery for treatment of nodal recurrence. For all of these reasons, we preferred to do our transplanted parathyroid gland in the forearm instead of the neck.",
