Greater auricular nerve-causes Loss of sensation while shaving as it supplies area near angle of mandible. 3. Auriculotemporal nerve -Patient presents with Frey's syndrome,also known as gustatory sweating.Patient presents with sweating & erythema in area of parotid.It occurs due to inappropriate regeneration of post ganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers,which unite with the sympathetic fibers of the superior cervical ganglia,which is responsibie for sweating & erythema.

The gag reflex, also known as the pharyngeal reflex, is an involuntary reflex involving bilateral pharyngeal muscle contraction and elevation of the soft palate. The afferent limb of the reflex is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), which inputs to the nucleus solitarius and the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The efferent limb is supplied by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) from the nucleus ambiguus. All of these are located in the medulla.",

It is also known to reduce the incidence of secondary primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast. Tamoxifen increases the risk of Endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women , hence aromatase Inhibitors are used in post-menopausal women.

Complications include: Hypocalcemia Due to citrate in stored blood binding calcium. Hypomagnesemia Can occur similarly due to citrate binding magnesium. Hyperkalemia Stored red blood cells leak potassium over time, especially in older units. When transfused rapidly, this can cause elevated serum potassium levels.",

It mimics acute mastitis . The hallmark of Inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of the dermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin , often without a discrete underlying tumor mass (peau d' orange appearance). The patient presents with rapidly progressive swelling of the breast, warmth , erythema and edema . A breast lump may or may not be present . - A diagnosis of Inflammatory breast carcinoma should be suspected when a patient with rapidly progressive swelling with Inflammatory skin changes does not respond to antibiotics. The imaging features with ultrasound and a mammogram is non-specific because of underlying erythema and edema . A biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In this case, a 24-year-old male involved in a road traffic accident presents with an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, which are signs of physiological stress, likely due to chest trauma. Although the chest X-ray is not shown here, trauma of this nature commonly results in injuries such as pneumothorax, rib fractures, or pulmonary contusions. In such patients, epidural anesthesia is contraindicated because it can worsen respiratory compromise by blocking the intercostal nerves needed for effective breathing. Additionally, epidural anesthesia causes vasodilation through sympathetic blockade, which may lead to hypotension — a serious risk in trauma patients who could already be experiencing blood loss or shock. Furthermore, if a spinal injury is suspected, inserting an epidural needle could cause further neurological damage. Therefore, in the context of this trauma scenario, epidural anesthesia is contraindicated",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) When a surgeon attempts to reduce an inguinal hernia, but instead of the contents sliding back into the abdominal cavity, the entire hernial sac (along with its contents) is pushed en masse through the defect and into the preperitoneal space, this is known as reduction en masse. This is a dangerous situation because the contents of the hernia, although apparently reduced from the external view, remain within the sac but are still outside the main peritoneal cavity. This means the contents are still susceptible to strangulation or obstruction, and the true nature of the reduction is missed, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis of complications. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: B. Maydl's hernia: Maydl's hernia, also known as W-hernia, is a type of incarcerated or strangulated hernia where two loops of bowel are present in the hernial sac, and the connecting loop inside the abdominal cavity is strangulated. This is a specific type of complicated hernia, not a description of a reduction maneuver. C. Sliding hernia: A sliding hernia occurs when a retroperitoneal organ (like a part of the colon or bladder) forms part of the wall of the hernial sac, rather than just being contained within it. The organ \"slides\" into the hernia, and its reduction involves reducing the organ itself, not the entire sac as a separate entity. D. Incarcerated hernia: An incarcerated hernia refers to a hernia whose contents are trapped in the sac and cannot be manually reduced back into the abdominal cavity. While reduction en masse often occurs during an attempt to reduce an incarcerated hernia, \"incarcerated hernia\" describes the state of the hernia, not the specific complication of an incomplete reduction of the sac itself.",

Option B-Healing by secondary intention involves an open wound closing naturally from the base upwards, without direct closure, often used for wounds with large tissue loss or those that cannot be safely closed with stitches. Option C-Tertiary intention, also known as delayed primary closure, involves initially leaving a wound open to allow for debridement and observation, then closing it later when conditions are appropriate.",

In a week-old child, the lower esophageal sphincter is often immature, leading to a common phenomenon where stomach contents easily flow back into the esophagus. This results in non-bilious (not green, as bile isn't involved at this level) and non-projectile (not forceful) vomiting, often appearing as \"spitting up\" or \"wet burps.\" A normal abdominal examination is typical in these cases. While milk allergy can cause vomiting, it often presents with other symptoms like rash, diarrhea, or irritability, which are not mentioned here. Small bowel obstruction usually involves bilious vomiting and abdominal distension, making it unlikely. Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (CHPS) characteristically presents with projectile non-bilious vomiting, usually later than one week of age (typically 3-6 weeks), which contradicts the \"non-projectile\" description.",
