      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A-This is a case of Telogen effluvium,which is a common type of hair loss that affects people after they experience severe stress or a change to their body. Symptoms include thinning hair, usually around the top of your head. Treatment exists to reverse hair loss, but hair will typically grow back in three to six months without treatment. Option B-Female pattern hair loss leads to central balding,but there will be no history of stressor like fever. Option C-Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that attacks your body’s hair follicles, causing patchy hair loss.It will be a well circumscribed patch with no erythema or inflammation.Again,there will be no history of stressor like fever. Option D-Trichotillomania is when someone cannot resist the urge to pull out their hair. They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes.It can present with tonsure sign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A-The Koebner phenomenon is the appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary to trauma.This phenomenon is also termed the isomorphic response, given that the new lesions appear clinically and histologically identical to the patient’s underlying cutaneous disease.In other words, a patient with psoriasis who exhibits koebnerization (and is said to be “Koebner-positive”) develops new psoriasiform lesions along sites of skin injury, even if trivial. Option B-The reverse Koebner phenomenon is the disappearance of a skin lesion after trauma to the area. Option C-Gottron papules are symmetric changes over the extensor surfaces of joints, being characterised with erythematous and scaly plaques,seen in dermatomyositis. Option D-Nikolsky sign is demonstrated when lateral pressure is applied on the border of an intact blister, which results in the dislodgment of the normal epidermis and extension of the blister.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/21(235).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Option B-In this case,we can see an annual plaque is present wioth central clearing.If Annular plaque is present and : - Central atrophy - Lupus Vulgaris Central clearing - Tinea /dermatophtic infections Central crusting - Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Option C-Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare condition that causes large, painful sores on the skin,which can later ulcerate. The sores can develop quickly. Most often they appear on the legs. The exact causes of pyoderma gangrenosum are unknown, but it appears to be a disorder of the immune system. Option D-Ichthyosis vulgaris is an inherited or acquired skin condition that occurs when the skin doesn’t shed its dead skin cells.This causes dry, dead skin cells to accumulate in patches on the surface of the skin. It’s also known as “fish scale disease” because the dead skin accumulates in a similar pattern to a fish’s scales.",

Melanin controls the pigmentation (color) of your skin, eyes and hair. People with albinism have extremely pale skin, eyes and hair.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color, is primarily formed from the amino acid tyrosine. This complex biochemical process, known as melanogenesis, occurs within specialized cells called melanocytes. The initial and rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis is the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), and then the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone. Both these steps are catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. Subsequent reactions, involving various intermediates, lead to the formation of different types of melanin, primarily eumelanin (black/brown pigment) and pheomelanin (red/yellow pigment). Therefore, tyrosine is the fundamental precursor for all melanin production. Why other options are incorrect: B. Tryptophan: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor for several important biomolecules, including serotonin, melatonin, and niacin (Vitamin B3). However, it is not involved in the synthesis of melanin. C. Leucine: Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) crucial for protein synthesis, muscle repair, and energy production. It plays no role in melanin formation. D. Valine: Valine is also an essential branched-chain amino acid involved in muscle metabolism and tissue repair. Like leucine, it is not a precursor for melanin.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Explanation: The patient presents with a combination of symptoms: hair loss in a particular pattern (moth-eaten alopecia, which is visible in the image), flat lesions near the anal canal (condylomata lata), and rashes on the body. This constellation of symptoms is highly suggestive of secondary syphilis, a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum (A). Moth-eaten alopecia is a characteristic, albeit uncommon, manifestation of secondary syphilis, resulting from patchy hair loss. Condylomata lata are moist, broad-based, raised papules that are highly infectious and typically found in anogenital or intertriginous areas in secondary syphilis. Generalized rashes, often maculopapular and non-itchy, are also common in this stage. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect: B. Microsporum: Microsporum is a genus of fungi that causes dermatophytosis, specifically tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp). While it causes hair loss, it typically results in well-demarcated patches of alopecia with scaling and broken hairs, and it does not cause the widespread flat lesions or body rashes described, nor condylomata lata. C. Sporothrix: Sporothrix is a dimorphic fungus that causes sporotrichosis, primarily affecting the skin (cutaneous sporotrichosis), usually presenting as nodular lesions that may ulcerate and spread along lymphatic channels. It is not typically associated with the type of hair loss or generalized rashes described, nor with condylomata lata. D. Malassezia: Malassezia is a genus of yeast that is part of the normal skin flora but can cause various skin conditions, including seborrheic dermatitis, tinea versicolor, and folliculitis. While seborrheic dermatitis can cause scalp flaking and some hair thinning, it does not cause the characteristic \"moth-eaten\" alopecia or the flat anal lesions and body rashes seen in secondary syphilis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) For the 25-year-old male patient presenting with papular acne on his back, as shown in the image, Systemic Doxycycline (Option B) is generally the most appropriate drug. Papular acne, which indicates inflammatory lesions (red, raised bumps), especially when widespread on the back, often requires a systemic approach for effective management. Doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is highly effective in treating moderate to severe inflammatory acne due to its dual action: it reduces the population of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), a bacterium contributing to acne inflammation, and it possesses significant anti-inflammatory properties. Its systemic delivery ensures that the medication reaches all affected areas, making it a practical and efficacious choice for widespread truncal acne where topical application can be difficult and less effective. Topical Dapsone (Option A) is less likely to be the primary answer. While topical dapsone is an anti-inflammatory agent used for inflammatory acne, particularly in certain patient populations, its efficacy for widespread or more significant papular acne on the back is generally not as robust as systemic treatments. Topical medications can also be cumbersome to apply consistently to large areas like the back. Systemic Minocycline (Option C) is also a systemic tetracycline antibiotic, similar to doxycycline, and is indeed a highly effective treatment for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Both doxycycline and minocycline are common first-line systemic antibiotics for this type of acne. In a multiple-choice scenario where only one \"best\" answer can be selected without further differentiating factors (e.g., patient allergies, specific side effect profiles), both B and C are strong candidates. However, often only one is presented as the intended best choice in such questions, and doxycycline is very frequently prescribed. Systemic Isotretinoin (Option D) is a potent oral retinoid reserved for severe forms of acne, such as nodulocystic acne, acne that is recalcitrant to other treatments, or acne causing significant scarring or psychological distress. While highly effective and capable of inducing long-term remission, it has a significant side effect profile and requires strict monitoring. The image, while showing papular acne, does not necessarily depict the severity typically warranting isotretinoin as an initial treatment; it's generally considered after less aggressive systemic options like antibiotics have failed or if the acne is clearly severe from the outset.",
