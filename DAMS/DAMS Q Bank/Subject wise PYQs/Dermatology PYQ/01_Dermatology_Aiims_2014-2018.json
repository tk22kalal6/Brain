      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dermatitis herpetiformis is an immunobullous disease which targets tissue transglutaminase. It presents as excoriated papules over elbows, knees and buttocks. The lesions are very itchy. Dapone is an effective therapy. On HPE we get neutrophilic microabcess on tips of dermal papillae. On DIF we get granular IgA deposits. An underlying genetic predisposition to the development of dermatitis herpetiformis has been demonstrated. Both dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease (CD) are associated with an increased expression of HLA-A1, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes. Environmental factors are also important; monozygotic twins may have dermatitis herpetiformis, celiac disease, and/or gluten-sensitive enteropathy with variable symptomatology.",
