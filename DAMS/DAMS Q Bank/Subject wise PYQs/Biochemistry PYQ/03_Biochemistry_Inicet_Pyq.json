      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) L-gulonolactone oxidase Humans (along with some other primates, guinea pigs, and bats) cannot synthesize Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) due to a genetic mutation that has rendered the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase nonfunctional. L-gulonolactone oxidase is the final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway that converts glucose to ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). The absence of this enzyme blocks the conversion of L-gulono-γ-lactone to ascorbic acid, thus making dietary intake essential for Vitamin C. Incorrect Options: B. Xylitol reductase: Involved in sugar alcohol metabolism, particularly in the conversion of xylulose to xylitol. It has no role in Vitamin C synthesis. C. Pyruvate dehydrogenase: Plays a central role in aerobic respiration, converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Again, unrelated to Vitamin C biosynthesis. D. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase: Catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid, important in glycosaminoglycan synthesis, not ascorbic acid production.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) RT-PCR is a molecular technique that is based on RNA. It is used to detect and quantify RNA expression levels by converting RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, followed by amplification using PCR. It is commonly used in gene expression studies, viral RNA detection (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), and mRNA quantification. This is the only option among the choices that specifically starts with RNA as the template. Incorrect Options: B. Sanger’s technique: DNA sequencing method based on chain termination using dideoxynucleotides. It uses DNA as the template, not RNA. C. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS): High-throughput DNA sequencing technology. Although RNA can be sequenced after converting it to cDNA, the technique itself is DNA-based. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) tRNA of alanine tRNA of alanine, like all tRNAs, is transcribed by RNA polymerase III and does not undergo 5’ capping. Instead of a 5’ cap, tRNAs are processed differently: the 5’ leader sequence is cleaved by RNase P, and the 3’ end is trimmed and appended with CCA. tRNAs also undergo extensive base modifications to become mature and functional. Since 5’ capping is a feature typically seen in transcripts from RNA polymerase II, tRNAs completely lack this modification. Incorrect Options: B. U6 snRNA U6 snRNA is involved in the spliceosome complex and is transcribed by RNA polymerase III. While it does not have the conventional 7-methylguanosine cap, it does have a unique γ-monomethyl triphosphate cap at the 5’ end, which is still a form of 5' end modification. Thus, it requires 5’ capping, albeit in a distinct form. C. mRNA for histone Histone mRNAs are unique among eukaryotic mRNAs in that they lack a poly-A tail, but they do have a 5’ cap. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and the 5’ cap is essential for their stability and translation, just like other mRNAs. D. siRNA siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) themselves are short, double-stranded RNA molecules that do not require capping in their mature form. However, the precursor transcripts (e.g., shRNA or long dsRNA) from which siRNAs are processed may be transcribed by RNA polymerase II and thus can be capped. This makes their association with capping context-dependent, so they are not as universally exempt as tRNAs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Methylation Methylation of cytosine residues, particularly at CpG islands in gene promoter regions, is a key epigenetic modification that suppresses gene expression and promotes the formation of heterochromatin (inactive chromatin) rather than permissive euchromatin. CpG islands are regions rich in cytosine and guanine nucleotides linked by phosphate (CpG) Methylation of cytosines here by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) leads to gene silencing by: Preventing binding of transcription factors Recruiting proteins like MeCP2 that condense chromatin into inactive heterochromatin Thus, methylation is anti-permissive and does not favor euchromatin. Incorrect Options: B. Phosphorylation Refers to the addition of phosphate groups, especially on histone tails. Can lead to chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation (permissive euchromatin), especially during DNA repair or active transcription. C. Alkylation Generally refers to the addition of alkyl groups. While alkylation can cause mutations and is more associated with chemical damage, it’s not a major regulatory mechanism of chromatin structure like methylation is. Its role in euchromatin/heterochromatin status is indirect and context-dependent. D. Sumoylation Post-translational modification involving the attachment of SUMO proteins. Often leads to transcriptional repression by promoting heterochromatin formation, but it does not involve CpG cytosine modification directly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 27 minutes At a substrate concentration of 1000 times the Km, the enzyme is operating under zero-order kinetics—meaning the reaction rate is independent of substrate concentration and depends solely on the enzyme concentration. When the enzyme is fully saturated, it works at Vmax, and under this condition, 12 μg/mL of product is formed in 9 minutes. Now, the substrate concentration is doubled to 2000×Km, which is still saturating, so the enzyme continues to operate at Vmax. However, the enzyme concentration is reduced to 1/3, and since Vmax is directly proportional to enzyme concentration, the new Vmax will also be 1/3 of the original. Therefore, the rate of product formation is reduced to 1/3, meaning it will take 3 times longer to produce the same amount of product (12 μg/mL). Hence, the new time required = 9 × 3 = 27 minutes. Incorrect options: Option A: 9 minutes This assumes the reaction rate is unchanged, which is incorrect. Since the enzyme concentration is reduced, the rate drops to 1/3, and the time required increases. So the reaction will not reach the same product level in 9 minutes under the new conditions. Option B: 4.5 minutes This would be correct only if the reaction rate had increased, possibly due to increased enzyme concentration. But here the enzyme concentration is decreased, so the reaction becomes slower, not faster. Option D: 13.5 minutes This suggests a 1.5× increase in time, which doesn’t fit with a 3× slower reaction rate due to the enzyme being reduced to 1/3. This underestimates the actual delay caused by the drop in enzyme concentration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phosphofructokinase I (PFK-1) Phosphofructokinase I (PFK-1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, responsible for converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. During fasting, the body shifts from glucose utilization to glucose conservation and alternate energy sources like fatty acids. In the fasting state, there is: Low insulin, high glucagon ↑ cAMP, ↑ PKA activity ↓ glycolysis, ↑ gluconeogenesis PFK-1 is inhibited by low insulin, high ATP, and citrate, leading to decreased glycolytic activity Thus, PFK-1 activity falls in fasting to conserve glucose. Incorrect Options: A. Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) Activated during fasting due to low insulin and high glucagon/epinephrine. Responsible for lipolysis: breaking down stored triglycerides in adipose tissue into free fatty acids for energy. B. Glycogen Phosphorylase Activated in fasting to release glucose from liver glycogen stores. Stimulated by glucagon (in liver) and epinephrine (in muscle/liver). C. Pyruvate Carboxylase Activated in fasting, especially in the liver. Key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, converting pyruvate to oxaloacetate, helping generate glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.",

This enzyme breaks down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate in muscle. Without it, glycogen accumulates, but muscle can't access glucose for energy during exercise, leading to pain, fatigue, cramps, and even myoglobinuria. Incorrect Options: A. Muscle debranching enzyme Deficiency causes Cori disease (GSD III), which also leads to glycogen accumulation. However, it affects liver and muscle, not only muscle, and is less associated with exercise-induced symptoms. B.

Once inside the body, fluoroacetate is converted to fluorocitrate, which acts as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase. Mechanism: Fluoroacetate → Fluorocitrate Fluorocitrate inhibits aconitase, an enzyme that converts citrate to isocitrate in the TCA cycle. This halts the TCA cycle, leading to: Accumulation of citrate Energy production failure (ATP depletion) Cellular toxicity, especially in high-energy demanding tissues like the heart and brain Thus, fluoroacetate poisoning specifically targets and inhibits the TCA cycle. Incorrect Options: B. Glycolytic Pathway Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol and breaks down glucose to pyruvate. Fluoroacetate does not directly affect enzymes in glycolysis. C. Oxidative Phosphorylation This process occurs in the mitochondria and involves ATP synthesis using the electron transport chain. Fluoroacetate affects an earlier step in metabolism (TCA cycle), not ATP synthase or proton gradients. D.

During this process, Vitamin K is oxidized to vitamin K epoxide. To reuse Vitamin K as a coenzyme, it must be converted back to its reduced, active form. This regeneration is catalyzed by the enzyme: ? Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) — also called epoxide reductase. This enzyme is the target of warfarin, an anticoagulant that inhibits VKOR and thereby reduces the activation of clotting factors. Incorrect Options: A. Glutathione reductase: Regenerates reduced glutathione (GSH) from its oxidized form (GSSG) using NADPH. Plays a role in antioxidant defense, not Vitamin K metabolism. B. Pyruvate carboxylase: A biotin-dependent enzyme that converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate in gluconeogenesis. Unrelated to Vitamin K or clotting factor activation. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Complementation The image depicts the LacZ α-complementation system, a molecular biology technique used especially in blue-white screening to detect recombinant bacterial colonies. This system relies on complementation of two inactive fragments of β-galactosidase enzyme to form an active enzyme. The host bacteria carry a mutant LacZ gene (deletion in amino acids 11–41), resulting in inactive β-galactosidase. A plasmid (vector) carries the LacZ α-fragment, which can complement the defect in the host's LacZ gene. When both fragments are expressed together, they form active β-galactosidase. If X-gal (a chromogenic substrate) is present, the active enzyme cleaves it, producing a blue-colored product. Blue colonies = non-recombinant (functional LacZα) White colonies = recombinant (interrupted LacZα) This is a classic example of complementation — where two defective gene products can interact to restore function. Incorrect Options: A. Translation Refers to the process of protein synthesis from mRNA. While translation is occurring here, the core concept in the image is about functional restoration, not just protein synthesis. B. Transformation Refers to the uptake of foreign DNA by bacteria. Though plasmids are involved, transformation is not the focus here — it's about the functional complementation after uptake. D.

It maintains high fidelity during DNA replication DNA polymerase enzyme is responsible for maintaining the fidelity of DNA while replication is taking place. Telomerase enzyme is responsible for maintain length of daughter DNA while replication takes place. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein having a RNA template in it. RNA provides scaffolding on which telomere gets synthesized by reverse transcriptase activity. Only eukaryotic DNA have this problem of end shortening as they are linear in nature, hence this protection by telomerase and telomere is needed only in eukaryotic DNA and not in prokaryotic DNA.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image-20230420163256-21.png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by absolute lack of insulin which results in increased mobilization of fatty acid from TAG of adipose cell. Excess fatty acid beta oxidation then results in more production of acetyl Co A which cannot be handled by TCA cycle all in all. Surplus acetyl co A thus is diverted to ketone body formation. Beta hydroxybutyrate is the enzyme during ketogenesis which shows increased activity during ketogenesis.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image-20230420164948-26.png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

In prolonged starvation and diabetic ketoacidosis, oxaloacetate is depleted for gluconeogenesis. With chronic alcohol overuse, high NADH state leads to accumulation of oxaloacetate (downregulated TCA cycle), shunting it to malate. Ketone bodies: acetone, (ketone) acetoacetate (ketoacid), β-hydroxybutyrate (ketoacid). Breath smells like acetone (fruity odor). Urine test for ketones can detect acetoacetate, but not β-hydroxybutyrate. RBCs cannot utilize ketone bodies; they strictly use glucose. Liver cells lack β ketoacyl-CoA transferase so cannot use ketone bodies as fuel. HMG-CoA lyase for ketone body production. HMG-CoA reductase for cholesterol synthesis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Real-time PCR (also called quantitative PCR or qPCR) is the standard technique used to quantify RNA levels. The process typically involves converting RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcription, followed by amplification and real-time measurement of the DNA. The technique uses fluorescent dyes or probes to detect and quantify the amount of DNA as it is amplified, which indirectly reflects the original RNA quantity. This makes real-time PCR highly sensitive and accurate for quantifying gene expression. Incorrect Options: A. RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase PCR): RT-PCR refers to the conversion of RNA to cDNA, followed by PCR amplification. While it is essential for detecting RNA, it is not inherently quantitative unless combined with real-time detection (as in real-time PCR). Standard RT-PCR only shows presence or absence of a transcript. C. Conventional PCR: Conventional PCR is used for amplifying DNA, not RNA, and it is not quantitative. It cannot measure the amount of starting material and is generally used for detecting DNA presence. D. Allele-specific PCR: This is used to detect specific mutations or polymorphisms in DNA sequences. It is not designed for quantifying RNA and is more relevant in genotyping than in gene expression analysis.",

The NIS transports two Na+ ions and one I- ion into the cell against the concentration gradient . The energy for this transport is derived from the Na+-K+ ATPase pump . Na+-K+ ATPase pumps sodium outside the cell and causes low intracellular sodium concentration. This causes sodium to enter the cell by facilitated diffusion. Along with sodium , iodide ions also enter the cell. Since the energy to transport sodium and iodide ions in NIS is derived from Na+-K+ ATPase pump, this is called Secondary Active transport . The NIS is also expressed in Salivary Glands , placenta , Gastric mucosa , Choroid plexus , Mammary glands.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The DNA template strand is given in the 5 to 3 direction as GATCTAC. However, transcription always occurs in the 5 to 3 direction, which means the template must be read 3 to 5. So we first reverse the sequence to get the template strand in the correct reading direction: CATCTAG (3 to 5). Now, using base pairing rules: C → G A → U T → A C → G T → A A → U G → C This gives the RNA sequence: GUAGAUC (5? to 3?), which is the correct RNA transcript. Hence, option B is correct. A. CUAGAUG Explanation: This sequence is the reverse complement (3 to 5 direction) of the correct RNA strand. It would be correct only if the DNA template was given in the 3 to 5 direction, which it wasn’t. Therefore, this option represents the RNA in the wrong direction. C. GTAGATC Explanation: This is a DNA sequence, not RNA, and it is the complementary DNA strand (i.e., the coding strand) without converting T to U. It’s irrelevant in the context of RNA transcription. D. CTAGATG Explanation: This is the non-template (coding) DNA strand, and again contains T instead of U, so it’s not an RNA sequence. Also, it doesn’t match the transcribed RNA in sequence or direction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) • Glucose-6-phosphatase is an enzyme involved in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, where it converts glucose-6-phosphate into glucose. This reaction occurs in the liver and kidneys, which helps maintain blood glucose levels. • In glycogen storage diseases like Von Gierke's disease (which is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase), the inability to convert glucose-6-phosphate into glucose leads to the accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate within liver cells. This accumulation disrupts normal liver function and causes hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). • Hepatomegaly occurs because the liver cells store excessive amounts of glucose-6-phosphate and glycogen as a result of the metabolic block, leading to liver enlargement. Why Other Options Are Incorrect: A. Accumulation of Glycogen Flakes: This is not a primary cause of hepatomegaly in glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. While there is glycogen accumulation in diseases like Von Gierke’s, the main cause of hepatomegaly is the accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (not just glycogen itself). B. Accumulation of Glucose-1-phosphate: Glucose-1-phosphate is an intermediate in glycogen metabolism. While it plays a role in glycogen synthesis and breakdown, its accumulation is not directly responsible for the hepatomegaly seen in glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. D. Accumulation of Glycogenin: Glycogenin is a protein that acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis, but its accumulation does not directly cause hepatomegaly. The main issue in glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is the inability to dephosphorylate glucose-6-phosphate, which leads to its accumulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answe-(B) Hybridoma technology involves the fusion of B cells (producing specific antibodies) with myeloma cells (cancerous cells that can proliferate indefinitely). This results in the creation of hybrid cells known as hybridomas, which can produce large quantities of a single type of antibody. The Purine Salvage Pathway is crucial in hybridoma technology because it allows the hybridoma cells to utilize pre-existing purine nucleotides for DNA and RNA synthesis, thus supporting the rapid proliferation of these cells. Myeloma cells, in particular, rely on this pathway because they often lack the ability to synthesize purines de novo, making them dependent on salvaging purines from the environment. In contrast, the other pathways listed are not as directly related to the process of hybridoma formation and proliferation: A. HMP Shunt: Primarily involved in the production of NADPH and ribose for nucleic acid synthesis, but not the main pathway for hybridoma cells. C. Glycolysis: While glycolysis is essential for energy production, it is not specific to hybridoma technology. D. Fructose Metabolism: This pathway is involved in the metabolism of fructose but isn't relevant to the specific needs of hybridoma cells.",

It plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage and is often cited in textbooks and exams when referencing selenoproteins. Why others are incorrect (as single best answer): B. Thioredoxin Reductase – Also contains selenocysteine, but it is less commonly used as the “go-to” example in standard questions. C. Deiodinase – Contains selenocysteine, but again, not as widely recognized as Glutathione Peroxidase for this purpose. D. Glutathione Synthase – Does not contain selenocysteine.",
