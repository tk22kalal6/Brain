      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A hypertensive crisis triggered by consuming wine is a classic adverse effect associated with Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Wine, along with other fermented foods like aged cheese and beer, contains high levels of tyramine. Normally, the MAO enzyme in the gut breaks down tyramine. However, MAO inhibitors block this enzyme, allowing a dangerous buildup of tyramine in the body. This surge of tyramine causes a massive release of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine, leading to a sudden and severe spike in blood pressure, known as a hypertensive crisis. The other drug classes listed—TCA, SSRI, and SNRI—do not inhibit the MAO enzyme and therefore do not carry the risk of this specific, life-threatening drug-food interaction.",

It is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and works by blocking the reverse transcriptase enzyme used by both viruses to replicate. Here's why the other options are incorrect: B. Interferon: Used to treat Hepatitis B and C, but it is not a primary treatment for HIV. C. Entecavir: Primarily used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B. It has weak activity against HIV and is not used as a standalone HIV treatment due to the risk of selecting for drug-resistant HIV strains. D. Ritonavir: An antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV. While it's a protease inhibitor, it is now most commonly used as a \"booster\" to increase the effectiveness of other HIV medications and is not used to treat Hepatitis B.",
