It occurs due to selective damage to arcuate nerve fibers, leading to nasal step defect on perimetry. Optic nerve head changes are structural, while Roenne nasal step is a functional change detected in visual field testing Optic nerve head (ONH) changes in glaucoma typically involve progressive cupping and neuroretinal rim thinning. The characteristic ONH changes include Option A: Cup-disc ratio change – Increased C/D ratio due to progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells Option B: Bayonetting – Bending/kinking of blood vessels as they pass over the deepened cup Option D: Nasal shifting of vessels – As the cup enlarges, blood vessels shift nasally",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The optic nerve (CN II) lies outside the cavernous sinus and is not directly involved in a CCF. IOP and fundus being normal further support that optic nerve function remains intact (no optic disc swelling or visual field loss) The patient presents with retro-orbital pain, pulsatile proptosis, diplopia, and tinnitus in one eye, which are classic features of a carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF). This condition involves abnormal communication between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the cavernous sinus, leading to arterialization of venous structures. Involvement of Structures: Cavernous Sinus (A) The cavernous sinus is directly involved in a CCF, as it receives high-flow arterial blood from the ICA Internal Carotid Artery (B) The ICA forms an abnormal fistula with the cavernous sinus, causing pulsatile proptosis and increased venous pressure 6th Cranial Nerve (C) The abducent nerve (CN VI) runs within the cavernous sinus and is the most commonly affected nerve, leading to lateral rectus palsy (diplopia with esotropia)<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/5(664).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The fisherman has a history of trauma with a fishtail and presents with pain and blurring of vision, which raises suspicion for infectious or inflammatory involvement of the anterior chamber Hypopyon is pus collection in the anterior chamber, appearing as a layer of white-yellow exudate at the bottom of the anterior chamber due to leukocytes accumulation. Trauma with organic matter (like a fishtail) increases the risk of fungal corneal ulcer, which can present with pain, decreased vision, and hypopyon Hyphema (B): Blood in the anterior chamber, usually from blunt trauma or vessel rupture. It would appear reddish instead of white/yellow Aqueous Flares (C): Tyndall effect due to increased protein in aqueous humor, seen in uveitis. It would cause a hazy appearance but not a white fluid level Keratic Precipitates (D): Inflammatory deposits on the corneal endothelium in uveitis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute congestive glaucoma (also known as acute angle-closure glaucoma) occurs due to sudden closure of the trabecular meshwork by the iris, leading to a rapid rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). Atropine causes mydriasis, which further narrows the already closed angle, worsening the obstruction and increasing IOP dangerously. Instead, miotic agents like Pilocarpine are used to open the angle Incorrect Options: Malignant Glaucoma (B) also known as aqueous misdirection syndrome, it is a rare condition where the aqueous humor gets misdirected behind the iris, causing a shallow anterior chamber and high IOP. Atropine is actually used in malignant glaucoma to deepen the anterior chamber and relieve pupillary block Acute Anterior Uveitis (C): In uveitis, atropine is used to relieve pain, prevent posterior synechiae (adhesions between the iris and lens), and stabilize the blood-aqueous barrier. It helps in cycloplegia, reducing ciliary spasm and pain Corneal Ulcer (D): Atropine is used to prevent ciliary muscle spasm, reducing pain and secondary iritis. It does not delay healing significantly and is often given to relieve discomfort",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Capsulorhexis refers to the continuous curvilinear tear made in the anterior lens capsule to allow access to the lens nucleus. This is a crucial step in phacoemulsification surgery as it helps in safe removal of the cataractous lens while preserving the integrity of the capsular bag for IOL implantation Other options: Lens Aspiration: This step comes later, where the remaining cortical material is aspirated after nucleus removal. It involves removal of soft lens material using suction, often after phacoemulsification Hydrodissection (C): Involves injecting fluid (BSS - Balanced Salt Solution) under the anterior capsule to separate the lens nucleus from the capsule. It occurs before phacoemulsification to facilitate lens rotation and safe removal Intraocular Lens (IOL) Implantation (D): This step is done after lens removal, where a foldable acrylic or PMMA lens is inserted into the capsular bag. It restores vision post cataract extraction",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The patient presents with red eye, anterior chamber cells, keratic precipitates, and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP = 36 mmHg). This suggests uveitic glaucoma, which is secondary to anterior uveitis (inflammation of the anterior chamber) Prostaglandin analogs (e.g., latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost) should be avoided in uveitic glaucoma because • They increase inflammation by upregulating prostaglandin-mediated pathways • Can worsen blood-aqueous barrier disruption, leading to more anterior chamber inflammation • May cause cystoid macular edema (CME), especially in pseudophakic patients (those who have had cataract surgery) Other options: A) Mannitol used in acute IOP elevation to rapidly reduce pressure via osmotic diuresis. Draws fluid from the eye into the bloodstream, lowering IOP B) Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs) (e.g., Acetazolamide, Dorzolamide) reduce aqueous humor production, lowering IOP. Oral Acetazolamide is preferred for rapid IOP reduction C) Beta-Blockers (e.g., Timolol) decreases aqueous humor production by inhibiting beta receptors in the ciliary body. Safe in uveitic glaucoma, but avoid in asthmatics or bradycardic patients",

The actual pathology is microscopic obstruction of aqueous outflow due to extracellular matrix accumulation or endothelial dysfunction. B) Family members have 1% risk of developing POAG: First-degree relatives of POAG patients have a 10-fold increased risk compared to the general population. The actual risk is about 10-15%, not just 1%. C) On dilating the pupil, IOP always rises: In POAG, IOP may increase, remain stable, or even decrease after dilation. However, in angle-closure glaucoma, pupil dilation (e.g., with mydriatics) can precipitate an acute attack. D) Visual field defect can be there with normal cup-disc ratio: In early POAG, visual field defects (such as arcuate scotomas or nasal steps) can precede significant optic disc cupping. Structural changes (optic nerve head) and functional changes (visual fields) do not always correlate perfectly in the early stages. E) First-degree relatives of POAG patients have steroid responsiveness: First-degree relatives of POAG patients often have an increased steroid response, meaning they show a significant IOP rise when given corticosteroids. This suggests a genetic predisposition to steroid-induced glaucoma in these individuals",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) KF rings are caused by copper deposition in Descemet’s membrane of the cornea. They typically start in the superior and inferior corneal periphery before becoming circumferential in advanced cases Other options: A) Pathognomonic of Wilson disease: While KF rings are highly suggestive of Wilson disease, they are not pathognomonic. They can also be seen in chronic cholestatic conditions (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis) and some cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis C) Seen in all patients with hepatitis: KF rings are not seen in all cases of hepatitis. They are associated with Wilson disease and some cholestatic liver diseases, but not with common viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B, C, etc.) D) Disappears with Deferoxamine: Deferoxamine is an iron chelator, not a copper chelator. KF rings improve with copper chelators like penicillamine, trientine, or zinc therapy as Wilson disease is treated",

Ulcerative Colitis: Yes, iritis can be seen in some patients with Ulcerative Colitis, particularly those with associated inflammatory bowel disease. D. Behçet's Disease: Yes, iritis is strongly associated with Behçet's disease, as it is a vasculitis that commonly causes recurrent uveitis, including iritis. E. Psoriasis: Yes, iritis can occur in psoriatic arthritis, particularly if the patient is HLA-B27 positive, as psoriatic arthritis is linked to recurrent anterior uveitis (iritis). Iritis can't be seen in the following condition: B. Rheumatoid Arthritis: No, iritis is not typically seen in rheumatoid arthritis.

It does not necessarily cause persistent miosis in darkness C) Argyll Robertson Pupil seen in neurosyphilis, this pupil is small, irregular, and does not react to light but constricts with accommodation (\"light-near dissociation\"). However, it still dilates in darkness, unlike Horner syndrome D) Adie Pupil: Adie’s pupil is a tonic pupil, meaning it is large and sluggishly reactive to light and accommodation. It does not remain small in darkness but instead tends to be dilated due to parasympathetic dysfunction",

The procedure involves inserting a lacrimal probe into the punctum and passing it through the nasolacrimal duct to assess patency. NLDO is common in elderly patients due to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, or age-related stenosis A) Anterior ethmoidal nerve block: Used for nasal surgeries (e.g., septoplasty, turbinate reduction).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Angiography, specifically fluorescein angiography (FA) is used to evaluate retinal and choroidal circulation abnormalities. Findings in Macular Ischemia: Fluorescein angiography (FA) shows capillary dropout or enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in macular ischemia. This occurs due to damage to the retinal capillary network, often seen in diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or other ischemic retinopathies. There will be areas of non-perfusion in the macula with an enlarged or irregular FAZ Other options: A) Submacular hemorrhage: This would present as blocked fluorescence on FA due to blood accumulation beneath the retina, preventing dye transmission. Typically seen in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) C) Macular oedema: FA in macular edema shows leakage from microaneurysms or capillaries, appearing as diffuse hyperfluorescence. Seen in diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or post-inflammatory conditions D) Premacular hemorrhage: This is a localized collection of blood in the sub-hyaloid space, commonly seen in Valsalva retinopathy or Terson syndrome.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) This is compound myopic astigmatism because both meridians are myopic: one at −2.00 D (horizontal) and the other at −3.00 D (vertical). Since the vertical meridian (90°) is more myopic than the horizontal (180°), it corresponds to “with the rule” astigmatism — the eye is more curved vertically, which is typical in younger individuals. Option A — Compound hypermetropic astigmatism, with the rule Incorrect because hypermetropic astigmatism refers to both meridians being hyperopic (farsighted), whereas in this case both meridians are myopic (nearsighted). Option C — Simple myopic astigmatism, against the rule Incorrect because “simple” means only one meridian is myopic and the other is emmetropic (normal). In this case, both are myopic. Also, this is “with the rule,” not “against the rule,” since the vertical meridian has greater myopia. Option D — Mixed astigmatism, with the rule Incorrect because mixed astigmatism involves one meridian being myopic and the other being hypermetropic. Here, both meridians are myopic, so it doesn’t fit the mixed definition.",

Alkali burns are more dangerous than acid burns because they penetrate deeper into ocular tissues, leading to corneal opacification and vision loss Immediate and copious irrigation: • Use normal saline, lactated Ringer’s solution, or clean water • Continue irrigation until the conjunctival pH normalizes (7.0-7.4) • Evert eyelids to remove retained particles • Avoid neutralizing agents, as they can cause exothermic reactions and worsen damage Other Options: B) Topical Antibiotics – Important later but irrigation is the priority C) Temporary Tarsorrhaphy – Used for severe exposure keratopathy, not an emergency step D) Complete Scraping – Not the initial step; irrigation should remove most particles. If any remain, gentle mechanical removal can be done later",

Electro-oculography (EOG) is the investigation of choice because it measures the Arden ratio, which is characteristically reduced (<1.5) in Best disease, even in asymptomatic carriers Other options: Multifocal ERG (mfERG) assesses macular function but is not diagnostic ERG (ERG) is typically normal in Best disease because generalized retinal function remains intact Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) tests the optic nerve function and is not useful in diagnosing Best disease",

Calcifications seen on imaging (like ultrasound or CT scan) are highly suggestive of retinoblastoma. The history of prematurity might be misleading, but retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) does not typically present with intraocular calcifications Other options: Coats’ disease: Characterized by telangiectatic retinal vessels and exudation, but no calcifications Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP): Associated with prematurity but presents with retinal neovascularization and fibrosis, not intraocular calcifications Congenital cataract: Causes leukocoria but does not have calcifications",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phacolytic glaucoma (Correct Answer): Phacolytic glaucoma is a secondary open-angle glaucoma caused by the leakage of high molecular weight lens proteins from a mature or hypermature cataract through an intact (but possibly permeable) lens capsule. These proteins are then phagocytosed by macrophages, which, along with the proteins themselves, obstruct the trabecular meshwork, leading to a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The patient's presentation fits perfectly: • 80-year-old male with 2 years of diminution of vision: This strongly suggests the presence of a long-standing and likely mature/hypermature cataract, which is the prerequisite for phacolytic glaucoma. • Red and painful right eye with IOP of 50 mmHg: This indicates acute, severe inflammation and significantly elevated pressure. • Deep anterior chamber: This is a hallmark feature of phacolytic glaucoma. Unlike angle-closure glaucomas, the mechanism here is an open angle clogged by material, not physical closure. • Cells and flare: This signifies an inflammatory reaction (uveitis), which is characteristic as the body responds to the leaked lens proteins and the presence of macrophages. All these findings are highly consistent with phacolytic glaucoma, where a mature cataract precipitates an acute inflammatory glaucoma. A. Malignant glaucoma (Incorrect Answer): Malignant glaucoma, also known as aqueous misdirection syndrome, is characterized by a misdirection of aqueous humor into the vitreous cavity, pushing the lens-iris diaphragm forward. The hallmark clinical sign of malignant glaucoma is a shallow or flat anterior chamber, often occurring after intraocular surgery (like glaucoma or cataract surgery), or sometimes spontaneously. The patient's presentation explicitly states a \"deep anterior chamber,\" which directly contradicts the defining feature of malignant glaucoma. Therefore, this option is highly unlikely. C. Phacomorphic glaucoma (Incorrect Answer): Phacomorphic glaucoma is a type of secondary angle-closure glaucoma caused by an intumescent (swollen) cataractous lens. The swollen lens pushes the iris forward, leading to pupillary block and mechanical closure of the anterior chamber angle. The defining characteristic of phacomorphic glaucoma is a shallow anterior chamber, which is caused by the forward displacement of the iris and lens. Since the patient in this scenario has a \"deep anterior chamber,\" phacomorphic glaucoma is inconsistent with the findings. D. Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (Incorrect Answer): Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI) is a chronic, low-grade, non-granulomatous anterior uveitis that is typically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, characterized by minimal inflammation (\"quiet\" eye). While FHI can be associated with secondary glaucoma (due to trabecular meshwork dysfunction) and cataract formation, the typical presentation is not an acutely \"red and painful eye\" with an IOP of 50 mmHg. The severe acute inflammation and extremely high pressure seen in this patient's right eye are far more consistent with an acute inflammatory event like phacolytic glaucoma rather than the chronic, insidious nature of FHI. Other classic signs of FHI like heterochromia or stellate keratic precipitates are also not mentioned.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Visual field defects to be associated with glaucoma if associated with optic nerve head changes (Correct Answer) This statement is a fundamental principle in the diagnosis of glaucoma. Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive optic neuropathy, meaning damage to the optic nerve. This damage leads to specific and reproducible patterns of visual field loss. While visual field defects can arise from various conditions affecting the visual pathway (e.g., neurological disorders, retinal diseases), for a defect to be definitively attributed to glaucoma, it must correlate with characteristic structural changes observed in the optic nerve head (such as increased optic disc cupping, thinning of the neuroretinal rim, or retinal nerve fiber layer loss). This correlation between functional (visual field) and structural (optic nerve) damage is crucial for an accurate glaucoma diagnosis and distinguishes it from other conditions that might cause similar field loss patterns. Incorrect Options: A. Early and specific feature is isopter contraction and baring of blind spot (Incorrect Answer) While both isopter contraction (generalized constriction of the peripheral visual field) and baring of the blind spot (an extension of the normal blind spot) can be observed in glaucoma, they are not typically considered the earliest or most specific features. The earliest detectable visual field defects in glaucoma are more commonly localized defects within the central 30 degrees of vision, such as paracentral scotomas (areas of decreased sensitivity near the center of vision but not involving the fovea) or nasal steps (a sharp cutoff of vision along the horizontal meridian in the nasal field). Isopter contraction often indicates more advanced damage, and baring of the blind spot can sometimes be a normal variant or related to other conditions. C. In static perimetry, intensity of stimulus is kept constant while it is moved (Incorrect Answer) This statement incorrectly describes static perimetry. In static perimetry, the stimulus is presented at fixed locations in the visual field. For each of these fixed locations, the intensity of the stimulus is varied (usually starting from sub-threshold and increasing) until the patient perceives it. This process determines the retinal sensitivity threshold at that specific point. The description provided—keeping the intensity constant while moving the stimulus—actually describes kinetic perimetry (like Goldmann perimetry), where a stimulus of fixed intensity is moved from a non-seeing area into a seeing area to map out the boundaries of visual perception (isopters). D. Kinetic perimetry is best for monitoring field changes in glaucoma (Incorrect Answer) Kinetic perimetry, while useful for mapping the full extent of the peripheral visual field and for certain types of visual loss, is generally not considered the best method for monitoring subtle or progressive changes in glaucoma. Static automated perimetry (e.g., using a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer) is preferred for glaucoma monitoring. Static perimetry offers several advantages, including greater sensitivity for detecting early, subtle defects (like paracentral scotomas which are common in glaucoma), the ability to provide quantitative threshold values, and the use of sophisticated statistical analysis software (e.g., Guided Progression Analysis) to track progression over time. These features make static perimetry more reliable for detecting the often subtle and gradual visual field changes characteristic of glaucoma progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 1. Fluorescein Fluorescein is the first dye to be applied during a dry eye examination. This hydrophilic dye primarily stains areas of the cornea where the epithelial barrier is compromised, meaning cells are missing or damaged, allowing the dye to penetrate. It is crucial for assessing the tear film's stability through the Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT) test, where the time taken for dry spots to appear in the tear film after a blink is measured. Additionally, fluorescein is excellent for identifying corneal punctate erosions or other epithelial defects. Its placement as the initial dye is strategic because it is relatively non-irritating, thereby minimizing reflex tearing that could interfere with accurate TBUT measurement and other subsequent observations. 2. Lissamine Green Following fluorescein, Lissamine Green is typically applied. This is a vital dye, meaning it specifically stains devitalized (damaged or dead) cells and mucus strands on the ocular surface, especially on the conjunctiva. Unlike fluorescein, Lissamine Green provides excellent visualization of conjunctival staining patterns, particularly in the interpalpebral zone (the area of the conjunctiva exposed between the eyelids), which is a key indicator of dry eye severity. The significant advantage of Lissamine Green over Rose Bengal is its minimal patient discomfort upon instillation, making it a more patient-friendly option for assessing conjunctival health. 3. Rose Bengal Rose Bengal is a vital dye that also stains devitalized cells and mucus on both the cornea and conjunctiva, similar in purpose to Lissamine Green. Historically, it was widely used in dry eye diagnostics. However, its use is often reserved as a third step or is sometimes foregone in favor of Lissamine Green due to its primary drawback: it can cause significant stinging and irritation upon application. This discomfort can lead to reflex tearing, which might dilute other dyes or interfere with prior measurements. Therefore, if Rose Bengal is deemed necessary for a comprehensive assessment, it is applied last to avoid confounding earlier test results.",

Strabismus surgery aims to realign the eyes for cosmetic and binocular vision purposes. It addresses the cause of the amblyopia, but not the amblyopia itself, which is a neurological issue of the brain ignoring the weaker eye. The other options are effective treatments. Correcting the refractive error with glasses is the crucial first step. Patching the stronger eye forces the brain to use the weaker, amblyopic eye, helping to strengthen the neural pathways. Video games, specifically those designed to present different images to each eye, are a modern and effective treatment that encourages the brain to fuse the images and use both eyes together.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Presenting vision < 3/60 in better eye. This definition was officially adopted by the Government of India in 2017 under the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB&VI) to align with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. This change was a significant shift from the previous definition which was based on a \"best corrected\" vision of < 6/60. The term \"presenting vision\" refers to a person's visual acuity with whatever correction they are currently using (or without any correction if they don't have glasses or contacts). This new definition more accurately reflects the burden of blindness in the country, especially for those whose vision loss is due to uncorrected refractive errors. By adopting this standard, India can now produce data on blindness prevalence that is comparable with global data, helping in the planning and implementation of better eye care strategies.",
