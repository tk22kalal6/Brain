The staining pattern agrees with previous reports that ABCG2 protein is primarily localized in the plasma membrane; however, some cytoplasmic staining has been observed. ABCG2 protein was also expressed by primary cultures of human limbal epithelial cells and preferentially by clusters of small cells. ABCG2 transcripts were also found to be much more abundant in the limbus than in the cornea, a pattern similar to the expression of ?Np63, a truncated dominant-negative isoform of p63. Nuclear protein p63, a member of the p53 family, was proposed to be an epithelial stem cell marker p63 is highly expressed by the basal cells of many human epithelial tissues, and ?Np63 is the predominant species in these stem cells. Analyzed by flow cytometry with ABCG2 mAb staining, the ABCG2? cells accounted for 2%–3% of the population of epithelial cells isolated from limbal epithelial tissues or their primary cultures. These results support the widely accepted concept that the corneal stem cells reside at limbus",

For example collagenous tissues stain blue( Sclera & cornea) whereas smooth muscles(e.g in the ciliary muscles) assumes adull red hue. Pathological deposits are seen in some diseases e.g granular corneal dystrophy. A dystrophy that combines features of both granular and lattice dystrophies has been described, with the majority of patients coming from the Avellino region of Italy. This is also referred to as granular dystrophy Type II. These patients have granular deposits in the anterior stroma as well as the presence of lattice-like lines deeper within the stroma. Gray subepithelial haze may develop centrally along with corneal erosions and can reduce visual acuity. The disorder is autosomal dominant with gene defects in keratoepithelin (BIGH3) with arginine replaced by histidine at residue 124. Histopathology shows superficial, discrete, red granular deposits with Masson trichrome stain, as well as mid-to-deep stromal fusiform deposits with the typical Congo red and other stains characteristic of lattice dystrophy Type I.Treatment is the same as for granular and lattice dystrophies.",

Evisceration surgery is a simpler procedure than enucleation surgery and offers better preservation of the orbital anatomy and natural motility of the anophthalmic socket tissues. A combined enucleation and evisceration technique has been described as an alternative, particularly in patients with a phthisical eye. In cases of documented or suspected intraocular malignant tumors, evisceration is contraindicated. Similarly, evisceration may be contraindicated if precise histopathology of the specimen is needed. Evisceration surgery may be more difficult in eyes with severe phthisis or scleral contracture or that are severely deformed. Finally, the issue of potential sympathetic ophthalmia should be considered.Evisceration surgery in a previously injured eye carries a definite small risk of sympathetic ophthalmia in the apposing eye because some uveal tissue is always left behind in scleral canals. Except in these situations, evisceration can be considered as an alternative to enulceation.

      "solution": "C Ref.: Ophthalmology Yanoff and duker 4/e p 691 Commotio retinae is a disease pathology that involves degeneration of the layers of the retina secondary to shock waves caused by blunt trauma or blast injury. Damage can occur centrally with macular involvement or peripherally without macular involvement and occurs sequentially, progressing from outer to inner layers. The photoreceptor outer segment is always involved; damage to more interior layers requires more force. Commotio retinae is the result of a closed globe blunt trauma or blast injury to the eye. Blunt trauma causes displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm with expansion of peripheral structures outward. This causes stretching and tearing of ocular tissues secondary to vitreoretinal traction and hydraulic forces transmitted. With blast injury, external shockwaves are generated secondary to heat-induced expansion of explosive products. External shockwaves hit the body and create internal shock waves throughout the body and within the eye. These cause shearing and tearing at tissue surface interfaces. Macular commotio retinae is presumed to be a countercoup mechanism of injury secondary to retropulsion and an increase in intraorbital pressure. Because the globe is elastic, it compresses under pressure and can absorb shock waves. The retina, however, is inelastic and bears the full effect of shock waves passed on by the elastic globe. Extramacular commotio retinae, on the other hand, is thought to be a result of direct trauma to sclera overlying the injured retina. Regeneration of photoreceptor outer segment begins at 1 week and continues for at least 2 months which may explain course of visual acuity recovery Signs Signs on DFE include gray-white opacification of neuroretina, RPE mottling and cherry red macular spot. Signs on OCT include hyperreflectivity of nerve fiber layer, photoreceptor OS, photoreceptor IS and disruption of OS-IS junction. Symptoms Pain, blurry vision or vision loss occurs within hours after trauma. Management Serial subsequent examinations are necessary to detect possible late developing problems including choroidal neovascularization, retinal tear, detachment, zonular dehiscence, angle close glaucoma and lens dislocation. Patient should be followed closely during the first few days and weeks following trauma to monitor and treat for complications. General treatment There is no approved or commonly used medical treatment for commotio retinae. However, in cases that do not resolve spontaneously, high dose IV steroids have been anecdotally shown to reduce retinal swelling and improve BCVA.",

      "solution": "A Ref.: Ophthalmology Yanoff and Duker 4/e p 879 Retrobulbar neuritis is a form of optic neuritis in which the optic nerve, which is at the back of the eye, becomes inflamed. The inflamed area is between the back of the eye and the brain. The optic nerve contains fibers that carry visual information from the nerve cells in the retina to the nerve cells in the brain. When these fibers become inflamed, visual signalling to the brain becomes disrupted, and vision is impaired. Retrobulbar neuritis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including: Infections such as meningitis, syphilis, and various viral illnesses Multiple sclerosis Tumors Exposure to certain chemicals or drugs Allergic reactions However, in many cases, the cause is unknown. Vision loss can be minimal or the disease can result in complete blindness. Optic neuritis affects women twice as often as men and usually affects adults between the ages of 20 and 40. The vast majority also have pain when they move their eyes. Retrobulbar neuritis often is an early sign that someone has multiple sclerosis. Between 20% and 40% of the 25,000 people who develop optic neuritis in the United States each year will develop multiple sclerosis within 5 years. Symptoms Symptoms usually worsen for two weeks and then stabilize. However, the course of the illness varies greatly. Most cases show some improvement over time, although complete recovery is rare. Optic neuritis usually affects only one eye, but both eyes may be affected. Common symptoms include: Blurred or dimmed vision A blind spot at or near the center of vision Color \"wash-out\" so that colors are less rich Pain with eye movement Tenderness of the eye to touch or pressure Complete blindness in the affected eye Diagnosis A doctor will use an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of the eye, particularly the optic disc. This is where the optic nerve fibers concentrate before exiting the eye to extend back toward the brain. In the early stages of retrobulbar neuritis, the optic disk appears normal. Later, it may become pale. The pupil normally becomes smaller (constricts) in response to light. In retrobulbar neuritis, this response often is reduced in the affected eye. The doctor also will test your visual acuity, which frequently is impaired in the affected eye. The doctor will test your side (peripheral) vision because, in many cases of retrobulbar neuritis, a scotoma, a blind or dark spot in the visual field, may be detected. The doctor also may search for associated conditions, such as infection or multiple sclerosis, after a detailed discussion about other symptoms and a complete physical examination. Treatment Many cases improve without treatment. Sometimes, a corticosteroid medication, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, is used to treat retrobulbar neuritis. The type of therapy depends on the suspected cause of the problem. For example, if an MRI shows abnormalities suggestive of multiple sclerosis in the brain or spinal cord, treatment with interferon or glatiramer acetate may lessen the likelihood of repeated attacks of neuritis and may also lessen the chances of progression to definite multiple sclerosis.",

They are characteristic but not mandatory to make a diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Homer Wright pseudorosettes, a ring of cells with an eosinophilic fibrillary center, are also commonly found. Fleurettes are retinoblastoma cells that have undergone greater photoreceptor differentiation. Calcification is common in these tumors. Necrosis is also very common and occurs when the tumor outgrows its vascular supply. Necrotic cells appear pink on H&E staining. Clinical presentation: Early diagnosis of retinoblastoma can maximize the patient's visual prognosis as well as survival rate. Retinoblastoma must always be in the differential diagnosis for any child who presents with strabismus, leukocoria, a red eye, or a cellulitis-like picture. Retinoblastoma is the most important differential diagnosis for a child with leukocoria. Leukocoria, or the loss of the red reflex, is secondary to this tumor filling the globe. Strabismus can also be a presenting sign of retinoblastoma so all patients undergoing a strabismus evaluation should also receive a dilated funduscopic examination. Physical Examination Age-appropriate visual acuity testing should be performed monocularly. External examination should rule out proptosis and signs of orbital cellulitis. Slit lamp examination should look for ciliary injection, pseudohypopyon, or signs of secondary glaucoma. The presence or absence of an afferent pupillary defect should be determined. As mentioned earlier, a dilated fundusopic examination is critical. If there is any suspicion for retinoblastoma, the patient should undergo an examination under anesthesia. An examination under anesthesia with careful scleral depression is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of retinoblastoma as well as to determine the exact location and extent of the tumor(s) and the tumor staging. Photographic documentation for future comparison is recommended. Complete retinal examination of both eyes is necessary to rule out bilateral disease. Fundus Examination Retinoblastoma classically presents with one or multiple nodular, white or cream colored masses often associated with increased vascularization. There are two primary clinical patterns of retinoblastoma growth. If the tumor grows forward into the vitreous it is known as an endophytic tumor. This form of retinoblastoma often shows vitreous seeding, which causes vitreous haze and opacities. This can eventually progress to involve the anterior chamber and can cause secondary glaucoma and inflammation. When the tumor shows a growth pattern that extends beneath the retina (subretinal) it is described as an exophytic tumor. These tumors can cause exudative retinal detachments and may be associated with significant subretinal seeding. Diagnostic procedures Computerized tomography (CT) scan can help demonstrate the presence or absence of calcium deposits and help define the size of the tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often performed to evalute optic nerve involvement, extraocular extension, and also to consider for the possibility of concomitant primitive neuroectodermal tumor (trilateral retinoblastoma). MRI is currently the preferred imaging modality for most clinicians because of radiation associated with CT scans. High doses of radiation can be harmful to all young children but especially to this patient population, who is at increased risk for secondary tumors. Bone marrow examination or lumbar puncture may also be performed in patients where there is concern regarding the extent of disease; particularly with extraocular extension to rule out cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or bone marrow metastases. Management: General treatment Spontaneous regression of retinoblastoma occurs, but is rare. The priorities in the treatment of retinoblastoma are to preserve life, preserve globe, and preserve vision, in that specific order.

Clinically, mfERG testing is most useful to assess macular function in patients with unexplained or central loss of vision who may have a normal full-field ERG. The mfERG can aid in the diagnosis of macular diseases including Stargardt’s dystrophy, cone dystrophy, occult macular dystrophy, and hydroxychloroquine toxicity.

      "solution": "C Ref.: Ophthalmology yanoff and Durker4/e p69 DIRECT OPHTHALMOSCOPE A thorough review of the origin of almost any important scientific development usually reveals that a number of people were involved in its discovery. In 1851 Helmholtz invented the first useable direct ophthalmoscope, which he described in a letter to his father:19 The ophthalmoscope directs the light rays of illumination and observation in a concentric pattern – the essence of the observation system is a peephole. The lens and cornea of the patient’s eye actually create the retinal image. Thus, the observer does not really see the retina of the patient, but an optical image of the retina. To bring the red fundus reflex into sharp focus for the viewer, the modern ophthalmoscope has a disc of lenses, developed by Rekoss for Helmholtz only 1 year after the original discovery. Because the compensating lens neutralizes the refractive error of both the physician and the patient, as well as the accommodation of each, its total power provides only a rough estimate of the patient’s refractive state. However, one of the authors recently noticed that, in cases of astigmatism, the patient’s foveal reflex is drawn out into a band that coincides with one of the major astigmatic meridians. Interestingly, the magnitude of a large amount of astigmatism may be estimated if the lens is focused on a blood vessel that travels parallel to the foveal reflex and then refocused on a vessel that travels perpendicular to the first vessel. Probably the most important advance in direct ophthalmoscopy was the use of the halogen tungsten bulb,which has a number of advantages over the older tungsten bulb. A quartz jacket can withstand higher temperatures than can the glass jacket; thus, the filament temperature may be raised higher than that in the conventional tungsten bulb, to produce an increased lumen output. The field of view of the new instruments averages about 10° and is limited by the most oblique pencil of rays that can pass from the outer edge of the observer’s pupil to the opposite outer edge of the patient’s pupil. To enlarge the field of view of the direct ophthalmoscope the investigator’s eye must be brought closer to the patient’s eye with the patient’s pupils dilated. The field of view of the new instruments averages about 10° and is limited by the most oblique pencil of rays that can pass from the outer edge of the observer’s pupil to the opposite outer edge of the patient’s pupil. To enlarge the field of view of the direct ophthalmoscope the investigator’s eye must be brought closer to the patient’s eye with the patient’s pupils dilated. Because the enlargement capacity of any magnification lens usually is defined as one-quarter of the lens power, the retinal image in the typical emmetropic eye of 60 D may be considered to be magnified by 60/4, or ×15. In aphakic eyes, from which a 20 D natural lens has been removed, the magnification for the observer is reduced to about 40/4 or ×10.",

      "solution": "A. Nocardia asteroids Ref: Ophthalmology yanoff and Duker 4/e p219 Nocardia is a rare cause of ocular infections. Ocular infections caused by Nocardia include keratitis, scleritis, conjunctivitis, canaliculitis, dacrocystitis, orbital cellulitis, and endophthalmitis. Corneal infections being the most common. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed as the the clinical picture may resemble other causative organisms. Nocardia belong to the bacterial order Actinomycetales. Originally classified as a fungus, Nocardia are now recognised as true bacteria. Nocardia are aerobic, gram-positive, non-motile, branching, filamentous bacteria (less than 1.5 micrometers in diameter). Nocardia represent indigenous microflora of soil, mud, dust and decaying vegetation. Pathogenic species of Nocardia have been detected in house dust, beach sand, garden soil, and swimming pools.Nocardia species do not present as normal flora either in the eye or in the respiratory tract. Actinomycetes are found around the word with no racial or occupational predilection noted. Nocardia asteroides is prominent in temperate regions and Nocardia brasiliensis is found in tropical and subtropical areas. Predisposing factors are trauma, surgery, corticosteroid use, and contact lens wear.Traumatising agents reported include vegetative material, dirt, stone, gravel, flying insects; as well as injuries from nails and fish line sinkers.Nocardia has been isolated from eyes with contact lens associated keratitis.Inappropriate lens hygiene and extended wear can predispose to infectious keratitis. N.asteroides keratitis has been found following surgical trauma. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: The rate of growth and multiplication of Nocardia is slow and does not cause a fulminant infection immediately post invasion. It is presumed that parasite-related virulence is involved, as the organism can infect healthy individuals. The virulence is partly due to structural and biochemical cellular changes that occur in the growth cycle. A combination of mycolic acids within the cell wall are altered throughout nocardial growth, that contributes to toxicity and virulence throughout the growth cycle.A toxic cell wall component known as trehalose 6,6’-dimycolate is associated with the virulence of Nocardia through the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages and the escape of lysosome fusion in macrophages.There is a probably role of nocardial surface membrane-bound catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in its resistance to being killed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.There is also a possible role of Nocardia exotoxins in causing host-tissue damage. SIGNS: The conjunctiva may show a fine papillary reaction. Keratitis can present as a nonspecific punctate epitheliopathy or an ulcer with margins studded with yellow white pin-head sized superficial infiltration (Figure. 1). Patchy infiltrations are predominantly anterior stromal with involvement of the epithelial and subepithelial tissues. These infiltrates often present in a classical wreath like pattern with satellite lesions(Figure. 2). Infiltrates are usually situated in the mid periphery of the cornea adjacent to the sites of minor corneal trauma or abrasion. Usually, there is an overlying epithelial defect and the surrounding stroma is clear. Anterior chamber reaction and hypopyon are usually associate. Introocular pressure is usually normal. Keratic precipitates and endothelial ring deposits on the endothelium have also been reported. Peripheral deep neovascularisation may be seen. The cornea may be hypesthetic. Superficial granular infiltrates can coalesce into white plaque, resulting in corneal ulceration. SYMPTOMS: Presenting symptoms consist of pain, photophobia, blepharospasm, and lid swelling. The amount of pain may be out of proportion to clinical findings. DIAGNOSIS of Nocardia eye infection is made based on the history, symptoms and clinical signs found during the systematic ocular examination. The gold standard for the diagnosis of Nocardia keratitis is a scraping from the corneal lesion using a spatula or blade.Usually, multiple scrapings are collected for three smears and to inoculate several culture media allowing for the growth of all types of bacteria (aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and anaerobic), fungi and Acanthameoba Smears are collected and stained by gram stain, Giemsa stain, and potassium hydroxide with calcoflour white stain. The presence of gram-positive, branching, beaded filaments that stain with 1% acid-fast stain (using 1% sulfuric acid, modified Kinyoun’s method) is suggestive of a Nocardia infection. Figure: Gram-positive, beaded, branching filaments in case of Nocardia keratitis. Nocardia organisms in culture are not fastidious and grow aerobically on media as tiny, white, dry colonies. They usually grow within 48-72 hours on blood agar, chocolate agar, and Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (without antiobiotics). Growth on one medium is considered significant with corresponding smear results and a clinical picture suggestive of Nocardia. Nocardi aisolation is considered significant, given that it is not a common contaminant. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Differentials for Nocardia infections include Moraxella, nontuberculous Mycobacteria and filamentous fungi. Moraxella is a gram-positive diplobacillus that can produce corneal ulcers in select patient groups including diabetics, alcoholics and the malnourished.Moraxella ulcers are oval and located inferiorly on the cornea. Nontuberculous Mycobacteria are acid-fast bacilli that cause slowly progressive corneal infections. The infiltrate in Myobacterial infections have indistinct fluffy or feather-like appearances with radiating projections, described as a “snow-flake” or “cracked windshield” appearances.Filamentous fungi produce slow growing, corneal ulcers with dry, raised infiltrates with hyphate edges and satellite lesions. MANAGEMENT: GENERAL TREATMENT: General treatment consists of medical and surgical therapies. Medical therapies are inclusive of topical and systemic antibiotic treatment. In the case of advanced Nocardia infections, surgical treatment may be warranted. In addition, general measures such as the discontinuation of contact lens wear, avoidance of immunosuppressive agents and avoidance of further insults should be facilitated. MEDICAL TREATMENT: Nocardia organisms show good susceptibility to amikacin and sulphonamides. SURGICAL THERAPY: Nocardia keratitis is usually well treated with medical therapy. However, surgical treatment may be warranted in the case of progressive corneal thinning, extension beyond the limbus, or presentation at an advanced stage. Surgical options are therapeutic lamellar keratectomy, penetrating keratoplasty, and conjunctival flap. PROGNOSIS: With medical treatment, the ulcer heals rapidly.The infiltrate resolves with minimal scarring, forming a fine superficial nebular opacity (Figure). Nocardia keratitis tends to heal with peripheral vascularisation or with vascularised scars. Patients usually continue to be asymptomatic with no recurrences. Visual prognosis is good and if the infection responds well to medical therapy, visual acuity improves.

      "solution": "B Aspergillosis Ref: Ophthalmology yanoff and duker 4/e p 225 Fungal keratitis was first described by Leber in 1879. This entity is a very common cause of corneal infection in developing countries, although it is not common in Western countries. If not diagnosed and treated promptly and effectively, significant damage can occur. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Fungi are a group of microorganisms that have rigid walls and a distinct nucleus with multiple chromosomes containing bothDNA and RNA. Fungal keratitis is rare in temperate countries but is a major cause of visual loss in tropical and developing countries. Though often evolving insidiously, fungal keratitis can elicit a severe inflammatory response – corneal perforation is common, and the outlook for vision is frequently poor. Two main types of fungi cause keratitis: 1) Yeasts (e.g. genus Candida), ovoid unicellular organisms that reproduce by budding, are responsible for most cases of fungal keratitis in temperate climates. 2) Filamentous fungi (e.g. genera Fusarium and Aspergillus),multicellular organisms that produce tubular projections known as hyphae. They are the most common pathogens intropical climates, but are not uncommon in cooler regions; the keratitis frequently follows an aggressive course. The diagnosis is frequently delayed unless there is a high index of suspicion, and often bacterial infection will initially have beenpresumed. Clinical signs are not a definitive means of distinguishing bacterial and fungal corneal infection; signs such as satellite infiltrates can be caused by other microorganisms. Symptoms. Gradual onset of pain, grittiness, photophobia,blurred vision and watery or mucopurulent discharge. Candidal keratitis Yellow–white densely suppurative infiltrate is typical. Filamentous keratitis Grey or yellow–white stromal infiltrate with indistinct fluffy margins. Progressive infiltration, often with satellite lesions. Feathery branch-like extensions or a ring-shaped infiltrate may develop. Rapid progression with necrosis and thinning can occur. Penetration of an intact Descemet membrane may occur and lead to endophthalmitis without evident perforation. An epithelial defect is not invariable and is sometimes small when present. Other features include anterior uveitis, hypopyon, endothelial plaque, raised IOP, scleritis and sterile or infective endophthalmitis. Differential diagnosis includes bacterial, herpetic and acanthamoebal keratitis. Bacterial infection may sometimes present subacutely, particularly when atypical organisms areresponsible. It is important to beware of co-infection, including with an additional fungal species. INVESTIGATIONS: Samples for laboratory investigation should be acquired before commencing antifungal therapy. Staining Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation with direct microscopic evaluation is a rapid diagnostic tool that can be highly sensitive. Gram and Giemsa staining are both about 50% sensitive. Other stains include periodic acid–Schiff, calcofluor white and methenamine silver. Culture. Corneal scrapes should be plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar, although most fungi will also grow on blood agar or in enrichment media. It is important to obtain an effective scrape from the ulcer base. Sensitivity testing for antifungal agents can be performed in reference laboratories but the relevance of these results to clinical effectiveness is uncertain. If applicable, contact lenses and cases should be sent for culture. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of specimens is rapid and highly sensitive (up to 90%) and may be the current investigation of choice. Calcium-containing swabs can inhibit polymerase activity and local collection protocols should be ascertained prior to specimen collection. Corneal biopsy is indicated in suspected fungal keratitis in the absence of clinical improvement after 3–4 days and if no growth develops from scrapings after a week. A 2–3 mm block should be taken, similar to scleral block excision during trabeculectomy; filamentous fungi tend to proliferate just anterior to Descemet membrane and a deep stromal specimen may be required. The excised block is sent for culture and histopathological analysis. Anterior chamber tap has been advocated in resistant cases with endothelial exudate, because organisms may penetrate the endothelium. Confocal microscopy frequently permits identification of organisms in vivo, but is not widely available outside tertiary centres. Treatment Improvement may be slow in comparison to bacterial infection. General measures are as for bacterial keratitis although hospital admission is usually required. Removal of the epithelium over the lesion may enhance penetration of antifungal agents. It may also be helpful to regularly remove mucus and necrotic tissue with a spatula. Topical antifungals should initially be given hourly for 48 hours and then reduced as signs permit. Because most antifungals are only fungistatic, treatment should be continued for at least 12 weeks. Candida infection is treated with amphotericin B 0.15% or econazole 1%; alternatives include natamycin 5%, fluconazole 2%, clotrimazole 1% and voriconazole 1 or 2%. Filamentous infection is treated with natamycin 5% or econazole 1%; alternatives are amphotericin B 0.15%, miconazole 1% and voriconazole 1 or 2%. Several others are available. A broad-spectrum antibiotic might also be considered to address or prevent bacterial co-infection. Cycloplegia as for bacterial keratitis. Subconjunctival fluconazole may be used in severe cases. Systemic antifungals may be given in severe cases, when lesions are near the limbus, and for suspected endophthalmitis. Options include voriconazole 400 mg twice daily for one day then 200 mg twice daily, itraconazole 200 mg once daily, reduced to 100 mg once daily, or fluconazole 200 mg twice daily. Tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline 100 mg twice daily) may be given for its anticollagenase effect when there is significant thinning. IOP should be monitored. Perforation – actual or impending – is managed as for bacterial keratitis. Superficial keratectomy can be effective to de-bulk a lesion. Therapeutic keratoplasty (penetrating or deep anterior lamellar) is considered when medical therapy is ineffective or following perforation. Anterior chamber washout with intracameral antifungal injection may be considered for unresponsive cases in which there is a stable corneal infiltrate but enlarging endothelial exudation.

      "solution": "D White Ref: Ophthalmology yanoff and duker 4/e p 589 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed at the beginning of the 20th century as a form of cancer therapy. However, its widespread application in various medical fields started with the introduction of lasers as powerful and localized light sources in the 1970s. In this two-step procedure, a photosensitizing drug is first administered to the patient, usually intravenously. After a delay to allow for accumulation and selective binding, the treatment area is illuminated with low-power laser light corresponding to the absorption peak of the drug. It is assumed that minimal damage is present in non pathologic tissue. In ophthalmology, a circular spot of laser light is directed and focused inside the eye through a slit lamp. It is used to treat tumors and neovascular formations in the irisand the retina.Recently, it gained popularity as treatment of choroidal complexes, the most frequent of which is choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Verteporfin was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 and approved in Europe in 2002 for the treatment of predominantly classic subfoveal CNV secondary to ARMD. In addition, the drug is used for the treatment of minimally classic and occult CNV secondary to ARMD, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome and CNV associated with pathologic myopia.Encouraging results have been published for the treatment of idiopathic subfoveal choroidal neovascular lesions. Verteporfin PDT has exhibited a good safety profile and minimal adverse effects.Nevertheless, some reports indicate that single and repeated PDT applications could cause limited damage to the intact retina, choroid, and optic nerve, as revealed by morphologic methods in rats, rabbits, monkeys, and humans. However, little is known about the long-term morphologic and histopathologic changes (beyond 6 weeks). In addition, the functional consequences on the treated and the neighboring nontreated areas of an intact central retina are unknown. Procedure: 2% dimethyl sulfoxide in H2O, 0.3 mL/kg intravenously (through the saphenous vein) is applied 20 minutes before start of PDT. Verteporfin is one dye that can be used & is administrated at a dose of 6 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 10 mL saline for 10 minutes. A diode laser coupled with a slit lamp is used as a light source. The procedure is conducted in a room with reduced illumination to avoid additional light photosensitization. A battery of tests is used to evaluate the functional and morphologic status of the retina. Mechanism of action: When a photosensitizer encounters light at a speci?c wavelength, the photon energy is transmitted into the electrons of the photosensitizer that then enter into an excited state. This excited photosensitizer returns to its ground state while causing 1 of 2 major photodynamic reactions. In a type 1 reaction, it transfers its energy into oxygen, forming superoxide radicals, whereas in a type 2 reaction, singlet oxygen is formed. Both of these reactions are oxygen dependent, andseveral studies have con?rmed in vivo oxygen depletion during PDT with direct measurements. The therapeutic ef?cacy of PDT is shown to be greater when tumor oxygenation during PDT is conserved, as it results in more tumor damage, a better immune response, longer stabilization, and increased cures. To improve oxygen maintenance during PDT, the light delivery method can be changed to a fractionated method, which allows for the recovery of tissue oxygen in between light fractions, or ?uence rate can be lowered. Fractionated light delivery in PDT is reported to be more effective in the treatment of some tumors,although it considerably increases the operating time. It is also shown to be more effective in nonmelanoma skin cancers and precancerous skin lesions. Low-?uence PDT is reported to be similar or more effective in central serous chorioretinopathy. When a molecule is excited, the energy of the electron increases, which increases the size of its orbit. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, 2 electrons in the same energy orbit must have opposite spins. If the excited electron has an opposite spin from the ground-state electron, it is called a singlet. If it has the same spin, it is called a triplet. Oxygen is one of the rare molecules found normally in a triplet ground state. Singlet oxygen is the excited state of the oxygen and is highly reactive in this form. Singlet oxygen is the primary cytotoxic agent responsible for photobiological activity in PDT; however, type 1 reactions may also play a role. There are 3 important mechanisms of action in PDT: 1) the direct cytotoxic effect, 2) the destruction of peritumoral vasculature, and 3) the local in?ammatory reaction resulting in increased autophagy. Singlet oxygen can directly kill tumor cells through the induction of necrosis or apoptosis and can cause the destruction of tumor vasculature. The lifespan of singlet oxygen is estimated at 0.03e0.18 ms, which corresponds to a diffusion distance of less than 0.2 mm, or approximately 1/50th of the cell diameter. Therefore, the damage is created close to the location of photosensitizer activation and is useful in the treatment of localized tumors such as skin cancers. Different photosensitizers create direct damage localized on the plasma membrane, lysosome, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane, and this localization appears to in?uence the type of cell death. The extent of the effect of the tissue microenvironment and other cellular inputs, however, remains unclear. Damage to tumor cells leads to the release of cell deathassociated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, which in turn attract leukocytes such as dendritic cells and neutrophils, thus producing an acute in?ammatory response. PDT also increases the vascular permeability that causes a release of vasoactive and proin?ammatory mediators and activates the alternative complement pathway, leading to the production of chemotactic factors and the induction of signaling cascades that trigger the secretion of cytokines. As a more targeted treatment choice, PDT might be an option because it causes activation of the immune system, whereas other treatments are highly immunosuppressive. PDT causes a local in?ammatory response including the secretion of IL-1, TNF-a, and IL-6 but also causes systemic neutrophilia, an increase of complement reactants, and a systemic release of cytokinesindicating a systemic in?ammatory response. PDT-treated tumors may act as therapeutic anticancer vaccines, as the immature dendritic cells engulf tumor cell lysates and present these antigens, whereby they trigger an antitumor immunity and a long-lasting tumor specific memory.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 10-15 seconds Ref: Ophthalmology Yanoff and Duker 4/e pg 304 Cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in the world, with an estimated 19 million operations performed annually, nearly 3 million of which are performed in the United States. The World Health Organization estimates this number will increase to 32 million by the year 2020 as the over- 65 population doubles worldwide between 2000 and 2020. Globally, more than 3000 eye surgeons (more than 1000 United States surgeons) have been trained. Femtosecond laser technology, introduced clinically for ophthalmic surgery in 2001 as a new technique for creating lamellar flaps in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), has recently been developed into a tool for cataract surgery. Current femtosecond laser technology systems use neodymium:glass 1053 nm (near-infrared) wavelength light. This feature allows the light to be focused at a 3 mm spot size, accurate within 5 mm in the anterior segment. The critical aspect of femtosecond laser technology is the speed at which the light is fired. The focused ultrashort pulses (10-15 seconds) eliminate the collateral damage of surrounding tissues and the heat generation associated with slower excimer and neodymium:YAG lasers. Photodisruption: Femtosecond laser energy is absorbed by the tissue, resulting in plasma formation. This plasma of free electrons and ionized molecules rapidly expands, creating cavitation bubbles. The force of the cavitation bubble creation separates the tissue. The process of converting laser energy into mechanical energy is known as photodisruption. The femtosecond laser technology virtually eliminates collateral damage and can therefore be used to dissect tissue on a microscopic scale. Femtosecond laser technology systems use photodissection to create tissue planes and side cuts for LASIK flaps in the cornea. For this application, the parameters are typically set so neighboring shots do not entirely overlap, leaving tissue bridges that must be bluntly dissected. Femtosecond laser technology systems used to perform certain steps of cataract surgery may use closer spot settings to overlap these cavitation regions, eliminating tissue bridges (ie, during capsulorhexis creation). As with any new technology, software upgrades to the systems improve energy delivery and stability.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/7(29).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "c. Topical natamycin only, no need to drain the hypopyon Ref: Opthalmolgy yanoff and duker 4/e pg 219 The efficacy of currently available antifungal agents is limited, and a relatively high medical treatment failure rate exists. The agents most commonly used for fungal keratitis include the polyenes and azoles. Polyene medications such as amphotericin B, natamycin, and nystatin bind to fungal cell wall ergosterol, thus disrupting the cell. The polyenes are effective against both filamentous and yeast forms. Amphotericin B is particularly effective against yeasts and is the agent of choice for keratitis caused by Candida species, but it is less effective against filamentous organism. Natamycin is effective against yeasts and has a broad spectrum of activity against filamentous organisms. In a randomized clinical trial, fungal ulcers randomized to natamycin had better vision at 3 months compared to those randomized to voriconazole. Natamycin was more effective especially for Fusarium ulcers, and is the treatment of choice for this organism. The polyenes do not penetrate well through in an intact corneal epithelium. Periodic debridement of the cornea may enhance penetration of topical medications, though it is unclear that debridement results in better outcomes. Azole medications, which include the imidazoles (e.g., miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole) and the triazoles (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) inhibit synthesis of ergosterol in the cell wall. Azoles generally have good activity against yeasts, but more variable activity against filamentous organisms. The newer triazole voriconazole has a broader spectrum of activity – although as mentioned earlier voriconazole is not as effective as natamycin, especially for Fusarium ulcers. Voriconazole has good corneal penetration when given topically, and good intraocular concentrations when given orally. Voriconazole can also be administered as an intracameral or intrastromal injection.Potential adverse effects of oral voriconazole include visual phenomena and hepatotoxicity; liver function should be monitored. Other antifungal agents have a role for treatment of fungal keratitis. The pyrimidine flucytosine blocks fungal thymidine synthesis. Flucytosine is well absorbed when administered orally, and it can also be applied as a topical solution. Echinocandins such as caspofungin and micafungin have recently shown promise as a topical therapy for fungal keratitis. They inhibit beta-glucan in cell walls. Once the diagnosis has been made, fungal keratitis should be treated with frequently applied topical antifungal medication. An oral triazole should be considered for deep stromal infection. Ulcers are typically treated with a loading dose (e.g., every 5–15 minutes for the first hour) followed by application every 30–60 minutes. The frequency of applications is reduced based on the clinical response. Intracameral injections of amphotericin B or voriconazole can be administered for infections that have penetrated Descemet’s membrane. Since these infections can be tenacious, and host suppression of infection is so important, corticosteroid use is generally not recommended in the management of fungal keratitis. The course of treatment is typically protracted. Antifungal treatment is usually maintained over 12 weeks, with strict vigilance as medicines are tapered. If fungal keratitis fails to respond to medical therapy, surgical intervention should be considered. Because of the propensity for fungal elements to invade deeply and, in some cases, penetrate Descemet’s membrane, advanced cases require penetrating keratoplasty to ensure complete removal of the invading fungus. In general, penetrating keratoplasty should be performed sooner rather than later to maximize the probability of a graft margin free of infection and to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis or infectious scleritis. As generous a clear margin as possible should be included in the excised cornea.Less advanced cases might be amenable to lamellar keratoplasty, but the surgeon must be confident that the entire infection has been encompassed by the lamellar dissection. If there is any question about the depth of infection, the procedure should be converted to a full-thickness penetrating excision",

Internuclear opthalmoplegia Ref: Yanoff and Duker 4/e pg 919 Injury to the MLF, between the abducens nucleus and the contralateral medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor nerve, interrupts transmission of neural impulses to the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle This impairs adducting saccades of the ipsilateral eye, which become either slow or absent. On attempted lateral gaze, away from the side of the lesion, the abducting eye overshoots the target (dysmetria), giving the appearance of dissociated (disconjugate) nystagmus. If the internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is bilateral, abduction saccades also may be slow because of impaired inhibition of resting tone in the medial rectus muscle. Upward beating and torsional nystagmus are frequently present, particularly if both MLFs are affected. A subtle INO may be demonstrated when the patient makes repetitive horizontal saccades, which disclose slow adduction of the ipsilateral eye. Convergence may be preserved. Other clinical features associated with INO include skew deviation, defective vertical smooth pursuit, impairment of the vertical VOR, as well as impaired ability to suppress or cancel the vertical VOR. INO also may occur with a variety of disorders that affect the brainstem (vascular, demyelinating, and metastatic) and must be differentiated from the pseudo-INO of myasthenia or a long-standing exotropia. The one-and-a-half syndrome occurs with damage to the caudal pons that involves the ipsilateral MLF and either the ipsilateral PPRF or the abducens nucleus. It results in an ipsilateral gaze palsy with an ipsilateral INO. The only intact horizontal movement is abduction of the contralateral eye. If the facial nerve nucleus or fasciculus is involved, oculopalatal myoclonus (a vertical oscillation of the eyes, palate, and other muscles of branchial origin) may develop later.14 The most common causes of the one-and-a-half syndrome are multiple sclerosis and brainstem stroke, followed by metastatic and primary brainstem tumors.

      "solution": "b. 2.5 kg Ref: Animal Models in Eye Research pg 188 Weight of some common lab rabbits The rabbit and its eye are ideally suited for ophthalmic research for several reasons. The animal is docile, easy to handle, comes in various sizes depending on the breed thus providing a range of sizes to work with and is economical compared to other mammals such as dogs or primates. Like other animals used in research, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and International Standards Organization/Committee European Normalization (ISO/CEN) have all implemented guidelines for the conduction of studies utilizing the rabbit model. Because the rabbit eye is relatively large it has proved useful for the assessment of both new technologies as well as ophthalmic surgical procedures. For example, the rabbit eye model has proved useful in the assessment of new technologies for removal of the natural crystalline lens/cataract such as surgical blades, phacoemulsification systems, intraocular lenses (IOLs), IOL insertion systems, ocular irrigating solutions, ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) and other novel technologies. Currently, it is one of the accepted animal models for evaluating the biocompatibility of IOLs. The rabbit eye model has also been used in the evaluation of ophthalmic surgical procedures, including corneal transplantation, corneal inlays and onlays, evaluation of microkeratomes and laser refractive procedures, trabeculectomy, glaucoma shunts and endocyclophoto-coagulation, vitrectomy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and intravitreal drug delivery. The following section reviews the use of the rabbit eye in selected types of ophthalmologic research. Rabbits acquired from animal research sources are generally between 6 and 12 weeks of age. Because the rabbit eye and lens grow with increasing age and weight with an age-related reduction in postoperative inflammatory response, animals of differing age and weight are used in different types of evaluations. Specifically, younger rabbits tend to have a greater postoperative inflammatory response, which is greater than that observed in adult human eyes and characterized by a heavy fibrin reaction. As such, their response to cataract and IOL implantation is similar to that of young children. Studies have found that the fibrin formation peri- and postoperatively and posterior capsule opacification (PCO)/lens regenerative growth is inversely related to the age of the animal with early rapid lens regrowth stimulation noted directly following surgery. In very young NZW rabbits weighting 2 kg, PCO was seen as early as 6 weeks. In our own unpublished studies, PCO/ lens regrowth was first noted at 8 weeks postoperative in young NZW rabbits weighing 2.5–3.5 kg and at 12 weeks postoperative in adult NZW rabbits weighting 3.0–4.0 kg. Because of the age-related reduction in the postoperative inflammatory response and fibrin formation, older, larger rabbits are often considered more desirable in certain types of intraocular studies such as phacoemulsification capability. The 12–24 month old rabbit has a hard lens that on a 0 to 4 grading scale is similar to a 3 to 4 human cataract density/hardness. In addition, the reduction in fibrin formation seen in these older and larger animals may ameliorate the need for intraocular heparin.",

      "solution": "A. Non Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Explanation: DIABETIC RETINOPATHY The reported prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in diabetics varies substantially between studies, even amongst contemporary populations in the same country, but is probably around 40%. It is more common in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 and sight threatening disease is present in up to 10%. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) affects 5–10% of the diabetic population; type 1 diabetics are at particular risk, with an incidence of up to 90% after 30 years. RISK FACTORS: 1) Duration of diabetes is the most important risk factor.(Q) 2) Poor control of diabetes. It has been shown that tight blood glucose control, particularly when instituted early, can prevent or delay the development or progression of DR. However, a sudden improvement in control may be associated with progression of retinopathy in the near term. 3) Pregnancy is sometimes associated with rapid progression of DR. Predicating factors include greater pre-pregnancy severity of retinopathy, poor pre-pregnancy control of diabetes, control exerted too rapidly during the early stages of pregnancy, and pre-eclampsia. 4) Hypertension, which is very common in patients with type 2 diabetes, should be rigorously controlled (<140/80 mmHg). Tight control appears to be particularly beneficial in type 2 diabetics with maculopathy. Cardiovascular disease and previous stroke are also predictive. 5) Nephropathy, if severe, is associated with worsening of DR. Conversely, treatment of renal disease (e.g. renal transplantation) may be associated with improvement of retinopathy and a better response to photo PATHOGENESIS: DR is predominantly a microangiopathy in which small blood Vessels (Q) are particularly vulnerable to damage from high glucose levels. Direct hyperglycaemic effects on retinal cells are also likely to play a role. Many angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors have been identified; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appears to be of particular importance in the former category.(Q) The following descriptive categories are in widespread use in clinical practice: • Background diabetic retinopathy (BDR) is characterized by microaneurysms, dot and blot haemorrhages and exudates. These are generally the earliest signs of DR, and persist as more advanced lesions appear. • Diabetic maculopathy strictly refers to the presence of any retinopathy at the macula, but is commonly reserved for significant changes, particularly vision-threatening oedema and ischaemia. • Preproliferative diabetic retinopathy (PPDR) manifests with cotton wool spots, venous changes, intraretinal microvascular anomalies (IRMA) and often deep retinal haemorrhages. PPDR indicates progressive retinal ischaemia, with a heightened risk of progression to retinal neovascularization. • PDR is characterized by neovascularization on or within one disc diameter of the disc (NVD) and/or new vessels elsewhere (NVE) in the fundus. • Advanced diabetic eye disease is characterized by tractional retinal detachment, significant persistent vitreous haemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma. SIGNS: 1) Microaneurysms: These are localized outpouchings, mainly saccular, of the capillary wall that may form either by focal dilatation of the capillary wall where pericytes are absent, or by fusion of two arms of a capillary loop. Most develop in the inner capillary plexus (inner nuclear layer), frequently adjacent to areas of capillary non-perfusion. This is the earliest sign (Q) On fundoscopy, Tiny red dots, often initially temporal to the fovea may be indistinguishable clinically from dot haemorrhages.(Q) Fluorescein angiography (FA) allows differentiation between dot haemorrhages and non-thrombosed microaneurysms(Q). Early frames show tiny hyperfluorescent dots typically more numerous than visible clinically. Late frames show diffuse hyperfluorescence due to leakage. 2) Retinal nerve fibre layer haemorrhages: It arise from the larger superficial pre-capillary arterioles and assume their characteristic shape because of the architecture of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Intraretinal haemorrhages arise from the venous end of capillaries and are located in the compact middle layers of the retina. Deeper dark round haemorrhages represent haemorrhagic retinal infarcts and are located within the middle retinal layers. The extent of involvement is a significant marker of the likelihood of progression to PDR. 3) Exudates: Exudates, sometimes termed ‘hard’ exudates to distinguish from the older term for cotton wool spots – ‘soft’ exudates, are caused by chronic localized retinal oedema; they develop at the junction of normal and oedematous retina. These are located mainly within the outer plexiform layer. 4) Diabetic maculopathy (foveal oedema, exudates or ischaemia): It is the most common cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients, particularly type 2(Q). Diffuse retinal oedema is caused by extensive capillary leakage, and localized oedema by focal leakage from microaneurysms and dilated capillary segments. The fluid is initially located between the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers; later it may also involve the inner plexiform and nerve fibre layers, until eventually the entire thickness of the retina becomes oedematous. With central accumulation of fluid the fovea assumes a cystoid appearance – cystoid macular oedema (CMO) that is readily detectable on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and assumes a central flower petal pattern on FA. 5) Ischemic Maculopathy: Signs are variable and the macula may look relatively normal despite reduced visual acuity. In other cases PPDR may be present. FA shows capillary non-perfusion at the fovea (an enlarged FAZ) and frequently other areas of capillary non-perfusion at the posterior pole and periphery. 6) Clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO): It is usually detected on clinical examination.(Q) 7) Cotton wool spots: These are composed of accumulations of neuronal debris within the nerve fibre layer(Q). They result from ischaemic disruption of nerve axons, the swollen ends of which are known as cytoid bodies(Q), seen on light microscopy as globular structures in the nerve fibre layer.(Q) As cotton wool spots heal, debris is removed by autolysis and phagocytosis 8) Venous changes: Venous anomalies seen in ischaemia consist of generalized dilatation and tortuosity, looping, beading (focal narrowing and dilatation) and sausage-like segmentation. The extent of the retinal area exhibiting venous changes correlates well with the likelihood of developing proliferative disease. 9) Intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA): These are arteriolar– venular shunts that run from retinal arterioles to venules, thus bypassing the capillary bed and are therefore often seen adjacent to areas of marked capillary hypoperfusion. 10) Arterial Changes: Subtle retinal arteriolar dilatation may be an early marker of ischaemic dysfunction. When significant ischaemia is present signs include peripheral narrowing, ‘silver wiring’ and obliteration, similar to the late appearance following a branch retinal artery occlusion. PROLIFERATIVE DABETIC RETINOPATHY It has been estimated that over one-quarter of the retina must be non-perfused before PDR develops. Although preretinal new vessels may arise anywhere in the retina, they are most commonly seen at the posterior pole. Fibrous tissue, initially fine, gradually develops in association as vessels increase in size. • New vessels at the disc (NVD) describes neovascularization on or within one disc diameter of the optic nerve head • New vessels elsewhere (NVE) describes neovascularization further away from the disc. it may be associated with fibrosis if long-standing. • New vessels on the iris (NVI ), also known as rubeosis iridis, carry a high likelihood of progression to neovascular glaucoma. FA highlights neovascularization during the early phases of the angiogram and shows irregular expanding hyperfluorescence during the later stages due to intense leakage of dye from neovascular tissue. FA can be used to confirm the presence of new vessels (NV) if the clinical diagnosis is in doubt, and also delineates areas of ischaemic retina that might be selectively targeted for laser treatment. Bird shot retinochoroidopathy: Birdshot retinochoroidopathy (also known as birdshot chorioretinopathy or vitiliginous chorioretinitis) is a chronic, bilateral, posterior uveitis with characteristic hypopigmented lesions. HLA-A29 is a strong genetic risk factor, and the disease has been hypothesized to be due to an autoimmune response to retinal S antigens. One-fifth of patients will will improve without treatment, but the majority will experience a gradual decline in visual acuity to ≤20/200 over 10 years due to cystoid macular edema and retinal atrophy. Treatment includes oral or intravitreal steroids for acute flares and immunomodulatory therapy for chronic disease. Birdshot retinochoriodopathy (BSRC) is characterized by its hypopigmented choroidal lesions ¼ to ½ optic disc diameter, clustered around the optic nerve, radiating towards the periphery, nearly always involving inferior and nasal peripapillary area, in a pattern similar to the gunshot spatter from birdshot. The lesions can be diffuse, macula predominant, macula sparing, or asymmetric. The disease accounts for 1-2% of all types of uveitis, primarily affecting Caucasian females between 40-60 years old. The early stage of the disease is characterized by retinal vascular leakage; the middle stage by prominent birdshot lesions; and the late stage by the presence of cystoid macular edema (84% in BSRC vs. 30% in other types of uveitis)[2], vascular attenuation, RPE changes, optic nerve atrophy, and subretinal neovascularization. Familial Drussen: Familial drusen typically manifest at younger ages than those seen in typical cases of age-related macular degeneration; it is not uncommon, for example, for affected patients to develop drusen in their 20s. In young patients, drusen are usually numerous and of varying size, typically extending beyond the vascular arcades and nasal to the optic disc. Although presumed to be genetically determined, the inheritance pattern in the vast majority of young patients with drusen is never established. In well-described pedigrees, the inheritance pattern has been autosomal dominant. Both forms are caused by mutations in the EFEMP1 gene on chromosome 2. This gene codes for an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-containing, fibrillin-like, extracellular matrix protein. The phenotype is distinctive because the drusen develop in a radiating pattern from the fovea. The many phenotypic variations of drusen suggest that several genetic defects are probably capable of causing them. It may be relevant that drusenlike deposits can be seen in some hereditary renal disorders that involve basement membrane abnormalities, such as Alport syndrome and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II. The clinical appearance of familial drusen is variable, ranging from a few large, coarse lesions to numerous tiny dots sometimes called basal laminar or cuticular drusen. The cuticular drusen phenotype is highly associated with the Tyr402His variant of the complement factor H (CFH) gene. Fluorescein angiography often shows more extensive drusen and RPE changes than are evident on ophthalmoscopy. The ERG and EOG are typically normal. Central vision is good as long as the drusen are discrete and extrafoveal. However, these patients may be at a greater than normal risk for macular degeneration as they age.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/23(6).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/24(6).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "B Myasthenia gravis The diagnosis of MG is made clinically by identifying typical signs and symptoms, pharmacologically by overcoming the receptor block through the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, serologically by demonstrating elevated anti–acetylcholine receptor antibody titers or anti–muscle-specific kinase antibody, and electrophysiologically by electromyography (EMG). If an obvious abnormality is present on examination, an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test, a sleep test, or an ice-pack testcan confirm the diagnosis of MG. Testing the patient after exercise or when the patient is tired may facilitate the response. Before performing the Tensilon test, the clinician should warn the patient of the short-lived but often discomforting potential side effects of edrophonium, including diaphoresis, lacrimation, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and salivation. Atropine sulfate (0.4–0.6 mg) should be immediately available, and some physicians treat with atropine (0.4 mg subcutaneously) before administering the edrophonium. Although major side effects from edrophonium are rare, bradycardia, respiratory arrest, bronchospasm, syncopal episodes, or cholinergic crisis may be precipitated by IV edrophonium administration. The patient’s pulse and blood pressure should be monitored throughout the procedure, which should be performed with the patient seated in a chair that can be reclined and with resuscitation equipment on hand. The ophthalmologist must be prepared to deal with severe side effects by injecting atropine sulfate IV and maintaining vital signs. Tensilon can cause severe bradycardia and bronchiolar constriction; thus, for patients with a history of cardiac or pulmonary disease, consultation with the primary physician before performing the Tensilon test is wise. In most protocols, 2 mg (0.2 cc) of edrophonium are first injected intravenously through a butterfly needle as a test dose. The patient is observed for 60 seconds. If the symptoms disappear or decrease (for example, the eyelid elevates or motility improves), the test is considered positive and can be discontinued. If no response is elicited, another dose of 4 mg edrophonium is given. If there is still no improvement, the final dose of 4 mg is given. Administering the drug in divided doses seems to cause fewer adverse effects. However, many patients develop minor side effects (fasciculations, warmth, nausea) no matter how it is given. When the ocular symptom is significant (such as complete ptosis), the end point (eyelid elevation) is often dramatic. However, a subtle deficit such as minimal diplopia may require that other means be used to better define the end point. Maddox rod tests with prisms or diplopia fields may be performed before and after edrophonium (see Chapter 8). False-positive responses are rare. A negative test does not exclude the diagnosis of MG, and repeat testing at a later date may be needed. An alternative to the Tensilon test is the neostigmine methylsulfate (Prostigmin) test. This test is particularly useful in children and in adults without ptosis who may require a longer observation period for accurate ocular alignment measurements than that allowed by edrophonium. Adverse reactions are similar to those with edrophonium. The most frequent side effects are salivation, fasciculations, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Intramuscular neostigmine and atropine are injected concurrently. A positive test produces resolution of signs within 30–45 minutes. The sleep test is a safe, simple office test that eliminates the need for Tensilon testing in many patients. After having the baseline deficit documented (measurements of ptosis, motility disturbance), the patient rests quietly with eyes closed for 30 minutes. The measurements are repeated immediately after the patient “wakes up” and opens his or her eyes. Improvement after rest is highly suggestive of MG. The ice-pack test is often helpful for diagnosing patients, but only if they have ptosis. An ice pack is placed over lightly closed eyes for 2 minutes. Improvement of ptosis occurs in most patients with MG. One exception is the patient with complete myasthenic ptosis; the cooling effect may be insufficient to overcome the severe weakness in these patients.. Other diagnostic tests for myasthenia gravis include serum assays for anti–acetylcholine receptor antibodies or anti–muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies and electrophysiologic testing. Three types of acetylcholine receptor antibody tests are commercially available. Binding antibodies are usually requested, because they are detected in approximately 90% of patients with generalized MG and 50% of patients with ocular MG. Blocking antibodies are rarely present (1%) without binding antibodies. Modulating antibodies are present as frequently as binding antibodies. Blocking and modulating antibody testing is usually reserved for patients who are negative for the binding antibody and for whom evidence of autoimmune MG is necessary. An assay for anti-MuSK antibodies may detect MG in some patients who do not have anti–acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Electromyographic repetitive nerve stimulation shows a characteristic decremental response in many patients with systemic myasthenia gravis. Single-fiber electromyography is most sensitive for MG. All myasthenic patients must be investigated radiologically for thymomas, which are visible on a CT scan in 10% of these patients. Malignant thymomas are present in a small percentage of patients. Because there is a high coexistence of myasthenia gravis with other autoimmune disorders, serologic testing should be done for thyroid dysfunction and pernicious anemia.",

      "solution": "C, Myopia. The image is being formed in front of the retina, hence, Myopia. If the image is formed at the back of the retina, Hypermetropia. Astigmatism is a common vision condition that causes blurred vision. It occurs when the cornea (the clear front cover of the eye) is irregularly shaped or sometimes because of the curvature of the lens inside the eye. An irregularly shaped cornea or lens prevents light from focusing properly on the retina, the light-sensitive surface at the back of the eye. As a result, vision becomes blurred at any distance. This can lead to eye discomfort and headaches. Most people have some degree of astigmatism. Slight astigmatism usually doesn't affect vision or require treatment. Astigmatism frequently occurs with other vision conditions like myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness). Together these vision conditions are referred to as refractive errors because they affect how the eyes bend or \"refract\" light. The specific cause of astigmatism is unknown. It can be hereditary and is usually present from birth. It can decrease or increase over time. Presbyopia is a condition associated with aging of the eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects. Symptoms include difficulty reading small print, having to hold reading material farther away, headaches, and eyestrain.Different people will have different degrees of problems. Other types of refractive errors may exist at the same time as presbyopia.[1] Presbyopia is a natural part of the aging process. It is due to hardening of the lens of the eye causing the eye to focus light behind rather than on the retina when looking at close objects. It is a type of refractive error along with nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Diagnosis is by an eye examination. Treatment is typically with eye glasses. The eyeglasses used have higher focusing power in the lower portion of the lens. Off the shelf reading glasses may be sufficient for some. People over 35 are at risk for developing presbyopia and all people become affected to some degree.",

Ectasias occur when the sclera distorts outwards.When the uvea is involved it is referred to as staphyloma( it is characterized by the ectasia of outer coats of the eye with uveal incarnation.) Staphyloma occurs in response to the inflammatory or degenerative changes in the eye which result in weakening of the eye ball. The presence of increased IOP contributes to the formation of staphyloma. The location of the stphyloma predisposes it to pathologic risk. Anterior and intercalary staphylomas are frequently associated with retinal detachment and Glaucoma.

      "solution": "A Endophthalmitis is a true ophthalmic emergency and mandates prompt therapy if visual acuity is to be preserved. EMPIRICAL MEDICAL THERAPY FOR ENDOPHTHALMITIS Acute onset postcataract extraction (as used by Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study) Intravitreal: Vancomycin hydrochloride 1.0 mg in 0.1 mL (normal saline) and Ceftazidime 2.25 mg in 0.1 mL (normal saline) or Amikacin 200–400 μg in 0.1 mL (normal saline) Dexamethasone 400 μg in 0.1 mL (optional) Subconjunctival: Vancomycin hydrochloride 25 mg in 0.5 mL (normal saline) and Ceftazidime 100 mg in 0.5 mL (normal saline) or amikacin 25 mg in 0.5 mL (normal saline) if β-lactam allergy exists and Dexamethasone 6 mg in 0.25 mL (normal saline) Topical: Vancomycin hydrochloride 50 mg/mL and Amikacin 20 mg/mL and Atropine sulfate 1% or scopolamine hydrobromide 0.25% and Prednisolone acetate 1% Oral: Prednisone 30 mg twice daily for 5–10 days (optional) Surgical In one sense, surgical management of endophthalmitis begins before the infection occurs. Careful operative technique to minimize wound abnormalities, avoidance of vitreous loss during cataract surgery, and careful microsurgical wound management and closure in open globe injuries decrease the risk. Once endophthalmitis occurs, initial therapeutic options primarily center around the method of intraocular fluid sampling and response to therapy. Surgery later in the course of endophthalmitis may be required to deal with complications, whether or not earlier surgical intervention occurred. Advantages of early therapeutic vitrectomy include clearing of the ocular media, removal of potentially harmful bacterial products, reduction of bacterial load, and removal of vitreous scaffolding by which traction retinal detachments may occur. Disadvantages include delay in treatment until operating room time is available, iatrogenic retinal holes or detachments, choroidal hemorrhage, and the problem of visualizing the posterior segment in an eye that has had recent surgery. In acute-onset postcataract extraction endophthalmitis, the EVS showed that in the subgroup of patients who had initial light perception, vitrectomy produced a threefold increase in the frequency of achieving 20/40 (6/12) vision or better, a twofold increased chance of achieving 20/100 (6/30) vision or better, and a 50% decrease in the frequency of severe visual loss. No difference was found in the confirmed culture results between the group of patients who had undergone tap versus those undergoing vitrectomy. Chronic endophthalmitis caused by P. acnes frequently requires surgery, not only to confirm the diagnosis but also to remove any sequestered infectious material from the posterior capsule with concurrent injection of intravitreous antibiotics, usually vancomycin. If this is not successful, complete en bloc removal of the intraocular lens implant and capsular bag is probably necessary. Endogenous endophthalmitis may require surgical intervention in the form of vitreal, retinal, and/or choroidal biopsies and culture if there is no obvious primary source and blood cultures and other studies are negative. The role of systemic antibiotic therapy had been controversial in postoperative endophthalmitis, but the EVS reported no difference in final visual acuity and media clarity with or without the use of systemic antibiotics for acute postcataract extraction endophthalmitis. The role of systemic antibiotics in other forms of endophthalmitis has not been addressed and many clinicians still consider their use the standard of care in these situations. Systemic antimicrobial usage is mandatory in endogenous endophthalmitis and is tailored to the infecting organism. Infectious disease consultation is recommended both for the systemic work-up and systemic treatment of endogenous endophthalmitis. Intravitreal antibiotics are required if the infecting agent has gained access to the vitreous cavity or empirically if any question exists.",

      "solution": "B Esotropia (manifest convergent squint) may be concomitant or incomitant. In a concomitant esotropia the variability of the angle of deviation is within 5 Δ in different horizontal gaze positions. In an incomitant deviation the angle differs in various positions of gaze as a result of abnormal innervation or restriction. Early-onset esotropia Up to the age of 4 months, infrequent episodes of convergence are normal but thereafter ocular misalignment is abnormal. Earlyonset (congenital, essential infantile) esotropia is an idiopathic esotropia developing within the first 6 months of life in an otherwise normal infant with no significant refractive error and no limitation of ocular movements. Signs • The angle is usually fairly large (>30 Δ) and stable. • Fixation in most infants is alternating in the primary position. • There is cross-fixating in side gaze, so that the child uses the left eye in right gaze and the right eye on left gaze . Such cross-fixation may give a false impression of bilateral abduction deficits, as in bilateral sixth nerve palsy. Abduction can usually be demonstrated, either by the doll’s head manoeuvre or by rotating the child. • Should these fail, uniocular patching for a few hours will often unmask the ability of the other eye to abduct. • Nystagmus is usually horizontal. • Latent nystagmus (LN) is seen only when one eye is covered and the fast phase beats towards the side of the fixing eye. This means that the direction of the fast phase reverses according to which eye is covered. • Manifest latent nystagmus (MLN) is the same except that nystagmus is present with both eyes open, but the amplitude increases when one is covered. • The refractive error is usually normal for the age of the child (about +1 to +2 D). • Asymmetry of optokinetic nystagmus is present. • Inferior oblique overaction may be present initially or develop later. • Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) develops in 80% by the age of 3 years. • Differential diagnosis includes bilateral congenital sixth nerve palsy, secondary (sensory) esotropia due to organic eye disease, nystagmus blockage syndrome in which convergence dampens a horizontal nystagmus, and mechanical limitations of eye movement such as Duane and Möbius syndromes and strabismus fixus. Initial treatment: Early ocular alignment gives the best chance of the development of some degree of binocular function. Ideally, the eyes should be surgically aligned by the age of 12 months, and at the very latest by the age of 2 years, but only after amblyopia and any significant refractive error have been corrected. • The initial procedure can be either recession of both medial recti or unilateral medial rectus recession with lateral rectus resection. Very large angles may require recessions of 6.5 mm or more. Associated significant inferior oblique overaction should also be addressed. • An acceptable goal is alignment of the eyes to within 10 Δ, associated with peripheral fusion and central suppression. This small-angle residual strabismus is often stable, even though bifoveal fusion is not achieved Subsequent treatment • Undercorrection may require further recession of the medial recti, resection of one or both lateral recti or surgery to the other eye, depending on the initial procedure. • Inferior oblique overaction may develop subsequently, most commonly at age 2 years. The parents should therefore be warned that further surgery may be necessary despite an initially good result. Initially unilateral, it frequently becomes bilateral within 6 months. Inferior oblique weakening procedures include disinsertion, recession and myectomy. • DVD is characterized by up-drift with excyclorotation (extorsion) of the eye when under cover, or spontaneously during periods of visual inattention. When the cover is removed the affected eye will move down without a corresponding down-drift of the other eye. It is usually bilateral. Surgical treatment may be indicated for cosmesis; options include superior rectus recession with or without posterior fixation sutures and inferior oblique anterior transposition. • Amblyopia subsequently develops in about 50% of cases as unilateral fixation preference commonly develops postoperatively. • An accommodative element should be suspected if the eyes are initially straight or almost straight after surgery and then start to reconverge. Regular refraction is therefore important. Acute (late-onset) esotropia • Presentation is at around 5–6 years of age. • Signs ? Sudden onset of diplopia and esotropia. ? Normal ocular motility without significant refractive error. ? Underlying sixth nerve palsy must be excluded. Treatment is aimed at re-establishing BSV to prevent suppression, using prisms, botulinum toxin or surgery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In diabetic (ischemic) third nerve palsy, the parasympathetic fibers controlling the pupil are usually spared, leading to pupillary sparing. This means the pupil typically remains normal in size and reactive to light, so pupil dilation is not seen. The ischemic damage mainly affects the motor fibers responsible for eyelid elevation and eye movements, not the peripheral pupillary fibers. Incorrect Options and Why They Are Seen: B. Ptosis Ptosis occurs due to involvement of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is innervated by the third nerve motor fibers. It is a common feature of third nerve palsy. C. Outward downward rolling of pupil This describes the typical “down and out” position of the eye due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles when the third nerve is affected. This sign is commonly present. D. Impaired pupillary reflex In diabetic third nerve palsy, pupillary reflex is generally preserved because the parasympathetic fibers are spared. Hence, impaired pupillary reflex is usually not seen. However, since the question asks for the “except” option and pupil dilation is a more classic “not seen” feature, D is less commonly chosen but can also be acceptable.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 50 min The Snellen chart is designed based on specific visual angles. Each letter on the chart is constructed such that its overall height (and width) subtends an angle of 5 minutes of arc at the distance for which that particular line is designated as readable by a person with normal (6/6 or 20/20) vision. The individual strokes or details of each letter subtend 1 minute of arc. The topmost letter on a standard Snellen chart typically corresponds to the 6/60 (or 20/200) line. This means that a person with normal vision should be able to read this largest letter from 60 meters (or 200 feet) away. At that distance (60 meters), the entire letter subtends an angle of 5 minutes of arc. The question asks for the angle subtended by this same topmost letter when viewed from a distance of 6 meters. Since 6 meters is one-tenth (1/10) of 60 meters, the angle subtended by the letter will be ten times larger. Therefore, the angle subtended by the topmost letter from a 6 m distance is: 5 minutes * 10 = 50 minutes of arc. Option (A. 1 min) Explanation: 1 minute of arc is the angle subtended by the detail (a single stroke) of a letter on the Snellen chart at the distance for which it is labeled. It is also the angle subtended by the entire letter on the 6/6 (20/20) line if it were viewed from 30 meters (which would make it 6/30 vision). It does not represent the overall angle of the topmost letter at 6 meters. Option (B. 5 min) Explanation: 5 minutes of arc is the angle subtended by the entire letter on a Snellen chart at the distance for which that specific letter is labeled. For the topmost letter (6/60), it subtends 5 minutes of arc when viewed from 60 meters, not 6 meters. For the 6/6 line, it subtends 5 minutes of arc when viewed from 6 meters. The question specifically asks about the topmost letter from 6 meters. Option (D. 60 min) Explanation: 60 minutes of arc is equal to 1 degree. While it is a larger angle, the precise calculation for the topmost letter at 6 meters is 50 minutes, not 60 minutes. This option is a distracter that is close in magnitude but not correct.",

Findings of pre-septal cellulitis (soft tissue swelling, eyelid edema/erythema, and conjunctival injection) are also possible. Involvement of the orbit is heralded by findings of chemosis, proptosis, extra-ocular motility deficits, multiple cranial neuropathies (namely CN III, V-1, V-2 and/or VI secondary to cavernous sinus involvement/thrombosis), and loss of vision. Involvement of the contralateral eye can be an indication of extension, namely via the cavernous sinus. Development of neurologic findings such as mental status changes, seizures, or other focal neurologic deficits can indicate intra-cranial extension. Urgent correction of underlying metabolic derangements such as hyperglycemia and metabolic ketoacidosis and tapering of corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications should be pursued if possible.
