      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is contraindicated and potentially dangerous in cases of suspected metallic foreign body in the eye. This is because MRI uses strong magnetic fields, which can cause ferromagnetic objects (like metallic fragments) to move, heat up, or cause additional tissue damage within the sensitive ocular structures. In an industrial setting involving hammer and chisel, there is a high likelihood of a metallic foreign body. Performing an MRI before ruling out a metallic object can lead to serious complications including vision loss or even perforation of the globe. Other Options: A. CT Scan CT is the investigation of choice for detecting intraocular or intraorbital metallic foreign bodies, as it provides excellent detail of radio-opaque materials like metal. It is safe and highly sensitive in such cases. C. X-ray X-ray can detect metallic foreign bodies but is less sensitive than CT. However, it is still a safe initial investigation, especially in resource-limited settings, to detect large or radio-opaque foreign bodies. D. B-Mode Ultrasonography (USG) While USG can detect intraocular foreign bodies, it should not be performed initially if globe integrity is compromised, as pressure from the probe can worsen the injury. It can be considered after excluding globe rupture with clinical examination or CT.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Neurons in the brain are highly differentiated and non-dividing (post-mitotic) cells, making them least sensitive to radiation. Radiation primarily targets rapidly dividing cells because it damages DNA, which these cells need to replicate. Since neurons do not divide, they are relatively resistant to the effects of radiation, although high doses may still cause indirect damage via vascular or glial injury over time. Nonetheless, compared to other listed tissues, neurons are the least affected. Other Options: B. Spermatogonia These are rapidly dividing germ cells in the testes and among the most radiosensitive cells in the body. Even low doses of radiation can impair spermatogenesis. C. Erythroblastic Tissue in Bone Marrow Bone marrow contains rapidly proliferating hematopoietic cells, especially erythroblasts, which are very radiosensitive. Radiation can cause bone marrow suppression leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. D. Intestinal Mucosa The epithelial lining of the intestines turns over quickly, making it highly radiosensitive. Radiation can damage crypt cells, leading to mucositis, diarrhea, and malabsorption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection) leads to pulmonary plethora due to increased pulmonary blood flow. In TAPVC, the pulmonary veins do not drain into the left atrium but instead connect anomalously to the systemic venous circulation. Blood returns from the lungs into the right atrium, causing volume overload and increased pulmonary blood flow. This results in vascular congestion and prominent pulmonary markings on chest X-ray, which is characteristic of pulmonary plethora. Other Options: B. Tricuspid Atresia Due to underdevelopment or absence of the tricuspid valve, there's reduced flow into the pulmonary circulation, leading to decreased pulmonary vascular markings, i.e., pulmonary oligemia, not plethora. C. Ebstein Anomaly In this condition, there's downward displacement of the tricuspid valve, leading to right atrial enlargement and reduced forward flow to lungs. This results in pulmonary oligemia. D. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) TOF involves pulmonary stenosis and right-to-left shunt via VSD, which significantly reduces pulmonary blood flow. Chest X-ray shows boot-shaped heart with decreased vascular markings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most appropriate next step in a patient with suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD), especially in the context of connective tissue disease (suggested by skin thickening), is to perform a High-Resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest. HRCT provides detailed imaging of the lung parenchyma and is superior to CECT or chest X-ray in detecting interstitial patterns such as ground-glass opacities, honeycombing, and reticulations, which are typical of ILDs like systemic sclerosis-associated ILD. It is considered the gold standard imaging for ILD evaluation. Other Options: A. CECT (Contrast-Enhanced CT) – Not ideal as first step in ILD workup. CECT is more useful for masses, lymphadenopathy, or vascular lesions, but does not provide the fine parenchymal detail that HRCT does. Hence, not the best initial investigation in suspected ILD. C. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) – Helpful but not first step. PFTs can confirm restrictive patterns and assess severity, but they are not diagnostic. They are typically done after HRCT has identified interstitial changes. D. Echocardiography – Useful for pulmonary hypertension screening, which may coexist, but is not the first diagnostic step when ILD is suspected. It’s more valuable later in the workup.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Oligemia refers to reduced pulmonary blood flow, seen as decreased vascular markings on chest X-ray. This is typically observed in conditions with reduced pulmonary circulation, such as Tetralogy of Fallot or severe pulmonary stenosis, not in CHF. CHF causes increased pulmonary venous pressure, leading to vascular congestion—not oligemia. Thus, oligemia is not a radiographic finding of CHF. Other Options: A. Kerley B lines These are short, horizontal lines at the lung bases representing interlobular septal thickening due to pulmonary edema. Common in early CHF. B. Cardiomegaly An enlarged heart shadow (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5) is often seen due to left ventricular dysfunction or volume overload. D. Kerley A lines These are longer, oblique lines radiating from the hilum to the periphery due to engorged deep septal veins, indicating more severe or chronic pulmonary venous hypertension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Iodine-based contrast agents are the primary water-soluble contrasts used in radiology. These are commonly used in intravenous, oral, and intra-arterial studies like CT scans, angiography, and urography. Their water solubility allows for rapid distribution and excretion, making them safe for internal use, especially when there's a risk of leakage or perforation (e.g., suspected GI perforation). Other Options: A. Barium – Not water-soluble. Barium sulfate is a suspension, not a solution, and is not absorbed by the body. It is contraindicated in perforation due to risk of barium peritonitis. C. Bromide – Not used as contrast. Although bromide ions can be radiopaque, they are not used as standard contrast media in clinical radiology. D. Calcium – Not a contrast agent. Calcium salts are not used as contrast media. They may show up on X-ray due to natural density but are not administered for imaging purposes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Explanation: The image displays a fluoroscopic (X-ray) image where a catheter or drain is clearly visible within the dilated biliary tree (the network of bile ducts within the liver) and extending down towards the duodenum. Contrast medium has been injected, outlining the biliary ducts. This procedure involves accessing the bile ducts from outside the body, typically through the skin (percutaneously) and liver (transhepatic), to relieve an obstruction and drain bile. This entire process is characteristic of a Percutaneous Biliary Drainage (D), often performed when the bile ducts are blocked (e.g., by a tumor or stone) and endoscopic drainage is not feasible. Now, let's analyze why the other options are incorrect: A. TIPSS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt): TIPSS is a procedure to create a shunt within the liver between the portal vein and a hepatic vein to relieve portal hypertension. While it's an interventional radiology procedure and involves the liver, the image shows the biliary system (bile ducts) being accessed and drained, not the portal venous system. B. Stenting for kidney stone: Stenting for a kidney stone typically involves placing a stent within the ureter (the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder) to bypass an obstruction caused by a stone or to help the stone pass. This procedure is performed in the urinary tract, not the biliary system, and the anatomy shown in the image (liver, bile ducts) is clearly not the kidney or ureter. C. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography): ERCP is an endoscopic procedure where a scope is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the duodenum. Contrast is then injected retrogradely (against the flow) into the bile and pancreatic ducts using a catheter inserted through the endoscope. While ERCP also visualizes the biliary tree and can involve stent placement or stone removal, it is an endoscopic procedure performed from the inside, not a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure with a visible external catheter entering the liver as seen in the image.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Iohexol is a non-ionic, water-soluble iodine-based contrast agent. In cases of suspected esophageal perforation, water-soluble contrasts like Iohexol (or Gastrografin) are preferred because they are less irritating and safer if leaked into the mediastinum or pleural cavity. Using water-soluble contrast prevents severe chemical mediastinitis or peritonitis, which could occur if a non-absorbable agent like barium leaks through a perforation. Other Options: B. Barium sulphate – Contraindicated in perforation. If barium leaks into the mediastinum or peritoneum through a perforation, it can cause severe inflammation or fibrosis. Hence, not used in suspected perforation cases. C. Gadolinium – Used in MRI, not esophagography. Though it is a contrast agent, gadolinium is not used for fluoroscopy or esophagography, and not safe or practical for GI tract evaluation. D. Methylene blue – Used for leak testing, not radiologic imaging. It can be used during endoscopic or surgical procedures to detect leaks, but it is not a radiographic contrast agent for esophagography.",

Other Options: A. Toxoplasmosis – Usually shows diffuse intracranial calcifications, often basal ganglia and scattered throughout the brain, not typically periventricular. B. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) – Typically causes temporal lobe involvement and may lead to hemorrhagic necrosis, not commonly associated with periventricular calcification. D. Parvovirus B19 – Known for causing fetal hydrops and anemia, not CNS calcifications or hepatosplenomegaly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Herpes Simplex Explanation: A patient presenting with altered sensorium and bitemporal hemorrhage on CT scan, particularly if it involves the medial temporal lobes, is highly suggestive of Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE). HSE is a severe and often life-threatening viral infection of the brain caused by Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1). It characteristically causes hemorrhagic necrosis, with a predilection for the temporal lobes (often unilaterally or asymmetrically, but bitemporal involvement is common), and the limbic system. The altered sensorium is a common symptom of encephalitis. Let's look at why the other options are less likely in this specific presentation: A. TB (Tuberculosis): Tuberculous meningitis or tuberculoma can cause altered sensorium. However, bitemporal hemorrhage is not a typical radiological finding in CNS tuberculosis. TB lesions are usually granulomatous and might show enhancement, but not acute hemorrhage in this specific bitemporal pattern. C. Brain cancer: Brain tumors (primary or metastatic) can cause altered sensorium, and some aggressive tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma) can hemorrhage. However, bitemporal hemorrhage specifically affecting the temporal lobes in this manner is not the most common presentation for typical brain cancers and wouldn't be the primary diagnosis given the specific imaging finding without further context. D. Stroke: A stroke involves a sudden interruption of blood supply to the brain (ischemic stroke) or bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). While a hemorrhagic stroke would show hemorrhage on CT, a bitemporal, often non-aneurysmal, hemorrhagic pattern is not characteristic of a typical stroke, which usually follows vascular territories. While a stroke could theoretically involve the temporal lobe, the \"bitemporal hemorrhage\" specifically points away from a common stroke presentation and more towards an infectious or inflammatory cause like HSE.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Option C is correct in principle, though it incorrectly attributes the law to Coulomb (which relates to electrostatics). The correct law here is the Inverse Square Law, which states that radiation intensity decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source: Intensity ∝ 1 / Distance2 A. The normal cell and cancer cells will be equally sensitive Cancer cells are generally more radiosensitive due to their high mitotic rate, less efficient DNA repair, and less organized cell cycle regulation. Normal cells—especially those that are slowly dividing—tend to have better repair mechanisms, giving them relative resistance to radiation. B. GI mucosa is more resistant part The gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa is one of the most radiosensitive tissues in the body, especially the crypt cells of the small intestine, because of their rapid proliferation. This sensitivity explains why GI toxicity is a common side effect of pelvic radiotherapy. D. Small blood vessels are resistant to the effect of radiation Small blood vessels, particularly capillaries and arterioles, are sensitive to radiation. Ionizing radiation can damage endothelial cells, leading to fibrosis, ischemia, and late vascular complications such as tissue necrosis or telangiectasia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) SDH (Subdural Hematoma) The crescent-shaped hyperdense collection seen on the CT scan, situated along the inner surface of the skull and compressing the underlying brain tissue (indicated by the red arrows), is the hallmark imaging finding of a subdural hematoma. This shape occurs because the blood accumulates between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, layers that loosely adhere to each other, allowing the hematoma to spread over a wider area following the contour of the brain. The patient's history of trauma one week prior is a significant predisposing factor for SDH, as it can cause tearing of the bridging veins that connect the cortical surface of the brain to the dural sinuses. The reported confusion and ataxia are neurological symptoms consistent with the mass effect and increased intracranial pressure resulting from the subdural hematoma. Furthermore, the patient's history of alcohol dependence, even with recent abstinence, can contribute to an increased risk of SDH due to potential coagulopathy and brain atrophy. Incorrect Options: A. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Intraparenchymal hemorrhage refers to bleeding directly within the brain tissue itself. On a CT scan, this typically appears as a localized, often rounded or irregular area of high density within the brain parenchyma, rather than a crescent-shaped collection along the skull's inner surface that displaces the brain. While trauma can sometimes lead to intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the imaging findings in this case are not characteristic of it. B. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) involves bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the area between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. On a CT scan, SAH typically presents as high-density blood within the sulci (grooves) of the brain and in the basal cisterns at the base of the brain, often having a more diffuse or star-shaped appearance rather than a localized crescentic collection. While trauma is a potential cause of SAH, the CT image provided does not demonstrate the characteristic pattern of bleeding seen in this condition. C. EDH (Epidural Hematoma) An epidural hematoma is a collection of blood between the skull and the dura mater. On a CT scan, epidural hematomas typically have a biconvex (lens-shaped) appearance because the dura is tightly adhered to the inner surface of the skull at the sutures, limiting the spread of the hematoma. While a history of trauma can certainly lead to an epidural hematoma, the crescent shape of the blood collection seen in the provided CT image is not characteristic of an EDH. Furthermore, epidural hematomas are often associated with skull fractures, which are not explicitly mentioned in the clinical information or clearly visible in this single axial slice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition caused by a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta, leading to blood entering the aortic wall and separating its layers. The classic presentation includes: • Sudden, severe chest pain that radiates to the neck, back, or interscapular region • Asymmetric blood pressure between limbs (in this case, right arm 100/60 mmHg vs. left arm 170/90 mmHg), which is a hallmark sign due to involvement of different branches of the aorta • Mediastinal widening on chest X-ray, which strongly suggests aortic pathology These findings together are highly indicative of an aortic dissection, especially in an older hypertensive patient. Option A: Acute Pulmonary Embolism – Incorrect Pulmonary embolism can cause sudden chest pain and dyspnea, but it typically does not cause blood pressure discrepancies between limbs or mediastinal widening on chest X-ray. Instead, findings may include tachycardia, hypoxia, and possibly a normal chest X-ray or features like Westermark sign or Hampton’s hump. Option B: Acute Coronary Syndrome – Incorrect Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) also presents with chest pain, but it is usually central, crushing, and associated with risk factors like exertion. However, ACS does not typically cause radiating pain to the back or interscapular area, blood pressure asymmetry, or mediastinal widening. ECG and troponins are used for diagnosis. Option D: Esophageal rupture – Incorrect Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) can cause severe chest pain and subcutaneous emphysema, often following vomiting or trauma. It may also cause mediastinal widening, but the asymmetric blood pressure and interscapular radiation of pain are not typical, making this diagnosis less likely.",
