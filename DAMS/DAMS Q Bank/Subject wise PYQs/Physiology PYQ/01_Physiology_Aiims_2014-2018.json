      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Phytates, which are found in plant-based foods like whole grains, nuts, and seeds, are a major inhibitor of calcium absorption. They bind to calcium in the digestive tract, forming an insoluble complex that the body cannot absorb. This significantly reduces the amount of calcium available to be utilized by the body. Why Other Options Increase Calcium Absorption B. Vitamin D: Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption. It promotes the synthesis of a protein in the intestines that acts as a carrier, transporting calcium from the gut into the bloodstream. Without adequate Vitamin D, calcium absorption is greatly impaired. C. Alkaline pH in gut: Calcium is absorbed more effectively in an alkaline (or basic) environment. The presence of an alkaline pH in the gut, particularly in the small intestine where most absorption occurs, keeps calcium in a more soluble form, making it easier for the body to take it up. D. Protein in diet: Dietary protein, particularly animal protein, can enhance calcium absorption. Certain amino acids in protein can form soluble complexes with calcium, which facilitates its transport across the intestinal wall. However, excessive protein intake can also lead to increased calcium excretion in the urine, so a balanced intake is key.",

FSH is synthesized and secreted by the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland, and regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the body. FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) work together in the reproductive system. FSH is a 35.5 kDa glycoprotein heterodimer, consisting of two polypeptide units, alpha and beta. Its structure is similar to those of luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The alpha subunits of the glycoproteins LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical and consist of 96 amino acids, while the beta subunits vary.",

The oxygen content of blood is the volume of oxygen carried in each 100 ml blood. It is calculated by: (O2 carried by Hb) + (O2 in solution ) = (1.34xHbxSpO2x0.01) + (0.023xPaO2) Where: SO2 = percentage saturation of Hb with oxygen Hb = haemoglobin concentration in grams pre 100 ml blood PO2 = partial pressure of oxygen (0.0225=ml of O2 dissolved per 100 ml plasma per kPa, or 0.003 ml per mm Hg) Ans.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ref: Chapter 27, Guyton & Hall textbook of medical physiology 13th edition, Pg-339 EXP: 1. Afferent arteriolar constriction decreases renal plasma flow (RPF) and thus decreases GFR by decreasing hydrostatic pressure of glomerular capillary. so here, filtration fraction viz GFR/RPF undergoes no change. 2) Constriction of efferent arteriole increases hydrostatic pressure of glomerular capillaries and thereby increases GFR. But this happens only initially. Later, GFR decreases when eff. arteriole constricts to less than critical diameter. So, effect of efferent arteriole constriction on GFR is BIMODAL. Option d: osmotic pressure in capillaries increases due to increased filtration fraction, mild efferent arteriolar constriction leads to increase in GFR.",

No stimulus, no matter how strong, will not excite the nerve during absolute refractory period Cause - inactivation gates of the Na+ channel are closed when the membrane potential is depolarized. They remain closed until repolarization occurs. No action potential can occur until the inactivation gates open • Relative refractory period: Begins from the remaining part of repolarization to the end of action potential Stronger than normal stimulus(suprathreshold stimulus) produces action potential in relative refractory period Cause - The K+ conductance is higher than at rest, and the membrane potential is closer to the K+ equilibrium potential and, therefore, farther from threshold; more inward current is required to bring the membrane to threshold",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The plasma volume for the man would be approximately 2695 ml. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation: Step 1: Estimate Total Blood Volume The total blood volume is not given directly, but it can be estimated based on body weight. A common approximation for adult males is that total blood volume is about 70 mL per kilogram of body weight. Total Blood Volume = Body Weight × 70 mL/kg Total Blood Volume = 70 kg × 70 mL/kg = 4900 mL = 4.9 L Step 2: Calculate the Percentage of Blood that is Plasma Haematocrit is the percentage of blood volume that is composed of red blood cells. The remaining volume is primarily plasma. Haematocrit = 45% Plasma Percentage = 100% - Haematocrit Plasma Percentage = 100% - 45% = 55% or 0.55 Step 3: Calculate Plasma Volume Now, multiply the total blood volume by the plasma percentage to find the plasma volume. Plasma Volume = Total Blood Volume × Plasma Percentage Plasma Volume = 4.9 L × 0.55 = 2.695 L 2.695L X 1000= 2695ml",

This induces release of erythropoietin from kidney. He immediately does hyperventilation, which causes CO2 washout. This leads to respiratory alkalosis. The kidneys compensate for respiratory alkalosis in about 2 to 3 days, by increased secretion of HCO3. OO2 - Hb curve is shifted to right. At cellular level, there is increase in mitochondria and cytosolic enzymes",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lusitropy refers to the heart's ability to relax during diastole. Factors that impair calcium removal from the cells, or increase intracellular calcium, generally impair lusitropy (slow down the relaxation phase). Increase in intracellular calcium increases contraction force, but decreases lusitropy, because it prevents the heart from relaxing properly. Now let's go through the options: A. Increase in catecholamines: Does not negatively impact lusitropy. Catecholamines (like adrenaline) actually improve both contraction and relaxation by enhancing calcium handling, thus increasing lusitropy. B. Defect in sarcolemmal calcium pump: Negatively impacts lusitropy. The sarcolemmal calcium pump helps remove calcium from the cell, and a defect would lead to calcium buildup in the cell, making it harder for the heart to relax. C. Defect in sodium-calcium exchanger: Negatively impacts lusitropy. This defect would also prevent proper calcium removal from the cell, impairing relaxation and reducing lusitropy. D. Increase in intracellular calcium: Negatively impacts lusitropy. More calcium inside the cell would enhance contraction but prevent proper relaxation, thus reducing lusitropy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a globulin protein that in humans is encoded by the SERPINA7 gene. TBG binds thyroid hormones in circulation. It is one of three transport proteins (along with transthyretin and serum albumin) responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the bloodstream. Of these three proteins, TBG has the highest affinity for T4 and T3 but is present in the lowest concentration relative to transthyretin and albumin, which also bind T3 and T4 in circulation. Despite its low concentration, TBG carries the majority of T4 in the blood plasma. Due to the very low concentration of T4 and T3 in the blood, TBG is rarely more than 25% saturated with its ligand. Unlike transthyretin and albumin, TBG has a single binding site for T4/T3. TBG is synthesized primarily in the liver as a 54-kDa protein. In terms of genomics, TBG is a serpin; however, it has no inhibitory function like many other members of this class of proteins.",

The fluid entering early DCT is always hypotonic Finally, osmolarity starts rising in late DCT due to Na and Cl movement to the outside. In terminal DCT and collecting tubules, the osmolarity changes according to water permeability, as governed by ADH. Under the influence of ADH (which increases only water reabsorption, not solutes), another 10-12% water is reabsorbed, thereby increasing the tonicity.

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The descending limb of the loop of Henle, particularly the thin descending limb, is highly permeable to water. As the tubular fluid flows down into the progressively saltier (hypertonic) renal medulla, water is osmotically drawn out of the tubule into the medullary interstitium. This outward movement of water is a crucial step in concentrating the urine and is a defining characteristic of this segment of the nephron. Therefore, the statement that the descending limb is impermeable to water is false. Incorrect Options: Option (A. Descending limb is moderately permeable to sodium & urea.) Explanation: While the primary characteristic of the thin descending limb is its high permeability to water, its permeability to solutes like urea and, to a lesser extent, sodium, does increase as it extends deeper into the inner medulla. This contributes to the medullary osmotic gradient and urea recycling. Thus, the statement is generally considered true in its nuanced detail, especially compared to the clear falsehood of options C and D. Option (B. Ascending limb is permeable to Sodium) Explanation: This statement is true. Both the thin and thick ascending limbs are permeable to sodium. The thick ascending limb specifically utilizes active transport (e.g., the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter) to reabsorb large amounts of sodium (along with chloride and potassium) from the filtrate into the medullary interstitium. This active removal of solutes is fundamental to the countercurrent multiplier's function and the dilution of the tubular fluid. Option (D. Ascending limb is permeable to water) Explanation: This statement is false. The entire ascending limb of the loop of Henle (both thin and thick segments) is characteristically impermeable to water. This impermeability is essential for the countercurrent multiplier to work effectively. It allows solutes to be removed from the tubule without water following, thereby diluting the tubular fluid and maintaining the hypertonicity of the renal medulla. While this statement is also false, in the context of typical \"except\" questions, the descending limb's absolute need for water permeability (Option C's inverse) is often seen as a primary and critical distinction.",

      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pulmonary compliance increases With aging, the lungs undergo structural changes — most notably the loss of elastic tissue in the alveolar walls. This results in a reduction in elastic recoil, meaning the lungs become more distensible or \"floppy.\" As a result, pulmonary compliance increases, allowing the lungs to inflate more easily. However, this increased compliance is physiologically not advantageous, as it leads to inefficient emptying of the lungs and air trapping. This is a hallmark age-related change in lung mechanics. Incorrect Option B: Residual volume decreases This is incorrect because residual volume (RV) increases with age, not decreases. As lung recoil diminishes and the strength of respiratory muscles weakens, the ability to forcefully exhale is reduced. This causes more air to be retained in the lungs after expiration, thereby increasing the residual volume. Therefore, this option is false. Incorrect Option C: Mucociliary clearance increases This option is also incorrect. Aging is associated with decreased mucociliary clearance due to reduced ciliary activity, altered mucus production, and thinning of airway epithelium. These changes impair the lungs' ability to clear inhaled particles and pathogens, making older adults more prone to respiratory infections. Hence, mucociliary clearance does not increase — it declines with age. Incorrect Option D: Fibrosis of interstitium decreases This is not true. In fact, fibrosis tends to mildly increase in the lung interstitium with age, even in the absence of overt disease. These fibrotic changes can contribute to a gradual decline in lung function and impaired gas exchange. So, fibrosis does not decrease as we age — it typically becomes more evident.",
