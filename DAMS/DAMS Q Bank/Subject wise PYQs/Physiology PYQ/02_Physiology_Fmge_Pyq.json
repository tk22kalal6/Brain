      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Milk ejection by Oxytocin. The mechanism of uterine contraction and milk ejection are both examples of a positive feedback loop. In this physiological mechanism, a stimulus triggers a response, and that response, in turn, amplifies the original stimulus, leading to a continuous cycle of increasing activity until the process is complete. In childbirth, uterine contractions lead to cervical stretching, which stimulates the release of more oxytocin, causing stronger contractions. Similarly, during lactation, the infant's suckling stimulates the release of oxytocin, which causes milk to be ejected, and the continued suckling then leads to the release of more oxytocin. Both processes are self-amplifying cycles mediated by oxytocin. This contrasts with negative feedback loops, such as water retention by ADH, which work to reverse or counteract a stimulus to maintain homeostasis. FSH secretion is also primarily regulated by a negative feedback loop. Therefore, milk ejection by oxytocin is the only option that demonstrates a similar positive feedback mechanism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (D) Facilitated diffusion Explanation: GLUT4 is a glucose transporter protein found in insulin-sensitive tissues like muscle and adipose cells. When insulin binds to its receptor, it signals these cells to move GLUT4-containing vesicles to the cell membrane. Once at the membrane, GLUT4 acts as a channel to allow glucose to move from an area of higher concentration (outside the cell) to an area of lower concentration (inside the cell). This movement down the concentration gradient, with the help of a protein carrier, is the definition of facilitated diffusion. No direct cellular energy (ATP) is consumed in the actual transport of glucose through GLUT4. Incorrect Options: Option A. Primary active Transport Explanation: Primary active transport directly uses ATP to pump molecules against their concentration gradient. GLUT4 does not directly consume ATP to move glucose. Option B. Secondary active Transport Explanation: Secondary active transport uses the energy from an existing electrochemical gradient (often established by primary active transport) to move another molecule. GLUT4 does not rely on such a coupled gradient for glucose transport. Option C. Simple diffusion Explanation: Simple diffusion involves molecules passing directly through the lipid bilayer without the aid of transport proteins. Glucose is a relatively large and polar molecule and cannot easily cross the cell membrane by simple diffusion; it requires a specific transporter like GLUT4.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): DMD is caused by a complete or nearly complete absence of functional dystrophin protein due to specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. It is a severe, rapidly progressive form of muscular dystrophy that typically presents in early childhood with proximal muscle weakness, and Gower's sign is a hallmark feature. B. Becker's muscular dystrophy (BMD): BMD is also caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, but these mutations result in the production of a reduced amount or a partially functional (altered) dystrophin protein. BMD is a milder, more slowly progressive form of muscular dystrophy compared to DMD, but patients can still exhibit Gower's sign and have similar, though less severe, muscle weakness. C. Congenital myopathy: This is a broad group of inherited muscle disorders that are present at birth or in early infancy. While they cause muscle weakness, they are typically associated with structural abnormalities in muscle fibers and are not primarily caused by defects in the dystrophin protein. D. All of the above: This would imply that congenital myopathy also fits the \"decreased/altered dystrophin\" criterion, which it does not.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Metabolic acidosis is the correct answer because it is not a feature of Conn’s syndrome. Conn’s syndrome, or primary hyperaldosteronism, involves excessive aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone promotes the excretion of hydrogen ions and potassium in the kidneys. The loss of hydrogen ions leads to metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis. Therefore, stating that metabolic acidosis occurs in Conn’s syndrome is incorrect, Metabolic alkalosis This option is incorrect because metabolic alkalosis does occur in Conn’s syndrome. The high levels of aldosterone cause the kidneys to lose hydrogen ions, which leads to a rise in blood pH and metabolic alkalosis. So, this is a true statement about Conn’s syndrome. Hypertension This option is incorrect because hypertension does occur in Conn’s syndrome. Aldosterone causes increased reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules, leading to volume expansion and elevated blood pressure. Therefore, hypertension is a correct and expected feature of the condition. Low renin levels This option is incorrect because low renin levels are seen in Conn’s syndrome. The expanded blood volume and elevated blood pressure from aldosterone’s action suppress renin secretion via negative feedback. Thus, low renin is a hallmark of primary hyperaldosteronism like Conn’s syndrome.",

They move along cytoskeletal filaments (microtubules for kinesin and dynein, and actin filaments for myosin) to transport cellular materials, enable muscle contraction, and play roles in processes like cell division. Incorrect options: A. Transcellular molecule Explanation: Transcellular molecules typically move across cells or cellular membranes (like transport proteins), which is not the primary function of kinesin, dynein, and myosin. B. Intracellular molecule Explanation: While these proteins are indeed found inside the cell, the term \"intracellular molecule\" does not specifically describe their function as motors. D. Cell adhesion molecule Explanation: Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are involved in the attachment between cells or between cells and the extracellular matrix. Kinesin, dynein, and myosin are not involved in adhesion but in movement along cytoskeletal tracks.",

It is typically insufficient in premature infants, leading to alveolar collapse, impaired gas exchange, and clinical respiratory distress soon after birth. Incorrect Options: Option A: Bronchial asthma Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease seen in older children and adults, not in neonates. It is characterized by bronchospasm, wheezing, and reversible airflow obstruction — not due to surfactant deficiency or alveolar collapse at birth. Option C: Pneumonia Neonatal pneumonia involves infection and inflammation of the lungs, which may cause respiratory distress, but it is not associated with surfactant deficiency or typical alveolar collapse due to immature lungs. Additionally, pneumonia would likely present with signs of infection such as fever, leukocytosis, or sepsis. Option D: Pleural effusion Pleural effusion refers to fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which can cause respiratory difficulty, but it is not caused by surfactant deficiency or associated with alveolar collapse in the context of a newborn. It would be seen on imaging as fluid, not collapsed alveoli.",

Although it plays a role in sensory perception, it is not the main center for thermoregulation. B. Hypothalamus: The hypothalamus acts as the body's thermostat. It monitors core body temperature via thermoreceptors and orchestrates appropriate responses (such as shivering, sweating, and changes in blood flow) to maintain thermal homeostasis. In this case, after ingesting a large amount of cold ice-cream, the hypothalamus detects the drop in temperature in certain regions (like the ear) and signals the body to adjust accordingly. C. Amygdala: The amygdala is primarily involved in processing emotions, especially fear and pleasure. It is not directly responsible for regulating body temperature. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Broca’s area is located in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere (usually the left). It is responsible for the motor production of speech. A lesion here leads to non-fluent (expressive) aphasia, where the patient can understand spoken language but has difficulty speaking. Speech becomes slow, effortful, and broken, often with intact comprehension. This matches the scenario described, where the patient understands his friend but is unable to express himself fluently after the trauma. Incorrect Options: A. Wernicke’s area is located in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus, and it governs language comprehension. A lesion here causes fluent aphasia, where the patient can speak in long sentences, but the speech is often meaningless and lacks comprehension. Since the patient in the question understands others well, this option is incorrect. C. Angular gyrus is involved in visual language processing, such as reading and writing. Damage here can lead to alexia (inability to read) or agraphia (inability to write) but does not typically cause speech production issues like non-fluent aphasia, making this option unrelated to the presented case. D. Arcuate fasciculus is the white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Lesions here lead to conduction aphasia, where the patient has fluent speech and good comprehension but poor repetition. This is different from the non-fluent, expressive type of aphasia described in the question, hence this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In cardiac tamponade, the pericardial space is filled with fluid, which compresses the heart and restricts its normal filling, particularly during diastole. This results in elevated venous pressure and the classic finding of an absent Y descent in the jugular venous pressure (JVP) waveform. The Y descent corresponds to early diastolic filling of the right atrium and is blunted in tamponade due to restricted filling. Why other options are incorrect: A. Rapid Y descent Explanation: A rapid Y descent would typically be seen in conditions like constrictive pericarditis, where there is restriction to ventricular filling, but not due to the same mechanism as in tamponade. In tamponade, the Y descent is absent, not rapid. C. Absent A wave Explanation: The A wave in JVP represents atrial contraction, and it is typically present in tamponade. It's not absent because atrial contraction still occurs even when there is restricted ventricular filling. D. Canon A wave Explanation: A canon A wave is associated with ventricular-atrial dissociation, such as in complete heart block or ventricular tachycardia, where the atria contract against a closed tricuspid valve. It is not seen in cardiac tamponade.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) RBCs In blood vessels, especially smaller ones like venules, blood flows in a laminar fashion. This means that the fluid near the vessel walls moves slower due to friction, while the fluid in the center moves faster. Due to their higher concentration, biconcave shape, and deformability, red blood cells tend to aggregate and move within this faster-flowing central (axial) stream. This phenomenon is known as axial streaming. Conversely, the plasma and other blood cells, particularly leukocytes (like lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages), which are less numerous and often more rigid or tend to interact with the endothelium, are pushed towards the periphery of the vessel, closer to the endothelial lining. This margination of leukocytes is a critical step in the inflammatory process, allowing them to adhere to the vessel wall and eventually exit into the surrounding tissue.",

Correct: Myasthenia gravis is due to antibodies against nicotinic ACh receptors on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. This prevents Ach from binding, causing fatigable weakness. C. Antibodies against Voltage gated Calcium channels in neuronal end ? This describes Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS).

Correct. •RyR mutation can cause excessive calcium release from the SR, leading to conditions like malignant hyperthermia: •Uncontrolled muscle contraction •Increased metabolism ? heat production •Rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia C. Decreased ATP binding with myosin head ? This is unrelated. ATP binding is necessary for detachment of the myosin head; defects in ATP handling lead to rigor mortis, not RyR mutation. D.

This is the site of Wernicke’s area (area 22, dominant hemisphere). •Lesion here leads to: •Fluent but meaningless speech (word salad) •Poor comprehension •Answers irrelevant to questions (receptive aphasia) •Matches the question perfectly. D. Basal ganglia •? Causes movement disorders (Parkinsonism, chorea) but not classical language deficits.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A. Work out - Sympathetic Stimulation - Bronchoconstriction • ? Sympathetic stimulation causes bronchodilatation, not constriction. B. Work out - Sympathetic Stimulation - Bronchodilatation • ? Although sympathetic stimulation causes bronchodilatation, this does not explain dyspnea in cold-induced bronchospasm. C. Work out - Parasympathetic Stimulation - Bronchodilatation • ? Parasympathetic stimulation causes bronchoconstriction, not dilatation. D. Chill cold weather & Airway hypersensitivity - Bronchoconstriction • ? Correct. • Cold air + airway hypersensitivity leads to bronchoconstriction (via parasympathetic reflexes and release of mediators). • This is the basis of exercise-induced bronchospasm seen in asthmatics and sensitive individuals.",
