      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Subdural Hematoma (SDH) occurs due to the tearing of bridging veins, which connect the cerebral cortex to the dural sinuses. These veins are particularly vulnerable in elderly individuals and alcoholics, where brain atrophy increases tension on the veins. Trauma (e.g., fall, head injury) is the most common cause Other options: A) Rupture of Middle Meningeal Artery: Causes epidural hematoma (EDH), which appears biconvex (lentiform) on CT and does not cross suture lines C) Rupture of Berry Aneurysm: Causes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), presenting as a thunderclap headache, not subdural bleeding D) Rupture of Middle Cerebral Artery: Leads to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or ischemic stroke, not SDH",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A lacerated wound on the scalp that is bone deep suggests that the injury is caused by blunt force trauma. In such cases, the skin and soft tissues are crushed between the impacting object and the underlying bone, leading to a tear in the skin with irregular margins. Mechanism of Laceration Formation: When a blunt object (such as a stick, rod, or stone) strikes the scalp, the skin is compressed against the skull. The force overcomes the elasticity of the skin, leading to splitting of the skin and underlying tissues. The wound appears irregular, with bruising and tissue bridges inside Other Options: B) Overstretching forces: More relevant for avulsion injuries, where the skin is forcibly stretched and torn away (e.g., degloving injuries) C) Shearing forces: More common in incised wounds caused by sharp weapons like knives, where the tissue is cut rather than crushed D) Hitting by semi-sharp objects: Would produce an incised-looking lacerated wound, but the given description only mentions laceration, suggesting a purely blunt injury",

When freshwater enters the lungs and is absorbed into the bloodstream, it causes hemolysis due to the dilution of blood and disruption of cell membranes. This releases potassium from the cells into the bloodstream, leading to hyperkalemia (increased potassium levels), which can cause serious cardiac arrhythmias and contribute to death Dilutional hyponatremia: The absorption of a large volume of freshwater into the bloodstream can dilute the sodium levels, causing hyponatremia, which can lead to brain swelling and death Hemodilution: The influx of freshwater into the body can lead to a decrease in blood osmolality, causing dilution of blood components, including red blood cells Disruption of pulmonary surfactant: The inhalation of water can disrupt the function of pulmonary surfactant, leading to alveolar collapse, impaired gas exchange, and respiratory failure Arrhythmia: The electrolyte disturbances and stress on the body from drowning can lead to fatal arrhythmias, especially due to hypoxia and electrolyte imbalance",

The injury is often caused by a rope, cord, or similar object, and it can lead to asphyxia by restricting airflow and blood flow to the brain Other options: Hanging (A): In hanging, the marks are often vertical, and the cause of death is typically due to mechanical obstruction or hypoxia caused by weight pulling on the neck Drowning (C): Drowning usually causes frothy fluid in the airways and water in the lungs, but external markings around the neck are not as commonly seen Traumatic asphyxia (D): This condition is associated with severe compression of the chest or body, leading to blood congestion and facial cyanosis, but it doesn't typically present with the specific neck marks seen in strangulation",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Assertion: The range of a shot can be determined by the spread of pellets. This is true because the spread of the pellets from a shotgun will increase with distance. A close-range shot will have tightly clustered pellets, while a long-range shot will have a wider spread. By assessing how dispersed the pellets are, an investigator can estimate the distance from which the shot was fired Reason: A shotgun cartridge contains pellets. While this is true, it does not directly explain the assertion. The fact that a shotgun cartridge contains pellets is a basic fact about how a shotgun works, but the spread of the pellets at various ranges is what actually helps determine the shot's range. Therefore, the reason is not a correct explanation of the assertion, even though both statements are true",

It is characterized by a fracture line that behaves like a hinge or pivot point, where the skull may be displaced in a way that causes limited mobility, like the opening and closing of a hinge. This type of fracture is often associated with significant trauma Other options: A) Ring fracture: A fracture that forms around the foramen magnum, often seen in cases of severe head trauma or high-impact injuries C) Diastatic fracture: A fracture that causes separation of the sutures in the skull, commonly seen in children with developing skulls D) Depressed fracture: This is a type of skull fracture where a portion of the bone is displaced inward, often resulting from direct blunt trauma",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Postmortem staining is typically seen in the dependent parts of the body after death, where blood settles due to gravity. In cases of drowning, postmortem staining is often seen in the back or posterior parts of the body (depending on how the body is positioned during recovery), but not specifically in the limbs Other options: B) Greenish discoloration in the subhepatic space: This is a postmortem change indicating the beginning of putrefaction, where microbial activity in the body leads to the breakdown of tissue and the formation of gases and discoloration C) Adipocere in drowning: This is a process of conversion of body fat to a wax-like substance during postmortem decomposition, which can occur in drowned bodies, especially in water that is cool or stagnant D) Cadaveric spasm is seen in one group of muscles: This is a postmortem phenomenon where muscles, especially those involved in the final act before death, contract and remain in a fixed position, typically seen in specific muscles, such as those involved in the grasping reflex during drowning",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) This case describes symptoms that suggest poisoning from a venomous bite, most likely from scorpion bite that has resulted in systemic effects. The presence of high blood pressure (150/90 mmHg), increased heart rate, priapism, and cold peripheries suggests a sympathetic overactivation, which can occur due to scorpion bite Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that helps in reducing the sympathetic response, such as high blood pressure and the other associated symptoms like priapism and cold extremities. It helps by blocking the effects of excess catecholamines that cause these symptoms Other options: B) Atropine: This is an anticholinergic used for bradycardia or to reverse the effects of organophosphorus poisoning. It wouldn't be appropriate here as the issue is likely related to sympathetic overactivation rather than parasympathetic effects C) Adrenaline can be used for anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions, it would not be the first choice in this case of sympathetic overactivity, as it may worsen the high blood pressure and other symptoms D) Antisnake venom: If a snake bite was confirmed and the symptoms were related to snake venom, antivenom would be necessary. However, based on the described symptoms (high blood pressure, priapism, cold peripheries), the immediate concern is controlling sympathetic overactivation with prazosin",

Loss of this mechanism is a feature of heat stroke, not heat exhaustion. B. Orthostatic hypotension is seen Correct ? Due to dehydration and peripheral vasodilation, orthostatic hypotension is common. C. Altered consciousness is not seen Correct ? Patients are usually alert, although they may feel weak, dizzy, or fatigued. Significant altered consciousness occurs in heat stroke. D. Core body temperature is < 105°C Correct ? Core body temp in heat exhaustion is usually between 37°C and 40°C, not exceeding 40.5°C (or ~105°F). So this statement, while awkwardly worded, is factually correct.",
