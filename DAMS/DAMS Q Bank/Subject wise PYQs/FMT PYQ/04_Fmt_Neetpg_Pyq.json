      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Leading questions are questions that suggest the answer within the question itself. Generally, leading questions are not allowed during direct examination (examination-in-chief), as they can influence the witness’s testimony. However, leading questions are allowed during cross-examination because the opposing counsel is trying to challenge or test the credibility of the witness Other Options: A) Direct examination: Leading questions are not allowed in direct examination except for preliminary or undisputed matters C) Examination-in-chief: Examination-in-chief is another term for direct examination, where leading questions are also restricted D) Dying declaration is a statement made by a person on their deathbed and does not involve questioning in the same manner as a trial examination",

Performing surgery while intoxicated is a severe breach of duty, indicating a reckless disregard for patient safety. Such cases often lead to legal action under criminal laws rather than just civil lawsuits Other Options: A) Civil negligence involves unintentional errors where compensation is sought in civil court, but gross negligence (e.g., operating while drunk) is a criminal offense C) Dichotomy refers to illegal fee-splitting between doctors, unrelated to negligence D) Therapeutic misadventure refers to unexpected complications during proper treatment, not reckless actions like performing surgery while intoxicated.",

They are commonly seen on the palms, forearms, and dorsum of hands, as victims instinctively raise their hands to block a weapon or strike. These wounds are irregular, deep, and often multiple, unlike hesitation cuts, which are more superficial Other Options: A) Hesitational cuts: Seen in suicidal attempts, usually shallow, parallel, multiple, and localized (commonly on wrists or neck) C) Post-mortem cuts: Lack vital reactions (like bleeding or inflammation) and are usually clean, uniform, and non-defensive D) Self-inflicted wounds: Often neatly placed, superficial, and in accessible areas (like wrists or arms)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ligature strangulation, because the forensic evidence described is highly consistent with this specific form of death. In ligature strangulation, the constricting force is external, not the victim's body weight, resulting in a ligature mark that is typically horizontal and completely encircles the neck. This contrasts with hanging, where the force of the body's weight creates an oblique mark that rises towards the point of suspension and is incomplete due to the presence of a knot. The location of the mark below the thyroid cartilage and the absence of salivary dribbling further support ligature strangulation, as the force applied is directed straight across the neck rather than upward.",

Datura contains tropane alkaloids like atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, leading to anticholinergic toxicity Dhatura poisoning causes anticholinergic toxicity (dry mouth, mydriasis, hallucinations, urinary retention, fever) Physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, reverses the effects by increasing acetylcholine levels. Other Options: B) Yellow Oleander and Physostigmine: Yellow oleander poisoning affect the heart by causing cardiac glycoside toxicity (arrhythmias, vomiting, hyperkalemia). Digibind (Digoxin-specific antibody fragments) is the antidote, not physostigmine C) Dhatura and Digibind: Digibind is used for cardiac glycoside poisoning, not anticholinergic toxicity D) Yellow Oleander and Digibind: This pair would be correct for yellow oleander poisoning but does not match the symptoms given in the question",

These symptoms strongly suggest severe alcohol withdrawal, specifically Delirium Tremens (DT) DT typically occurs 48–96 hours after alcohol cessation in chronic alcohol users Symptoms include confusion, hallucinations (often visual), autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, fever), tremors, and agitation Management: Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam), fluids, thiamine, and supportive care Other options: A) Korsakoff Psychosis is a chronic complication of Wernicke encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency. Features anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, but no acute disorientation, hallucinations, or altered sensorium seen in DT B) Wernicke Encephalopathy caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency in alcoholics. Classic triad: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, confusion C) Acute Alcoholic Hallucinosis occurs within 12–24 hours of alcohol withdrawal (earlier than DT).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Close shot entry wound: Burning, blackening, tattooing, and a dirt collar around the wound indicate a close-range gunshot entry wound. Tattooing occurs due to unburnt gunpowder embedding into the skin, while blackening and burning result from the hot gases expelled from the firearm. A dirt collar (abrasion collar) forms due to the bullet rubbing against the skin upon entry Other options: B) Close shot exit wound: Exit wounds do not exhibit burning, blackening, or tattooing because there is no direct contact with gunpowder or gases. Exit wounds are typically irregular in shape and larger than entry wounds due to the bullet's deformation and tumbling inside the body C) Distant shot entry wound: Distant gunshot wounds lack blackening, burning, or tattooing since the gunpowder and heat dissipate before reaching the target. The entry wound at a distant shot is clean with an abrasion collar but no soot or tattooing D) Distant shot exit wound: Like Close shot exit wounds, distant shot exit wounds also lack burning, blackening, and tattooing.

It is the foundation of forensic investigations, used in crime scene analysis Other options: B) Identification of Sex from Bones: Sex determination from bones is done using skeletal differences, especially the pelvis and skull. This falls under forensic anthropology C) Calculation of Stature from Bones: Height estimation from bones is based on formulas like Trotter & Gleser’s method using the long bones (femur, tibia, humerus) D) Estimation of Age: Age estimation in forensic medicine is done by examining teeth (dental eruption), bones (epiphyseal fusion), and skull sutures.

In warm and humid conditions, liquefaction of the brain occurs rapidly Other options: A) Heart resists putrefaction longer than the brain. It is a muscular organ with relatively lower water content, making decomposition slower B) Kidney decomposes after the brain. They have moderate moisture content, but their compact structure delays putrefaction D) Prostate is one of the last organs to putrefy due to dense fibrous tissue and lower water content.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rigor mortis follows a definite sequence in the body, progressing in a \"head-to-foot\" direction due to depletion of ATP and muscle contraction Sequence of Rigor Mortis: 1. Begins in small muscles (eyelids, jaw, neck) 2. Spreads to upper limbs (shoulders, arms, hands) 3. Progresses to the trunk and lower limbs 4. Finally affects the feet and toes This follows Nysten's rule, which states that rigor mortis progresses from head to toe due to the descending ATP depletion in muscles Other Options: A) Centre to periphery, as rigor does not start centrally; it begins in smaller muscles first C) Foot to head, as rigor starts in the head and moves downward D) Periphery to centre, as rigor moves sequentially downward, not from the periphery inward",

While sexual assault cases require privacy, \"in camera\" is the specific legal term used for such hearings Option D (With camera) is incorrect because it implies video recording, which is not mandatory or appropriate in sexual assault cases",

The process results in a white, waxy, soap-like material that preserves body contours and facial features. Other options: A) It needs hot weather without humidity: Adipocere formation occurs in moist environments like water or wet soil. Hot and dry conditions promote mummification, not adipocere formation C) Commonly occurs in non-fatty tissues: It primarily affects fatty tissues (e.g., cheeks, buttocks, breasts, thighs), as it involves fat hydrolysis D) Occurs within minutes to hours: Adipocere formation takes weeks to months to develop.
