      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The scenario describes a patient with suspected tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) toxicity, which presents with altered sensorium, hypotension, and ECG findings of wide QRS complexes. The appropriate treatment is sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate is the treatment of choice for TCA toxicity or another antidepressant-induced cardiotoxicity. It helps to alkalinize the serum, reduce QRS widening, and reverse sodium channel blockade caused by the antidepressant Other options: A) DC cardioversion is used in cases of unstable tachyarrhythmias or atrial fibrillation but is not the first-line treatment for wide QRS complexes caused by antidepressant toxicity, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) C) Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used for anticholinergic toxicity. It is contraindicated in TCA overdose as it may worsen cardiac arrhythmias and seizures D) Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., class IA, IC) are generally avoided in TCA-induced wide QRS complexes as they may exacerbate the sodium channel blockade and worsen cardiac toxicity. Sodium bicarbonate is more effective and safer in this context",

Other options: Obsession: This is a recurrent, intrusive thought or urge that causes distress. It is commonly seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Not part of formal thought disorder, as it pertains to the content of thought rather than its structure. Thought insertion where a person believes that thoughts are being placed into their mind by external forces Delusion: A false, fixed belief held despite evidence to the contrary, e.g., delusions of persecution or grandeur. Delusions involve the content of thought, not its form, and are not part of formal thought disorder",

The patient's symptoms of overfamiliarity, flight of ideas, elevated mood, increased sexual desire lasting for 10 days, fulfill the criteria for mania Other options: Schizomania: This is not a recognized diagnostic term in psychiatry Hypomania has similar features to mania but is less severe, with no significant functional impairment, hospitalization, or psychosis. Symptoms must last at least 4 days. In this case, the severity and functional impairment point towards mania rather than hypomania Cyclothymia: This is a chronic mood disorder with periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for hypomania or major depressive episodes.

It is a positive and cooperative dynamic and does not involve the therapist’s personal, unconscious needs Dissociation is a psychological defense mechanism in which a person becomes detached from their thoughts, feelings, or sense of identity, often as a response to trauma or stress. It is not related to the therapist’s reactions towards the patient in the context of therapy Transference is the patient's unconscious redirection of feelings, desires, or expectations from past relationships onto the therapist.

Bradycardia is not a typical response to cocaine use; it usually results in tachycardia due to its stimulating effects on the heart Other options: A) Hyperthermia: Cocaine use, especially in heavy doses, increases sympathetic activity and can lead to hyperthermia, a common effect C) Agitation: Cocaine is a stimulant, and agitation or anxiety is common with use. This occurs due to its effect on the central nervous system, which increases excitability D) Myocardial infarct: Cocaine is known to cause myocardial infarction due to its effects on increasing blood pressure, heart rate, and causing vasoconstriction of coronary arteries",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The patient is experiencing parkinsonism as a side effect of the antipsychotic medication trifluoperazine, which is a first-generation antipsychotic (typical antipsychotic). One of the known side effects of these medications is drug-induced parkinsonism, which resembles Parkinson's disease but is caused by the drug's effect on dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic medication commonly used to treat drug-induced parkinsonism. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, which can help restore the balance between acetylcholine and dopamine in the brain, improving the parkinsonism symptoms caused by antipsychotic drugs Other options: B) Rasagiline: This is a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but it is not typically used for drug-induced parkinsonism caused by antipsychotic medications C) Amantadine: While amantadine can be used to treat both Parkinson's disease and drug-induced parkinsonism, it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. It is more commonly used for early Parkinson's disease or to reduce tremors and rigidity D) Pramipexole: This is a dopamine agonist used primarily in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, not drug-induced parkinsonism. It may worsen symptoms in drug-induced parkinsonism since it could further interfere with the normal dopamine balance",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The symptoms described by the 18-year-old female with episodes of tightness in the chest, anxiety, feelings of impending doom, and recurrent episodes (1 episode per week for 3-4 months) — are classic signs of panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, which are intense surges of fear or discomfort that occur suddenly and without warning Other options: A) Acute stress disorder: Acute stress disorder occurs immediately after a traumatic event and lasts for at least 3 days but less than 4 weeks. This diagnosis would require a recent traumatic event, which is not mentioned in the case B) Major depressive disorder: While depression can involve anxiety and chest tightness, it is characterized by a persistent low mood and loss of interest in most activities, which is not described in this case. Panic attacks can occur in comorbid depression, but the focus here is on recurrent panic-like episodes D) Conversion disorder: Conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms (such as paralysis, blindness, or seizures) that do not have a medical explanation. The symptoms described here (chest tightness, anxiety, etc.) are more consistent with panic disorder, not conversion disorder",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The patient presents with decreased sleep, decreased appetite, death wishes, and now with the addition of hearing voices telling him to die, which suggests the presence of psychotic symptoms. These symptoms, when combined with a 6-month history of depressive symptoms (e.g., decreased sleep and appetite), point to a severe depressive episode with psychotic features Other options: B) Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia typically presents with positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech/behavior, along with negative symptoms like flat affect or social withdrawal. In this case, the patient has a clear history of depressive symptoms lasting for 6 months, and the psychotic symptoms (hearing voices) are concurrent with depression, which makes schizophrenia less likely C) Delusional disorder: Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (e.g., the patient believes something that is not true but could be plausible) without the significant mood disturbance seen in this patient. The patient also presents with depression, decreased appetite, and sleep disturbances, which are not typical for delusional disorder D) Schizoaffective disorder: Schizoaffective disorder involves a combination of psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations or delusions) and mood disorder symptoms (e.g., depression or mania). However, the psychotic symptoms in schizoaffective disorder occur during a mood episode but may also exist outside of the mood episodes. This patient’s depressive symptoms appear to be chronic (over 6 months) and only recently developed auditory hallucinations, which are more consistent with severe depression with psychosis rather than schizoaffective disorder",

This is the transition from wakefulness to sleep and typically lasts for a few minutes. During this stage, the EEG shows theta waves, along with alpha wave attenuation as the person drifts into sleep Other options: B) Sleep stage 2 (N2): This stage is characterized by sleep spindles (short bursts of high-frequency brain activity) and K-complexes. While theta waves are also present, the hallmark features are sleep spindles and K-complexes C) Sleep stage 3 (N3): This is deep sleep (also called slow-wave sleep), and it is characterized by delta waves (high amplitude, low-frequency waves), not theta waves D) REM Sleep: Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is characterized by low-voltage, mixed-frequency waves that resemble wakefulness.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lithium is commonly used for the treatment of Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD), and fasting can affect the body's electrolyte balance, potentially leading to lithium toxicity. Lithium toxicity can cause symptoms such as vomiting, coarse tremors, dizziness, and other signs of neurological dysfunction Serum lithium levels should be checked promptly to assess for lithium toxicity, which can occur when there is reduced renal clearance of lithium during dehydration or fasting. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range, and slight fluctuations in its blood levels can lead to toxicity Other options: A) Serum electrolytes: While electrolyte disturbances (like hyponatremia) can exacerbate lithium toxicity, measuring serum lithium levels is more directly relevant to this situation, as it will help assess if the lithium level is elevated C) EEG: While an EEG might be used if there were concerns about seizure activity, it's not the first-line investigation in this case. The patient’s symptoms are more likely related to lithium toxicity D) MRI Brain: An MRI would not be indicated as the first-line investigation unless there were focal neurological signs or a history of trauma.

In the context of detecting reactions when told about an event that is already known to the person, brain mapping can be used to assess changes in brain activity in response to information or stimuli, including those that may elicit a reaction from the individual when discussing specific events Other options: A) Truth serum: This refers to the use of drugs (e.g., Thiopentone) that are supposed to lower inhibitions and make a person more likely to tell the truth. However, these substances are not reliable for detecting knowledge of events and do not measure brain activity directly B) Narcoanalysis: Similar to truth serum, narcoanalysis involves the use of drugs like sodium pentothal to induce a state of relaxation and suggestibility, but it does not directly measure the brain's response to known information C) Polygraph: The polygraph measures physiological responses such as heart rate, breathing rate, and skin conductivity.

ERP therapy is effective in reducing this symptom because it targets the compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking behaviors B) Contamination of dirt: Contamination OCD, where individuals fear germs or dirt, generally responds well to ERP. Exposure to situations involving dirt or contamination, along with preventing the compulsive washing or cleaning behaviors, tends to lead to symptom reduction D) Magical thinking: Magical thinking in OCD, where a person believes that certain actions or thoughts can influence outcomes in unrealistic ways (e.g., thinking that not wearing a specific shirt will cause bad things to happen), also tends to improve with ERP.

Symptoms also do not persist once the stressor resolves C) Anxiety Disorder: Anxiety is part of PTSD, but generalized anxiety disorder lacks trauma-related re-experiencing and hyperarousal D) Major Depression: This condition involves low mood, anhedonia, and vegetative symptoms but does not account for trauma-related symptoms like flashbacks and hyperarousal.",

It is the opposite of abreaction D) Free association: This is a technique in psychoanalysis where the patient speaks freely, sharing thoughts and feelings as they come to mind, but it doesn't necessarily involve the emotional release associated with abreaction",

This technique helps individuals gain better control over ejaculation and is often used in combination with other therapeutic strategies. Other options: A) Infertility: The squeeze technique is not used for infertility. Infertility treatments typically involve medications, assisted reproductive technologies, or surgical interventions C) Erectile dysfunction: The squeeze technique is not used for erectile dysfunction. Treatments for ED include medications like PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil), lifestyle changes, or devices like penile pumps D) Impotence: Impotence is an older term for erectile dysfunction, and the squeeze technique is not used to treat it.

Individuals with ASPD often display a pattern of violating the rights of others, engaging in deceitful or aggressive behavior, and disregarding societal norms, especially in their interactions outside structured settings.

The first-line treatment for BDD typically includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have been shown to reduce the preoccupations and distress associated with the disorder.

Selective mutism is a disorder where a person consistently fails to speak in certain social situations despite being able to speak in others, but it is not commonly associated with ADHD C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The scenario described is most consistent with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), also known as conversion seizures, which are often triggered by psychological factors rather than a neurological cause. Since the EEG and MRI are normal, and the episodes occur under specific circumstances (in front of family), PNES is highly suspected. Behavioral therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is the most appropriate treatment for PNES. It helps address underlying psychological stressors and improves coping mechanisms. Other options: A. Aversive therapy is not appropriate for this condition C. Valproate is used to treat epilepsy, but this patient’s symptoms are not due to seizures, so anticonvulsants are not indicated D. Ketogenic diet is typically used in the management of epilepsy, particularly drug-resistant epilepsy, and would not be effective for psychogenic seizures",
