      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Akathisia The correct diagnosis in this case is Akathisia, a common extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol, especially after several days to weeks of use. Akathisia is characterized by a subjective sense of inner restlessness and a compelling need to move, which matches the patient’s complaints of “inner restlessness and urge to move” over the last four days. Patients may pace, rock back and forth, or be unable to sit still, and they often describe a constant need to move even though it does not relieve the discomfort. Akathisia is most often seen with high-potency typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Early recognition and management are crucial, as untreated akathisia can lead to non-compliance and even suicidal ideation. Incorrect Options: B. Tardive Dyskinesia: This is a late-onset EPS that typically occurs after months or years of antipsychotic use. It involves involuntary, repetitive movements, often of the face (e.g., chewing, lip-smacking, tongue protrusion), and is not associated with inner restlessness or an urge to move. The short duration (only a few days of symptoms) and the type of symptoms described make this diagnosis unlikely. C. Rabbit Syndrome: Rabbit syndrome is a rare EPS marked by fine, rhythmic, perioral tremors, resembling the chewing motion of a rabbit. It typically occurs after long-term antipsychotic use, particularly with typical antipsychotics, but does not present with inner restlessness or a generalized urge to move. Hence, it does not fit the clinical picture here. D. Acute Dystonia: Acute dystonia usually occurs within the first few days of initiating antipsychotic therapy and presents with sudden, sustained muscle contractions — such as torticollis, oculogyric crisis, or jaw stiffness. It is painful and visibly abnormal in posture, which is different from the patient’s symptoms of inner restlessness and movement urge. Therefore, acute dystonia is not the correct diagnosis here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Serial (100-7) subtraction test up to 5 steps The serial subtraction test (100-7) is commonly used to assess immediate attention and working memory. In this task, a person is asked to subtract 7 serially from 100 (i.e., 100, 93, 86, 79, 72...), typically for 5 steps. This test evaluates the person’s ability to concentrate, hold information in mind, and manipulate it briefly — all core aspects of immediate memory. It's widely used in clinical settings (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination - MMSE) to check for cognitive impairments. Incorrect Options: B. Digit span forward up to 7 digits with 2 skips allowed This primarily tests attention span and short-term memory, but not the manipulation component, so it's not a full test of immediate memory or working memory. It measures how many digits a person can repeat in order, but doesn’t involve active mental processing. C. Digit span backward up to 5 digits with 2 skips allowed This is a better measure of working memory (manipulation of information), but it's typically used to assess executive function and attention, rather than pure immediate memory. While related, it’s not the standard or most direct test of immediate memory. D. Serial (20-1) subtraction test up to 5 steps This test is too simple (subtracting 1 from 20) and doesn't adequately challenge attention and working memory. It lacks the cognitive load of the 100-7 test, and therefore is not a standard test for immediate memory.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer: C. Delusion of grandiosity and persecution The patient believes he is the most important person in the world, which reflects a delusion of grandiosity — a false belief in one's exceptional importance, wealth, fame, or abilities. At the same time, he also believes that his neighbors and family are trying to harm him because they are jealous of him, which is characteristic of a delusion of persecution — a false belief that one is being harassed, cheated, or harmed by others without any real basis. The coexistence of grandiose and persecutory delusions is not uncommon, especially in conditions like paranoid schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or manic episodes with psychotic features. The fact that this behavior is recent in onset and different from his prior stable baseline (school teacher, peaceful life) suggests an acute onset psychotic episode, possibly secondary to a mood or psychotic disorder. Incorrect Options: A. Delusion of grandiosity This choice is partially correct, as the patient indeed has grandiose beliefs. However, it misses the important persecutory component of the delusion (neighbors trying to harm him), making it incomplete. B. Delusion of persecution Again, this is partially correct — the patient does show persecutory ideas — but it overlooks the grandiose aspect, which is clearly stated in the scenario (he believes he is the most important person in the world). D. Delusion of grandiosity, persecution and reference Delusion of reference involves believing that common elements of the environment (e.g., TV, newspapers, strangers' conversations) are directly referring to oneself. There's no evidence in the case scenario suggesting he misinterprets unrelated events as being about him. Hence, this choice includes an extra, incorrect element.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The basis of reliability of information provided by an informant about a patient is primarily grounded in how well the informant knows the patient, observes the patient, and has been around the patient. The correct answer is educational status, because while education may affect how well someone expresses themselves or understands complex questions, it does not necessarily reflect the accuracy or reliability of the information they provide about a patient’s behavior or condition. An informant's reliability hinges more on exposure to the patient and ability to observe their behavior consistently, rather than their level of formal education. Incorrect options: a. Biological relationship – A closer biological relationship (e.g., parent, sibling, child) often implies greater emotional involvement and longer, more intimate exposure to the patient’s habits and behaviors, making their information generally more reliable. c. Observational skills – This is directly related to reliability. A person who is naturally observant and attentive is more likely to notice and accurately report relevant behavioral or psychological symptoms in the patient. d. Duration of stay with patient – The longer an informant has lived with or been in close contact with the patient, the more chances they have to observe patterns and identify changes, making their input more dependable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Capgras Syndrome Capgras Syndrome is a type of delusional misidentification syndrome in which a person believes that someone close to them—typically a spouse, family member, or friend—has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor. In this scenario, the young patient recognizes the physical appearance of his wife but believes she is actually a nurse pretending to be his wife, and even accuses her of previously trying to harm him. This misidentification and associated delusional thinking are hallmark features of Capgras Syndrome, especially when it occurs in the context of acute psychosis, where reality testing is impaired. The patient’s aggressive reaction and the belief that his wife is someone else trying to deceive and hurt him strongly support this diagnosis. Incorrect Options: B) Fregoli Syndrome Fregoli Syndrome is another delusional misidentification disorder but is characterized by the belief that different people are actually a single person in disguise. For example, the patient would believe that various individuals are all the same person who is changing their appearance. In this case, the patient believes his wife is being impersonated by someone else, not that multiple people are one individual in disguise—hence, this is not Fregoli Syndrome. C) Delusion of Subjective Doubles This condition involves the belief that there is a duplicate or double of oneself, often with a different personality, who is carrying out actions independently. It is self-directed rather than directed at others, as in Capgras Syndrome. Since the patient is misidentifying his wife, not himself, this option is not appropriate. D) Othello Syndrome Othello Syndrome refers to a delusional belief of infidelity in one’s partner, often without any real evidence. The person may become paranoid, jealous, and accusatory. While the patient is suspicious and accusatory, the focus is not on infidelity but rather misidentification and a belief in deception for the purpose of harm, which does not fit with Othello Syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) Acute Intermittent Porphyria is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to the accumulation of porphyrin precursors. It often presents in adolescent girls or young women and is precipitated by stress, hormonal changes, certain medications, or infections. The hallmark of AIP is a combination of gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal colic, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), neuropsychiatric symptoms (irritability, anger, lethargy, headache), and motor neuropathy (weakness of limbs, especially lower limbs in severe attacks). The chronicity of symptoms over a year, progressive neuropsychiatric features, and acute motor weakness point strongly toward AIP. Importantly, the abdominal symptoms are disproportionate to physical findings, and standard GI workups are often unrevealing. This constellation of symptoms makes AIP the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A) Conversion Disorder Conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms (such as paralysis or seizures) that are inconsistent with medical disease and are often associated with psychological stressors. However, the presence of systemic symptoms like GI disturbances, headache, and a year-long history of progressive illness makes a psychiatric diagnosis like conversion disorder unlikely. AIP is an organic disorder with a clear biochemical basis. C) Lower Limb Paralysis This is a symptom, not a diagnosis. While the girl presents with lower limb weakness, the underlying cause must be identified. Simply labeling it as \"lower limb paralysis\" does not provide a clinical explanation or etiology. D) AIDP with Migraine AIDP (Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, also known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome) can cause ascending paralysis and weakness but typically has an acute onset rather than a chronic course over a year. Additionally, AIDP is not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms or mood changes. Migraine could explain the headache but not the colic, diarrhea, or limb weakness. The broader clinical picture is inconsistent with this combination. Thus, Acute Intermittent Porphyria is the most coherent and encompassing diagnosis given the diverse and progressive symptom profile.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Forced Thinking Forced thinking is a rare but well-described phenomenon associated with epilepsy, particularly focal (partial) seizures involving the frontal or temporal lobes. It is characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts that the person feels are being \"forced\" into their mind. These thoughts are experienced as distressing or intrusive, but not necessarily anxiety-provoking, and unlike obsessions, they often lack a clear resistance or urge to neutralize. A key diagnostic clue is the temporal relationship to seizures: the thoughts typically occur just before a seizure (pre-ictally) and resolve abruptly once the seizure occurs. In this case, the patient experiences disturbing, detailed thoughts of self-harm without an urge to act, followed by a seizure and immediate relief from these thoughts—this is classic for forced thinking. The episodic nature and resolution post-seizure further support the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A) Obsession Obsessions are intrusive, unwanted thoughts or urges that cause marked anxiety or distress. Individuals usually try to resist or neutralize them. In this case, the patient does not experience anxiety or feel the need to resist the thoughts, and they disappear after a seizure—this pattern is not typical of obsessions. B) Thought Crowding Thought crowding refers to an overwhelming number of thoughts occurring simultaneously, often seen in mania or psychosis. It involves disorganized, racing, and chaotic thought processes, which is not described here. The patient has a single, repetitive, intrusive theme rather than multiple simultaneous thoughts. D) Thought Insertion Thought insertion is a psychotic symptom, typically seen in schizophrenia, where the individual believes that external forces are placing thoughts into their mind. This patient does not report the thoughts as foreign or externally implanted, but rather experiences them as her own, though intrusive—hence, this is not thought insertion. Thus, the patient's symptom pattern—pre-ictal intrusive thought, no compulsion or anxiety, resolution post-seizure—is best explained by Forced Thinking.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Stupor Stupor is a state in which a person is apparently awake and alert (as indicated by open eyes and some awareness of the surroundings) but exhibits mutism (inability or refusal to speak) and akinesis (lack of voluntary movement). This condition is often associated with severe depression (e.g., depressive stupor), catatonia, or sometimes neurological conditions. Importantly, in stupor, the patient does not interact with the environment despite appearing conscious. The hallmark is the striking absence of movement or speech in someone who is not in a coma. Incorrect Options: B) Oneiroid This refers to a dream-like state with vivid hallucinations and fantasy-like experiences, typically seen in certain psychotic or dissociative disorders. The patient may appear confused or immersed in internal experiences but is not mute or akinetic in the classic sense seen in stupor. C) Twilight Twilight states are episodes of altered consciousness, often sudden in onset and termination, with clouding of consciousness and amnesia for the event. Commonly seen in epilepsy or dissociative states, these do not usually involve sustained mutism and akinesis while appearing alert. D) Delirium Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness, disorientation, and cognitive impairment. Patients are usually restless, agitated, or drowsy—not mute and motionless with preserved alertness. Therefore, mutism and akinesis in an apparently awake and alert person is best described as stupor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lithium Lithium is the only mood stabilizer with well-documented anti-suicidal properties. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown that lithium significantly reduces the risk of suicide and self-harm in patients with mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder and recurrent major depressive disorder. This anti-suicidal effect is independent of its mood-stabilizing and antidepressant effects, suggesting a unique benefit. Lithium is often preferred in patients with high suicide risk due to its ability to reduce both depressive episodes and suicidal behavior over the long term. Incorrect Options: B) Carbamazepine While effective as a mood stabilizer, especially in bipolar disorder with rapid cycling or mixed features, carbamazepine has no established anti-suicidal effects. It can stabilize mood but does not reduce suicide risk the way lithium does. C) Valproate Valproate is widely used for mania and mixed episodes in bipolar disorder but, like carbamazepine, lacks definitive evidence for anti-suicidal effects. It may help reduce mood episodes, but not specifically suicide risk. D) Lamotrigine Lamotrigine is more effective for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder and has a favorable side effect profile. However, no robust data support its role in reducing suicide risk, unlike lithium. Thus, lithium stands out as the mood stabilizer with clear, evidence-based anti-suicidal properties.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A, B and C In Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), the correct statements are: A. Repression and Reaction Formation are the defence mechanisms in this — ? True OCD is classically associated with the use of neurotic defense mechanisms, particularly reaction formation (where an individual behaves in a way opposite to their unacceptable impulses) and repression (unconscious exclusion of distressing thoughts). These help explain the conflict between intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and the behaviors (compulsions) used to neutralize them. B. Drug of choice is SSRI — ? True Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line pharmacological treatment for OCD. Examples include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and escitalopram. They are often used at higher doses and for a longer duration than in depression. C. Risperidone can be used as an augmenting agent — ? True In treatment-resistant OCD (when SSRIs alone are not effective), atypical antipsychotics like risperidone can be used as augmenting agents. This is especially effective in patients with comorbid tics or partial response to SSRIs. D. Systemic Desensitization is the psychotherapy of choice — ? False The psychotherapy of choice for OCD is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically a subtype called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Systemic desensitization is more appropriate for phobias and anxiety disorders, not OCD. Therefore, the correct statements are A, B, and C, making Option B the right answer. .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A and C are true A. Condition is Acute Stress Reaction — True The described scenario fits Acute Stress Reaction (ASR), which occurs in response to a sudden, overwhelming stressor such as a natural disaster (like an earthquake). It typically includes symptoms such as anxiety, fear, and emotional distress, beginning within minutes to hours after the event. The symptoms are usually short-lived and resolve with support and reassurance, as seen in this case. C. Fluoxetine is the treatment of choice — True (with caveats) While supportive psychotherapy and reassurance are first-line for Acute Stress Reaction, fluoxetine (an SSRI) may be considered if symptoms persist or evolve into Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or another anxiety disorder. So although not the immediate treatment of choice, it can be used if pharmacologic intervention becomes necessary. Therefore, it is acceptable in broader clinical reasoning. B. She doesn't need to consult a psychiatrist — False Even though her symptoms improved with support, psychiatric consultation may still be appropriate, especially to monitor for worsening or progression to PTSD. Declaring outright that she \"doesn't need\" to see a psychiatrist is incorrect, as follow-up is important in disaster survivors. D. Projection is the defence mechanism used — False Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to others. This defense mechanism is not characteristic of Acute Stress Reaction. Instead, more primitive defenses like denial or dissociation might be seen in severe stress reactions.",

In this case, the individual is under court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, and discrepancies between statements made to the doctor and in court strongly suggest that the person may be intentionally feigning symptoms to influence the legal outcome. This purposeful deception with a clear external gain is characteristic of malingering. Incorrect Options: B) Factitious Disorder In factitious disorder, the individual intentionally produces or feigns symptoms but without obvious external incentives. The primary motivation is to assume the sick role and gain attention or sympathy. Since the scenario involves a legal setting and possible manipulation of outcomes, factitious disorder is less likely. C) Antisocial Behavior Antisocial behavior refers to a pattern of disregard for the rights of others and may involve deceit or manipulation, but it is a broader personality disorder, not specifically related to feigning illness. While individuals with antisocial personality disorder may malinger, the term \"malingering\" directly addresses the intentional deception for gain, which is more specific to this case.

B) EOG (Electrooculogram) True component – EOG records eye movements, which is especially important for detecting REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. C) Pulse oximetry True component – Pulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation non-invasively and is vital for detecting sleep-related breathing disorders like sleep apnea. D) Intra-arterial O2 assessment Not a component – This is an invasive procedure that involves drawing arterial blood to measure oxygen levels, which is not routinely done during standard polysomnography. Instead, non-invasive methods like pulse oximetry are preferred for safety and practicality. Therefore, intra-arterial oxygen assessment is NOT a standard component of polysomnography.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hemoglobin The clinical presentation — sudden onset of intense anxiety (ghabraahat), palpitations, profuse sweating, and a sense of impending doom — is highly suggestive of a panic attack. However, since these symptoms can mimic several acute medical emergencies, it is critical to rule out organic causes first in an emergency setting. Tests that should be done: B) Blood Sugar Level To rule out hypoglycemia, which can present with anxiety-like symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, and confusion. C) ECG To rule out cardiac causes like arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, especially since palpitations and chest discomfort are common in both panic attacks and cardiac events. D) T3/T4/TSH To rule out thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism, which can cause symptoms that mimic anxiety or panic attacks (e.g., palpitations, restlessness, sweating). A) Hemoglobin — Not immediately necessary Hemoglobin levels are not acutely relevant in the context of evaluating a sudden-onset panic-like presentation unless there are specific signs suggesting anemia (like pallor, chronic fatigue, or breathlessness). Therefore, this test can be deferred in an acute emergency setting for this clinical picture. Conclusion: In an emergency evaluation of panic-like symptoms, hemoglobin testing is not essential, making Option A the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) May be seen in schizophrenia — False / Exception Explanation of Correct Answer: Obsessions are a hallmark feature of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and are defined as intrusive, unwanted, repetitive thoughts, urges, or images that cause marked anxiety or distress. They are typically: B) Ego-dystonic – True This means the thoughts are experienced as alien or inconsistent with the person’s self-concept or values, and the individual recognizes them as irrational or senseless but is unable to control them. C) Persists on resistance and causes depression and anxiety – True Despite attempts to resist or suppress the obsessions, they persist, often leading to intense distress, anxiety, or secondary depression. The more the person tries to stop them, the more distressing they become. D) Disorder of content of thought – True Obsessions fall under disorders of the content of thought, as they involve abnormal, repetitive intrusive ideas or themes, unlike disorders of the form of thought (like loosening of associations in schizophrenia). A) May be seen in schizophrenia – False / Exception While obsession-like symptoms may occasionally occur in schizophrenia, true obsessions, as seen in OCD, are rare in schizophrenia. In schizophrenia, intrusive thoughts are often ego-syntonic (accepted as part of the self), bizarre, or associated with delusions or hallucinations, rather than the classic ego-dystonic and anxiety-inducing obsessions of OCD. Final Answer: A) May be seen in schizophrenia – This is the exception and therefore the correct choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Haloperidol Explanation: This 30-year-old pregnant woman presents with mania (decreased sleep, hyperactivity, increased appetite) and a history of recurrent major depressive episodes, suggesting bipolar disorder. Treating acute mania in pregnancy requires special consideration due to potential teratogenic risks of various medications. Why Haloperidol is correct: Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic that is commonly used for acute management of mania, especially in pregnant patients, due to a more established safety profile in pregnancy compared to mood stabilizers. It does not carry the teratogenic risks associated with some other agents (e.g., lithium or valproate). It is effective in rapidly controlling agitation and psychotic symptoms. Incorrect Options: B) Lithium – Although lithium is effective for bipolar disorder and prevention of manic and depressive episodes, it is not recommended in the first trimester due to its association with Ebstein's anomaly (a rare cardiac defect). It may be used cautiously later in pregnancy under strict monitoring, but not first-line in acute mania during early pregnancy. C) Promethazine – This is an antihistamine with sedative properties, not an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer. It is not effective for treating mania. D) Clonazepam – A benzodiazepine, which may help with short-term agitation or sleep, but it is not a treatment for mania and carries risks in pregnancy, including potential neonatal withdrawal and floppy infant syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 12 months Explanation: In a patient with first-episode schizophrenia, maintenance antipsychotic treatment is essential even after symptom remission to prevent relapse. This 23-year-old patient has: A first episode of schizophrenia Been stable on risperidone for 2 months No family history (suggesting a possibly lower long-term risk) The minimum recommended duration of maintenance therapy after a first episode of schizophrenia is 12 months (1 year), as per major guidelines including APA and NICE. Why 12 months is correct: Even after remission, the risk of relapse remains high, particularly in the first year. Antipsychotic discontinuation earlier than 12 months is associated with significantly increased relapse rates. Long-term outcomes are better when treatment is continued for at least 1 year after remission. Why the other options are incorrect: A) 5 years – Too long as a minimum duration for a first episode without family history. Extended treatment may be needed in recurrent or high-risk patients, but not typically after a single episode. B) 6 months – Insufficient. Studies show that relapse rates are higher when antipsychotics are discontinued before 12 months after the first episode. C) 2 years – May be appropriate in patients with high risk of relapse, multiple episodes, or poor insight. However, it's not the minimum duration for all patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sodium bicarbonate Explanation: The clinical picture is highly suggestive of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, a life-threatening emergency. Here's why: History of antidepressant use Altered sensorium and hypotension ECG findings: Wide QRS complexes (>100 ms is dangerous) Right axis deviation These are classic signs of TCA toxicity (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine), which cause: Cardiac sodium channel blockade Leading to conduction delays → wide QRS Hypotension due to alpha-1 adrenergic blockade and myocardial depression CNS toxicity (e.g., delirium, seizures, coma) Why Sodium Bicarbonate is the correct answer: Sodium bicarbonate is the first-line antidote for TCA-induced cardiotoxicity. It: Alkalinizes the serum → reduces binding of TCAs to sodium channels Provides sodium → directly combats sodium channel blockade It helps narrow the QRS, improve blood pressure, and stabilize cardiac membranes. Why the other options are incorrect: B) Hemodialysis – Ineffective in TCA overdose because TCAs are highly protein-bound and lipophilic, making them poorly dialyzable. C) Fomepizole – Used for methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, not antidepressant overdose. D) Flumazenil – Benzodiazepine antidote. Not only ineffective in TCA overdose, but it may worsen seizures in mixed overdoses. Conclusion: The next best step in this case of suspected TCA overdose is Sodium bicarbonate, making Option A the correct answer.",

This is a common and serious issue in bipolar patients, where discontinuation or tapering of mood stabilizers often results in symptom recurrence. Why Psychoeducation is the Correct Answer: Psychoeducation involves educating the patient (and often their family) about: The nature of the illness Importance of medication adherence Warning signs of relapse Triggers and lifestyle modifications It empowers the patient to take an active role in their treatment. Has been proven to improve compliance, reduce relapse rates, and improve long-term outcomes in bipolar disorder. It is considered first-line adjunctive therapy in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Why the Other Options are Incorrect: B) CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) Useful in managing depressive symptoms and distorted thinking, but less effective alone for improving compliance in bipolar disorder. It is more beneficial after mood stabilization. C) Supportive Psychotherapy Offers emotional support, but it lacks the structured, educational component needed to address medication adherence specifically. D) Insight-oriented Psychotherapy Focuses on uncovering unconscious conflicts, which is not immediately helpful in improving compliance or understanding of the illness.",

It is effective in rapidly reversing acute dystonic reactions, including oculogyric crisis (inability to move eyes), neck stiffness, and muscle rigidity. It can be given intravenously for quick relief. Why the other options are incorrect: B) Haloperidol – This is the causative agent of EPS here, so continuing or increasing dose will worsen symptoms. C) Risperidone – Another antipsychotic that can also cause EPS. Not used to treat dystonia. D) Diazepam – A benzodiazepine that can help with agitation or muscle relaxation but is not the first-line treatment for acute dystonia.

The increased frequency and impact on daily life suggest a diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome or a chronic tic disorder. Why Risperidone is the best medication: Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with proven efficacy in reducing tic severity. It is commonly used as a first-line pharmacological treatment for moderate to severe tics and Tourette’s syndrome. It helps reduce the frequency and severity of both motor and vocal tics.

They typically involve fine, rapid shaking of the hands (\"the shakes\"). Tremors can be accompanied by other autonomic symptoms such as sweating, anxiety, and palpitations. Why the other options are less typical or later symptoms: A) Visual hallucinations Can occur but are less common and usually part of alcohol withdrawal hallucinosis, which is separate from delirium tremens. B) Sleep disturbance Common in alcohol withdrawal but nonspecific and less characteristic than tremors. D) Delirium (Delirium Tremens) A severe and life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal, but occurs later (48-72 hours after last drink), not a key early symptom.

Although Histrionic is usually a Cluster B personality disorder, shy and anxious avoidant traits point towards Cluster C, which includes Avoidant personality disorder and others characterized by anxiety and fearfulness.

The excessive sense of responsibility drives compulsions, as patients believe their actions (or inactions) could cause harm or negative outcomes. Why other options are less accurate: A) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Characterized by excessive worry about multiple life events but not specifically uncertainty or responsibility related to compulsions. C) Phobia Involves irrational fear of specific objects or situations, not a pervasive sense of responsibility or uncertainty. D) Personality Disorder Personality disorders may involve maladaptive traits but do not typically present with excessive uncertainty or compulsive responsibility.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) Explanation: The patient is presenting with compulsive hand-washing, a classic symptom of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Why Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the best treatment: ERP is a specific type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focused on gradually exposing patients to feared situations (e.g., germs) without allowing them to perform compulsive behaviors (e.g., washing hands). This therapy helps patients tolerate anxiety and learn that feared outcomes do not happen, thereby reducing compulsions. It has been shown to be highly effective and first-line psychological treatment for OCD. Why the other options are less ideal or incomplete: A) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) CBT is broad; ERP is a specialized, evidence-based form of CBT specifically for OCD. So ERP is more precise. C) Systematic Desensitization Used mainly for phobias by gradual exposure combined with relaxation, less effective for OCD compulsions. D) Pharmacological agents Useful adjuncts, especially SSRIs, but behavioral therapy (ERP) is considered first-line or combined approach.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Akathisia Explanation: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective symptoms, often seen in mood disorders, schizophrenia, and some medical conditions. Why Akathisia is not a feature of catatonia: Akathisia is a movement disorder marked by inner restlessness and an inability to stay still, typically a side effect of antipsychotic medications (especially first-generation ones). It is not considered a core feature of catatonia and represents a distinct clinical condition. Features commonly seen in catatonia (and why options B–D are correct): B) Ambitendency – Refers to inability to complete a voluntary action due to opposing movements (e.g., reaching out to shake hands, then withdrawing). Seen in catatonia as a form of psychomotor disturbance. C) Akinesia – A marked decrease in motor activity, can present as stupor or immobility, typical of catatonic patients. D) Agitation – Catatonia has both hypoactive and hyperactive forms. In the excited type, agitation and excessive motor activity are prominent. Conclusion: While catatonia includes symptoms like ambitendency, akinesia, and even agitation, akathisia is a drug-induced movement disorder, not a feature of catatonia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Self-exemption Explanation: The smoker acknowledges the harmful effects of smoking but justifies continuing the behavior by comparing himself favorably to others (e.g., \"I smoke less than others\" or \"I eat a good diet to balance it out\"). This is a classic example of self-exemption. Why Self-exemption is the correct term: Self-exemption is a cognitive distortion where a person believes that general risks or rules don’t apply to them personally. It allows individuals to reduce cognitive dissonance—the discomfort that arises from holding two conflicting beliefs (e.g., “Smoking is harmful” vs. “I continue to smoke”). Instead of changing the behavior (smoking), the person modifies their belief to justify the action. Why the other options are incorrect: B) Cognitive behavior A broad term encompassing thoughts influencing behavior; not specific to the justification mechanism described. C) Self-protection Involves strategies to defend self-esteem or avoid psychological harm, but not specifically about denying personal risk. D) Distortion Too general; \"cognitive distortion\" is a broader umbrella under which self-exemption falls.",

Why Diazepam and Thiamine are appropriate: A) Diazepam A long-acting benzodiazepine used as the first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal, including seizures and agitation. It prevents progression to delirium tremens (DTs) and reduces withdrawal severity. C) Thiamine (Vitamin B1) Alcoholics are at high risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency. Must be given before glucose to prevent precipitation of Wernicke’s. Standard in the management of alcohol withdrawal in chronic drinkers. Why the other options are incorrect: B) Naltrexone An opioid antagonist used for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence, not in acute withdrawal. Giving it during withdrawal can be harmful and worsen symptoms. D) Flupenthixol A typical antipsychotic, not indicated for managing acute alcohol withdrawal, especially seizures.

Why Option B is correct: In children, conversion disorder is more common in girls than boys, particularly around puberty. This gender difference is thought to be related to psychosocial and hormonal factors, as well as differences in emotional expression and coping strategies. The girl in this case displays a \"la belle indifférence\" (lack of concern about the symptoms), which is commonly seen in conversion disorder. Why other options are incorrect: A) Incidence in childhood is equal in both males and females Incorrect — there's a clear female preponderance in children, especially during adolescence. C) In adults, incidence more in males than females Incorrect — in adults, conversion disorder is also more common in females.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hyponatremia Explanation: Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are both anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers used in epilepsy and bipolar disorder. While they share some side effects, carbamazepine is generally associated with more serious adverse effects except for hyponatremia, which is more common with oxcarbazepine. Why Option C is correct: Hyponatremia (low sodium levels) occurs more frequently with oxcarbazepine than with carbamazepine. This is due to oxcarbazepine's stronger antidiuretic hormone-like effect, leading to SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). It's the one side effect that is actually more common in oxcarbazepine, not carbamazepine. Why the other options are incorrect (i.e., they are more common with carbamazepine): A) Rash More commonly seen with carbamazepine, including serious hypersensitivity reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome. B) Agranulocytosis A rare but serious hematologic side effect seen more with carbamazepine. Requires regular blood count monitoring. D) Visual side effects Carbamazepine may cause diplopia, blurred vision, and nystagmus, particularly during dose escalation. .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: A) A, B, C, D Explanation: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety, including during pregnancy. However, prenatal exposure to SSRIs can be associated with several neonatal and developmental risks, though most are low in absolute terms. Why all four options (A, B, C, D) are correct: A) ADHD Some epidemiological studies suggest a possible link between in utero SSRI exposure and an increased risk of ADHD, though confounding factors (like maternal depression) complicate the association. B) Low APGAR Score SSRIs, especially when used late in pregnancy, have been associated with neonatal adaptation syndrome, which can lead to low APGAR scores and signs of poor neonatal tone or respiratory effort. C) Delayed Motor Development Some studies indicate transient delays in early motor development in SSRI-exposed infants, although these may resolve over time and are not consistently reported across studies. D) Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) A well-established risk, especially with third-trimester exposure to SSRIs. The mechanism may involve serotonin’s role in pulmonary vasculature development.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase Explanation: Disulfiram is a drug used in the aversion therapy for alcohol dependence. It works by interfering with the metabolism of alcohol, leading to unpleasant effects if alcohol is consumed. The statement that it \"inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase\" is not true. Why Option A is incorrect (and thus the correct answer here): Disulfiram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase — not alcohol dehydrogenase. This causes the intermediate acetaldehyde (a toxic metabolite of alcohol) to accumulate, leading to symptoms like flushing, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and hypotension if alcohol is consumed. So, option A is false, making it the correct choice for the question asking what is not true. Why the other options are true: B) Causes accumulation of acetaldehyde True — This is the primary mechanism of disulfiram, leading to the disulfiram-ethanol reaction. C) Starting dose is 250 mg True — The typical starting dose of disulfiram is 250 mg once daily, which can be adjusted as needed. D) Not an anti-craving agent True — Disulfiram is not used to reduce craving or reward associated with alcohol. It works purely on the principle of negative reinforcement (deterrence).",

It reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms by partially stimulating nicotine receptors. Simultaneously, it blocks nicotine’s rewarding effects, making smoking less satisfying. Recommended for motivated individuals trying to quit smoking, especially with behavioral support.

It involves physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses and can be triggered by internal or external stimuli. Why Option A is correct: The description in Option A encompasses both the cognitive (e.g., worry about future events and consequences) and physiological/behavioral aspects (how the body responds). It aligns with widely accepted definitions such as that by the American Psychological Association, which defines stress as “the physiological or psychological response to internal or external stressors.” Why the other options are incorrect: B) Mental tension Too narrow. While stress can cause mental tension, the definition misses the physiological and situational components. C) External pressure Also incomplete. Stress may be triggered by external pressure, but it is defined by the individual's response, not the stimulus alone.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 5HT1a blockage helps in reducing positive symptoms and causes weight loss Explanation of Correct Option (C): 5HT1a (serotonin 1a) receptors are not primarily involved in the mechanism of action of antipsychotics for treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In fact, agonism (not blockage) at 5HT1a is sometimes associated with anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. Additionally, 5HT1a blockade is not associated with weight loss — weight gain is more commonly linked to 5HT2c and H1 histamine receptor antagonism. Thus, option C is incorrectly matched. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Blockage of D2 receptors in mesolimbic pathway helps in control of positive symptoms Correct. This is the primary mechanism by which typical and atypical antipsychotics reduce hallucinations and delusions (positive symptoms). B) 5HT2a blockage helps in control of negative symptoms Correct. Atypical antipsychotics (like risperidone, olanzapine) block 5HT2a receptors, which modulates dopamine release in various brain regions and may improve negative symptoms. D) Anticholinergic (M1 blockage) action helps to reduce extrapyramidal side effects Correct. M1 receptor antagonism can reduce EPS (e.g., parkinsonism, dystonia) by restoring dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the nigrostriatal pathway.",

Patients with OCD frequently experience depressive symptoms due to the chronic and distressing nature of their obsessions and compulsions. Why Option A is true: Depression occurs frequently alongside OCD, affecting up to 50% of patients at some point. The emotional burden and impairment caused by OCD contribute to the high rates of depression. Why the other options are false: B) Atypical antipsychotics is first line treatment False. The first-line treatment for OCD is SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) and/or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), especially exposure and response prevention (ERP). Atypical antipsychotics may be used only as augmentation in treatment-resistant cases. C) Prevalence is 7-10 percent in general population False. OCD prevalence is approximately 1-2%, not as high as 7-10%. D) Contamination is uncommon obsession False. Contamination fears are among the most common obsessions in OCD.",

Why Varenicline is most effective: It is a partial agonist at α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which: Reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Blocks the rewarding effects of nicotine, making smoking less pleasurable. Studies show it has higher quit rates compared to bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies. Why others are less efficacious: B) Bupropion An antidepressant with some efficacy in smoking cessation but generally less effective than varenicline. C) Nicotine gum A form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); helps reduce withdrawal but less effective than varenicline. D) Rimonabant A cannabinoid receptor antagonist that was once studied for smoking cessation but withdrawn due to psychiatric side effects and not recommended.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterograde amnesia with loss of recent memory Explanation: Korsakoff’s syndrome is a chronic neuropsychiatric condition typically resulting from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often associated with chronic alcoholism. Why Option A is true: Korsakoff’s syndrome is characterized primarily by anterograde amnesia, meaning the patient cannot form new memories (loss of recent memory). Patients have difficulty learning and retaining new information, while remote memories might be relatively preserved. This leads to severe memory impairment especially for recent events. Why other options are incorrect: B) Triad of acute confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia This describes Wernicke’s encephalopathy, the acute precursor to Korsakoff’s syndrome, not Korsakoff’s itself. C) Loss of identity memory and intact personality Korsakoff’s patients typically have memory deficits, but loss of identity memory (autobiographical memory) can be variable, and personality may be affected. D) Impairment of implicit memory and immediate recall Korsakoff’s syndrome mainly affects explicit (declarative) memory, particularly anterograde memory. Implicit memory and immediate recall are relatively spared.",

PTSD treatment primarily involves psychotherapy (like CBT, EMDR) and sometimes antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs). Antipsychotics like risperidone may be used cautiously in severe cases but are not routinely recommended or considered effective off-label agents. Why risperidone is used off-label in other conditions: A) Dementia Sometimes used to manage behavioral and psychotic symptoms, though with caution due to side effects. C) OCD Can be used as an augmenting agent to SSRIs in treatment-resistant OCD. D) Bipolar Approved and commonly used for mania and maintenance phases in bipolar disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Exposure & Response Prevention Explanation: For a patient with OCD symptoms, such as recurrent distressing thoughts about contamination and compulsive hand washing, the psychotherapy of choice is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Why ERP is the best choice: ERP involves gradual exposure to feared stimuli (e.g., dirt) without allowing the compulsive response (hand washing). It helps reduce anxiety and break the cycle of obsessions and compulsions. It is considered the most effective behavioral therapy for OCD. Other options explained: A) Systemic Desensitization Used primarily for phobias; it involves relaxation techniques paired with gradual exposure, but less effective for OCD. C) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) ERP is actually a type of CBT; however, general CBT without ERP is less effective for OCD.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Adjustment Disorder Explanation: The patient has experienced a recent identifiable stressor (job loss 1 week ago) followed by mood symptoms like irritability, sadness, and worry specifically related to the stressor. His ability to enjoy activities (e.g., going to the movies) intermittently suggests the mood disturbance is directly linked to the stressful event and not a pervasive depressive episode. Why Adjustment Disorder is the best fit: Symptoms develop within 3 months of a clear stressor. Emotional or behavioral symptoms are out of proportion to the stressor. Symptoms cause distress and impairment, but do not meet criteria for major depressive disorder or anxiety disorder. Symptoms improve when away from the stressor (e.g., he enjoys movies with friends). Why other options are less likely: A) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Characterized by excessive anxiety over 6 months and about multiple events, not just one recent stressor. C) Mixed anxiety with depression More chronic mood and anxiety symptoms, not clearly linked to a recent stressor. D) Moderate depression Would include pervasive low mood, anhedonia, and functional impairment that persists in various contexts, not just related to stressor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In some clinical scenarios, especially in the initial stages of differentiating between a new onset of cognitive impairment, disorientation and agitation might be the most prominent and immediately observable symptoms that point towards delirium, particularly in contrast to the more insidious and often less acutely agitated presentation of early Alzheimer's. Here's why, with a revised perspective, A might be considered correct: Disorientation: While memory impairment is central to dementia, in delirium, disorientation to place, time, and person can be profound and fluctuate rapidly, often more strikingly and acutely than in the typical progression of Alzheimer's dementia. A person with delirium might not recognize their surroundings or even close family members, which, if it's a sudden change, strongly suggests an acute confusional state rather than just dementia progression. Agitation: Agitation in delirium is often more acute, motoric, and less purposeful than the agitation seen in dementia. It can manifest as restlessness, picking at clothes, trying to get out of bed, or even aggressive behavior, often driven by the underlying acute brain dysfunction and perceptual disturbances (like hallucinations). While agitation certainly occurs in dementia, its sudden onset and association with other acute changes might be a key differentiator. In essence, if the question is looking for the most striking and acute symptoms that help a clinician immediately suspect delirium over a baseline of dementia, then the sudden worsening of disorientation and the new or significantly increased agitation become highly significant flags for delirium superimposed on dementia. Re-evaluating why other options might be less \"correct\" in this specific context (if A is the intended answer): C. Acute onset and level of consciousness: While medically the most definitive differentiator, perhaps the question intends to focus on readily observable symptoms rather than a broader diagnostic framework. \"Level of consciousness\" is a more clinical assessment, whereas \"disorientation and agitation\" are direct behavioral observations. If the question implicitly refers to the manifestations that prompt suspicion, then A could be argued as more direct. B. Visual hallucinations and impairment of memory: As previously discussed, both can occur in either condition, making them less specific for differentiation. Visual hallucinations are more common in delirium and certain dementias (like Lewy Body), and memory impairment is central to both but manifests differently. D. Agitation and irritation: \"Irritation\" is a less precise term than disorientation and agitation, and both are still quite general. \"Disorientation\" adds a crucial cognitive component that is very indicative of a confused state.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Childhood anxiety disorder Explanation: Selective mutism is a condition typically seen in children characterized by the inability to speak in specific social situations (like school) despite being able to speak normally in other settings (like home). It is strongly associated with anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety. Why this fits childhood anxiety disorder: Selective mutism is often considered an anxiety-related disorder. Children with selective mutism experience significant anxiety or fear that prevents them from speaking in particular situations. It is not due to speech or language problems, nor psychosis or hyperactivity. Why other options are less likely: A) Childhood depression Depression can cause withdrawal, but selective mutism is more specific to anxiety. B) Hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) Characterized by hyperactivity and inattention, not mutism. C) Childhood psychosis Would involve hallucinations, delusions, or thought disorder, not selective mutism.",

It's a type of nihilistic delusion but more specific and complex.

Hyponatremia is actually more commonly seen with oxcarbazepine than with carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine has a higher risk of causing SIADH leading to low sodium levels. Summary: Side effects more common with carbamazepine: Rashes, blood dyscrasias, visual disturbances. Side effect more common with oxcarbazepine: Hyponatremia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increase dose of lithium Explanation: During pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, the volume of distribution and renal clearance of lithium increase, leading to lower plasma lithium levels. This often necessitates increasing the dose to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent relapse. Stopping lithium abruptly or switching to valproate is not advisable during pregnancy due to risks to both mother and fetus. Valproate is teratogenic, especially in the first trimester, so switching is generally avoided. Close monitoring of lithium levels and fetal health is essential.",

Dysfunctional beliefs: Deeply held negative beliefs about oneself and the world, formed early in life and activated in stressful situations. B. Introjection, on the other hand, is a psychoanalytic concept (originating from Freud), referring to the unconscious adoption of the ideas or attitudes of others (e.g., internalizing the voice of a critical parent). It is not a component of Beck’s cognitive theory. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Introjection.",

It is non-confrontational, non-interpretive, and focused on support rather than insight. It is especially helpful in: Patients with acute crises (as in Option A) Patients with chronic psychiatric conditions and ego fragility (as in Option B) Patients with cognitive deficits or physical illness (as in Option D), where insight-oriented therapies may not be feasible.

Fine tremors are seen at therapeutic blood levels — True Fine hand tremors are a common and well-documented side effect of lithium even at therapeutic levels (0.6–1.2 mEq/L). These tremors are typically benign but may be distressing to patients. Propranolol is often used to treat lithium-induced tremors. B. Lithium is not absorbed from the gut — False Incorrect. Lithium is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It reaches peak plasma levels within 1–2 hours of oral administration. C. It doesn’t cause teratogenicity — False Incorrect. Lithium is teratogenic, particularly associated with Ebstein's anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect, when used during the first trimester of pregnancy. D. Approved drug for use in absence seizures — False Incorrect. Lithium is not used and not approved for absence seizures. In fact, lithium may lower the seizure threshold in some individuals.",

Why Trazodone causes priapism: Trazodone has alpha-1 adrenergic antagonistic activity. This leads to vasodilation and impaired venous outflow in the penis, resulting in prolonged erections (priapism). Though rare, it is a urological emergency and must be addressed quickly to avoid permanent damage. Other Options: Venlafaxine (SNRI): Not commonly associated with priapism.

While it is highly effective, it carries a risk of serious side effects, the most important and rare but potentially fatal being: Agranulocytosis Definition: A severe drop in white blood cells (particularly neutrophils), increasing risk of infections. Monitoring: Mandatory regular blood tests (WBC and ANC counts).Weekly for the first 6 months, biweekly for the next 6 months, and monthly thereafter if stable. Action: If WBC or ANC drops below a certain threshold, clozapine must be discontinued immediately. Other options: B. Myocarditis: Also a rare but serious side effect of clozapine, particularly in the first month of treatment. It should be monitored for, but agranulocytosis remains the most critical and routine monitoring is mandated. C. Intra-Cerebral Bleed: Not associated with clozapine. D.

What are Nihilistic Delusions? These are false beliefs involving nonexistence of self, body parts, or the external world. Most commonly seen in severe depression, especially psychotic depression. Often associated with Cotard's syndrome, a rare condition characterized by nihilistic delusions. Option Clarification: A. Paranoid – Involves beliefs of being persecuted or conspired against. C. Bizarre – Delusions that are clearly implausible (e.g., \"my thoughts are being beamed into outer space\"). While nihilistic delusions are strange, they are not necessarily categorized as bizarre in the technical psychiatric sense. D. Cotard – This is not a type of delusion, but a syndrome in which nihilistic delusions are the core symptom. So while Cotard's syndrome may describe the clinical picture, the specific type of delusion is nihilistic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Flumazenil is used for the management of long-term management of Alcohol Dependence syndrome. This statement is incorrect because Flumazenil is a drug used to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. It acts as an antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA-A receptor. It has no role in the long-term management of Alcohol Dependence Syndrome. Here's an explanation of why the other statements are correct: A. Opioid withdrawal is rarely fatal: While opioid withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable, it is not typically life-threatening. The main symptoms—nausea, vomiting, diarrhea—can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, but these are generally manageable and rarely result in death. B. Buprenorphine can be used for management of opioid withdrawal: Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist. It works by binding to the same receptors as other opioids, but it produces a weaker effect. This helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings without providing a full opioid high. It is a very effective medication for treating opioid use disorder. D. Cannabis withdrawal is associated with minimal withdrawal symptoms: Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are generally mild compared to other substances like opioids or alcohol. They may include irritability, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and decreased appetite, but these symptoms are usually not severe and do not pose a significant medical risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Alcohol in low dose is CNS excitatory and high dose is CNS depressant. This statement is true. Alcohol has a biphasic effect. In low doses, it can cause feelings of euphoria, disinhibition, and increased energy, acting as a CNS stimulant. However, as the dose increases, its primary depressant effect on the central nervous system becomes dominant, leading to impaired judgment, slurred speech, drowsiness, and, in high doses, respiratory depression, coma, or death.",
