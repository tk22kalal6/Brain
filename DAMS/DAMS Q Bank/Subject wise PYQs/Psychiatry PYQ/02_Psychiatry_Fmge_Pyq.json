      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)Auditory hallucinationAuditory hallucinations, particularly hearing voices, are classically associated with primary psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and severe depression with psychosis. While they can occur in some medical conditions (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy or drug-induced psychosis), they are not a hallmark of medical (organic) causes of mental illness. Therefore, this is not suggestive of a medical cause and more indicative of a functional (psychiatric) disorder.Incorrect Options:A. Elderly ageNew-onset psychiatric symptoms in the elderly are more likely due to organic causes like dementia, delirium, stroke, or metabolic disturbances. Age is an important clue in favor of a medical cause.B. Acute onsetSudden appearance of psychiatric symptoms suggests an organic cause, such as electrolyte imbalance, infection (e.g., UTI in elderly), intoxication, or withdrawal.C. Loss of consciousnessEpisodes involving altered or lost consciousness strongly point to neurological or medical issues (e.g., seizures, head injury, encephalopathy), not primary psychiatric illness.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Hemodialysis is not useful in lithium toxicityA: Hemodialysis is not useful in lithium toxicity – Incorrect statement (Correct Answer)This statement is incorrect and therefore the correct choice for this question. Hemodialysis is in fact very useful and often life-saving in lithium toxicity, especially in cases of severe toxicity (serum lithium > 4.0 mEq/L or lower levels with symptoms such as altered mental status, seizures, or renal failure).Lithium is a small molecule, not protein-bound, and is easily removed from the blood through dialysis. Therefore, this statement contradicts standard medical practice and is the incorrect one among the given options.Incorrect Options:Option B: Lithium decreases thyroid function Lithium inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and release, which can lead to hypothyroidism in long-term users. This is a well-known adverse effect of lithium therapy, especially in females.Option C: Thiazides increase lithium toxicity Thiazide diuretics reduce lithium excretion by increasing sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, where lithium is also reabsorbed. This leads to increased serum lithium levels and risk of toxicity, making this a true and important clinical consideration.Option D: Lithium is avoided in pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects Lithium use in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of Ebstein's anomaly, a congenital heart defect. Although the absolute risk is low, lithium is generally avoided or used with caution during pregnancy, especially in early gestation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)Concentration The serial sevens test (asking a patient to subtract 7 from 100 repeatedly) is a standard part of the Mental Status Examination (MSE). It primarily assesses the patient's concentration, which is the ability to sustain mental focus and carry out a task requiring continuous cognitive effort.Concentration involves working memory, attention span, and mental control — and serial subtraction directly tests this ability by requiring ongoing engagement in a mental operation. Errors or inability to perform this task may indicate impaired concentration due to psychiatric or neurological conditions (e.g., delirium, dementia, depression).Incorrect Options:Option A: ConfusionWhile a confused patient may struggle with serial subtraction, \"confusion\" is a broad clinical state, not a specific cognitive domain assessed by this task. Confusion could result from multiple cognitive deficits, including impaired memory, orientation, and attention — but this task is specific to concentration.Option B: Attention Although related, attention refers to the initial ability to notice and process information, while concentration is about sustaining that focus over time. Serial subtraction goes beyond mere attention; it requires sustained mental effort, making concentration the more accurate term.Option C: Orientation Orientation assesses a patient's awareness of time, place, and person. It’s tested by asking questions like “What day is it?” or “Where are you now?”. Serial sevens do not evaluate orientation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)A state of dreaminess with altered consciousnessCannabis (marijuana) primarily acts through CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and produces characteristic psychotropic effects. One of the most common and hallmark effects is a state of dreaminess or detachment from reality, often described as \"altered consciousness\" or a \"high.\"Users may experience euphoria, slowed time perception, vivid daydreams, and reduced motivation or energy, resembling a dreamy state. This is typical in moderate doses and is part of the cognitive and perceptual distortions cannabis induces.Incorrect Options:Option A: Depression While chronic cannabis use can be associated with amotivational syndrome or, in rare cases, mood disturbances, acute intake does not typically produce depression. Euphoria and relaxation are more common.Option B: Physical dependence Cannabis is not strongly associated with physical dependence. Psychological dependence may occur with chronic use, but withdrawal symptoms are mild, and there is minimal physical dependence compared to substances like opioids or alcohol.Option D: Anxiety Although cannabis can induce anxiety or even panic reactions in some individuals (especially in high doses or with THC-rich strains), this is not the most common or characteristic effect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) SchizophreniaThis case presents classic features of schizophrenia, a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal, and functional decline.The delusion that aliens are communicating via electromagnetic radiation and are giving him commands (asking him to kill relatives) is a non-bizarre, bizarre, persecutory and possibly referential delusion, typical of schizophrenia.The fact that the patient has been ill for over 20 years supports a chronic course—another key feature of schizophrenia.Stopping social activities and occupational decline points toward negative symptoms (social withdrawal, avolition).The patient being oriented to time, place, and person indicates intact cognition and rules out confusion or delirium.The delusions are systematized and bizarre, more than what would typically be seen in delusional disorder.Incorrect Options:A. Depression Depression can feature psychotic symptoms, but these are usually mood-congruent (e.g., delusions of guilt, poverty, worthlessness).This case has persecutory delusions unrelated to mood, making depression unlikely.B. Mania Mania typically involves elevated or irritable mood, increased activity, grandiosity, and decreased need for sleep.There is no evidence of elevated mood or manic behavior in this case.Also, chronic bizarre delusions over decades is not typical of mania.C. Delusional disorder In delusional disorder, delusions are non-bizarre and systematized, with preserved functioning and no marked disorganization or hallucinations.In this case, the delusions are bizarre, highly implausible (aliens, electromagnetic rays), and there is significant social dysfunction, all of which support schizophrenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)BupropionBupropion is the preferred antidepressant in patients who experience sexual dysfunction with other antidepressants, especially SSRIs or SNRIs. It acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and is not associated with significant sexual side effects—in fact, it may even improve libido in some cases.In this case, the patient is experiencing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, a common side effect of SSRIs like fluoxetine, sertraline, or escitalopram. Switching to bupropion can help maintain antidepressant efficacy while relieving sexual side effects.Incorrect OptionsA. Escitalopram Escitalopram is an SSRI, and like most SSRIs, it commonly causes sexual side effects (e.g., decreased libido, anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction).Switching to another SSRI would likely not improve the sexual dysfunction.B. Venlafaxine Venlafaxine is an SNRI, and it too is associated with sexual dysfunction, often comparable to SSRIs.It would not be a good alternative in this context.C. TCA (Tricyclic Antidepressants) TCAs, especially clomipramine, can also cause sexual dysfunction and have a worse side effect profile (e.g., anticholinergic effects, cardiac toxicity).They are not first-line drugs, especially in a sexually active patient concerned with these side effects.",

This dual action makes it particularly effective in smoking cessation.It is commonly prescribed for patients who are motivated to quit smoking, and clinical trials have shown it to be more effective than both bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy when used appropriately.Incorrect Options :B. Naloxone Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist used in acute opioid overdose, not for nicotine or tobacco addiction.C. Naltrexone Naltrexone is used for alcohol and opioid dependence but not effective for nicotine addiction.D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)LithiumLithium should be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, because of its teratogenic potential. The most serious risk is Ebstein's anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect affecting the tricuspid valve of the fetus. Lithium crosses the placenta freely and its use during organogenesis (first trimester) is strongly associated with this cardiac malformation.Although lithium may sometimes be used in pregnancy under strict supervision if the benefits outweigh the risks (particularly in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder), it is generally avoided during early pregnancy, making it the correct choice for the drug to be avoided in a pregnant bipolar patient.Incorrect Options: B. Lamotrigine Lamotrigine is one of the safest mood stabilizers in pregnancy. It has no significant teratogenic risk and is preferred in pregnant women with bipolar disorder. However, dosing adjustments are often needed due to altered metabolism during pregnancy.C. Risperidone Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that has no strong evidence of teratogenicity. It is sometimes used cautiously in pregnancy when required for symptom control, although it is not the first-line mood stabilizer.D. Haloperidol Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic and is considered relatively safe in pregnancy, especially if antipsychotic treatment is essential.

Bipolar Disorder In bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms (like delusions) occur only during mood episodes (mania or depression).Since there is no mention of any mood disturbance, bipolar disorder is unlikely here.D. Xenophobia Xenophobia is not a psychiatric diagnosis, but rather a strong dislike or fear of foreigners.It does not explain persecutory delusions or involve psychotic features.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)VenlafaxineVenlafaxine is a Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI). It works by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain, thereby improving mood and relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety.It is commonly prescribed for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder, especially when somatic symptoms (like fatigue, poor concentration) are present — which can often accompany depression in middle-aged individuals experiencing loneliness or anxiety.Incorrect Options:A. Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI), not an SNRI.It only acts on serotonin, not norepinephrine.C. Phenelzine Phenelzine is a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI), not commonly used first-line due to dietary restrictions and drug interactions.It is reserved for treatment-resistant depression, not typically used initially.D.

Methylcobalamin 1500 IV Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) is used in B12 deficiency causing peripheral neuropathy or megaloblastic anemia.It does not treat Wernicke's encephalopathy or acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms.C. Methylmalonyl + Lorazepam Methylmalonyl is related to B12 metabolism but has no role in acute management.Lorazepam (a benzodiazepine) can help with alcohol withdrawal symptoms (e.g. seizures), but thiamine remains the priority in Wernicke’s encephalopathy.D.

It typically occurs 48–72 hours after the last drink in chronic alcoholics and presents with the following hallmark features:Visual hallucinations (most common type in DT)Disorientation and confusionAgitation and tremorsAutonomic hyperactivity — such as tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and feverGiven that the patient:Is a chronic alcoholic,Had last alcohol intake 2 days back, and Is experiencing visual hallucinations and disorientation,This fits Delirium Tremens best.Incorrect Options:A. Alcohol withdrawal seizures These usually occur within 6–24 hours after cessation of alcohol.Characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizures without confusion or hallucinations.In this case, it's been 48 hours, and there’s disorientation + hallucination, not seizures.C. Alcoholic hallucinosis Occurs within 12–48 hours after alcohol cessation.Involves hallucinations only (typically auditory), without confusion or altered consciousness.This patient has disorientation, which rules out alcoholic hallucinosis.D. Schizophrenia Schizophrenia involves chronic psychosis, typically with auditory hallucinations and delusions.It does not present acutely in this withdrawal context.Visual hallucinations are not characteristic of schizophrenia.",

These beliefs are not based on reality and are resistant to contrary evidence.In this case, the 21-year-old girl believes:The principal is conspiring against her,Other teachers and students are involved, andThe goal is to fail her in exams.This strongly suggests persecutory delusions, where she feels targeted or victimized without any logical basis — a classic example of delusion of persecution.Incorrect Options:B. Delusion of reference This is the false belief that ordinary events, objects, or behaviors of others have special meaning or relevance to oneself.Example: Thinking a TV newsreader is sending hidden messages directed at them.In this case, the girl is not misinterpreting neutral events — she believes people are plotting against her, which is persecutory, not referential.C. Delusion of infidelityAlso known as Othello syndrome, it's a false belief that one's partner is unfaithful, despite no evidence.This is not applicable here since there’s no mention of a romantic partner or infidelity.D.

Long-term treatment would focus on SSRIs and psychotherapy (like CBT), but benzodiazepines are the best immediate next step in the emergency setting.Incorrect Options:A. Admit for detailed investigation She has already undergone investigations multiple times with normal results.Repeating tests or hospitalizing may reinforce her somatic focus and is not warranted unless new findings emerge.B. Start counselling sessions While counseling and CBT are very important, they are not immediate symptom relievers.This should follow once acute distress is controlled, but not the first emergency action.D.

They are more likely to model behavior seen in peers, family members, or even fictional characters (e.g., seen in movies, shows, or news).In recent years, media exposure (like viral news stories, TV series, and social media content) has contributed significantly to the risk of suicide contagion in children, leading to copycat behavior.Incorrect Options:A. AdolescenceAdolescents are also at risk for suicide, but copycat suicide is more specifically observed in younger children who tend to mimic without fully understanding the permanence or consequences of death.C. Adult ageAdults may commit suicide due to psychosocial stressors or mental illness but are less likely to do so purely due to imitation.D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Aversion therapyDisulfiram is used in the treatment of alcohol dependence as part of aversion therapy. It works by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde, a byproduct of alcohol metabolism.When a person on disulfiram consumes alcohol, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body, causing unpleasant symptoms such as:FlushingHeadacheNausea and vomitingPalpitationsHypotensionThese symptoms act as a negative reinforcement, discouraging the individual from consuming alcohol again — a classic principle of aversion therapy, where an undesirable behavior (drinking alcohol) is paired with an unpleasant stimulus (acetaldehyde reaction).Disulfiram is not used to reduce cravings or manage withdrawal symptoms. It is most effective in motivated individuals who are abstinent and wish to remain so, often under supervision.Incorrect Options:B. Anti-craving therapyDisulfiram does not reduce cravings for alcohol. Drugs like naltrexone, acamprosate, and baclofen are used as anti-craving agents.C. Maintenance therapyMaintenance therapy involves using medications to support long-term abstinence, typically by controlling cravings (e.g., acamprosate) or reducing euphoric effects of alcohol (naltrexone), not causing aversion.D. Alcohol withdrawal therapyDisulfiram is not used during alcohol withdrawal, as it does not manage withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines are the primary drugs used for managing alcohol withdrawal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)Alcohol withdrawal deliriumThe clinical presentation in this case—sensation of insects crawling on the body (formication), agitation, irritability, and a history of chronic alcohol use with last intake 3 days ago—is classic for Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (Delirium Tremens, or DTs). DTs usually occur 48–72 hours after the last alcohol intake and is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., tachycardia, hypertension), confusion, disorientation, agitation, hallucinations (especially visual or tactile like insects crawling on the skin), and sometimes seizures. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate intervention with benzodiazepines and supportive care.Incorrect OptionsA: Alcohol intoxication Alcohol intoxication presents with slurred speech, impaired coordination, unsteady gait, disinhibition, and sometimes respiratory depression depending on the dose. It does not occur days after stopping alcohol, nor is it characterized by hallucinations or agitation following abstinence. Therefore, this does not match the clinical picture.C: Tolerance Tolerance refers to a condition where increasing amounts of alcohol are needed to achieve the same effect due to neuroadaptation. It is a long-term physiological adaptation, not an acute withdrawal syndrome. The patient's acute symptoms are better explained by withdrawal rather than tolerance.D: Reaction with alcohol This typically refers to disulfiram-like reactions (e.g., flushing, nausea, hypotension) that occur when alcohol is consumed alongside certain drugs (e.g., metronidazole, disulfiram).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)IV ThiamineThe triad of ophthalmoplegia or diplopia (eye problems), ataxia (difficulty walking), and confusion in a patient with a history of chronic alcohol use is classic for Wernicke’s encephalopathy. This condition is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which is common in alcoholics due to poor nutritional intake and impaired absorption.The initial treatment of choice is IV thiamine, because immediate administration can reverse or halt the progression of neurological symptoms and prevent the development of Korsakoff syndrome, an irreversible chronic memory disorder. IV thiamine must always be given before glucose, because giving glucose before correcting thiamine levels can worsen or precipitate Wernicke’s encephalopathy.Incorrect Options:A: IV Lorazepam Lorazepam is used in alcohol withdrawal, particularly to prevent or treat seizures and delirium tremens, but it is not the first step in treating Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which this patient most likely has.C: IV fluid + dextrose Giving dextrose before thiamine can actually precipitate or worsen Wernicke’s encephalopathy by increasing metabolic demand for thiamine. Therefore, thiamine must always be administered first, especially in suspected alcoholics.D: Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause neurological symptoms, but they are typically subacute and include peripheral neuropathy, megaloblastic anemia, and posterior column signs (like impaired vibration sense), not acute confusion, diplopia, or ataxia. Vitamin B12 is not the initial or primary treatment in this scenario.",

According to Sigmund Freud's psychosexual stages of development, the anal stage, occurring roughly between 1 and 3 years of age, is centered on bowel and bladder control and the associated struggles with authority and independence. Fixation during this stage, particularly due to overly strict or punitive toilet training, can lead to the development of an \"anal-retentive\" personality. Individuals with this type of fixation often exhibit traits such as excessive orderliness, compulsiveness, stubbornness, and frugality, matching the patient's description of being \"obsessed with particular things,\" \"stubborn,\" and \"frugal.\"",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A pseudohallucination is a perceptual experience that is vivid, clear, and distinct, yet is perceived as occurring within the individual's subjective inner space (e.g., \"in my head,\" \"behind my eyes\") rather than in the external world. Crucially, the individual experiencing a pseudohallucination usually maintains insight, meaning they understand that the perception is not externally real. Given these defining characteristics, Outer objective space (Option B) is not a feature of a pseudohallucination. Perception in outer objective space is, by definition, a characteristic of a true hallucination, where the individual perceives something as being externally real and objective. Not vivid (Option A) is incorrect as a feature of pseudohallucination. Pseudohallucinations are consistently described as vivid and clear, similar in quality to a normal perception. If they were truly \"not vivid,\" they would likely be indistinguishable from intrusive thoughts or imagination. Therefore, stating that they are \"not vivid\" is actually a false characteristic of pseudohallucinations. Not in voluntary control (Option C) is a correct feature of pseudohallucinations. Like true hallucinations, pseudohallucinations are involuntary; they cannot be willed into existence or easily dismissed at will. This distinguishes them from intentional mental imagery or imagination. Can occur with a stimulus (Option D) refers to the context in which pseudohallucinations might manifest. While they are not direct misinterpretations of an existing external stimulus (which would be an illusion), they can sometimes be influenced or triggered by internal states (e.g., strong emotions, stress, specific brain states like hypnagogic sleep transitions) or even certain external circumstances. While not a primary defining feature as much as the locus of perception or insight, it doesn't fundamentally contradict the nature of pseudohallucinations.",

Lithium is well-known for common side effects such as hypothyroidism (affecting the thyroid gland), tremors (involuntary shaking), and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (leading to excessive thirst and urination).

In contrast, tardive dyskinesia, characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, is a neurological side effect primarily associated with prolonged use of antipsychotic medications, particularly older generations.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The clinical presentation of drowsiness, ataxia, and blurred vision, especially in the context of consuming alcohol from a \"local liquor shop,\" strongly suggests poisoning with a toxic alcohol, most commonly methanol or ethylene glycol, rather than ethanol intoxication alone. These toxic alcohols are often found in illicit or counterfeit alcohol due to improper distillation or intentional adulteration. For such poisonings, Ethyl Alcohol (Ethanol) (Option C) is the antidote. Ethanol works by competitively inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the enzyme responsible for metabolizing methanol and ethylene glycol into their toxic metabolites (formic acid from methanol, and oxalic acid/glycolic acid from ethylene glycol). By saturating ADH with ethanol, the formation of these highly toxic metabolites is prevented, allowing the parent toxic alcohol to be excreted unchanged by the kidneys, thus mitigating the severe metabolic acidosis, organ damage (e.g., blindness from methanol, kidney failure from ethylene glycol), and neurological effects. Fomepizole is another, more specific, antidote that also inhibits ADH, but if not available, ethanol is used. Incorrect Options: Flumazenil (Option A) is incorrect. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with benzodiazepine overdose, and flumazenil would have no effect on toxic alcohol poisoning. Diazepam (Option B) is incorrect. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal. While it might be used to manage seizures if they occur due to toxic alcohol poisoning, it is not an antidote to the poisoning itself and would worsen the central nervous system depression. Naltrexone (Option D) is incorrect. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid dependence and alcohol use disorder. It works by blocking the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids and reducing alcohol cravings. It has no role as an antidote for acute toxic alcohol poisoning.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic known for having the least risk of weight gain among its class. It has a relatively favorable metabolic profile compared to other antipsychotics. This makes it a preferred choice in patients where minimizing weight gain and metabolic side effects is important, such as in long-term treatment of bipolar disorder (which includes both manic and depressive episodes). Option A: Risperidone – Incorrect Risperidone is associated with moderate weight gain and metabolic side effects, especially with long-term use. While it is effective in mood stabilization, it is not the best choice when weight gain is a concern. Option B: Quetiapine – Incorrect Quetiapine is another atypical antipsychotic often used for bipolar disorder, but it is commonly associated with weight gain and metabolic syndrome, particularly with prolonged use. Therefore, it is not ideal in patients where weight is a concern. Option D: Chlorpromazine – Incorrect Chlorpromazine is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic, and it is well-known to cause significant weight gain as well as sedation. It also has many other side effects such as anticholinergic effects and extrapyramidal symptoms, making it less favorable in most modern psychiatric management plans.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A delusion of influence is a type of psychotic delusion in which a person believes that their thoughts, feelings, or actions are being controlled by an external force or agency. This is commonly seen in schizophrenia. The patient might feel that their thoughts are not their own or that someone is inserting, withdrawing, or broadcasting them. In this case, the belief that his thoughts and feelings are controlled by some external agency fits this definition precisely. Option A: Nihilistic delusion – Incorrect A nihilistic delusion involves the false belief that oneself, others, or the world no longer exists or has been destroyed. It is often seen in severe depression or psychotic disorders, but it does not involve control by an external agency, making it an incorrect choice here. Option C: Delusion of persecution – Incorrect A delusion of persecution refers to the false belief that one is being plotted against, harassed, or targeted by others. While it can co-exist with delusions of influence, the key theme here is external control over thoughts and feelings, not being targeted or harmed, so this is not the best match. Option D: Othello syndrome – Incorrect Othello syndrome is a delusional jealousy, where the person is irrationally convinced that their partner is being unfaithful. It is a specific type of delusional disorder and has no relevance to the theme of thought control by an external force.",

This term describes a paradoxical lack of concern or unbothered attitude a patient displays regarding a significant physical symptom for which no organic cause can be found. In this case, the lady's inability to speak after a stressful event (fight with husband), coupled with normal neurological examinations and her lack of concern about her condition, strongly aligns with \"la belle indifference\" as a key feature of Conversion Disorder.
