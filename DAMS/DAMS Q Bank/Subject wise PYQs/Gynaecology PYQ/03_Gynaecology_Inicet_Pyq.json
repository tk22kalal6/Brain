      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tubal ligation. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods are highly effective forms of birth control that, once administered, can prevent pregnancy for an extended period without requiring daily, weekly, or monthly action from the user. They are also reversible, meaning fertility can return after removal. Tubal ligation, while a highly effective and long-term birth control method, is considered a permanent sterilization procedure rather than a reversible one. It involves surgically blocking or severing the fallopian tubes, making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reverse and regain fertility. Therefore, it does not fit the \"reversible\" criterion of LARC. Implants (A) are a type of LARC. These are small, flexible rods inserted under the skin of the upper arm that release hormones to prevent pregnancy for up to three to five years. They are easily removable, and fertility quickly returns. IUDs (B), or intrauterine devices, are also a type of LARC. These small devices are inserted into the uterus and can prevent pregnancy for three to ten years, depending on the type (hormonal or copper). They are highly effective and can be removed at any time, with fertility returning promptly. Injectable contraception (D), such as Depo-Provera, is not considered a LARC. While it provides contraception for a longer period than daily pills (typically three months per injection), it requires repeat injections at regular intervals to maintain effectiveness. The \"long-acting\" aspect of LARC generally refers to methods that last for at least a year without further user action, which injectables do not meet.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 14-year-old with Tanner Stage 1 breast development. Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstruation by a certain age, often in conjunction with the presence or absence of secondary sexual characteristics. There are two key criteria for diagnosing primary amenorrhea: Absence of any secondary sexual characteristics (like breast development) by age 13. Absence of menarche by age 15, even with normal secondary sexual characteristics. Absence of menarche within 3 years of thelarche (onset of breast development, typically Tanner Stage 2). In option A, a 14-year-old with Tanner Stage 1 breast development (meaning no breast development) clearly meets the criteria for primary amenorrhea. At 14, a girl should have started puberty (Tanner Stage 2 breast development is the first sign) and likely menarche, or at the very least, have clear signs of pubertal progression. The complete absence of breast development at this age is a significant red flag. B. 13-year-old with Tanner Stage 5 breast development: Tanner Stage 5 breast development indicates full adult breast development. While menarche typically occurs around Tanner Stage 4, it's possible for a girl to have reached Tanner Stage 5 without having had her first period yet, especially if she is only 13. However, given the advanced breast development, it's less likely to be classified as primary amenorrhea based on the lack of any secondary sexual characteristics. The more immediate concern would be if she hasn't had menarche within 3 years of her initial breast development. If her breast development started very early, say at 8 or 9, then at 13 without menarche, it might meet the 3-year criterion for primary amenorrhea, but simply Tanner Stage 5 at 13 doesn't automatically classify it. C. 12-year-old with Tanner Stage 4 breast development: Similar to option B, Tanner Stage 4 breast development indicates significant pubertal progression. Menarche commonly occurs around this stage. At 12, a girl with such advanced breast development is well within the typical range for puberty and would be expected to have menarche soon, if not already. This scenario does not meet the criteria for primary amenorrhea. D. 11-year-old with Tanner Stage 1 breast development: While Tanner Stage 1 means no breast development, an 11-year-old is still within the normal age range for the onset of puberty. Puberty can begin anywhere from 8 to 13 years old. Therefore, at 11, the lack of breast development alone isn't immediately indicative of primary amenorrhea as she may still enter puberty at a typical time. This would only become a concern if she remains in Tanner Stage 1 past age 13.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Clear cell cancer of the vagina. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women between 1940 and 1971 to prevent complications such as miscarriage and premature birth. It was later discovered that in utero exposure to DES (meaning exposure while the female fetus was in the womb) significantly increased the risk of developing a rare type of vaginal and cervical cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma in these \"DES daughters.\" This cancer typically presented when the DES daughters were in their teens or early twenties, although cases have been reported in older women as well. The link between DES and clear cell adenocarcinoma is one of the most well-known examples of a transplacental carcinogen. A. Sarcoma botryoides: This is a rare, aggressive type of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, primarily affecting the vagina, bladder, or cervix, most commonly seen in infants and young children. It presents as a \"grape-like\" mass. Its occurrence is not linked to DES exposure. B. Squamous cell cancer of the vagina: Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of vaginal cancer, but its primary risk factor is human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly high-risk types of HPV. While DES daughters may have some structural abnormalities of the vagina, squamous cell cancer is not specifically caused by DES. C. Paget's disease of the vagina: Paget's disease of the vulva (or vagina, though less common) is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma that presents as a red, itchy, eczematous lesion. Its exact cause is not fully understood, but it is not directly linked to DES exposure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A, B, C, D. Dilation and curettage (D&C) is a common gynecological procedure involving the dilation (opening) of the cervix and the curettage (scraping) of the uterine lining. The sequence of steps is crucial for the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. A. Assess uterus direction and size: This is the initial and critical step. Before any instruments are inserted into the uterus, the physician must carefully perform a bimanual pelvic examination to determine the position (ante-flexed, retro-flexed) and approximate size of the uterus. This assessment helps to guide the subsequent insertion of instruments, reducing the risk of uterine perforation. B. Uterine sound: After assessing the uterus, a uterine sound (a long, thin, malleable instrument with markings) is gently inserted through the cervix into the uterine cavity. This step precisely measures the depth of the uterine cavity, confirming the earlier bimanual assessment and providing essential information for the safe use of other instruments, particularly the curette. It also helps to confirm the uterine direction. C. Serial dilatation: Once the uterine depth and direction are confirmed, the cervix needs to be gradually opened to allow the passage of the curette. This is achieved by using a series of progressively larger dilators, inserted gently one after another until the desired degree of cervical dilation is achieved. This step is critical to prevent cervical trauma. D. Curettage: With the cervix adequately dilated, the curette (a spoon-shaped instrument with a sharp or blunt edge) is then inserted into the uterine cavity. The uterine lining is gently and systematically scraped to remove tissue, which might be for diagnostic purposes (e.g., endometrial biopsy for abnormal bleeding) or therapeutic purposes (e.g., evacuation of retained products of conception after a miscarriage). The other options are incorrect because they present an incomplete or incorrect sequence of these essential steps. B. A and B: This option only includes the initial assessment and sounding, omitting the crucial steps of dilation and curettage necessary to complete the procedure. C. A, C and D: This option omits the use of the uterine sound (B). While one might argue that careful assessment can provide some information, the uterine sound provides a precise, objective measurement of uterine depth, which is vital before proceeding with dilation and curettage to prevent perforation. D. B and D: This option skips the initial uterine assessment (A) and serial dilation (C), making the procedure unsafe. Inserting a uterine sound or curette without prior assessment and adequate dilation significantly increases the risk of uterine perforation and cervical trauma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) L1. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are designed to prevent infection by specific types of HPV that cause various cancers (like cervical, anal, and throat cancers) and genital warts. These vaccines are made using a specific protein from the HPV virus. L1 (Major Capsid Protein): The HPV vaccines are made from virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs are formed by the self-assembly of the L1 major capsid protein of the HPV virus. The L1 protein is the main structural protein that makes up the outer shell (capsid) of the virus. When this protein is produced in a lab (using recombinant DNA technology, often in yeast cells), it can spontaneously assemble into a structure that looks like the actual virus but contains no viral genetic material. This means the VLPs are non-infectious and cannot cause disease. However, they are highly immunogenic, meaning they effectively trigger the body's immune system to produce antibodies against HPV. These antibodies can then neutralize real HPV viruses if a person is exposed to them in the future, providing protection against infection. A. E6: E6 is an early protein of the HPV virus. In high-risk HPV types, E6 (along with E7) plays a crucial role in the development of cancer by interfering with host cell growth regulatory pathways (e.g., targeting p53 for degradation). While E6 is important for viral replication and oncogenesis, it is not used to make the prophylactic vaccines because including it could potentially carry oncogenic risks or not elicit the necessary protective neutralizing antibodies. B. E7: Similar to E6, E7 is also an early protein involved in HPV-related cancer development. It primarily targets the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), another key cell cycle regulator. For the same reasons as E6, E7 is not used in prophylactic HPV vaccines. However, these oncoproteins are being explored in the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines, which aim to treat existing HPV infections or HPV-related cancers by eliciting a cellular immune response against infected cells. D. E1: E1 is an early protein of the HPV virus that functions as a helicase, essential for viral DNA replication. While vital for the virus's life cycle, it is not the structural protein that forms the viral capsid and elicits the protective neutralizing antibody response needed for a prophylactic vaccine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 65-85. Vulval cancer is predominantly a disease of older women. The incidence of vulval cancer significantly increases with age, with the majority of cases diagnosed in postmenopausal women. A. 65-85: This age range accurately represents the demographic where vulval cancer is most commonly diagnosed. Studies consistently show that the average or median age at diagnosis for vulval cancer is around 70 years old. More than half of all cases occur in women over 70, and a significant percentage are diagnosed in women aged 65 and above. For instance, some data indicates that over 4 in 10 new cases (42%) are in females aged 75 and over in the UK, and in the US, the majority of cases fall within the 70-84 age group. B. 35-55: While vulval cancer can occur in younger women, especially those with certain risk factors like HPV infection, it is far less common in this age group compared to older women. This range represents a much smaller proportion of total vulval cancer cases. C. Below 18: Vulval cancer is extremely rare in individuals under the age of 18. This age group accounts for a negligible percentage of diagnoses. D. None: Since option A accurately identifies the most common age group, \"None\" is incorrect. It's important to note that while age is a significant risk factor, other factors like HPV infection, smoking, a weakened immune system, and certain chronic inflammatory vulvar conditions (e.g., lichen sclerosus) also contribute to the risk, and some types of vulval cancer are more associated with younger women and HPV. However, when considering the overall most common age group, it is definitively in older age.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vulvar hamartoma. Vulvar cancer is a relatively rare cancer, but several well-established risk factors contribute to its development. A vulvar hamartoma is a benign (non-cancerous) growth consisting of a disorganized but mature mixture of tissues normally found in the vulva. It is a developmental anomaly and does not carry an increased risk of malignancy or progression to cancer. Therefore, it is not considered a risk factor for vulvar cancer. A. Vulvar dystrophy (specifically chronic inflammatory conditions like Lichen Sclerosus): Vulvar dystrophies, particularly chronic inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus and lichen planus, are significant risk factors for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of vulvar cancer. These conditions cause chronic inflammation, itching, thinning, and scarring of the vulvar skin, which can lead to cellular changes over time, increasing the risk of malignant transformation. B. Smoking: Smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for various cancers, including vulvar cancer. Carcinogens in tobacco smoke can directly damage DNA and impair the immune system's ability to clear HPV infections, thereby increasing the risk of HPV-associated vulvar cancers. Even for non-HPV related vulvar cancers, smoking can contribute to chronic inflammation and cellular changes that predispose to malignancy. D. HPV (Human Papillomavirus): Infection with high-risk types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV 16 and 18, is a major risk factor for vulvar cancer, especially in younger women. HPV infection can lead to precancerous lesions known as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), which, if left untreated, can progress to invasive vulvar cancer. A significant proportion of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas are associated with HPV infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HIV and STDs. Oral contraceptives (OCs), while highly effective for preventing pregnancy and offering several non-contraceptive health benefits, provide absolutely no protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. They do not create a physical barrier to prevent the transmission of viruses or bacteria during sexual contact. Therefore, individuals using OCs still need to use barrier methods like condoms to protect themselves from STIs. B. Endometrial cancer: Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), which contain both estrogen and progestin, significantly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. The progestin component of COCs helps to thin the endometrial lining, counteracting the proliferative effects of estrogen and thereby reducing the risk of abnormal cell growth that could lead to cancer. The protective effect increases with the duration of COC use and persists for many years after discontinuation. C. Ovarian cancer: COCs also provide substantial protection against ovarian cancer. The mechanism is thought to involve the suppression of ovulation; by reducing the number of ovulations over a woman's lifetime, OCs decrease the number of times the ovarian surface epithelium is disrupted, which is believed to be a contributing factor to ovarian cancer development. Like endometrial cancer, the protective effect increases with duration of use and can last for decades after stopping the pill. D. Ectopic pregnancy: While OCs do not treat an ectopic pregnancy, they significantly reduce the risk of developing one. Since OCs work primarily by preventing ovulation, they drastically lower the chance of fertilization occurring. If fertilization does not occur, then an ectopic pregnancy (where a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube) cannot happen. By effectively preventing pregnancy altogether, they inherently reduce the risk of all types of pregnancy, including ectopic ones.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). What happens hormonally? • DHT levels fall, but testosterone levels may increase slightly due to reduced feedback from DHT. • Testosterone still provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary. • As a result, LH and FSH may slightly reduce or remain unchanged - they do not increase. So, among the options, A is the best fit, though in reality, changes in LH/FSH are usually mild and variable.",

In adolescents with PCOS, the first-line management includes: • Lifestyle modification, especially weight reduction in overweight or obese individuals. This helps improve insulin sensitivity, reduce androgen levels, and regulate cycles. • Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are also first-line. They help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen production, and improve acne and hirsutism. • Spironolactone is an anti-androgen and is used to treat hirsutism, but only after OCPs have been tried for at least 6 months. It’s not the very first step but still considered part of first-line pharmacologic options in adolescents. • Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) is not first-line treatment, especially in adolescents. It is invasive and generally reserved for women wit",

A) Causes endometrial thinning Clomiphene acts as an anti-estrogen at the endometrial level, leading to thinning of the endometrium in some women, which may impair implantation. B) Causes monofollicular development This is the incorrect statement, hence the correct answer. • Clomiphene can lead to the development of multiple follicles, not just one. • Multiple ovulations can occur, increasing the risk of multiple gestation (twins ~5-10%). C) Inhibits negative feedback on GnRH Clomiphene blocks estrogen receptors at the hypothalamus, preventing negative feedback. This leads to increased GnRH, which stimulates FSH and LH release, promoting follicular development. D) Can be used with gonadotropins In resistant cases",

Types of Fixatives: 1. Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) Fixatives – Used in ThinPrep or SurePath systems. • ThinPrep: Uses a methanol-based preservative. • SurePath: Uses an ethanol-based fixative with other stabilizing agents. 2. Conventional Pap Smear Fixatives: • 95% Ethanol – Gold standard for immediate wet fixation. • Spray Fixatives – Contain alcohol and polyethylene glycol to prevent air-drying. Fixation Process: • Wet Fixation: The slide is immediately placed in 95% ethanol for at least 15–30 minutes. • Spray Fixation: The slide is sprayed from a 15–20 cm distance to avoid dislodging cells. Proper fixation is crucial to prevent air-drying artifacts and ensure accurate cytological evaluation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The gross appearance of vulvar cancer can vary depending on the type and stage of the disease. However, common gross features include: 1. Exophytic (Raised) Lesions – Cauliflower-like, warty, or fungating masses. 2. Ulcerated Lesions – Irregular, necrotic, and non-healing ulcers with raised, indurated edges. 3. Plaque-like Lesions – White, red, or pigmented thickened areas on the vulva. 4. Nodular Masses – Firm, irregular, and sometimes infiltrative nodules. 5. Leukoplakia or Erythroplakia – White (hyperkeratotic) or red patches that may progress to invasive carcinoma. 6. Fissures or Erosions – Often painful and associated with chronic irritation. 7. Necrosis and Bleeding – Advanced tumors may show areas of necrosis, friability, and spontaneous bleeding. Common Sites: • Most commonly affects the labia majora, but can also involve the labia minora, clitoris, or perineum. Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of vulvar cancer, followed by rare types like melanoma or adenocarcinoma.",

Its main purpose is to detect premalignant and malignant changes in the cervical epithelium. Why it’s relevant in a patient with recurrent trichomoniasis: • Chronic infections, including Trichomonas vaginalis, can cause persistent inflammation of the cervix. • This chronic inflammation can lead to cellular atypia, making it important to screen for cervical cancer or pre-cancerous changes. • While Trichomonas organisms may be seen on a Pap smear, that’s not its primary purpose. Why other options are incorrect: • A) Diagnosis of cervical cancer - Pap smear is a screening, not a definitive diagnostic test. Diagnosis requires colposcopy + biopsy. • C) Diagnosis of trichomoniasis - Not reliable; wet mount or NAAT is used for diagnosis. • D) Screening of other genital tract cancers - Pap smear is specific for cervical epithelium, not for uterus, ovaries, or vulva.",

Fluid deficit of 500 ml is for the doctor, for the patient it is fluid overload. Upper limit for electrolyte deficient media for fluid overload is 1 liter → cause hyponatremia at a lower level. Mannitol has the least risk of hyponatremia. Electrolyte deficient media are used with unipolar cautery. For Electrolyte rich media [ NS/RL] - upper limit is 2.5L, used with bipolar cautery/mechanical morcellators Once we reach the upper limits - stop the procedure. Gaseous distension media used is carbon dioxide, only used for diagnostic laparoscopy. Most common complication of hysteroscopy is perforation. Contraindications of hysteroscopy: 1. Pregnancy 2.

However, it has specific contraindications, and menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) is considered an absolute contraindication. ? Why B) Menorrhagia is Correct: • Copper IUD can increase menstrual bleeding and cramps, especially in the first few months. • In women with pre-existing menorrhagia, it can worsen symptoms and lead to anemia. • Therefore, Cu-T is contraindicated in such cases, and alternatives like LNG-IUS (Mirena) may be preferred, which can actually reduce bleeding. Evaluation of Other Options: • A) Unmotivated person - Not an absolute contraindication; may lead to noncompliance, but not a medical barrier. • C) Previous ectopic pregnancy - Relative contraindication, not absolute. Cu-T actually reduces the overall risk of pregnancy, including ectopic. However, if pregnancy does occur, ectopic risk is higher. • D) Previous history of abortion - Not a contraindic",

They are a medical sign of bacterial vaginosis, particularly that caused by Gardnerella vaginalis a group of Gram-variable bacteria. This bacterial infection is characterized by a foul, fishy smelling, thin gray vaginal discharge, and an increase in vaginal pH from around 4.5 to over 5.5. It is a part of Amsel’s Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis- In clinical practice, bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed by the presence of 3 out of 4 Amsel criteria: 1. Thin, homogenous or milky vaginal discharge 2. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 (i.e. greater than normal) 3. Positive whiff test (fishy amine odor when 10 percent potassium hydroxide solution is added) 4. At least 20 percent clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells with borders obscured by adherent coccobacilli on wet-mount preparation or Gram stain).",

D) Nulliparity • Increased risk of epithelial ovarian tumors, including borderline tumors, likely due to more lifetime ovulations. • Repeated ovulation may cause surface epithelial trauma, promoting neoplastic changes.",

Why Option B is not advised at this stage: • Antiandrogens (e.g., spironolactone, cyproterone acetate) are typically added only if hirsutism is moderate to severe, and not controlled after 6 months of OCP use. • In a girl with mild hirsutism and normal testosterone, OCP alone is first-line. • Combining OCP and antiandrogens upfront is not standard practice in mild cases due to potential side effects and over-treatment. Other Options: A) OCP • Advised • First-line treatment to regulate cycles and reduce androgen symptoms.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) • The cyst is unilocular, 8×6 cm, and shows a reticular pattern—all features suggestive of a benign ovarian lesion, such as a hemorrhagic cyst. • In pregnancy, most simple ovarian cysts <10 cm resolve spontaneously, especially if they appear benign on ultrasound. • Warfarin use increases the risk of bleeding, so surgical intervention should be avoided unless clearly indicated. • Therefore, the safest and most evidence-based next step is to monitor with a follow-up ultrasound in 6–12 weeks to check for resolution or any change in morphology. Incorrect Options: A. Measure CA-125 • CA-125 is not reliable in pregnancy because it can be falsely elevated due to normal physiological changes. • This can mislead the diagnosis and potentially prompt unnecessary investigations or interventions. • Not recommended for evaluating ovarian cysts during pregnancy unless there are clear signs of malignancy. C. Surgical intervention • Surgery is not the first line for a benign-looking cyst in a stable, asymptomatic pregnant patient. • The patient is on Warfarin, which significantly increases surgical bleeding risk. • Surgery is only considered if there is suspicion of malignancy, torsion, rupture, or persistent growth after follow-up. D. MRI pelvis • MRI is used when ultrasound findings are inconclusive or if there’s suspicion of malignancy that cannot be clarified with USG. • In this case, the ultrasound clearly shows a simple unilocular cyst, and there's no indication for MRI at this stage. • MRI is not the next best step when ultrasound provides sufficient information.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In low-resource settings, the Pap smear (cytology-based screening) is the standard and most feasible method for cervical cancer screening. According to WHO guidelines and other global cervical cancer screening guidelines, Pap smear screening should start at age 21, regardless of sexual activity. After that, it should be repeated every 3 years if the results are normal. This approach is cost-effective and can be easily implemented even in settings where HPV testing is not widely available. For women in their 20s, this is the most appropriate and widely accepted guideline. Why Option A is Incorrect (Co-testing every 5 years starting at 25 years): Co-testing (Pap smear + HPV testing) is indeed a good option for cervical cancer screening, but it is usually recommended starting at age 30 in high-resource settings where both tests are available. This is not typically implemented in low-resource settings, where HPV testing may be too costly or unavailable. Additionally, the 25-year age recommendation is not aligned with guidelines for low-resource areas, where Pap smear alone is typically used. Why Option C is Incorrect (HPV testing every 5 years starting at 30 years): HPV testing is a valid option in high-resource settings, but it is not recommended for women under 30 years old due to the high rate of transient infections in younger women. Furthermore, HPV testing is often not feasible in low-resource settings due to lack of infrastructure and cost. Therefore, starting at age 30 in such settings is not practical. In this case, Pap smear is the more accessible and recommended choice for women in their 20s. Why Option D is Incorrect (Pap smear every 5 years starting at 21 years): Although Pap smears are indeed recommended for cervical cancer screening, the interval for normal Pap smears is every 3 years, not 5 years. Extending the interval to 5 years may delay the detection of pre-cancerous changes, which is why this interval is not recommended for routine screening, especially in younger women.",
