Continuous progestogens should be used (medroxyprogesterone 10–20 mg/day or norethisterone 10–15 mg/day) for women who decline the LNG-IUS. Cyclical progestogens should not be used because they are less effective in inducing regression of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia compared with continuous oral progestogens orthe LNG-IUS Treatment with oral progestogens or the LNG-IUS should be for a minimum of 6 months in order to induce histological regression of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.
