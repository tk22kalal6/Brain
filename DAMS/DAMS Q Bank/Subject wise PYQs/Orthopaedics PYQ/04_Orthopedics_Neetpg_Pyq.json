      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Paralysis is typically a late sign of compartment syndrome, indicating severe nerve damage due to prolonged elevated pressure in the affected compartment. By the time paralysis occurs, irreversible ischemia and nerve injury have often taken place, making this a sign of a more advanced stage of compartment syndrome. Option A. Pallor: Pallor can appear early in compartment syndrome, as decreased blood flow causes the affected area to lose its normal color. It may happen before pulselessness or paralysis and is an important early indicator. Option B. Pulselessness: While pulselessness may occur in severe cases of compartment syndrome, it is not a reliable sign. In fact, pulse may still be palpable in early stages of compartment syndrome, and it is possible to have a pulse even with elevated compartment pressures. Thus, pulselessness should not be used alone for diagnosis. Option D. Pain on passive stretch: This is one of the earliest and most specific signs of compartment syndrome. The pain arises because of muscle ischemia when the muscles are stretched due to increased pressure in the compartment. It’s a critical finding for early detection and intervention.",

The clinical presentation of fever, localized pain, and tenderness in the lower limb, combined with a raised ESR, points towards an inflammatory or infectious process. The radiographic findings provide the definitive clue: the X-ray shows changes consistent with a bone infection, specifically sclerotic and lytic areas, along with a subperiosteal reaction. This combination is highly characteristic of osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone. In contrast, while Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma can present with pain and fever, their X-ray appearances typically show more aggressive patterns like \"onion skin\" or \"sunburst\" reactions, respectively, which are not visible here.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) This patient presents with chronic back pain, anterior uveitis, and tenderness in the sacroiliac joint — classic features of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), especially ankylosing spondylitis (AS). However, his initial X-ray is normal, which is common in early disease. • MRI of the sacroiliac (SI) joints is the investigation of choice in early disease because it can detect active inflammation (bone marrow edema, synovitis, enthesitis) before structural changes become visible on X-ray. • MRI helps diagnose non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), which may later progress to radiographic AS.",
