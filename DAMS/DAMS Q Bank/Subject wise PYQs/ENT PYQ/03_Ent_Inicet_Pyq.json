      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The structure marked as A in the image is the Malleus, which is the correct answer (Option D). This image appears to be an endoscopic or otoscopic view of the middle ear, likely taken during a surgical or diagnostic procedure. The malleus is one of the three ossicles in the middle ear and is typically the most anterior and largest of the ossicles. It is directly attached to the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and is often visible during procedures involving the middle ear. Its long process and handle (manubrium) make it distinguishable, especially in endoscopic images. Incorrect Options: Option A: Incus The incus is the middle ossicle situated between the malleus and the stapes. It is located more posteriorly and medially in the middle ear, and its position and morphology are different from the structure labeled A. It does not have the same orientation or attachment to the tympanic membrane as the malleus. Option B: Stapes Footplate The stapes is the smallest of the three ossicles and is located furthest medially, connecting to the oval window of the cochlea. The footplate of the stapes is very small and would not appear as prominently as the structure labeled A. Additionally, the stapes would be positioned more posteriorly and medially than the structure shown. Option C: Lateral Semicircular Canal The lateral semicircular canal is part of the inner ear and lies posterior and superior to the middle ear cavity. It is not an ossicular structure and would not resemble the shape or location of the labeled A. Its bony contour can sometimes be seen during procedures involving the middle ear, but it appears as a smooth rounded prominence, not like the malleus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gelle's Test is performed in cases of otosclerosis It is a tuning fork test used to assess the mobility of the ossicular chain, particularly the stapes. In otosclerosis, the stapes becomes fixed due to abnormal bone growth, which dampens sound conduction through the middle ear. During Gelle's test, a vibrating tuning fork (usually 256 Hz or 512 Hz) is placed on the mastoid, and pressure is applied to the external auditory canal using a pneumatic speculum or by pressing on the tragus. In a normal ear, increased pressure reduces sound transmission, and the patient reports a decrease in loudness. However, in otosclerosis, because the stapes is immobile, no change in loudness is perceived, indicating a positive Gelle’s test. Incorrect Options: B. Serous Otitis Media This condition involves fluid in the middle ear that dampens sound conduction, but the ossicular chain, including the stapes, remains mobile. Gelle’s test is not helpful here because the pathology is due to fluid, not fixation of the ossicles. C. Traumatic Hearing Loss Traumatic hearing loss may involve damage to the ossicles or inner ear, but it is not typically diagnosed with Gelle’s test. The findings would vary depending on the nature of the trauma (e.g., dislocation, rupture, sensorineural damage), and this test is not specific for such conditions. D. Age-related Hearing Loss (Presbycusis) This is a sensorineural type of hearing loss that occurs due to degeneration of hair cells in the cochlea or auditory nerve. Gelle’s test assesses conductive issues related to ossicular mobility and would not be relevant or diagnostic in sensorineural hearing loss.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Labyrinthectomy This procedure involves the complete removal or destruction of the membranous labyrinth, which houses the balance and hearing organs of the inner ear. It is highly effective in permanently eliminating vertigo by eliminating the erratic signals from the diseased vestibular apparatus. However, because it destroys inner ear structures, it results in total and irreversible hearing loss in that ear, and thus is typically reserved for patients who already have poor or non-serviceable hearing in the affected ear. Incorrect Options: B. Cochlear Neurectomy – This term is often confused with vestibular neurectomy, which involves cutting the vestibular nerve (not cochlear nerve) to relieve vertigo while preserving hearing. While vestibular neurectomy is a good option for vertigo control with hearing preservation, it is technically more complex than labyrinthectomy and carries risks to nearby cranial nerves. C. Endolymphatic Sac Decompression – This is a less destructive, hearing-preserving procedure aimed at reducing endolymphatic hydrops by improving fluid drainage. It is less effective than labyrinthectomy in controlling severe, intractable vertigo, though it may be tried earlier in the disease course. D. Cochleosacculotomy – This is a drainage procedure that attempts to relieve pressure in the cochlea and saccule. It is now rarely performed due to limited effectiveness and potential damage to hearing without reliable vertigo relief.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In the case of a 12-year-old adolescent male presenting with a unilateral nasal mass, recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, and a pink, mucosa-covered mass in the nasopharynx, the most likely diagnosis is Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA). This is a highly vascular benign tumor seen almost exclusively in adolescent males. Biopsy is done for diagnosis – which should NOT be done. Biopsy is contraindicated in suspected JNA due to its high vascularity, which can result in profuse, uncontrollable bleeding. The diagnosis of JNA is made based on clinical presentation, age/gender, nasal endoscopy findings, and imaging (especially contrast-enhanced CT or MRI). Biopsy poses a significant risk without adding diagnostic value in a typical case of JNA. Incorrect Options: B. CECT is done, Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is used to evaluate the extent of the tumor, its vascularity, and involvement of adjacent structures, especially the pterygopalatine fossa or skull base. C. Endoscopic surgery can be done. Minimally invasive endoscopic excision is often the preferred surgical approach for smaller or moderately sized tumors, offering good access with reduced morbidity. D. Angioembolization can be performed Preoperative embolization of feeding vessels (usually from the internal maxillary artery) significantly reduces intraoperative bleeding and is a standard preparatory step before surgical excision.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Eyes move rapidly to left In caloric testing, nystagmus has two phases: A slow phase: due to vestibular input causing the eyes to drift in one direction A fast phase: a corrective saccade in the opposite direction, which is used to define the direction of the nystagmus With cold water in the right ear, this simulates movement away from the stimulated ear (to the left), resulting in: Slow eye movement to the right Fast corrective movement (nystagmus) to the left Thus, nystagmus is named for the fast phase, which in this case is to the left. Incorrect Options:A. Eyes move slowly to right – While this is true for the slow phase, nystagmus is named based on the fast phase, so this is not the correct answer. B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo that is positional and episodic. It typically presents in middle-aged or elderly individuals with brief episodes of severe vertigo triggered by changes in head position, such as turning in bed, looking up, or bending down. Cause: Displacement of otoliths (calcium carbonate crystals) into the posterior semicircular canal, which abnormally stimulates the vestibular system during head movements. Key feature: Vertigo is sudden, intense, short-lived (lasting seconds) and provoked by specific head positions. Diagnosis: Dix-Hallpike maneuver Treatment: Canalith repositioning maneuvers (e.g., Epley maneuver) This makes BPPV the most probable diagnosis in a patient who experiences vertigo specifically when turning in bed. Incorrect Options: B. Vestibular neuronitis – Involves sudden onset of prolonged vertigo (lasting days), often after a viral illness. It is not positional and usually does not recur in short spells. C. Labyrinthitis – Similar to vestibular neuronitis but includes hearing loss and tinnitus, along with prolonged vertigo. It is not provoked by position changes. D. Ménière’s disease – Characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Attacks last 20 minutes to several hours, and it is not triggered by position changes like turning in bed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) C, D C. Level 5 – Between base of skull to clavicle This is correct. Level 5 cervical lymph nodes are located in the posterior triangle of the neck. The boundaries of Level 5 include: Superiorly: Base of skull Inferiorly: Clavicle Anteriorly: Posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) Posteriorly: Anterior border of the trapezius muscle This group contains important nodes like the spinal accessory nodes and transverse cervical nodes. Level 5 is significant in head and neck cancers, especially those involving the nasopharynx and thyroid. D. Level 6 – Between cricoid to clavicle This is also correct. Level 6 nodes lie in the central compartment of the neck and are bounded: Superiorly: Cricoid cartilage (or hyoid bone depending on the reference) Inferiorly: Suprasternal notch/clavicle Laterally: Carotid arteries These nodes include pretracheal, paratracheal, and prelaryngeal (Delphian) nodes. They are especially relevant in thyroid, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancers. Incorrect Options A. Level 2 – Between mylohyoid base to cricoid Level 2 nodes are located in the upper jugular group, extending from the skull base down to the hyoid bone, not from the mylohyoid to cricoid. They are closely associated with the jugulodigastric node, and they receive drainage from the oral cavity, oropharynx, and parotid region. B. Level 3 – Between cricoid to clavicle Level 3 lies between the hyoid bone and the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, not down to the clavicle. It includes mid-jugular nodes, which are part of the deep cervical chain and drain areas like the larynx, hypopharynx, and thyroid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Endolymphatic hydrops The most appropriate diagnosis is endolymphatic hydrops, which is the pathological basis of Meniere’s disease. This condition is characterized by a classic triad of episodic vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss (typically low-frequency in early stages), and tinnitus, which matches the clinical presentation in this case. The vertigo episodes often last from 20 minutes to several hours and may be associated with aural fullness. The audiogram (PTA) shows low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is typical of Meniere’s disease in its early stages. Over time, the hearing loss may become more flat or affect higher frequencies as well, but early on, the involvement of low frequencies is a hallmark. The hearing loss in Meniere’s can also fluctuate, and word recognition may remain preserved in the early stages. The presence of all three symptoms and the PTA pattern support the diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops. Incorrect Options B. Acoustic neuroma Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) typically presents with unilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, often progressive, and poor speech discrimination. Vertigo is usually mild or absent; patients more commonly report imbalance rather than true spinning vertigo. The hearing loss is not typically episodic or fluctuating, and the audiogram pattern would differ from the low-frequency loss seen here. C. Cochlear otosclerosis Cochlear otosclerosis typically presents with progressive sensorineural or mixed hearing loss, but vertigo is uncommon. It does not usually involve episodic vestibular symptoms or tinnitus to the degree described. The PTA may show a conductive or mixed loss pattern (e.g., Carhart’s notch), not isolated low-frequency SNHL. This makes it less likely in this scenario. D. Noise-induced hearing loss Noise-induced hearing loss characteristically presents with a notched audiogram at 4 kHz, affecting high frequencies, and does not cause vertigo. Tinnitus may occur, but the absence of episodic vertigo and the different audiogram pattern rule this out. Additionally, noise-induced HL is typically chronic and progressive, not episodic or fluctuating.",

It may have a supporting or modifying role in mucosal health, but it is not a recognized direct carcinogenic factor like viruses or carcinogens. Incorrect Options: A. EBV infection – etiological vector Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a well-established cause of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly in endemic regions like Southeast Asia. It integrates into host DNA and leads to oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells. B. HPV infection –etiological vector Human papillomavirus (HPV), especially types 16 and 18, is strongly associated with oropharyngeal cancers (e.g., tonsil, base of tongue). HPV-positive head and neck cancers often occur in younger, non-smoking individuals and generally have a better prognosis. C. Betel nut (Areca nut) – etiological factor Chewing betel nut, often combined with tobacco and lime (in paan), is a major risk factor for oral cavity cancers, particularly in South and Southeast Asia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sensorineural Hearing Loss Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) syndrome is caused by a bony defect in the superior semicircular canal, creating a \"third window\" effect in the inner ear. This abnormal opening alters normal sound and pressure conduction in the inner ear. While SSCD can cause hearing loss, it is typically of a conductive or mixed type, not purely sensorineural. The conductive component arises due to the third window allowing abnormal flow of perilymph in response to sound or pressure, mimicking middle ear pathology even though the middle ear structures are normal. Incorrect Options: A. Nystagmus – Present in SSCD Vertigo and nystagmus are hallmark features, especially triggered by sound (Tullio phenomenon) or pressure changes (e.g., Valsalva maneuver). Eye movements (nystagmus) correspond to stimulation of the dehiscent superior canal. B. Positive Tullio phenomenon – Present in SSCD This is sound-induced vertigo or nystagmus, caused by the abnormal response of the dehiscent semicircular canal to acoustic stimuli. C. Positive fistula test – Present in SSCD A positive fistula test (nystagmus or vertigo triggered by pressure changes to the external ear canal) can also occur in SSCD due to the abnormal \"third window\".",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) D. PTA (Pure Tone Audiometry) Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) is a subjective test of hearing. It requires active participation from the patient, who must indicate when they hear a tone. The results depend on the patient's perception, response accuracy, and cooperation. Because it relies on subjective feedback, PTA cannot be used in individuals who are non-cooperative or unable to respond reliably (e.g., infants, unconscious patients, malingerers). Incorrect Options: A. Impedance Audiometry – Objective test Also called tympanometry, this test evaluates the status of the middle ear and tympanic membrane compliance. It is objective as it does not require patient response and measures how the eardrum moves in response to pressure changes. B. BERA (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry) – Objective test BERA measures electrical activity in the auditory nerve and brainstem in response to sound. It is especially useful in infants, uncooperative patients, or to detect retrocochlear lesions. No patient feedback is needed, making it objective. C. OAE (Otoacoustic Emissions) – Objective test OAE detects sounds generated by the outer hair cells of the cochlea in response to an acoustic stimulus. It's used for newborn hearing screening and does not require any active response from the subject.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Inferior Turbinate The image shown is an endoscopic view of the nasal cavity, with the arrow pointing to a prominent structure along the lateral wall. This structure is the inferior turbinate, which is the largest of the three nasal turbinates (inferior, middle, and superior). The inferior turbinate plays a crucial role in filtering, humidifying, and warming inspired air due to its large surface area and rich vascular supply. It is the first turbinate encountered when viewing the nasal cavity endoscopically, positioned just above the nasal floor and below the middle turbinate. Its prominent location and size make it the most visually striking turbinate during anterior rhinoscopy or nasal endoscopy, making it the correct answer in this image. Incorrect Options: B. Middle Turbinate The middle turbinate is located superior to the inferior turbinate and is smaller in size. It is usually seen as a smaller, more centrally placed structure in endoscopic views, and would not be the most inferiorly located turbinate, as is indicated by the arrow in this image. C. Superior Turbinate This is the smallest and most superior of the three turbinates, often difficult to visualize without deep endoscopy. It lies high in the nasal cavity and is not the structure marked in this image. D. Septal Cartilage The septal cartilage forms part of the nasal septum, which divides the two nasal cavities. It is found medially, not laterally like the turbinates. The marked structure is clearly along the lateral nasal wall, ruling out the septum as a possibility.",

In this technique, the patient's forehead and nose are pressed against the X-ray cassette with the central beam angled 15 degrees caudally.

Because of this optimal visualization, Caldwell’s view is the investigation of choice for evaluating pathology in the frontal sinuses. Incorrect Options: A. Water’s View This is primarily used to visualize the maxillary sinuses. In this view, the patient extends their neck so the orbitomeatal line forms a 37-degree angle with the X-ray plate. While some frontal sinus detail can be seen, it is not as clearly visualized as in Caldwell’s view. C. Lateral View This view is useful for evaluating all paranasal sinuses in a single film (including frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary), but it does not provide a focused or detailed view of the frontal sinus like Caldwell’s view does.

Each labeled structure (A, B, C, and D) corresponds to key skeletal components of the larynx and adjacent areas: A: Epiglottis – This is a leaf-shaped cartilage that projects upward and functions to close over the laryngeal inlet during swallowing, preventing food from entering the airway. It is part of the laryngeal skeleton and is visible in this specimen as a curved, cartilaginous structure at the superior aspect of the larynx. B: Arytenoid Cartilage – These paired cartilages sit atop the cricoid cartilage and are essential in vocal cord movement. They provide the posterior attachment for the vocal folds and are clearly seen in this image. C: Cricoid Cartilage – This is a complete ring of cartilage located below the thyroid cartilage and arytenoids. It forms the inferior portion of the laryngeal skeleton and provides attachment points for muscles and other cartilages. D: Hyoid Bone – Located above the thyroid cartilage, this U-shaped bone is unique because it does not articulate with any other bone.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Peritonsillar vein The image provided is a sagittal anatomical section showing the oropharyngeal region, particularly the tonsillar area, which is relevant in the context of a post-tonsillectomy patient. In children undergoing tonsillectomy, the most common source of post-operative bleeding, especially within the first 24 hours, is the peritonsillar vein. These veins are superficial, fragile, and prone to bleeding due to surgical trauma during tonsil removal. Since the patient had mild bleeding the next day, this is most consistent with reactionary hemorrhage (secondary to slippage of a clot or vessel retraction), and the peritonsillar vein is the usual culprit. Incorrect Options: A. Facial artery While the facial artery does give off the tonsillar branch, it is a deeper and more robust artery. Injury to the facial artery is less common and typically causes more severe bleeding than what's described as \"mild.\" B. Tonsillar artery This artery is a branch of the facial artery and does contribute to the blood supply of the tonsil. However, active bleeding from this vessel is more serious and would likely present intraoperatively or immediately post-op, rather than the next morning. D. Ascending pharyngeal artery This is a smaller vessel that also contributes to the tonsillar blood supply.

Characteristic CT findings without bone invasion – Hyperdense areas (representing allergic mucin) and expansion of sinuses without tissue or bone invasion. Allergic mucin containing fungal elements – Thick, peanut butter–like mucin containing fungal hyphae visible on histopathology (not necessarily culture). Type I hypersensitivity (IgE mediated) – Evidence of allergy via skin prick or serum IgE testing. Incorrect Options: B. Nasal polyposis – Correct major criterion Common in AFRS and part of the defining clinical presentation. C.

Chronic mouth breathing, especially during development, leads to abnormal facial growth patterns, including: Crowded teeth due to improper tongue posture and altered jaw development High-arched palate Elongated face with an open mouth posture (often referred to as \"adenoid facies\") Symptoms of nasal obstruction, snoring, and sleep-disordered breathing Hence, the association of crowded teeth and mouth breathing in a child strongly suggests adenoid hypertrophy. Incorrect Options: A. Horse facies Not a standard clinical term. Sometimes used descriptively but not associated with adenoids or mouth breathing. C. Frog face Typically refers to craniofacial fibrous dysplasia with bony swelling, especially of the maxilla. Not linked to adenoid hypertrophy or dental crowding. D. Goldenhar Goldenhar syndrome (also called oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum) involves facial asymmetry, ear anomalies, and vertebral defects, not primarily adenoids or mouth breathing.",

Blocking this nerve helps in managing pain in nasal and sinus surgeries. Incorrect Options: A. Frontal Sinus Trephination This involves creating a surgical opening into the frontal sinus, usually done through a small skin incision above the medial aspect of the eyebrow—not the approach shown in this image.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Super-Supraglottic Swallow Super-supraglottic swallow is a swallowing technique used in partial laryngectomy patients where some part of the larynx is preserved. It involves holding the breath tightly, bearing down, swallowing, and then coughing to clear any residue — relying on structures like the supraglottis and glottis for airway protection. After a total laryngectomy, the entire larynx (including the vocal cords and supraglottic structures) is removed. There is complete separation between the airway (via a permanent tracheostomy) and the digestive tract, so airway aspiration is not a concern, and such techniques are not required or feasible. Hence, super-supraglottic swallow is not done post-laryngectomy, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A. Polite yawning This is a type of speech therapy technique used to help create sound by relaxing the pharyngeal muscles and facilitating esophageal or tracheoesophageal speech after total laryngectomy. C. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) A tracheoesophageal puncture can be created intentionally during or after laryngectomy to allow for tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis placement. This enables patients to speak by diverting air into the esophagus. D. Esophageal Voice A common method of voice rehabilitation where the patient learns to swallow and then release air from the esophagus, causing vibration of the pharyngoesophageal segment to produce sound.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In this case, the child is 6 months old and has bilateral bony atresia (a congenital absence or closure of the external auditory canal), but imaging shows intact middle ear and cochlea. This suggests that inner ear (cochlear) function is likely preserved, and bone conduction hearing is possible. Option B shows a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) or bone conduction hearing device, which is the most appropriate intervention in infants with conductive hearing loss due to atresia but with a functioning cochlea. Since the child is very young, a soft band bone conduction hearing aid (like that shown in B) is typically used until the child is old enough for surgical implantation (usually after 5 years of age). Incorrect Options: A (Cochlear implant) Cochlear implants are used for sensorineural hearing loss, not conductive hearing loss like in bony atresia. This child has a normal cochlea, so a cochlear implant is not indicated. C (Atresia dilator or trephine) Surgical correction (atresiaplasty) is often delayed until the child is older (usually after age 5–6) and is considered based on hearing status and anatomy. This is not a first-line treatment at 6 months. D (Hook or curette for cleaning) This tool is used for cerumen removal or ear cleaning—not relevant to hearing rehabilitation in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Inverted Papilloma The case describes a 75-year-old woman with right-sided nasal obstruction, bloody muco-purulent nasal discharge, and a mass arising from the lateral nasal wall as seen on endoscopy and CT imaging. The CT scan also shows characteristic features such as sinonasal mass with bone remodeling and possible hyperostosis, often seen with inverted papilloma. Inverted papilloma is a benign but locally aggressive tumor that typically arises from the lateral nasal wall (especially the middle meatus), has a unilateral presentation, and commonly presents with nasal obstruction and epistaxis in older adults. It has a high recurrence rate and risk of malignant transformation (most commonly to squamous cell carcinoma), making early diagnosis important. Incorrect Options: A. Squamous Cell Carcinoma Although this can also cause unilateral nasal obstruction and bleeding, SCC more often presents with destructive features, and not with the lobulated, non-invasive appearance seen here. Also, SCC is usually not centered on the lateral nasal wall in this manner. B. Esthesioneuroblastoma (Olfactory Neuroblastoma) Typically arises from the olfactory epithelium in the cribriform plate and presents with bilateral symptoms, sometimes with orbital or intracranial extension. More common in younger age groups (2nd–5th decades). D. Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA) Occurs exclusively in adolescent males, not in elderly females. Also arises from the sphenopalatine foramen, not the lateral wall, and presents with profuse epistaxis rather than muco-purulent discharge.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Perilymphatic fistula Perilymphatic fistula is a pathological communication between the inner ear’s perilymphatic space and the middle ear, often caused by trauma or surgery involving the middle ear, such as tubotympanic ear surgery. This abnormal opening leads to leakage of perilymph fluid, causing inner ear disturbances. The hallmark symptoms include tinnitus, vertigo, aural fullness, and disequilibrium, exactly as described in this patient. These symptoms arise due to altered pressure and chemical composition in the inner ear fluids, which disrupt the normal vestibular and auditory functions. PLF is a recognized complication following ear surgery and should be suspected when vestibular symptoms appear in the postoperative period without infection. Incorrect Options: A. Labyrinthitis Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear, usually due to infection, characterized by vertigo, hearing loss, and sometimes tinnitus. However, it typically presents with systemic signs of infection such as fever, which are absent here. Moreover, labyrinthitis is not a common immediate postoperative complication after tubotympanic surgery. B. Lateral Sinus Thrombophlebitis This is a rare but serious complication of ear infections that involves thrombosis of the lateral sinus. It presents with severe headache, fever, neurological symptoms, and signs of systemic illness. Vestibular symptoms like vertigo and aural fullness are not prominent early features, and the clinical scenario here lacks such systemic signs. D. Paget Disease Paget disease is a chronic bone disorder that can involve the temporal bone and cause hearing loss or tinnitus. However, it does not present acutely after surgery with vertigo, aural fullness, and disequilibrium. Its progression is gradual and unrelated to middle ear surgery.",

Grade II: TM touches the promontory but is not adherent. Grade III: TM adherent to the promontory but still mobile. Grade IV: TM severely retracted, adherent and immobile; may cause ossicular erosion. Findings in the image: The TM appears mildly retracted, with normal landmarks still visible. It is not adherent to the promontory. There’s no evidence of ossicular erosion or severe atelectasis. This corresponds to Grade I retraction — early stage with only mild pulling inwards. Incorrect Options: Grade II–IV would show increasing degrees of TM adherence, loss of mobility, and visibility of middle ear structures — none of which are evident here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Left hypoactive labyrinth The patient presents with vertigo, dizziness, and horizontal nystagmus whose slow component is directed toward the left side. In vestibular pathology, the direction of the slow phase of nystagmus typically points toward the side of the lesion or decreased vestibular activity. A hypoactive (or hypofunctioning) labyrinth on the left reduces the tonic input from that side to the brainstem vestibular nuclei, causing the brain to interpret this as movement from the affected side to the intact side. This results in spontaneous horizontal nystagmus with a slow phase toward the left (the weaker side) and a fast corrective phase toward the right (the stronger, unaffected side). Therefore, the slow phase to the left indicates left-sided vestibular hypofunction. Incorrect Options: A. Superior canal BPPV Superior canal BPPV is a rare variant of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo characterized by positional vertigo and vertical-torsional nystagmus, rather than horizontal nystagmus. The clinical picture here does not include positional triggers or vertical nystagmus, making this diagnosis unlikely. B. Posterior canal BPPV Posterior canal BPPV is the most common type of BPPV and typically causes brief episodes of vertigo triggered by head position changes, with characteristic torsional and upbeating nystagmus. Horizontal nystagmus at rest is not typical, so this option does not fit the presentation. C. Right hypoactive labyrinth If the right labyrinth were hypoactive, the slow phase of nystagmus would be directed toward the right side (the affected side), and the fast corrective phase toward the left. Since the slow phase is to the left, right hypoactivity is unlikely.",

Injury or impairment of this nerve leads to reduced sensation in the laryngeal mucosa, causing sluggish or absent supraglottic and cough reflexes, which increases the risk of aspiration, especially in patients with chronic alcohol use who are prone to nerve damage. Thus, damage to the internal laryngeal nerve explains the defective airway protective reflexes seen in these patients. Incorrect Options: A. Glossopharyngeal nerve The glossopharyngeal nerve mainly supplies sensation to the oropharynx and posterior third of the tongue, contributing to the gag reflex but not directly involved in the supraglottic or cough reflex. C. External laryngeal nerve The external laryngeal nerve supplies motor innervation to the cricothyroid muscle, affecting voice pitch but not the sensory input for cough or supraglottic reflexes. D. Recurrent laryngeal nerve The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the vocal cords and intrinsic muscles of the larynx except cricothyroid, providing motor control and sensation below the vocal cords, but it is not primarily responsible for initiating the supraglottic or cough reflex.",

There is a gap between air and bone conduction in the left ear, which implies conductive hearing loss on the left side (as bone conduction would be normal while air conduction is impaired). Clinical Correlation: Rinne’s Test: Positive = Air conduction > Bone conduction ? Normal or sensorineural loss. Negative = Bone conduction > Air conduction ? Conductive hearing loss. Since right ear is normal, Rinne would be positive. Weber’s Test: Sound lateralizes to the better cochlea in sensorineural hearing loss or to the affected side in conductive hearing loss. In this case, left ear has conductive loss, so Weber would lateralize to left. Incorrect Options: B – Rinne would not be negative on the right (it’s normal).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tympanometry When Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) are absent or negative, it indicates a possible dysfunction in the cochlea, particularly the outer hair cells, or a conductive pathology preventing sound transmission to the cochlea. Tympanometry is the next logical step because it assesses middle ear function by measuring the mobility of the tympanic membrane and the status of the middle ear system. This test helps determine if the negative OAE is due to a middle ear problem (like fluid, eustachian tube dysfunction, or perforation) causing conductive hearing loss, which could prevent the emission from being recorded, or if it is due to a sensorineural cochlear issue. Incorrect Options: A. Free Field Audiometry Free field audiometry tests hearing through speakers but does not localize the site of lesion or differentiate conductive vs sensorineural causes and is less informative immediately after a negative OAE. C. Speech Audiometry Speech audiometry evaluates speech recognition and discrimination but is not the primary next step to identify the cause of absent OAEs. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Option D The correct response is Option D, which correctly matches each type of tympanoplasty with the appropriate anatomical structure on which the graft is placed. According to Wullstein's classification, tympanoplasty is categorized based on the extent of ossicular chain damage and the corresponding site for graft placement: Type 2 Tympanoplasty (1 → B): Here, the malleus is eroded, but the incus is intact, so the graft is placed on the incus. This restores the conductive pathway from the tympanic membrane to the intact ossicles. Type 5 Tympanoplasty (2 → A): This involves fenestration surgery, typically done when the stapes footplate is fixed, like in otosclerosis. The graft is placed on the promontory, and a window is made into the lateral semicircular canal to bypass the stapes. Type 3 Tympanoplasty (3 → C): In this type, both malleus and incus are eroded, and the graft is placed directly on the head of the stapes, allowing sound conduction directly to the inner ear. Type 4 Tympanoplasty (4 → D): Here, only the footplate of stapes is present (the suprastructure is absent), so the graft is placed on the footplate, and the round window niche is also covered to prevent sound wave dissipation. Incorrect Options Option A (1C 2B 3A 4D): This mismatches multiple pairings. It wrongly places Type 5 with stapes (3) and Type 2 with promontory (2), which is anatomically and surgically incorrect. Option B (1B 2C 3A 4D): Here, Type 2 is matched with Type 3’s site (stapes) and Type 3 is matched with Type 5’s site (promontory), which reverses the expected placements. Option C (1C 2B 3D 4A): This option has Type 3 matched with footplate, which is actually for Type 4, and Type 4 matched with promontory, which belongs to Type 5—again indicating incorrect associations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Myringotomy, Grommet Insertion, Adenoidectomy The flat (Type B) tympanogram indicates the presence of otitis media with effusion (OME), which is common in children with recurrent URTIs and craniofacial abnormalities like a high-arched palate (seen in Down syndrome or cleft palate). These children are at higher risk due to chronic eustachian tube dysfunction, leading to fluid accumulation behind the tympanic membrane and conductive hearing loss. Myringotomy is performed to drain the fluid from the middle ear, which provides immediate symptomatic relief. Grommet (ventilation tube) insertion keeps the tympanic membrane open, allowing continuous aeration and preventing fluid reaccumulation. Adenoidectomy helps resolve the underlying cause by removing adenoidal hypertrophy, which can block the eustachian tube and contribute to chronic OME. This combination addresses both the symptom and the anatomical cause, providing both short- and long-term relief and helping prevent complications such as hearing loss and speech delays. Incorrect Options: Option A - Only Myringotomy Myringotomy alone may help temporarily by draining the fluid, but the tympanic membrane often closes quickly, leading to recurrence of effusion. Without grommet placement or addressing the cause (adenoids), this is inadequate as a standalone treatment. Option B - Myringotomy + Grommet Insertion This is a good initial intervention but incomplete for a patient with recurrent infections and anatomical predisposition. Without adenoidectomy, the root cause (adenoidal hypertrophy causing eustachian tube dysfunction) remains uncorrected, leading to persistent or recurrent OME. Option C - Grommet Insertion, Adenoidectomy, Tympanoplasty While grommet insertion and adenoidectomy are appropriate, tympanoplasty is not indicated in this case. Tympanoplasty is used for repairing chronic perforations of the tympanic membrane or ossicular chain issues, typically seen in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), not OME with an intact tympanic membrane. Therefore, including tympanoplasty here is unnecessary and inappropriate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A. Ranula The image shows a bluish, translucent swelling in the floor of the mouth, lateral to the midline—classic appearance of a ranula. A ranula is a mucous retention cyst that arises from the sublingual salivary gland due to ductal obstruction or rupture, leading to mucous extravasation into surrounding tissues. The term \"ranula\" comes from the Latin word rana (frog), as the swelling resembles a frog’s underbelly. It typically presents as: A painless, fluctuant, bluish swelling Located on one side of the floor of the mouth May increase in size during meals Incorrect Options: Option B: Mucocele A mucocele is also a mucous retention cyst, but it usually occurs on the lower lip, buccal mucosa, or palate, not on the floor of the mouth. It is smaller, more superficial, and less bluish compared to a ranula. Option C: Ludwig Angina Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis involving the floor of the mouth, submandibular, and sublingual spaces. It presents with firm bilateral swelling, elevation of the tongue, difficulty breathing or swallowing, pain, fever, and is a surgical emergency. The absence of systemic symptoms and the well-defined, cystic appearance makes Ludwig angina unlikely here. Option D: Dermoid Cyst A dermoid cyst in the floor of the mouth is typically midline, non-translucent, and doughy or firm to palpation. It is usually deeper and does not have the bluish, cystic appearance of a ranula.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Nasociliary Nerve Block The image shows a needle being inserted at the root of the nose, close to the medial canthus of the eye, which is the landmark for a nasociliary nerve block. The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). It gives off several important sensory branches, including: Infratrochlear nerve Anterior ethmoidal nerve Long ciliary nerves Blocking the nasociliary nerve at this location provides anesthesia to: Medial canthus Root and dorsum of the nose Upper eyelid (medially) Cornea and conjunctiva (via long ciliary nerves) This block is typically used in ophthalmic procedures, rhinoplasty, or nasal surgeries involving the dorsum and upper part of the nose. Incorrect Options: Option A: Infratrochlear Block The infratrochlear nerve is a terminal branch of the nasociliary nerve. While the infratrochlear block is also given near the medial canthus, it is more superficial and more medial and inferior compared to the nasociliary block. It only anesthetizes the skin of the upper nose and medial eyelids, not the deeper structures supplied by the nasociliary nerve. Option C: Supraorbital Block The supraorbital nerve, a branch of the frontal nerve (also from V1), exits through the supraorbital foramen located on the upper margin of the orbit, above the pupil line. The injection site in the image is not above the orbit, ruling this out. Option D: Anterior Ethmoidal Block The anterior ethmoidal nerve, a branch of the nasociliary nerve, exits through the anterior ethmoidal foramen and innervates the anterior nasal cavity and nasal dorsum. Blocking it specifically requires a different approach, usually more medial and deeper, often used in nasal surgeries, but not at the site shown in this image.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Auditory neuropathy Auditory neuropathy is a disorder where the cochlea (and hence pure tone audiometry) functions normally, but there is a disruption in the transmission of sound signals along the auditory nerve or brainstem pathways. This results in patients being able to detect sounds but unable to process or understand speech properly, despite having normal hearing thresholds on pure tone audiometry. The abnormal Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) confirms a defect in neural conduction despite normal cochlear function, which is characteristic of auditory neuropathy. This explains why the patient hears sounds but cannot understand the meaning. Incorrect Options: A. Malingering Malingering refers to the intentional feigning of hearing loss or symptoms, which is inconsistent with the clinical and audiometric findings here. The objective ABR abnormality rules out malingering. B. Otosclerosis Otosclerosis causes conductive hearing loss due to stapes fixation. It would show abnormal pure tone audiometry with a conductive pattern, which is not the case here. D. Michael’s aplasia Michael’s aplasia refers to congenital absence or malformation of the cochlea, which would cause profound sensorineural hearing loss with abnormal pure tone audiometry, unlike the normal audiogram in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A-2, B-3, C-4, D-1The correct matching links each anatomical structure with a classical clinical symptom caused by its dysfunction or damage: A ? 2 (Esophagus ? Dysphagia) The esophagus is responsible for transporting food from the pharynx to the stomach. Any lesion, compression, inflammation, or malignancy involving the esophagus can disrupt swallowing, resulting in dysphagia, which is a classic presenting symptom of esophageal disease. B ? 3 (Sympathetic chain ? Horner syndrome) The sympathetic chain supplies sympathetic innervation to the eye and face. Disruption of this pathway, as seen in conditions like Pancoast tumors or trauma to the cervical chain, leads to Horner syndrome—a triad of ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating). C ? 4 (Trachea ? Dysphonia) The trachea is part of the respiratory tract, and while not directly responsible for sound production, any inflammation, compression, or mass effect can impinge on nearby structures like the vocal cords, leading to dysphonia, a general term for altered voice quality. D ? 1 (Recurrent laryngeal nerve ? Hoarseness of voice) The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates almost all intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except cricothyroid). Injury to this nerve—common in thyroid surgery or due to apical lung tumors—results in vocal cord paralysis, leading to hoarseness of voice, a classic symptom. Incorrect Options: Option B (A-2, B-4, C-1, D-3) Incorrect because it mismatches the sympathetic chain with dysphonia, which is not its domain. Also, it links the trachea to hoarseness and the recurrent laryngeal nerve to Horner syndrome, which is anatomically and clinically inaccurate. Option C (A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4) Incorrect as it inappropriately associates the esophagus with hoarseness, and the trachea with Horner syndrome, which is caused by sympathetic disruption, not airway problems. Additionally, recurrent laryngeal nerve causes hoarseness, not just general dysphonia. Option D (A-3, B-1, C-2, D-4) Incorrect because it incorrectly matches the esophagus with Horner syndrome and the sympathetic chain with hoarseness, both of which are unrelated. The trachea causing dysphagia is less accurate than it causing dysphonia.",

It commonly presents with nasal obstruction and recurrent, often profuse epistaxis due to its highly vascular nature. The age of presentation, gender, and symptoms of nasal blockage combined with frequent nosebleeds strongly point towards JNA. Early diagnosis is important due to the risk of significant bleeding and local tissue invasion. Incorrect Options: A. Antro choanal polyp Antro choanal polyps cause unilateral nasal obstruction but rarely cause recurrent epistaxis. They are usually painless and do not present with frequent bleeding episodes. C. Allergic rhinitis Allergic rhinitis typically causes nasal congestion, sneezing, and rhinorrhea but is not associated with recurrent epistaxis or a mass causing obstruction. D. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is rare in children and usually presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and sometimes neck masses. However, it is less common in this age group compared to JNA, and the presentation over six months without other systemic symptoms makes it less likely. .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ad tympanogram on impedance audiometry, which is not associated with serous otitis media. In serous otitis media (also known as otitis media with effusion), fluid accumulates in the middle ear without signs of acute infection. This fluid dampens the movement of the tympanic membrane and ossicles, resulting in decreased compliance (mobility). On impedance audiometry (tympanometry), this typically produces a Type B (flat) tympanogram, indicating fluid in the middle ear. A Type Ad tympanogram, on the other hand, reflects hypercompliance, which is seen in ossicular discontinuity or flaccid tympanic membrane—not in serous otitis media. Incorrect Options: A. Resolves on its own True. In many cases, serous otitis media resolves spontaneously within weeks to months without the need for aggressive treatment. B. Bilateral True. Especially in children, serous otitis media is often bilateral due to the anatomical and functional immaturity of the Eustachian tubes. C. Most commonly seen after common cold True. Serous otitis media frequently follows upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold, due to Eustachian tube dysfunction leading to fluid accumulation in the middle ear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Grommet insertion with adenoidectomy, Grommet (ventilation tube) insertion and adenoidectomy are procedures aimed at treating conductive hearing loss, most commonly due to otitis media with effusion (OME) or Eustachian tube dysfunction. These conditions cause fluid buildup in the middle ear, and grommets help ventilate the middle ear to restore hearing. However, in sensorineural hearing loss, the problem lies in the inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve, and thus grommets or adenoidectomy have no role in treatment. Incorrect Options (Actually part of SNHL management) B. Hearing aids True. Hearing aids are a standard treatment for children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. They amplify sounds and help improve auditory perception. C. Cochlear implant True. For children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss who do not benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants are an effective option. They directly stimulate the auditory nerve to provide a sense of sound. D. Classroom accommodations True. Educational and environmental support such as preferential seating, use of FM systems, speech therapy, and teacher awareness are crucial for maximizing the child's learning and communication in school settings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Right Rinne's Negative and Weber lateralized to right ear. This is the classical tuning fork finding in conductive hearing loss, such as otosclerosis, which is a condition characterized by abnormal bony fixation of the stapes footplate, impeding sound conduction through the middle ear. A Rinne's test compares air conduction (AC) with bone conduction (BC). In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air conduction, resulting in a negative Rinne's test on the affected side. The Weber test lateralizes to the ear with greater conductive loss because bone-conducted sound bypasses the middle ear and is heard more prominently in the affected ear. Since the patient has more deafness on the right side, the tuning fork findings will be Rinne negative on the right and Weber lateralized to the right, making option B correct. Incorrect Options: A. Right Rinne's Positive and Weber lateralized to left ear Incorrect. A positive Rinne on the right indicates normal or sensorineural loss, not conductive loss. In conductive loss (otosclerosis), Rinne would be negative. C. Left Rinne's Positive and Weber lateralized to right ear While the Weber result matches the affected side (right), a positive Rinne on the left does not tell us anything about the right side; and the right side's Rinne (the affected ear) should be negative. D. Left Rinne's Negative and Weber lateralized to left ear This suggests conductive hearing loss on the left, which contradicts the clinical scenario indicating more hearing loss on the right.",

Incorrect Options: Option A: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) SCC is more aggressive than BCC and typically presents as: A scaly, ulcerated lesion Crusting or bleeding Faster growing More common on the lower lip, ears, and scalp Although it can occur on the nose, the lack of keratinization and crusting, along with the pearly rolled edge, makes SCC less likely here.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Severe hearing loss >70%. In hearing assessment, the degree of hearing loss is determined based on how loud a sound must be before it is heard. A person with severe hearing loss can only hear very loud sounds such as shouting or amplified speech. This corresponds to a hearing threshold of 70–90 dB HL, which often affects the ability to understand even amplified or loud conversational speech. Since the patient in this case can only hear loud shouts and amplified sounds, it falls within the severe hearing loss category. Incorrect Options: A. Profound <40% This is incorrect both in definition and percentage range. Profound hearing loss typically refers to thresholds above 90 dB HL, and patients may not hear even loud sounds. The percentage mentioned (“<40%”) is also inaccurate in this context. C. Moderately severe hearing loss <70% Moderately severe hearing loss falls in the 55–70 dB HL range. While this may cause difficulty in hearing normal conversation, people in this category can typically still hear loud speech without amplification. D.

The arrow is pointing at the articulation between these two ossicles. This is a saddle-type synovial joint, which allows a limited gliding motion—essential for the efficient transmission of sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. Key Characteristics of the Saddle Joint (as seen here): Each articulating surface is concave in one direction and convex in the other (like a rider on a saddle). Allows movement in two planes (biaxial): flexion-extension and abduction-adduction (in this case, specialized for vibration transmission). Found in areas needing precise but limited motion (e.g., thumb's carpometacarpal joint and ossicular joints). Incorrect Options: Option A: Pivot Joint Allows rotational movement (e.g., atlantoaxial joint between C1 and C2 vertebrae). Not relevant to the ossicular chain. Option B: Ball and Socket Joint Permits multiaxial movement (e.g., hip and shoulder joints). The ossicles do not have a spherical articulating surface and do not require such a wide range of motion.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1 and 4. The sensory cells of the inner ear include inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs), which play distinct roles in the process of hearing. Statement 1 is correct: Inner and outer hair cells are present in a ratio of approximately 1:3, meaning there are about three outer hair cells for every inner hair cell. Statement 4 is correct: Inner hair cells are arranged in a single row along the cochlear spiral and are primarily responsible for transmitting auditory impulses to the brain via the auditory nerve. They convert mechanical energy into electrical signals. These two statements are accurate, making Option C the correct choice. Incorrect Options: Statement 2: \"Inner hair cells are only responsible to transmit auditory impulses.\" This is misleading. While inner hair cells do transmit auditory signals, outer hair cells also contribute to the cochlear amplifier mechanism, which indirectly enhances auditory signal detection. The word “only” makes the statement overly exclusive. Statement 3: \"Outer hair cells are responsible for tectorial membrane movement.\" This is inaccurate. Outer hair cells contribute to cochlear amplification by changing their length in response to sound (electromotility), which affects the basilar membrane, not directly the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is a gelatinous structure that interacts with hair cell stereocilia but is not actively moved by the OHCs.",

This surgery is typically performed for otosclerosis, a condition common in young females (especially worsens during pregnancy) and causes conductive hearing loss due to fixation of the stapes footplate. In stapedotomy: A small hole is made in the fixed stapes footplate. A prosthesis is inserted to transmit sound from the incus to the inner ear (oval window), bypassing the fixed stapes. Clinical Clues Matching the Diagnosis: Young female (30 years old) Pregnancy-associated hearing loss (common trigger for otosclerosis worsening) Prosthesis involving the stapes in the image Incorrect Options: Option A: Tympanoplasty Aims to reconstruct the tympanic membrane and/or ossicles. Does not typically involve a stapes prosthesis. Done for chronic otitis media or tympanic membrane perforation. Option B: Myringoplasty A type of tympanoplasty limited to repairing the tympanic membrane only. No ossicular chain work is done, and no prosthesis is placed. Option D: Ossiculoplasty Involves repair or reconstruction of ossicles, often using prostheses.

Malleus-Incus disruption with tympanic membrane perforationWhile this involves both ossicular disruption and TM perforation, the combined loss is not necessarily greater than complete ossicular discontinuity with an intact membrane, as some sound may still transmit via bone conduction or residual membrane.C. Otitis Media with EffusionThis causes mild to moderate conductive hearing loss (20–35 dB) due to fluid in the middle ear, which dampens the movement of the tympanic membrane and ossicles, but does not completely block sound transmission.D. Partial fixation of stapesThis refers to early otosclerosis, which may cause progressive conductive hearing loss, but the loss is typically less than that caused by complete ossicular discontinuity.",

No air-bone gap — so it’s a pure sensorineural hearing loss, not mixed. Option B: Conductive Hearing Loss In pure conductive loss, bone conduction is normal, and only air conduction is elevated, with a clear air-bone gap.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A. 1b 2c 3d 4a The correct matching is based on anatomical proximity and pathophysiological effects of thyroid swelling on surrounding structures. A thyroid mass may compress or infiltrate nearby organs and nerves, leading to characteristic symptoms. Esophagus (1) ? Dysphagia (b): The esophagus lies posterior to the thyroid gland. Enlargement of the thyroid can press on the esophagus, leading to difficulty in swallowing. Trachea (2) ? Dyspnea (c): The trachea is anterior to the esophagus and often displaced or compressed by a large goiter, leading to respiratory difficulty. Sympathetic Chain (3) ? Horner Syndrome (d): Compression of the cervical sympathetic chain causes Horner syndrome, which includes ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (4) ? Hoarseness (a): This nerve runs in the tracheoesophageal groove and supplies intrinsic muscles of the larynx. Compression results in hoarseness due to vocal cord paralysis. Incorrect Options: Option B: 1c 2b 3d 4a This mismatches esophagus with dyspnea and trachea with dysphagia, which is anatomically incorrect. The esophagus is a digestive structure and compression causes swallowing difficulty (dysphagia), not breathing difficulty (dyspnea). The trachea, when compressed, causes dyspnea—not dysphagia. Option C: 1b 2c 3a 4d Incorrectly matches sympathetic chain with hoarseness and recurrent laryngeal nerve with Horner syndrome. This is a clear anatomical mismatch. The recurrent laryngeal nerve affects voice (hoarseness), not the sympathetic chain. The sympathetic chain involvement causes Horner syndrome, not voice change. Option D: 1b 2d 3c 4a Here, trachea is incorrectly matched with Horner syndrome, and sympathetic chain with dyspnea, which are not accurate. The trachea causes dyspnea when compressed, and the sympathetic chain—located more laterally—leads to Horner syndrome when affected.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Auditory NeuropathyAuditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) is a hearing disorder in which outer hair cell function in the cochlea is normal, but there is disruption in the transmission of sound signals from the inner ear to the brain.This condition is characterized by:Normal OAE (Otoacoustic Emissions) – indicating intact outer hair cells.Abnormal or absent BERA (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry) / CERA (Cortical Evoked Response Audiometry) – suggesting neural desynchrony.Speech perception difficulties – the patient can hear sounds but has trouble understanding speech.Medial geniculate body and cortical response loss – points to post-synaptic neural pathway involvement.These findings together are classic for auditory neuropathy, especially when there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing test results (normal OAE) and central processing tests (abnormal BERA/CERA).Incorrect Options:B. MalingeringIn malingering, test results are inconsistent, but objective tests like BERA and OAE typically show normal findings. Here, objective testing shows abnormal auditory pathway beyond the cochlea, making malingering unlikely.C. Michel AplasiaA complete absence of inner ear structures (congenital), which would result in absent OAE and BERA. But in this case, OAE is present, so Michel aplasia is ruled out.D. Cochlear otosclerosisThis involves fixation of the stapes and leads to conductive hearing loss, often with abnormal PTA and absent OAE, not the pattern seen here.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (ISLN) is responsible for sensory innervation of the mucosa of the larynx above the vocal cords, including the pyriform fossa, laryngeal inlet, and posterior surface of the epiglottis. When a foreign body like a fish bone gets lodged in the pyriform fossa, it stimulates this nerve, causing a foreign body sensation, discomfort, and sometimes referred pain or coughing. Incorrect Options: a. Recurrent laryngeal nerve – This nerve provides motor innervation to all intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except cricothyroid) and sensory innervation below the vocal cords, not the pyriform fossa. c. External branch of superior laryngeal nerve – It supplies motor fibers to the cricothyroid muscle (which tenses the vocal cords), but does not have a sensory role in the mucosa. d. Glossopharyngeal nerve – This nerve provides sensory innervation to the oropharynx, posterior third of the tongue, and tonsillar region, not the pyriform fossa, which is part of the hypopharynx.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bezold abscess Bezold abscess is a deep neck abscess that arises as a complication of mastoiditis (which itself follows an ear infection). It occurs when pus from mastoid air cells erodes through the medial aspect of the mastoid tip into the sternocleidomastoid muscle, leading to: • Neck rigidity • Trismus (lockjaw) due to irritation/inflammation of adjacent muscles • Fever and systemic toxicity • Neck swelling and tenderness It typically affects children and adolescents, especially with a delayed or poorly treated otitis media. Incorrect Options: a. Meningitis – Can cause fever and neck rigidity, but trismus and limb spasms are not typical. Also, the link to ear infection more strongly suggests a local complication rather than a generalized CNS infection. b. Tetany – Caused by hypocalcemia, leading to muscle spasms, but does not present with fever or ear infection history. Also, lockjaw is not a defining feature of tetany. d. Sinus thrombosis – May occur post-otitis media or mastoiditis (esp. lateral sinus thrombosis), but more often presents with headache, papilledema, and neurological symptoms, not primarily trismus and neck rigidity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Biopsy because it is a procedure that is contraindicated for this condition. Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma is a highly vascular tumor that is fed by blood vessels, primarily from the external carotid artery. Due to this characteristic, attempting a biopsy can trigger a massive, life-threatening hemorrhage. Therefore, a biopsy is not part of the diagnostic process. The diagnosis is instead made based on the clinical presentation (e.g., recurrent nosebleeds in an adolescent boy) and confirmed through imaging studies like CT and MRI, which reveal the tumor's location and extent without the risk of bleeding.",

The best candidates include: 1. Ototoxicity – Certain drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) can damage cochlear hair cells, causing bilateral SNHL. These patients often benefit from cochlear implants. 2. Congenital hearing loss – Children born with bilateral profound SNHL are excellent candidates, especially when implanted early (before age 2) for optimal speech and language development. Incorrect Options: 3. Ossicular fixation – This is a conductive hearing loss, often due to otosclerosis or chronic otitis media, and is best treated with surgical correction (e.g., stapedectomy) or hearing aids, not cochlear implants. 4. Otosclerosis – Early stages affect the stapes (conductive loss); later stages (cochlear otosclerosis) may involve SNHL, but cochlear implantation is rarely the first line and reserved for severe cochlear involvement, which is uncommon.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stridor in infants is a high-pitched, noisy breathing sound typically due to upper airway obstruction. The following are common causes of stridor in infants: 1. Laryngomalacia – The most common cause of stridor in infants, due to floppy supraglottic structures collapsing during inspiration. It presents as inspiratory stridor soon after birth. 3. Subglottic stenosis – A narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords, which may be congenital or acquired (post-intubation). It causes biphasic stridor and respiratory distress. 4. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) – Caused by HPV types 6 and 11, it results in wart-like growths in the airway, especially the larynx, and leads to progressive stridor and hoarseness. Incorrect Option: 2. Congenital hemangioma/polyp – While congenital hemangioma (especially subglottic) can rarely cause stridor, polyps are extremely rare in infants and not a common cause of stridor. Hence, this option is not as consistent or reliable compared to the other three.",
