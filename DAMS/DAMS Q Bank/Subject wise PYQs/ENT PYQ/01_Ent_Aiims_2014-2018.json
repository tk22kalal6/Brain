      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Internal maxillary artery. A 14-year-old boy with nasal obstruction, proptosis, and recurrent epistaxis that is not responding to anterior nasal packing is highly suggestive of Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA). Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA): Benign but highly vascular tumor that occurs exclusively in adolescent males. Arises from the sphenopalatine foramen in the posterolateral wall of the nasal cavity. Presents with recurrent, profuse epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and proptosis due to tumor extension into the orbit. Source of Bleeding – Internal Maxillary Artery (IMA): The Internal Maxillary Artery (IMA) is the main blood supply to JNA. It gives rise to the sphenopalatine artery, which is the major contributor to nasal mucosal vascularization. Since JNA is highly vascular, it is crucial to embolize the internal maxillary artery before surgical excision to reduce intraoperative bleeding. Incorrect Options: (B) Ascending pharyngeal artery This artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and contributes to the blood supply of the pharynx and skull base, but it is not the primary source of bleeding in JNA. (C) Facial artery The facial artery supplies the external structures of the face and contributes to the superficial vasculature of the nose but is not the primary source of bleeding in JNA. (D) Anterior ethmoidal artery The anterior ethmoidal artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery (from the internal carotid system) and supplies the anterior nasal septum and lateral nasal wall. It is involved in epistaxis from the anterior septum (Kiesselbach’s plexus) but not in JNA, which originates deeper in the nasal cavity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Allergic Fungal Sinusitis is the diagnosis. This condition is the most common type of fungal sinusitis, typically seen in patients presenting with nasal congestion, stuffiness, discharge, and anosmia. It results from type I and III hypersensitivity reactions to fungal antigens, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus. On CT scans, allergic fungal sinusitis is characterized by heterogeneous opacification of the sinuses due to the presence of allergic mucin mixed with fungal debris and nasal polyps. The management involves functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) combined with corticosteroids, while antifungals are reserved for invasive fungal sinusitis rather than the allergic type. Incorrect Responses: (A) Ethmoidal Polyp – This option is less likely because ethmoidal polyps typically present as homogeneously opacified soft tissue masses on CT scans and are usually associated with chronic rhinosinusitis rather than the heterogeneous appearance seen in allergic fungal sinusitis. (B) Antrochonal Polyp – An antrochoanal polyp is usually a unilateral, benign lesion arising from the maxillary sinus and extending into the nasopharynx. Its imaging features and clinical presentation differ from the bilateral, heterogeneous opacification typical of allergic fungal sinusitis. (D) Nasoethmoidal Carcinoma – Carcinoma in the nasoethmoidal region would likely present with more aggressive features such as bone destruction and localized mass effect, rather than the characteristic allergic mucin and heterogeneous sinus opacification seen in allergic fungal sinusitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cricothyroidotomy. In this case, the patient has sustained severe maxillofacial and laryngeal injuries, which have resulted in an obstruction in the patent airway and an inability to open the mouth. Given these conditions, a cricothyroidotomy would be the most appropriate emergency procedure to secure the airway. Cricothyroidotomy involves making an incision through the cricothyroid membrane to establish an airway when other methods of securing the airway, such as orotracheal intubation, are not possible due to facial or laryngeal trauma. This procedure is especially indicated in situations of severe facial trauma where access to the mouth or nose is compromised. Incorrect Options: (A) Submental endotracheal intubation This technique involves placing an endotracheal tube through a submental incision, providing an airway when there is maxillofacial trauma. However, it is not the most common or immediate procedure performed in cases of airway obstruction due to traumatic injury. A cricothyroidotomy is preferred when rapid airway access is needed. (B) Emergency tracheostomy An emergency tracheostomy is typically performed when prolonged airway management is needed, or if other less invasive procedures have failed. However, cricothyroidotomy is preferred in the acute setting due to its faster execution and lower complication rate compared to tracheostomy. (D) Subcutaneous tracheostomy This is an uncommon procedure and not typically used in emergency airway management. A subcutaneous tracheostomy would involve placing a tracheostomy tube beneath the skin, but this is not the standard technique in traumatic airway obstructions where cricothyroidotomy is preferred.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Internal carotid artery. The internal carotid artery (ICA) is not ligated in the management of epistaxis because it is a major artery supplying the brain, and ligating it could lead to severe complications like stroke or neurological deficits. While branches of the internal carotid artery (such as the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries) may be involved in epistaxis, direct ligation of the ICA itself is not an option. Instead, embolization of its branches may be performed if necessary. Incorrect Options: A. Anterior Ethmoidal Artery – Can Be Ligated The anterior ethmoidal artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery (from the internal carotid system), supplies the anterior and superior nasal septum. In cases of severe anterior epistaxis, this artery can be ligated via an external approach through the medial orbit. B. Maxillary Artery – Can Be Ligated The maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, is the main supplier of the posterior nasal cavity through its terminal branch, the sphenopalatine artery. It is frequently ligated in posterior epistaxis through an intraoral (transantral) or endoscopic approach. C. External Carotid Artery – Can Be Ligated The external carotid artery gives off the maxillary artery, which is a major contributor to nasal bleeding. In severe, intractable epistaxis, especially when other measures fail, the external carotid artery may be ligated to reduce blood flow to the nasal mucosa.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Traumatic CSF Leak (Correct Answer) The target sign (also called the halo sign or double-ring sign) is seen in a blot test performed on nasal discharge to differentiate CSF rhinorrhea from normal nasal secretions or blood. When a drop of fluid is placed on a piece of filter paper or gauze, CSF forms a clear outer ring, while blood (if present) stays in the center, creating a bullseye or target-like appearance. Traumatic CSF leaks occur due to skull base fractures, particularly involving the cribriform plate or temporal bone, leading to nasal or otorrheal CSF leakage. Incorrect Options: (B) Fracture Mastoid A mastoid fracture can lead to CSF otorrhea (CSF leakage from the ear), rather than nasal discharge. The target sign is typically used for nasal CSF leaks, making this less relevant for mastoid fractures. (C) Spontaneous CSF Leak Spontaneous CSF leaks occur due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or congenital skull base defects, often without a history of trauma. While a target sign can still be seen in these cases, it is most commonly associated with traumatic leaks, making Option A the better choice. (D) Meningoencephalocele A meningoencephalocele is a herniation of brain tissue and meninges through a skull defect, which can cause intermittent CSF leakage. While CSF rhinorrhea can occur, the target sign is more frequently used in cases of acute traumatic leaks.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Open reduction after 3 weeks In cases of fractures involving the facial bones, particularly the zygoma, orbit, or maxilla, open reduction timing is crucial. Waiting for 3 weeks allows for initial swelling to subside, making surgical correction more precise and reducing complications. After 3 weeks, fibrous union may begin, but complete bony healing has not yet occurred, making reduction still possible without extensive osteotomy. This approach is often recommended for zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures, nasal fractures, and mandibular fractures in select cases. Incorrect Options: (A) Open reduction immediately Immediate surgery is only considered in cases of severe displacement, ocular involvement (diplopia, enophthalmos), or airway compromise. Otherwise, early surgery may be difficult due to severe edema, which can obscure surgical landmarks. (B) Open reduction after 3 days Three days is often too early, as swelling may still be significant, leading to difficulties in precise fracture reduction. Surgeons usually prefer to wait 7–10 days for swelling to improve before performing open reduction. (D) Open reduction after 3 months Three months is too late, as bony healing and remodeling would have progressed, making reduction much more difficult. At this stage, osteotomies and more extensive surgical intervention may be required.",

It is classified as “non-allergic rhinitis” (Old PGI MCQ) Mostly caused by topical sympathetic agents (e.g. alpha-adrenergic agonists like xylometazoline) May rarely be produced by cocaine sniffing and benzalkonium chloride. Persistent adrenergic stimulation producing refractoriness and rebound vasodilatation may be the pathophysiology After use of topical sympathetic agents beyond 3-5 days, there is rebound vasodilatation, nasal obstruction, edema, erythema and reduced efficacy of the drug. This congestion causes the patient to increase the frequency of application and the quantity applied, resulting in dependence on topical nasal decongestants Clinical rhinoscopic examination is non-specific, showing areas of red, thickened mucosa and dull zones It is treated by withdrawal of nasal drops, short course of systemic steroid therapy and in some cases, surgical reduction of turbinates, if they have become hypertrophied (Dhingra) Both topical and systemic steroids are effective in most cases. Topical antihistamines may also be tried (Sataloff”s)",

The threshold tone decay test is simple and is performed in the following manner:A tone of 4000 Hz is presented at 5 dB above the patient's threshold of hearing, continuously for a period of 60 seconds. If patient stops hearingearlier, intensity is increased by another 5 dB. The procedure is continued till patient can hear the tone continuously for 60 seconds, or no level exists above the threshold where tone is audible for full 60 seconds.

It may occur in one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral) and can cause varying degrees of sensorineural hearing loss, although most individuals have profound hearing loss. The condition can also predispose affected individuals to recurrent meningitis. It is caused by disruption in the embryonic development of the inner ear during the seventh week of gestation.

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) A patient of cancer larynx scheduled for laryngectomy. A high-level tracheostomy is typically performed in patients who are undergoing laryngectomy (surgical removal of the larynx). This procedure is done to ensure that the patient can breathe through the tracheostomy after the larynx is removed. The tracheostomy is placed high in the neck, usually above the level of the stoma (opening) created during the laryngectomy, to help with respiratory function and maintain airway patency following the procedure. It is particularly beneficial in cases where the airway is at risk due to the removal of the vocal cords and laryngeal structures. Incorrect Options: (A) Foreign body obstruction in trachea A low tracheostomy or an emergency cricothyroidotomy would be more appropriate for managing airway obstruction caused by a foreign body in the trachea. A high-level tracheostomy would not be typically preferred for this type of acute obstruction. (B) A patient of vocal cord palsy scheduled for thyroplasty Thyroplasty is a procedure done to improve vocal cord function in patients with vocal cord paralysis, typically involving surgical alteration of the thyroid cartilage. This is not an indication for a high-level tracheostomy, as the procedure does not involve the removal of the larynx, and airway management is usually handled with standard intubation or tracheostomy at a lower level if needed. (D) A child with acute epiglottitis Acute epiglottitis involves inflammation and potential obstruction of the supraglottic structures, but high-level tracheostomy is not commonly the procedure of choice. In such cases, endotracheal intubation or, if necessary, a low tracheostomy may be performed. The airway management focuses on securing the airway as quickly as possible, usually in a lower, safer region.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Supra glottic Inspiratory stridor is a high-pitched sound during inhalation and is usually indicative of an obstruction in the upper airway. This includes areas like the supraglottic region, which is the area above the vocal cords. Supraglottic lesions (e.g., tumors, infections, swelling) cause inspiratory stridor because they obstruct the airway before the vocal cords, making it harder for air to enter the trachea during inspiration. Incorrect Options: (B) Subglottic Subglottic lesions typically cause expiratory stridor because the obstruction is below the vocal cords. This creates difficulty in exhaling air out of the trachea. Subglottic stenosis or other issues below the vocal cords will result in expiratory rather than inspiratory stridor. (C) Tracheal Lesions in the trachea (such as tracheal stenosis or tumors) can cause both inspiratory and expiratory stridor depending on the location of the obstruction. The stridor may be biphasic (heard during both inhalation and exhalation), but typically, inspiratory stridor is not the hallmark symptom unless the lesion is specifically in the upper trachea near the vocal cords. (D) Bronchial Bronchial obstructions affect the lower airways (below the trachea), and they often lead to symptoms like wheezing or difficulty breathing but not typically inspiratory stridor. Bronchial lesions cause more of an expiratory or wheezing sound due to obstruction of airflow in the bronchi.",
