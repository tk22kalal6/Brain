      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IgE release Aspirin-induced asthma (also known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease or AERD) is characterized by bronchospasm (wheezing and breathlessness) that occurs after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. While it's not a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction in the classical sense (like typical allergic asthma), the symptoms are driven by an abnormal arachidonic acid metabolism leading to the overproduction of specific leukotrienes. This mechanism leads to mast cell activation and mediator release, which clinically mimics an allergic reaction and involves pathways that can overlap with immune responses. Therefore, \"IgE release\" is often considered the closest answer among the given choices, as the downstream effects lead to similar mast cell degranulation and mediator release that cause the bronchoconstriction. Incorrect Options: Option B: Nasal polyp Explanation: Nasal polyps are a common comorbidity with aspirin-induced asthma, often part of the same syndrome (AERD). However, nasal polyps themselves do not directly cause the acute wheezing and breathlessness after aspirin ingestion. They are a symptom or associated condition, not the cause of the acute reaction. Option C: Drug interaction Explanation: While drug interactions can cause adverse effects, the specific presentation of wheezing and breathlessness after aspirin in a patient predisposed to this condition is a recognized pharmacological reaction to the drug itself, not typically classified as a general \"drug interaction\" in this context. It's a specific pseudoallergic reaction to aspirin. Option D: Extrinsic asthma Explanation: Extrinsic asthma (or allergic asthma) is typically mediated by IgE antibodies against environmental allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites). Aspirin-induced asthma is distinct from extrinsic asthma because it is a reaction to a pharmacological agent (aspirin) and is not triggered by specific allergens in the same way. It's often referred to as a \"pseudoallergy\" or \"non-allergic hypersensitivity reaction\" because it doesn't involve classic IgE antibodies against the drug itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The false statement about tonsillectomy is B. Active infection is the contraindication for the procedure. While it might seem intuitive to avoid surgery during an active infection, tonsillectomy can sometimes be performed in the presence of an active tonsillar infection if symptoms are severe and unresponsive to antibiotics, or in cases of peritonsillar abscess. In such situations, the surgery might be performed as a \"hot tonsillectomy\" (during an acute attack or abscess) or an \"interval tonsillectomy\" after initial stabilization. However, routine elective tonsillectomy is usually deferred until an acute infection has subsided to minimize bleeding risk and improve visualization, but an active infection is not an absolute contraindication in all circumstances, especially for urgent indications like airway obstruction or abscess drainage. A. The neck of the patient is hyperextended during the procedure: True. During tonsillectomy, the patient is typically positioned supine with the head extended and often a shoulder roll placed to achieve optimal exposure of the tonsils and pharynx. This hyperextension of the neck facilitates the surgeon's view and access to the surgical field. C. Reactionary hemorrhage occurs within 24 hours post tonsillectomy: True. Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage is classified by its timing. Reactionary hemorrhage (also known as primary hemorrhage) occurs within the first 24 hours after the surgery. This type of bleeding is usually due to inadequate hemostasis (control of bleeding) during the procedure or dislodgement of a clot shortly after surgery, often as blood pressure returns to normal. Secondary hemorrhage, on the other hand, typically occurs later, usually between 5 to 10 days post-operatively, and is often associated with infection or sloughing of the eschar. D. Recurrent infection is the most common indication of tonsillectomy: True. One of the primary indications for tonsillectomy, especially in children, is recurrent episodes of acute tonsillitis, which often manifest as recurrent sore throats, fever, and difficulty swallowing. Specific criteria (e.g., 7 episodes in 1 year, 5 episodes/year for 2 years, or 3 episodes/year for 3 years) are often used to determine the necessity of surgery for recurrent infections. Other major indications include obstructive sleep apnea due to enlarged tonsils, but recurrent infection remains a very common reason for the procedure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Right sensorineural deafness. The most appropriate diagnosis here is Right-sided sensorineural deafness. This conclusion is drawn mainly from the absolute bone conduction test, which is reduced on the right, directly indicating sensorineural involvement on that side. The Weber test lateralizes to the left, which is exactly what happens in right sensorineural hearing loss because the sound is perceived better in the healthy ear. Although the Rinne test is negative on the left, this can be explained by a phenomenon called a false negative Rinne: in cases of profound sensorineural deafness in the opposite ear, the bone-conducted vibrations may be heard by the good cochlea, giving the illusion that bone conduction is better than air conduction on the opposite side. This makes the left side appear falsely as having conductive deafness, even though the true pathology lies in the right cochlea. Therefore, when interpreting all the tests together, the most reliable indicator is the reduced bone conduction on the right, supported by Weber lateralization, pointing towards right sensorineural deafness. Thus, option D is the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Conductive hearing loss) The audiogram (left graph) displays a significant air-bone gap, meaning there's a substantial difference (greater than 15 dB) between the air conduction thresholds (represented by 'X' marks, indicating hearing through the outer, middle, and inner ear) and the bone conduction thresholds (represented by '<' symbols, indicating hearing directly through the inner ear). The air conduction thresholds are elevated (indicating hearing loss), while the bone conduction thresholds are within normal limits (close to 0-10 dB HL). This pattern is the hallmark of conductive hearing loss, where sound transmission is impaired in the outer or middle ear, but the inner ear is functioning correctly. The tympanogram (right graph) shows a flat or very reduced peak (appearing as a blue shaded area with minimal or no peak). This indicates very low compliance of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and/or middle ear system, consistent with a middle ear pathology that obstructs sound transmission. This type of tympanogram (often classified as Type B or a severe Type C with very low compliance) is highly characteristic of conductive hearing loss. Incorrect Options: Option (A. Noise induced trauma) Explanation: Noise-induced hearing loss is typically a sensorineural hearing loss. This means both air conduction and bone conduction thresholds would be elevated, with little to no air-bone gap. Furthermore, it often presents with a characteristic \"notch\" in the audiogram around 3000-6000 Hz, which is not clearly depicted here. Option (C. Mixed Hearing loss) Explanation: Mixed hearing loss involves both a conductive and a sensorineural component. This would be indicated by an air-bone gap AND elevated bone conduction thresholds. In the given audiogram, the bone conduction thresholds are within normal limits, ruling out a significant sensorineural component. Option (D. Sensorineural Deafness) Explanation: Sensorineural deafness (or sensorineural hearing loss) results from damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve. In this case, both air conduction and bone conduction thresholds would be elevated, with no significant air-bone gap. The audiogram clearly shows a large air-bone gap and normal bone conduction, which contradicts sensorineural deafness.",

Functions of the Cuff: 1. Prevents Aspiration: The cuff seals the airway, reducing the risk of saliva, gastric contents, or secretions entering the lungs. 2. Ensures Effective Positive Pressure Ventilation: In mechanically ventilated patients, the cuff prevents air from leaking around the tube, allowing full delivery of ventilatory support. 3. Stabilizes the Tube: Helps keep the tracheostomy tube in place, especially in restless or critically ill patients. 4. Improves Oxygenation: By preventing air leak, it ensures accurate oxygen delivery.",
