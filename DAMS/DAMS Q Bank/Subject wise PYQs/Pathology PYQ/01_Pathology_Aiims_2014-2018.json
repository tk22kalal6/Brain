      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ref.: Robbins and Cotran, 9th edition Klinefelter syndrome is best defined as male hypogonadism that occurs when there are two or more X chromosomes and one or more Y chromosomes. It is one of the most frequent forms of genetic disease involving the sex chromosomes as well as one of the most common causes of hypogonadism in the male. The incidence of this condition is approximately 1 in 660 live male births. Klinefelter syndrome can rarely be diagnosed before puberty, particularly because the testicular abnormality does not develop before early puberty. Most patients have a distinctive body habitus with an increase in length between the soles and the pubic bone, which creates the appearance of an elongated body. Also characteristic are eunuchoid body habitus with abnormally long legs; small atrophic testes often associated with a small penis; and lack of such secondary male characteristics as deep voice, beard, and male distribution of pubic hair. Gynecomastia may be present. The mean IQ is somewhat lower than normal, but mental retardation is uncommon. There is increased incidence of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome that gives rise to insulin resistance. Curiously, mitral valve prolapse is seen in about 50% of adults with Klinefelter syndrome. There is also an increased incidence of osteoporosis and fractures due to sex hormonal imbalance. Gynaecomastia in Klinefelter's syndrome has 30% risk of development of breast cancer",

The distended phagocytic cells, known as Gaucher cells, are found in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, and Peyer patches. Similar cells may be found in both the alveolar septa and the air spaces in the lung. In contrast to other lipid storage diseases, Gaucher cells rarely appear vacuolated but instead have a fibrillary type of cytoplasm likened to crumpled tissue paper. Gaucher cells are often enlarged, sometimes up to 100 µm in diameter, and have one or more dark, eccentrically placed nuclei. Periodic acid–Schiff staining is usually intensely positive. With the electron microscope the fibrillary cytoplasm can be resolved as elongated, distended lysosomes, containing the stored lipid in stacks of bilayers",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ref.: Robbins and Cotran, 9th edition All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are highly associated with translocations of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 that lead to increased MYC protein levels. MYC is a master transcriptional regulator that increases the expression of genes that are required for aerobic glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect. The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells, the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages. These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic “starry sky” pattern. When the bone marrow is involved, aspirates reveal tumor cells with slightly clumped nuclear chromatin, two to five distinct nucleoli, and royal blue cytoplasm containing clear cytoplasmic vacuoles.",

Interestingly, the presence of isolated cervical nodal metastases does not have a significant influence on prognosis, which is generally good. Most carcinomas are single nodules that move freely with the thyroid gland during swallowing and are not distinguishable on examination from benign nodules.

They are abundant near blood vessels and nerves and in subepithelial tissues, which explains why local immediate hypersensitivity reactions often occur at these sites. Mast cells have cytoplasmic membrane-bound granules that contain a variety of biologically active mediators. The granules also contain acidic proteoglycans that bind basic dyes such as toluidine blue. (Mast in German refers to fattening of animals, and the name of these cells came from the erroneous belief that their granules fed the tissue where the cells were located.) Mast cells (and their circulating counterpart, basophils) are activated by the cross-linking of high-affinity IgE Fc receptors; in addition, mast cells may also be triggered by several other stimuli, such as complement components C5a and C3a (called anaphylatoxins because they elicit reactions that mimic anaphylaxis), both of which act by binding to receptors on the mast cell membrane.",

During the second week: - There is continued collagen accumulation and fibroblast proliferation. - The leukocyte infiltrate, edema, and increased vascularity are substantially diminished. - The process of “blanching” begins, accomplished by increasing collagen deposition within the incisional scar and the regression of vascular channels.",

Grossly, these tumors form firm, gray masses. Microscopically, they are comprised of an admixture of dense and loose areas referred to as Antoni A and Antoni B areas, respectively. The dense eosinophilic Antoni A areas often contain spindle cells arranged into cellular intersecting fascicles. Palisading of nuclei is common and “nuclear-free zones” that lie between the regions of nuclear palisading are termed Verocay bodies. In the loose, hypocellular Antoni B areas the spindle cells are spread apart by a prominent myxoid extracellular matrix that may be associated with microcyst formation.",

The liver is slightly enlarged, tense, and cyanotic, with rounded edges. Microscopically there is congestion of centrilobular sinusoids. With time, centrilobular hepatocytes become atrophic, resulting in markedly attenuated liver cell plates. Left-sided cardiac failure or shock may lead to hepatic hypoperfusion and hypoxia, causing ischemic coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes in the central region of the lobule (centrilobular necrosis). In most instances the only clinical evidence of centrilobular necrosis or its variants is transient elevation of serum aminotransferases, but the parenchymal damage may be sufficient to induce mild to moderate jaundice. The combination of hypoperfusion and retrograde congestion acts synergistically to cause centrilobularhemorrhagic necrosis. The liver takes on a variegated mottled appearance, reflecting hemorrhage and necrosis in the centrilobular regions. This finding is known as nutmeg liver due to its resemblance to the cut surface of a nutmeg.",

C3a is released, and C3b becomes covalently attached to the cell or molecule where complement is being activated. More C3b then binds to the previously generated fragments to form C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to release C5a and leave C5b attached to the cell surface. C5b binds the late components (C6­C9), culminating in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, composed of multiple C9 molecules).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bouin's solution. Bouin's solution is commonly used for preserving testicular biopsies. It is a fixative that contains a mixture of picric acid, formaldehyde, and acetic acid, which provides excellent preservation of tissue structure and cellular detail. This solution is especially useful for preserving testicular tissue and is recommended for both histological evaluation and sperm analysis. It helps in maintaining the integrity of testicular architecture, making it an ideal choice for testicular biopsy specimens. Incorrect Options: A. 95% Ethanol While ethanol is commonly used as a fixative for some types of tissue samples, it is not the best choice for preserving testicular tissue. Ethanol can cause tissue dehydration and may lead to poor preservation of cellular structure, which can hinder the pathologist's ability to evaluate the biopsy. It is more commonly used for preserving specimens for molecular analysis, rather than for histopathological examination of testicular tissue. B. 10% Formalin 10% Formalin is a widely used fixative for most tissue types, but it is not the preferred choice for testicular biopsies. Formalin works well for many types of tissue, but it may not preserve testicular tissue as optimally as Bouin's solution, especially for structures like spermatozoa. Bouin's solution is considered superior for preserving testicular tissue for histopathological evaluation. D. Zenker’s solution Zenker's solution is a fixative that contains mercury, potassium dichromate, and acetic acid, but it is not commonly used for testicular tissue. While it is effective for preserving some types of tissue, especially muscle and other organs, its use is limited due to the toxicity of mercury and the fact that it does not provide the best preservation for testicular tissue. Therefore, it is not the ideal fixative for a testicular biopsy specimen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Posterior pituitary tumors Ref: Robbins 9/epg 1162 MEN-1, or Wermer syndrome, is a rare heritable disorder with a prevalence of about 2 per 100,000. MEN-1 is characterized by abnormalities involving the parathyroid, pancreas, and pituitary glands; thus the mnemonic device, the 3Ps. Parathyroid: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common manifestation of MEN-1 (80% to 95% of patients) and is the initial manifestation of the disorder in most patients, appearing in almost all patients by age 40 to 50. Parathyroid abnormalities include both hyperplasia and adenomas. Pancreas: Endocrine tumors of the pancreas are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with MEN-1. These tumors are usually aggressive and often present with metastatic disease. It is not uncommon to find multiple “microadenomas” scattered throughout the pancreas in conjunction with one or two dominant lesions. MEN-1-associated pancreatic endocrine tumors are often functional; however, because pancreatic polypeptide is the most commonly secreted product, manyumors fail to produce an endocrine hypersecretion syndrome. Among those that do, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (associated with gastrinomas) and hypoglycemia and neurologic manifestations (associated with insulinomas) are most common. Pituitary: The most frequent anterior pituitary tumor encountered in MEN-1 is a prolactinoma; some patients develop acromegaly from somatotrophin-secreting tumors. It is now recognized that the spectrum of this disease extends beyond the 3Ps. The duodenum is the most common site of gastrinomas in individuals with MEN-1 (far in excess of the frequency of pancreatic gastrinomas), and synchronous duodenal and pancreatic tumors may be present in the same individual. In addition, carcinoid tumors, thyroid and adrenocortical adenomas, and lipomas are more frequent than in the general population.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) High estrogen Endometriotic lesions are heavily influenced by high estrogen levels, which play a central role in their pathogenesis and persistence. Estrogen stimulates the proliferation of the ectopic endometrial tissue, promoting its growth and maintenance. This hormonal dependence explains why endometriosis is more prevalent in women of reproductive age, when estrogen levels are higher, and tends to regress after menopause, when estrogen levels decline. Additionally, endometriotic lesions can produce their own local estrogen through the upregulation of the enzyme aromatase, further driving lesion growth. This estrogen dominance is the hallmark of endometriosis, making A the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) High progesterone: Progesterone typically acts as an antagonist to estrogen's effects, promoting decidualization and atrophy of endometrial tissue. In endometriosis, there is often a phenomenon of progesterone resistance, where the tissue does not respond adequately to progesterone. This contributes to the persistent growth of the lesions despite normal or elevated progesterone levels. Thus, high progesterone is not characteristic of endometriosis, making this option incorrect. (C) High cholesterol: While cholesterol serves as a precursor for steroid hormones like estrogen, elevated cholesterol is not directly related to the pathology of endometriotic lesions. Endometriosis is primarily driven by the hormonal environment, specifically estrogen, rather than cholesterol levels. This makes this option incorrect. (D) High levels of prolactin: Prolactin is a hormone primarily involved in lactation and does not play a direct role in the growth or maintenance of endometriotic lesions. While high prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) may cause menstrual irregularities, it is not associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) AIRE Ref. Robbins and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease, 9th edition In developing T cells, random somatic gene rearrangements generate diverse TCRs. Such antigen-independent TCR generation produces many lymphocytes that express high-affinity receptors for self antigens. When immature lymphocytes encounter the antigens in the thymus, many of the cells die by apoptosis. This process, called negative selection or deletion, is responsible for eliminating self-reactive lymphocytes from the T-cell pool. A wide variety of autologous protein antigens, including antigens thought to be restricted to peripheral tissues, are processed and presented by thymicantigenpresenting cells in association with self MHC molecules and can, therefore, be recognized by potentiallyself-reactive T cells. A protein called AIRE (autoimmune regulator) stimulates expression of some “peripheral tissue-restricted” self antigens in the thymus and is thus critical for deletion of immature T cells specific for these antigens. Mutations in the AIRE gene are the cause of an autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. In the CD4+ T-cell lineage, some of the cells that see self antigens in the thymus do not die but develop into regulatory T cells",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization). FISH is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting chromosomal translocations, such as the t(11;22) translocation, which is characteristic of Ewing’s sarcoma. This technique uses fluorescently labeled probes that bind to specific DNA sequences on the chromosomes involved in the translocation. The ability of FISH to directly visualize the translocation within the tumor cells makes it particularly effective in confirming the diagnosis. FISH is relatively rapid and can be performed on both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, making it a practical tool for clinical diagnostics. Its utility in detecting specific translocations makes it a gold standard in many laboratories for diagnosing Ewing's sarcoma and other tumors associated with recurrent genetic alterations. Incorrect Options: A. Conventional karyotyping While karyotyping can detect large chromosomal abnormalities and translocations, it has limitations in sensitivity and resolution. It requires dividing cells, which can be challenging to obtain from a solid tumor like Ewing's sarcoma. Additionally, karyotyping might not always identify smaller or cryptic translocations, such as t(11;22), with the same accuracy as FISH. B. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Although NGS is a powerful tool for detecting a wide range of genetic alterations, including translocations, it is typically more complex, time-consuming, and expensive compared to FISH. NGS is not the standard method for diagnosing specific translocations like t(11;22) in Ewing’s sarcoma in routine clinical settings due to these practical limitations. D. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) PCR can be used to detect specific fusion genes resulting from the t(11;22) translocation (e.g., EWSR1-FLI1 fusion). However, it requires prior knowledge of the exact fusion sequence, and different primers are needed for different fusion variants. PCR also lacks the ability to visualize the translocation in its chromosomal context, which can be crucial for diagnostic confirmation.",

Explanation: This pedigree displays several key features of X-linked recessive inheritance: only males are affected across multiple generations (II-3, III-5, IV-1), affected males (like II-3) can have unaffected sons (like III-3), and unaffected mothers (like II-5 and III-2) can transmit the trait to their sons (III-5 and IV-1, respectively). The complete absence of affected females and the clear transmission pattern through carrier mothers strongly point to this mode of inheritance over autosomal recessive (which would likely show affected females) or dominant patterns (which would not skip generations or appear from two unaffected parents). Y-linked is ruled out because affected fathers do not pass the trait to all their sons.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Seminiferous tubules The seminiferous tubules are one of the most well-known immune-privileged sites in the body. This privilege is necessary to protect developing sperm cells (spermatogenesis) from immune system attack. During puberty, sperm develop unique antigens that the immune system may recognize as foreign, as these antigens were not present during immune system development. The blood-testis barrier, formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells, isolates the seminiferous tubules from the immune system, preventing immune cells and antibodies from accessing developing sperm. This specialized microenvironment is essential for normal spermatogenesis, making the seminiferous tubules one of the most immune-privileged sites. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Loop of Henle: The loop of Henle, part of the nephron in the kidney, is not an immune-privileged site. Its primary function is in concentrating urine and regulating electrolyte balance. It does not require protection from the immune system, as it is not involved in processes that would elicit an immune response. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (C) Optic nerve: While the eye is considered an immune-privileged site, the optic nerve itself is not fully immune-privileged. Immune privilege in the eye is mainly restricted to the anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina, where inflammation could lead to vision loss. The optic nerve is more vulnerable to immune-mediated damage, as seen in conditions like optic neuritis. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) Area Postrema: The area postrema is part of the brain, located in the medulla oblongata, and plays a role in detecting toxins in the blood to trigger vomiting. It lacks a blood-brain barrier (BBB), allowing it to sense circulating substances, but this also means it is not an immune-privileged site. Its lack of immune privilege further excludes it from being the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tumor of neuroendocrine cell Tumors of neuroendocrine cells are not germ cell tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) originate from neuroendocrine cells, which are specialized cells found in various organs like the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. These tumors include carcinoid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma, and pancreatic NETs. Their origin is fundamentally different from that of germ cell tumors, which arise from primordial germ cells and are most commonly found in the gonads or extragonadal sites like the mediastinum. This distinction makes D the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Teratoma: Teratomas are germ cell tumors composed of tissues derived from all three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. They can be mature (benign) or immature (malignant). Teratomas can occur in both gonadal (testis or ovary) and extragonadal locations. Since teratomas are derived from germ cells, this option is incorrect. (B) Embryonal carcinoma: Embryonal carcinomas are malignant germ cell tumors that are highly aggressive and undifferentiated. They typically occur in the testis or ovary and are characterized by their primitive appearance, reflecting their origin from early-stage germ cells. As a germ cell tumor, this option is incorrect. (C) Germinoma: Germinomas are malignant germ cell tumors that most commonly occur in the gonads (testis or ovary) or midline structures such as the pineal gland or mediastinum. They are highly sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As germ cell tumors, this option is incorrect.",

Hyperhomocystinemia • The mechanism by which hyperhomocysteinemia predisposes to thrombosis is unclear; however, potential mechanisms include endothelial activation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, changes in endothelial nitric oxide production, or changes in endothelial sterol metabolism. • Congenital hyperhomocysteinemia is most commonly due to mutations affecting the cystathion ?-synthase (CBS) gene or the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene",

(warfarin present in rat poison) • Warfarin-induced skin necrosis (or, more generally, Anticoagulant-induced skin necrosis) is a condition in which skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis (tissue death) occurs due to acquired protein C deficiency. • Warfarin inactivates vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. At the same time, Vitamin K dependent proteins C and S are inactivated. • Half the activated Protein C disappears within 6 hours (its half-life). So, Protein C runs out during the first few days of warfarin therapy, before Factor X and II disappear, which have half-lives of 2-5 days.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B,C) Ref: Robbins 9th Ed/54,65,76 Explanation: The process of adhesion/attachment and transmigration is regulated by complementary molecules on WBCs and endothelium. The adhesion molecules mainly include Selectins and Integrins, with some role of immunoglobulins and mucin-like glycoproteins as well. Selectins are receptorsexpressed on leukocytes and endothelium that contain an extracellular domain that binds sugars (hence the lectin part of the name). The three members of this family are E-selectin (also called CD62E), expressed on endothelial cells; P-selectin (CD62P), present on platelets and endothelium; and L-selectin (CD62L), found on the surface of most leukocytes. The ligands for selectins are sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides bound to glycoprotein backbones. The endothelial selectins are typically expressed at low levels or not at all on unactivated endotheliumand are upregulated after stimulation by cytokines and other mediators. Therefore, binding of leukocytes is largely restricted to the endothelium at sites of infection or tissue injury (where the mediators are produced). Integrins are transmembrane two-chain glycoproteins that mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium and of various cells to the extracellular matrix. They are normally expressed on leukocyte plasma membranes in a low-affinity form and do not adhere to their specific ligands until the leukocytes are activated by chemokines. Chemokines are chemoattractant cytokines that are secreted by many cells at sites of inflammation, bind to endothelial cell proteoglycans, and are displayed at high concentrations on the endothelial surface. When the rolling leukocytes encounter the displayed chemokines, the cells are activated, and their integrins undergo conformational changes and cluster together, thus converting to a high-affinity form<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image(993).png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acute rejection of a graft occurs when the recipient's immune system recognizes the transplanted organ as foreign and mounts an immune response against it. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which happens within minutes to hours due to pre-existing antibodies, acute rejection is primarily mediated by T-cells and typically manifests within a broader timeframe. While it can occur at any point, the highest risk and most common period for acute rejection is from the first week after the transplant up to about three months. Therefore, among the given options, \"6 weeks\" falls squarely within this frequently observed window, making it the most appropriate answer for when acute rejection commonly takes place. Although it can extend to several months, 6 weeks represents a peak incidence for such episodes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Seminoma Seminoma is the most common type of germ cell tumor in adult men, typically presenting as painless scrotal swelling. On gross examination, seminomas appear as homogeneous, gray-white, lobulated masses without hemorrhage or necrosis. Microscopically, seminomas are characterized by sheets of uniform cells with clear cytoplasm, well-defined cell borders, and central nuclei with prominent nucleoli, often described as having a \"fried-egg appearance.\" These tumors are also infiltrated by lymphocytes and may show fibrous septa. Seminomas are highly sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with an excellent prognosis when treated early. Their typical histological and gross appearance aligns with the description provided, making B the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Lymphoma: Lymphoma is the most common testicular tumor in men over 60 years of age, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma being the typical subtype. Grossly, it may resemble seminomas but often has a softer consistency. Microscopically, lymphoma is characterized by sheets of atypical lymphoid cells, often positive for markers like CD20 (B-cell marker). Unlike seminomas, lymphomas lack the characteristic clear cytoplasm and fibrous septa. Additionally, lymphomas often present bilaterally, which is less common for seminomas. This makes lymphoma an incorrect answer. (C) Germ cell tumor: While seminomas are a subtype of germ cell tumors, the broader category of germ cell tumors includes other types such as embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, teratoma, and choriocarcinoma. These other types have distinct gross and microscopic features: Embryonal carcinoma: Poorly differentiated, with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Yolk sac tumor: Schiller-Duval bodies are present. Teratoma: Multiple tissue types (e.g., cartilage, glands). Choriocarcinoma: Hemorrhagic with syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts. Since seminoma is a specific subtype with a defined histological appearance, \"germ cell tumor\" is too broad to be correct. (D) Metastasis: Metastatic tumors to the testis are rare. When they occur, they are usually secondary to cancers such as prostate, lung, or gastrointestinal tract carcinomas. Grossly and microscopically, metastases would reflect the histology of the primary tumor rather than seminoma’s distinctive features. The absence of such features in the description makes this option incorrect.",
