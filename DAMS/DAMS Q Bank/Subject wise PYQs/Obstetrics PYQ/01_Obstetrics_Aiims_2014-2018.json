The recommended dosage for PPH prevention is a single 100 ?g dose, administered either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). For IV administration, the dose should be given slowly over one minute. This administration should occur as soon as possible after the delivery of the infant, preferably before the removal of the placenta. This dosing regimen is supported by various clinical guidelines and studies, highlighting its efficacy in reducing the need for additional uterotonics and minimizing blood loss.",

It looks like a thin, flat ring around the placenta. This is usually a benign and incidental finding, with no impact on the pregnancy or fetal growth. Placenta Circumvallata: Here, the fetal membranes fold back over the edge of the placenta, forming a thick, prominent white ring. The chorionic plate is significantly smaller than the basal plate.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Spinal anesthesia is now widely regarded as a safe and effective option for cesarean delivery in patients with severe preeclampsia, provided there are no contraindications such as coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. Recent studies have demonstrated that while spinal anesthesia may cause hypotension, this is typically less frequent and less severe in preeclamptic patients compared to healthy parturients. Moreover, any hypotension that does occur is usually short-lived and easily managed with vasopressors like ephedrine . A. General anesthesia (GA) is incorrect because it is associated with increased risks in preeclamptic patients, including difficult airway management, aspiration, and hypertensive responses during intubation. GA is generally reserved for situations where neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated or in emergencies. C. Epidural anesthesia is incorrect in this context because, although it offers gradual onset and hemodynamic stability, it has a slower onset compared to spinal anesthesia. In urgent situations requiring rapid anesthesia, spinal anesthesia is preferred due to its quick onset and reliability. D. Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) is incorrect because, while it combines the benefits of both techniques, it may not offer significant advantages over spinal anesthesia alone in the context of preeclampsia. Additionally, CSE may introduce complexities without substantial benefit in this specific scenario. Therefore, spinal anesthesia is currently considered the preferred anesthetic technique for cesarean delivery in patients with severe preeclampsia, balancing efficacy and safety.",
