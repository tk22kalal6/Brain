      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is a known cause of atrioventricular (AV) block, particularly first-degree or higher-degree AV blocks, due to the generalized slowing of metabolic activity, including effects on the cardiac conduction system. In hypothyroid states, there is reduced sympathetic tone and diminished myocardial excitability, which can lead to bradycardia, prolonged PR interval, and even more severe conduction disturbances like second-degree or complete AV block. These conduction abnormalities are usually reversible with appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Therefore, recognizing hypothyroidism as a reversible cause of AV block is important in the clinical setting. B. Hyperthyroidism – Incorrect: Hyperthyroidism typically leads to increased sympathetic activity and causes tachyarrhythmias, such as sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, rather than conduction delays or AV block. It generally accelerates the conduction system rather than impairing it. C. Cushing syndrome – Incorrect: Cushing syndrome results from excess cortisol, which can lead to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and an increased risk of arrhythmias, but it is not a direct cause of AV block. The most common cardiac effects are metabolic and hypertensive complications, not conduction abnormalities. D. Pheochromocytoma – Incorrect: Pheochromocytoma leads to catecholamine excess, causing paroxysmal hypertension, tachycardia, and other signs of heightened sympathetic activity. Like hyperthyroidism, it is more likely to cause tachyarrhythmias than bradycardia or AV block.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypokalemia Hypokalemia is associated with various electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, one of which is pseudo P pulmonale—a term describing tall peaked P waves resembling the pattern seen in true P pulmonale, which is usually caused by right atrial enlargement. In hypokalemia, these peaked P waves occur without actual atrial enlargement, hence the term \"pseudo.\" The mechanism is related to altered atrial conduction due to low extracellular potassium, which affects myocardial repolarization and depolarization dynamics. Additional ECG findings in hypokalemia include flattened or inverted T waves, U waves, ST depression, and prolonged QT interval. Recognizing pseudo P pulmonale in the context of hypokalemia is crucial for timely diagnosis and correction of the electrolyte disturbance. B. Hyperkalemia – Incorrect: Hyperkalemia causes different ECG changes, including peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, flattened P waves, and eventually sine wave pattern in severe cases. It does not cause pseudo P pulmonale, as P waves are typically reduced or absent in hyperkalemia. C. Hypocalcemia – Incorrect: Hypocalcemia primarily affects the QT interval, causing its prolongation due to delayed ventricular repolarization. It has no significant effect on P wave morphology, and does not cause pseudo P pulmonale. D. Hypernatremia – Incorrect: Hypernatremia may lead to neurological symptoms due to cellular dehydration but does not typically result in specific ECG changes like pseudo P pulmonale. Its effects on cardiac conduction are minimal and non-specific.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Continuous involvement of bowel Crohn's disease is characterized by segmental, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, often with \"skip lesions\", meaning areas of normal bowel between segments of diseased bowel. This is in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which typically involves the colon in a continuous fashion starting from the rectum. Therefore, the statement that Crohn's disease involves the bowel continuously is not true, making it the correct answer. The discontinuous nature of Crohn's is a hallmark feature and plays a role in differentiating it from other inflammatory bowel diseases. A. Sparing of rectum area – Correct: Crohn's disease often spares the rectum, which is another distinguishing feature from ulcerative colitis, where rectal involvement is almost always present. This supports the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease. C. Responds to antibiotic – Correct: Crohn's disease may respond to certain antibiotics such as metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, especially in cases involving perianal disease or bacterial overgrowth. While not first-line, antibiotics can be a useful adjunct in management. D. Creeping fat – Correct: Creeping fat is a classic pathological feature of Crohn's disease, where mesenteric fat wraps around the bowel wall due to chronic inflammation. It is often seen during surgery or on imaging and helps in identifying Crohn’s disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Patient requires colectomy within one year of diagnosis It is not true that a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) requires colectomy within one year of diagnosis. Most patients with UC are managed medically for long periods and do not require colectomy in the first year. Colectomy is typically considered when the disease is medically refractory, results in severe complications, or leads to cancer risk, but it is not a routine necessity within the first year. Therefore, this statement is incorrect and is the right answer. B. Steroid resistant cases require surgery – Correct: In cases of steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis, where the disease does not improve despite high-dose steroid treatment, surgical intervention is often required. These patients may require a colectomy to manage the disease effectively, particularly when medical therapy fails. C. Extraintestinal manifestations treated by steroid – Correct: Ulcerative colitis is associated with extra-intestinal manifestations such as arthritis, uveitis, or erythema nodosum. These manifestations are typically treated with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive treatments, as they are part of the systemic inflammatory process. D. Almost 20% require surgery – Correct: It is estimated that 20-30% of patients with ulcerative colitis will require surgery at some point due to disease severity, complications, or refractory disease. Surgery is usually considered when medical management fails or in the presence of complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pulmonary artery stenosis The most characteristic cardiovascular defect seen in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is pulmonary artery stenosis, often involving the branch pulmonary arteries. Congenital rubella, especially when the infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, interferes with fetal organ development. The virus damages endothelial cells and disrupts vascular development, leading to narrowing of the pulmonary arteries. In addition to pulmonary artery stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is also commonly seen. These cardiovascular defects are part of the classic CRS triad, which also includes sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities such as cataracts. Pulmonary artery stenosis is considered particularly characteristic and helps in distinguishing CRS from other congenital infections. B. Coarctation of aorta – Incorrect: Coarctation of the aorta is not typically associated with congenital rubella syndrome. It is more commonly linked to Turner syndrome and other genetic conditions. It does not form part of the classic cardiac features of CRS. C. Rheumatic fever – Incorrect: Rheumatic fever is an acquired inflammatory disease that occurs after streptococcal infection and is not congenital. It can cause valvular heart disease (especially mitral stenosis), but it is unrelated to CRS and is not a congenital cardiovascular defect. D. Transposition of great arteries – Incorrect: Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a cyanotic congenital heart defect that results from abnormal embryological development of the great vessels. It is not characteristically seen in CRS and is not part of its typical cardiovascular manifestations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypothermia Osborn J waves, also known as J waves or camel-hump waves, are most characteristically seen on ECG in cases of hypothermia, typically when the core body temperature falls below 32°C (89.6°F). These are positive deflections that occur at the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment, most prominent in the precordial leads (V2–V5). The underlying mechanism involves delayed ventricular repolarization due to low temperatures, which alters ion channel function. Osborn waves are considered an important diagnostic clue in hypothermic patients and may also be accompanied by other ECG changes such as bradycardia, prolonged PR, QRS, and QT intervals, and atrial or ventricular arrhythmias in severe cases. B. Hyperkalemia – Incorrect: Hyperkalemia typically causes tall, peaked T waves, flattened or absent P waves, widened QRS complexes, and in severe cases, a sine wave pattern. It does not produce Osborn waves. C. Hypocalcemia – Incorrect: Hypocalcemia is associated with a prolonged QT interval due to delayed ventricular repolarization. It does not lead to the appearance of Osborn J waves. D. Hypokalemia – Incorrect: Hypokalemia shows ECG findings like flattened T waves, prominent U waves, and ST segment depression, but it does not produce J waves. The classic ECG marker for hypokalemia is the presence of U waves rather than Osborn waves.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Single culture positive for Coxiella burnetii According to the modified Duke criteria, which are used for diagnosing infective endocarditis, a single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii or an anti-phase I IgG antibody titer ≥1:800 is considered a major criterion. Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a fastidious intracellular organism and one of the few pathogens for which a single positive blood culture (or serology) is sufficient to fulfill the major criterion. This reflects the organism's difficulty to culture and its strong association with culture-negative endocarditis. Recognizing Coxiella burnetii as a major diagnostic marker is essential due to its distinct microbiological characteristics and clinical implications. A. Single culture positive for HACEK – Incorrect: While the HACEK group (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella) are recognized causes of infective endocarditis and are included under the major criteria when two separate positive blood cultures are present, a single positive culture is not sufficient to meet the major Duke criteria. C. Single positive culture for Clostridium – Incorrect: Clostridium species are not typically associated with infective endocarditis and are more often considered contaminants unless multiple cultures or clinical context supports infection. A single positive culture for Clostridium does not meet major criteria for endocarditis. D. Both A and B – Incorrect: Only option B (single positive culture for Coxiella burnetii) fulfills a major Duke criterion. Option A requires two positive cultures, so both A and B together is not the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dilated cardiomyopathy Chronic alcohol abuse is a well-established cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In alcoholic cardiomyopathy, prolonged and excessive alcohol intake exerts direct toxic effects on the myocardium, leading to ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function. This results in a reduced ejection fraction and symptoms of congestive heart failure such as dyspnea, fatigue, and edema. The mechanism involves alcohol-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. Importantly, early recognition and abstinence from alcohol can halt or even partially reverse the myocardial dysfunction in some cases. A. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – Incorrect: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder characterized by asymmetric septal hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, not associated with alcohol consumption. It is unrelated to toxic or lifestyle factors like chronic alcohol use. C. Pericarditis – Incorrect: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardial sac, often caused by infections, autoimmune diseases, or post-myocardial infarction syndromes. It is not typically linked to chronic alcohol abuse and does not cause dilated ventricles. D. Myocarditis – Incorrect: While myocarditis can result from toxins, including alcohol, the more common causes are viral infections. Alcohol may contribute indirectly to myocardial inflammation, but in chronic alcohol abuse, the predominant effect is dilation and systolic dysfunction, consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, not isolated myocarditis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HOCM (Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy) The murmur of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) increases in intensity upon standing because standing causes venous pooling, which leads to decreased preload (less blood returning to the heart). In HOCM, the obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract is dynamic and worsens when the heart is smaller due to less filling, as the anterior mitral leaflet moves closer to the hypertrophied interventricular septum, increasing the obstruction. This mechanism causes the systolic murmur to become louder with maneuvers that reduce preload, such as standing or Valsalva maneuver. This behavior is unique to HOCM and is a key clinical clue in differentiating it from other systolic murmurs. B. MR (Mitral Regurgitation) – Incorrect: The murmur of mitral regurgitation is typically holosystolic and best heard at the apex, radiating to the axilla. It does not increase with standing; in fact, increased preload (e.g., squatting or leg raising) can make it more prominent. Standing usually causes a decrease in murmur intensity. C. MS (Mitral Stenosis) – Incorrect: Mitral stenosis causes a diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex with the patient in left lateral decubitus position. Its intensity does not increase on standing, and it is not preload-dependent in the same dynamic way as HOCM. D. VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) – Incorrect: The murmur of a ventricular septal defect is pansystolic and best heard at the lower left sternal border. It is usually unchanged or decreases with standing, as decreased preload results in less left-to-right shunting, hence a softer murmur.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Left atrium In mitral stenosis, the most commonly enlarged cardiac chamber is the left atrium due to the increased pressure load from obstruction of blood flow through the narrowed mitral valve. This chronic pressure overload leads to left atrial hypertrophy and dilation. On a barium swallow, an enlarged left atrium can be seen as an impression or posterior displacement of the esophagus, since the left atrium lies directly anterior to the esophagus. This radiographic finding is a classic indirect sign of left atrial enlargement, commonly used before widespread availability of echocardiography. B. Right atrium – Incorrect: The right atrium may enlarge in conditions involving tricuspid valve disease or chronic pulmonary disease, but it is not the primary chamber affected in mitral stenosis. It also does not significantly impact the esophagus on imaging. C. Left ventricle – Incorrect: The left ventricle is typically normal or even small in mitral stenosis, since less blood reaches it due to the narrowed mitral valve. There is no significant hypertrophy unless another condition like aortic stenosis or systemic hypertension is also present. D. Right ventricle – Incorrect: Right ventricular hypertrophy can occur secondary to pulmonary hypertension caused by long-standing mitral stenosis, but it is not the initial or most prominent change. Also, the right ventricle lies anteriorly and does not affect the esophagus, so it wouldn’t be seen on a barium swallow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is a pathway between atria and ventricle in WPW syndrome The bundle of Kent is an abnormal accessory conduction pathway that directly connects the atria to the ventricles, bypassing the atrioventricular (AV) node. This bundle is characteristic of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, a type of pre-excitation syndrome. In WPW, the impulse travels rapidly through the bundle of Kent instead of the slower AV node, resulting in early activation of the ventricles. On ECG, this produces the classic short PR interval, delta wave (a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex), and widened QRS complex. The presence of this bypass tract can lead to reentrant tachyarrhythmias, making recognition and proper diagnosis of WPW critical. A. Abnormal pathway between two atria – Incorrect: An abnormal pathway between the atria (interatrial pathway) is not called the bundle of Kent. Such pathways may be seen in atrial arrhythmias like atrial flutter but are not involved in WPW syndrome. C. It is slower than AV nodal pathway – Incorrect: The bundle of Kent conducts impulses faster than the AV node because it lacks the physiologic delay found in the AV node. This is what leads to pre-excitation of the ventricles in WPW. D. None of the above – Incorrect: This option is incorrect because option B is true. The bundle of Kent is indeed a bypass tract between the atria and ventricles involved in WPW syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) PSVT (Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia) Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) is a narrow-complex tachycardia that originates above the ventricles, typically due to a reentrant circuit involving the AV node (as in AV nodal reentrant tachycardia) or an accessory pathway (as in AV reentrant tachycardia). On ECG, PSVT is characterized by a regular rhythm, rapid heart rate (typically 150–250 bpm), and narrow QRS complexes. P waves may be absent, inverted (if visible), or buried in the QRS complexes due to simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation. The sudden onset and termination of the arrhythmia is typical of PSVT, and it often presents with palpitations, dizziness, or syncope in otherwise healthy individuals. A. Atrial fibrillation – Incorrect: Atrial fibrillation presents with an irregularly irregular rhythm, absent P waves, and fibrillatory baseline waves. The rhythm in PSVT is regular, which helps differentiate it from atrial fibrillation. C. Atrial flutter – Incorrect: Atrial flutter shows a sawtooth pattern of flutter waves (especially in leads II, III, and aVF) with an atrial rate of ~300 bpm and a regular or variable ventricular response. This pattern is distinct from the regular narrow complex tachycardia seen in PSVT. D. STEMI – Incorrect: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is characterized by ST-segment elevation in specific leads, indicating acute transmural myocardial injury. It does not present as a narrow complex tachycardia and is associated with chest pain and other ischemic symptoms, not typically with the rapid regular rhythm of PSVT.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Copper In Wilson's disease, there is a genetic defect in the ATP7B gene, which impairs hepatic copper transport and biliary excretion of copper. As a result, copper accumulates in the liver, brain, cornea, and kidneys, leading to hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms. Because the body cannot eliminate copper through bile effectively, more copper is excreted via the urine. Therefore, increased 24-hour urinary copper excretion is a key diagnostic marker for Wilson’s disease. It helps distinguish Wilson’s from other liver or neuropsychiatric disorders and is especially useful when ceruloplasmin levels are borderline. B. Methyl histidine – Incorrect: Methyl histidine is a marker of muscle protein breakdown, not related to copper metabolism. It is used in metabolic studies of muscle turnover and is not elevated in Wilson’s disease. C. Tyrosine – Incorrect: Elevated tyrosine levels are seen in tyrosinemia, especially type I, which is a separate metabolic disorder involving the breakdown of amino acids, not copper. It has no diagnostic value in Wilson's disease. D. Serine – Incorrect: Serine is a non-essential amino acid involved in several metabolic processes. Its urinary excretion is not characteristic of Wilson’s disease and does not serve as a diagnostic clue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ventricular tachycardia The ECG in ventricular tachycardia (VT) typically shows wide QRS complexes, usually at a rate of 150-250 bpm, with the absence of distinct P waves. VT originates from the ventricles, leading to a rapid and abnormal ventricular rhythm. The QRS complexes are often bizarre in shape, typically wider than 120 milliseconds, due to the abnormal conduction of the electrical impulse through the ventricles. Additionally, VT may exhibit fusion beats or capture beats, where some impulses are conducted normally through the AV node, while others are blocked, causing an alternating ventricular and normal rhythm. This arrhythmia is associated with serious symptoms, including hypotension, syncope, or cardiac arrest, and requires immediate medical attention. A. Atrial flutter – Incorrect: Atrial flutter is characterized by sawtooth waves (flutter waves) at a regular rate of approximately 300 bpm, usually with a 2:1 or 3:1 conduction ratio to the ventricles. The P waves are replaced by flutter waves, and the QRS complexes remain narrow. The rhythm in VT is irregularly irregular, and there is no sawtooth pattern of atrial activity in VT. B. Atrial fibrillation – Incorrect: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is marked by an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent P waves and rapid, chaotic atrial activity. It usually leads to a variable ventricular response with a narrow QRS complex, unlike VT, which has wide QRS complexes due to ventricular origin. The ECG in AF does not show the distinct wide QRS complexes seen in VT. D. PSVT – Incorrect: Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) typically presents with a narrow QRS complex and regular rhythm, originating above the ventricles. It is usually sudden in onset and terminates abruptly, which is in contrast to the wide complex and sustained rhythm of VT. In PSVT, P waves may be hidden or inverted, but the QRS complexes are not as wide as in VT.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Herpes simplex A punched-out ulcer in the esophagus is most commonly seen in Herpes simplex virus (HSV) esophagitis. HSV infection in the esophagus leads to the formation of deep, well-defined ulcers that appear as \"punched-out\" lesions on endoscopy. These ulcers are typically surrounded by erythematous mucosa and may be associated with painful swallowing (odynophagia), fever, and chest pain. HSV esophagitis often occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those undergoing chemotherapy, but it can also affect healthy individuals in some cases. The viral cytopathic effect causes necrosis of the mucosa, resulting in these characteristic ulcerations. B. CMV esophagitis – Incorrect: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis also causes ulcerations but tends to produce larger, irregular-shaped ulcers with heaped-up edges rather than the well-demarcated, punched-out lesions seen in HSV. CMV ulcers are often more shallow and multiple, and the infection typically affects immunocompromised individuals. The diagnostic hallmark of CMV esophagitis is the presence of inclusion bodies (cytomegalic cells) on histology. C. Candidiasis – Incorrect: Candidiasis of the esophagus causes white plaques that are often seen on endoscopy, rather than punched-out ulcers. The lesions are typically shallow and can be scraped off to reveal erythematous mucosa underneath. Candidiasis may occur in patients with immunocompromised states, such as those with diabetes or HIV. The appearance is not as well-defined or ulcerative as in HSV or CMV infections. D. GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) – Incorrect: GERD does not cause punched-out ulcers in the esophagus. Instead, it is characterized by erosions, inflammation, and ulcerations of the lower esophagus, often with the formation of fissures or linear ulcers. GERD is typically associated with acid reflux from the stomach and does not have the well-defined, deep ulcers that are characteristic of HSV infection.",

It is primarily based on three laboratory values: serum creatinine, bilirubin, and INR (International Normalized Ratio). Serum creatinine is included in the MELD score because it is a marker of renal function, and kidney dysfunction is common in patients with severe liver disease. Elevated serum creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which is a key factor in assessing prognosis in these patients. The MELD score has been shown to predict mortality in cirrhotic patients, and serum creatinine is an important predictor of poor outcomes in liver failure. B. Transaminase – Incorrect: While transaminases (AST and ALT) are important markers of liver injury, they are not included in the MELD score. The MELD score focuses on the severity of end-stage liver disease and includes factors that are more predictive of liver dysfunction, such as bilirubin and serum creatinine, rather than enzymes reflecting acute injury. C. Albumin – Incorrect: Albumin is a marker of liver synthetic function and is often used in assessing chronic liver disease severity, but it is not directly included in the MELD score. The MELD score focuses more on the acute aspects of liver dysfunction (such as bilirubin, creatinine, and INR) rather than chronic synthetic capacity as reflected by albumin levels. D. Alkaline phosphatase – Incorrect: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme typically elevated in conditions like cholestasis or biliary obstruction, but it is not included in the MELD score. The MELD score does not include markers of biliary disease or cholestasis, focusing instead on renal function, bilirubin levels, and coagulopathy to assess liver function and predict outcomes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aortic regurgitation A water hammer pulse (also known as Corrigan's pulse) is most commonly seen in aortic regurgitation (AR). In AR, the aortic valve does not close properly, leading to backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. This results in a rapid increase in stroke volume during systole, followed by a sharp decline in pressure during diastole. The characteristic water hammer pulse occurs due to the forceful ejection of blood during systole, followed by a rapid collapse of the pulse in diastole. On palpation, the pulse is bounding and may be easily felt due to the wide pulse pressure. B. Mitral stenosis – Incorrect: Mitral stenosis is associated with obstruction to left ventricular filling during diastole. This leads to increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary congestion rather than the bounding pulse seen in aortic regurgitation. In mitral stenosis, the pulse is typically not described as water hammer. C. Aortic stenosis – Incorrect: In aortic stenosis, there is a narrowed aortic valve, which causes obstruction to blood flow from the left ventricle. This results in a slow-rising pulse with a narrow pulse pressure, rather than the bounding, rapid collapse seen in aortic regurgitation. The pulse in aortic stenosis is more commonly described as parvus et tardus (weak and delayed). D. Left ventricular failure – Incorrect: In left ventricular failure, there may be reduced stroke volume and impaired circulation, but it does not typically cause the water hammer pulse. Instead, left ventricular failure leads to weak, slow pulses, as the heart is unable to generate an adequate forceful ejection of blood. The bounding pulse is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, not left ventricular failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bulging of tricuspid valve during the isovolumetric contraction phase The ‘c’ wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP) is caused by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during the isovolumetric contraction phase of the right ventricle. When the right ventricle begins to contract but the pulmonary valve has not yet opened, the closed tricuspid valve is pushed slightly upward (toward the right atrium), causing a brief rise in right atrial pressure. This pressure increase is transmitted back to the jugular vein and is seen as the ‘c’ wave on the JVP waveform. It is a transient upward deflection and follows the ‘a’ wave, which represents atrial contraction. B. Atrial systole – Incorrect: Atrial systole causes the ‘a’ wave, not the ‘c’ wave. The ‘a’ wave occurs due to right atrial contraction, which pushes blood into the right ventricle just before ventricular systole begins. C. Passive filling of ventricle – Incorrect: Passive ventricular filling corresponds with the ‘y’ descent in the JVP waveform, which follows the opening of the tricuspid valve and reflects blood flowing from the right atrium into the right ventricle. It is not associated with the 'c' wave. D. Atrial relaxation – Incorrect: Atrial relaxation contributes to the ‘x’ descent, which follows the ‘a’ wave and represents a fall in atrial pressure as the atrium relaxes and the base of the heart moves downward during ventricular contraction. This is different from the pressure increase seen in the 'c' wave.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) DC cardioversion The presence of a hemodynamically unstable arrhythmia—as evidenced by hypotension (BP 80/40 mmHg) and feeble pulse—in a 70-year-old male with comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes necessitates immediate synchronized DC cardioversion. The rhythm disturbance is likely a tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, supraventricular tachycardia, or ventricular tachycardia), leading to compromised cardiac output. In such cases, pharmacologic treatment is not appropriate as the first step because the patient is unstable. Synchronized DC cardioversion is the treatment of choice in unstable tachyarrhythmias to rapidly restore normal sinus rhythm and stabilize the patient. A. IV adenosine – Incorrect: Adenosine is used for stable supraventricular tachycardias (SVT). However, it is not suitable when the patient is hemodynamically unstable, as it may delay definitive management. Also, it is ineffective in most atrial fibrillation or flutter cases. B. IV Diltiazem – Incorrect: Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is used to control ventricular rate in stable atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, but it is contraindicated in hypotension or hemodynamic instability, as it can further lower blood pressure. D. Ibutilide – Incorrect: Ibutilide is an antiarrhythmic used to convert atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm in stable patients, but it is not indicated in emergency settings with unstable vitals. It also carries a risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, especially in critically ill patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) High LDL According to the NCEP-ATP III (National Cholesterol Education Program – Adult Treatment Panel III) guidelines, high LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is not a component of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The five defining criteria include: central obesity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and elevated fasting glucose. LDL cholesterol levels are important for overall cardiovascular risk assessment, but they are not included as one of the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome under NCEP-ATP III. A. Hypertriglyceridemia – Incorrect: Elevated triglyceride levels (≥150 mg/dL) are one of the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. It reflects an altered lipid profile and increased cardiovascular risk associated with insulin resistance. C. Central obesity – Incorrect: Central obesity, defined by increased waist circumference (≥102 cm in men, ≥88 cm in women for Western populations), is a core component of metabolic syndrome and reflects visceral fat accumulation, which is closely linked to insulin resistance. D. Hypertension – Incorrect: A blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg or current use of antihypertensive medication is part of the diagnostic criteria. Elevated blood pressure is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular events and commonly coexists with other features of metabolic syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vitamin B12 deficiency Vitamin B12 deficiency is the most likely consequence following resection of the ileum, as the terminal ileum is the primary site of vitamin B12 absorption, which occurs via intrinsic factor-mediated transport. The jejunal resection may contribute to malabsorption of other nutrients, but the loss of the ileum is specifically critical for vitamin B12 and bile salt absorption. Without adequate B12 absorption, the patient may eventually develop megaloblastic anemia, neurological deficits (e.g., paresthesia, ataxia), and glossitis. The deficiency typically becomes clinically apparent several months after surgery, once body stores of B12 are depleted. B. Constipation – Incorrect: Constipation is not a typical feature after resection of the ileum or jejunum. In fact, patients with short bowel syndrome often suffer from diarrhea or malabsorption, not constipation, due to the reduced absorptive surface area and rapid intestinal transit. C. Gastric ulcer – Incorrect: While stress-related mucosal injury or ulceration can occur in trauma patients, ileal and jejunal resection does not directly predispose to gastric ulcer formation. Ulcers are more related to gastric acid secretion, NSAID use, or H. pylori infection. D. GI bleeding – Incorrect: Gastrointestinal bleeding is not a direct or inevitable result of small bowel resection. Though bleeding may occur due to trauma, the question emphasizes long-term consequences of resection, in which malabsorption syndromes, not bleeding, are the key issues.",

The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypothyroidism, both of which are autoimmune disorders, increasing the risk of developing other autoimmune conditions like celiac disease. Symptoms of watery diarrhea and weight loss strongly suggest malabsorption, and celiac disease is a leading cause of malabsorption in such a clinical context. Anti-gliadin antibodies (along with anti-tTG and EMA) help confirm the diagnosis. Identifying celiac disease early is crucial for dietary intervention (gluten-free diet) and preventing complications. B. Thyroid Function Test – Incorrect: Though the patient has hypothyroidism, rechecking thyroid function tests would not explain watery diarrhea and weight loss unless hyperthyroidism was suspected, which is inconsistent with known hypothyroidism. C. Stool Microscopy – Incorrect: Stool microscopy is useful in identifying infectious causes of diarrhea, but this patient has chronic symptoms with weight loss and associated autoimmune diseases, pointing more towards a malabsorptive or autoimmune etiology than an acute infection. D. 72-Hour Fecal Fat – Incorrect: While this test is a good measure of fat malabsorption, it is a non-specific test. It does not help pinpoint the cause of malabsorption.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fecal Calprotectin Fecal calprotectin is a sensitive and non-invasive marker used to differentiate between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils during inflammation. Its presence in stool indicates neutrophilic inflammation in the intestinal mucosa, as seen in conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In contrast, patients with functional disorders like IBS will have normal fecal calprotectin levels, as there is no true mucosal inflammation. This test is especially useful to decide if more invasive investigations like colonoscopy are warranted. B. Stool Occult Blood – Incorrect: While stool occult blood can detect bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, it is not specific for inflammation and may be positive in malignancy, hemorrhoids, or peptic ulcers. It cannot reliably differentiate between IBD and IBS. C. Fecal Elastase – Incorrect: Fecal elastase is used to assess exocrine pancreatic function and is helpful in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic insufficiency, not bowel inflammation. D. 72-Hour Fecal Fat Estimation – Incorrect: This test is used to evaluate fat malabsorption (steatorrhea), which can occur in malabsorptive syndromes, but it does not differentiate between inflammatory and functional bowel diseases. It’s more useful in diagnosing conditions like celiac disease or chronic pancreatitis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Oral anticoagulants In a patient with mitral stenosis who develops an irregularly irregular pulse (suggestive of atrial fibrillation), the risk of thromboembolic events, especially stroke, is significantly elevated—even if no thrombus is visualized on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This is because mitral stenosis leads to left atrial enlargement, resulting in blood stasis, which predisposes to clot formation. Oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) are therefore indicated to prevent stroke, irrespective of the current presence or absence of a visible thrombus. The goal is to maintain a target INR of 2.0–3.0. This is a Class I recommendation in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation. A. Aspirin – Incorrect: Aspirin is not sufficient as monotherapy for stroke prevention in patients with valvular atrial fibrillation, particularly rheumatic mitral stenosis. It does not provide adequate anticoagulation to prevent embolic stroke in this high-risk group. C. Heparin – Incorrect: While heparin may be used acutely, it is not practical or recommended for long-term stroke prevention due to the need for parenteral administration and monitoring. Long-term management requires oral anticoagulants. D. Aspirin + Clopidogrel – Incorrect: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may be used in some non-valvular AF patients who cannot tolerate anticoagulants, but it is less effective than warfarin and is not recommended in valvular atrial fibrillation, such as that seen with mitral stenosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tricuspid stenosis The most likely diagnosis is tricuspid stenosis, as suggested by the presence of fatigue, palpitations, a prominent ‘a’ wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP), and a mid-diastolic murmur. Tricuspid stenosis causes obstruction to blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle during diastole, leading to right atrial enlargement, which manifests as a prominent 'a' wave in the JVP. The mid-diastolic murmur is best heard at the lower left sternal border and is often accentuated with inspiration (Carvallo’s sign). The fatigue is due to reduced cardiac output, and palpitations may result from associated atrial arrhythmias due to atrial dilation. A. Mitral stenosis – Incorrect: Mitral stenosis also causes a mid-diastolic murmur, but it is heard best at the apex, not along the left sternal border. It does not cause a prominent 'a' wave in JVP, as it affects the left side of the heart. Additionally, mitral stenosis would present with pulmonary symptoms (e.g., dyspnea), not prominent JVP features. C. Mitral regurgitation – Incorrect: This condition leads to a holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex and radiating to the axilla. It does not cause a mid-diastolic murmur or a prominent 'a' wave in JVP, as it does not affect right atrial pressure. D. Tricuspid regurgitation – Incorrect: Tricuspid regurgitation typically causes a holosystolic murmur, not a diastolic one. It also causes a prominent v wave (not 'a' wave) in the JVP due to systolic regurgitation of blood into the right atrium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Enoxaparin The patient presents with recurrent substernal chest discomfort suggestive of unstable angina, a form of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without elevated cardiac biomarkers (normal Troponin T). The fact that the chest pain is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and the ECG shows LVH with flat T waves (which may indicate ischemia), further supports the diagnosis. Additionally, the patient is diabetic, hypertensive, and dyslipidemic—all major risk factors for coronary artery disease. In this setting, even without troponin elevation, guidelines recommend initiation of anticoagulation (e.g., enoxaparin) to reduce the risk of thrombus progression and myocardial infarction. This is part of the standard management of unstable angina/NSTEMI, along with anti-platelets, beta-blockers, nitrates, and statins. A. IV nitroglycerin – Incorrect: While IV nitroglycerin can be used for pain relief in unstable angina, it's generally reserved for ongoing or severe chest pain, hypertension, or pulmonary edema. Since the patient responds to sublingual nitrates, IV nitroglycerin is not necessary at this stage and does not address the underlying thrombotic risk. B. Increase metoprolol to 100 mg – Incorrect: Up-titration of beta-blockers should be done cautiously, especially in the acute setting. There's no evidence of inadequate rate control or blood pressure issues here. Increasing metoprolol does not directly address the acute coronary syndrome or thrombosis risk. D. Add clopidogrel – Incorrect: The patient is already on aspirin, and while dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel is often added, anticoagulation is a higher priority in the acute setting of suspected unstable angina. DAPT would typically be added in conjunction with, not in place of, anticoagulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) The patient's presentation — sudden, severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back, along with hypotension — is highly suggestive of an acute aortic dissection, particularly involving the ascending aorta (Stanford type A). In hemodynamically unstable patients, the next best investigation is Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE). TEE is fast, can be done at the bedside, and provides excellent visualization of the thoracic aorta, especially the ascending portion and aortic root. It is highly sensitive and specific for aortic dissection and does not require the patient to be moved or have stable hemodynamics, unlike CT angiography. B. CT Angiography – Incorrect: Although CT angiography is the gold standard in hemodynamically stable patients due to its high resolution and wide availability, it requires contrast administration and patient transport to the CT scanner.

These markers are highly sensitive and specific for detecting myocardial injury and are crucial for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Elevated cardiac markers, particularly troponins, confirm myocardial injury, while normal levels help rule out an acute MI and direct further investigation toward non-cardiac causes of chest pain. A. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) – Incorrect: While TEE is an excellent tool for diagnosing conditions like aortic dissection or valvular abnormalities, it is not the first step in evaluating chest pain with ST-T changes. The initial assessment should focus on ruling out myocardial infarction or other causes of myocardial injury, which can be done with cardiac markers. TEE may be used later if other causes of chest pain, such as aortic dissection, are suspected.",

Pellagra is characterized by the three D's: diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia. This condition can occur due to insufficient dietary intake of niacin or the amino acid tryptophan (which is converted into niacin). In severe cases, if left untreated, it can lead to death. The key symptoms — gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea), skin changes (dermatitis), and neurological effects (dementia) — point directly to a niacin deficiency. A. B1 (Thiamine) – Incorrect: Thiamine deficiency is associated with beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Beriberi presents with symptoms of neuropathy, edema, and cardiovascular issues like heart failure, while Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by ataxia, confusion, and memory impairment. Thiamine deficiency does not cause the triad of symptoms seen in this patient (diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia). B. B2 (Riboflavin) – Incorrect: Riboflavin deficiency leads to ariboflavinosis, which presents with symptoms like sore throat, cracks or sores on the lips (cheilosis), and inflammation of the tongue (glossitis), but does not cause the classic symptoms of diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia seen in niacin deficiency. D. B12 (Cobalamin) – Incorrect: Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to pernicious anemia and neurological symptoms, such as peripheral neuropathy, demyelination, and memory loss.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ACE inhibitors In a pregnant hypertensive female, ACE inhibitors (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme inhibitors) should be discontinued immediately. ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril, are contraindicated during pregnancy due to their teratogenic effects, particularly during the second and third trimesters. They can cause renal dysfunction, oligohydramnios, and fetal death. Therefore, they should be replaced with safer antihypertensive medications during pregnancy, such as methyldopa or labetalol. B. CCB (Calcium Channel Blockers) – Incorrect: Calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine and amlodipine, are considered safe to use during pregnancy. They help control blood pressure by relaxing the vascular smooth muscles and are not associated with significant teratogenic effects. Therefore, there is no need to discontinue a calcium channel blocker in a hypertensive pregnant woman. C. Labetolol – Incorrect: Labetalol is a beta-blocker and alpha-blocker combination that is commonly used in the management of hypertension during pregnancy. It is considered safe in pregnancy and is often preferred for managing gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. It does not need to be changed in this scenario. D. Alpha-methyl dopa – Incorrect: Alpha-methyl dopa (or methyldopa) is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that is safe to use during pregnancy. It has been used for many years as a first-line antihypertensive for pregnant women. It is an appropriate medication for managing hypertension in pregnancy and does not need to be changed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chlorthalidone In a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and peripheral edema, chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, is the most appropriate choice. Diuretics like chlorthalidone are effective in reducing fluid retention and peripheral edema. These medications help decrease the extra fluid volume by promoting urinary excretion of sodium and water. In ESRD, patients often experience fluid overload, and chlorthalidone can be beneficial in managing this condition while also helping control blood pressure. A. Beta blocker – Incorrect: While beta blockers (e.g., metoprolol, carvedilol) are useful for controlling blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular events, they do not specifically address fluid overload or edema. Additionally, in ESRD, beta blockers need to be used cautiously, as renal dysfunction can affect their metabolism, potentially leading to higher drug levels and side effects. They are not the first-line option for managing edema in ESRD. C. Prazosin – Incorrect: Prazosin is an alpha-1 antagonist primarily used for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is not the ideal choice for managing peripheral edema in ESRD. While it can lower blood pressure, it does not have significant effects on fluid balance or edema management, making it less effective for this specific scenario. D. Aliskiren – Incorrect: Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor that works by blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Although it can reduce blood pressure, it is not particularly effective for fluid management and edema. Additionally, aliskiren is contraindicated in patients with diabetic nephropathy and should be used with caution in patients with ESRD due to the potential for hyperkalemia and renal function deterioration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Octreotide with albumin In a patient with chronic alcoholism, abdominal distension, serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dl, icterus, and normal BP (130/80 mmHg), the most likely diagnosis is ascites due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The management of ascites in these patients typically includes the use of octreotide (a somatostatin analog) and albumin. Octreotide is used to reduce portal hypertension by inhibiting the release of vasodilators such as glucagon and serotonin, which helps reduce splanchnic vasodilation and ascitic fluid formation. Albumin is given to help expand the circulating volume and improve renal perfusion. In cirrhosis with ascites, the low albumin levels contribute to third-spacing of fluid and poor circulation, leading to complications such as hepatorenal syndrome. Therefore, the combination of octreotide with albumin is the appropriate treatment to manage ascites and prevent renal complications in this setting. A. 0.9% NS IV infusion – Incorrect: While normal saline (0.9% NS) is commonly used for fluid resuscitation, it is not the best choice for this patient. In a patient with cirrhosis and ascites, excessive fluid administration with normal saline could lead to fluid overload and worsen the ascites. Albumin is a better choice to manage this condition, as it will help correct the circulatory dysfunction that contributes to ascitic fluid formation. B. Thiazide – Incorrect: Thiazide diuretics are generally not recommended in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, especially when renal dysfunction is present (creatinine 1.8 mg/dl in this case). Thiazides are less effective in cirrhotic patients, as they have poor renal perfusion and often require loop diuretics for adequate diuresis. Moreover, thiazides can worsen electrolyte imbalances in these patients. C. Torsemide – Incorrect: Torsemide, a loop diuretic, is typically used in cirrhosis-related ascites and can help manage fluid retention. However, the correct initial treatment in this patient involves octreotide and albumin to address the underlying portal hypertension and ascitic fluid buildup, rather than relying solely on a diuretic. Torsemide can be used later as part of the diuretic regimen, but it is not the first choice for this specific scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) IV NTG (Nitroglycerin) The patient is presenting with acute dyspnea (shortness of breath), high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg), and findings suggestive of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. In this case, the acute onset of dyspnea with hypertension points toward acute heart failure (HF) or hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema. The most effective treatment to manage this condition is IV nitroglycerin (NTG). Nitroglycerin (NTG) works by reducing preload (by venodilation), thus decreasing the volume of blood returning to the heart and reducing pulmonary congestion. It also provides afterload reduction by causing arterial dilation, which helps to lower blood pressure and improves cardiac output. IV NTG is particularly beneficial in acute heart failure and pulmonary edema, especially in hypertensive patients, as it works rapidly to decrease the load on the heart and alleviate symptoms of pulmonary congestion (such as dyspnea). A. Oxygen + Antibiotics – Incorrect: While oxygen may be necessary to improve oxygenation in cases of pulmonary edema or hypoxia, the primary treatment in this case is focused on reducing the blood pressure and relieving pulmonary congestion, not treating infection. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is a clear suspicion of pneumonia or another bacterial infection, which is not the case here. B. Inhaled Salbutamol – Incorrect: Inhaled salbutamol is a bronchodilator used for conditions like asthma or COPD exacerbations, but it does not address the underlying issue of pulmonary edema or hypertension. In this case, the primary pathology is likely heart failure with pulmonary edema due to poor blood pressure control, and salbutamol will not improve the cardiogenic nature of the pulmonary congestion. D. Oxygen + Salbutamol – Incorrect: Again, salbutamol would not be the correct treatment for pulmonary edema or hypertensive emergency. Oxygen can help manage hypoxia, but salbutamol will not significantly alleviate the underlying cause of the patient's dyspnea, which is likely due to fluid accumulation in the lungs from poor cardiac function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IV Amiodarone The patient is presenting with chest discomfort and palpitations, and the ECG likely shows a ventricular arrhythmia or another form of arrhythmic disorder such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Since the blood pressure is stable (120/70 mmHg) and there is no immediate threat to life, the next step in management should be a pharmacological approach to stabilize the rhythm. IV amiodarone is the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can effectively manage both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It is typically used in acute settings, especially when the patient is symptomatic with chest discomfort and palpitations. IV amiodarone is preferred for its rapid onset of action in acute arrhythmia management, particularly for ventricular arrhythmias or severe supraventricular arrhythmias that are not immediately life-threatening but require prompt control. A. DC Shock – Incorrect: A direct current (DC) shock is indicated in cases of life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). However, the patient's blood pressure is stable (120/70 mmHg) and there is no indication of a severe or life-threatening arrhythmia requiring immediate electrical cardioversion. Therefore, DC shock is not appropriate at this point unless the patient deteriorates or develops more severe symptoms. C. Oral Amiodarone – Incorrect: Oral amiodarone is usually used for chronic management of arrhythmias or for long-term prevention of recurrent arrhythmias. Since the patient is presenting with an acute episode of arrhythmia, IV amiodarone is the better choice for immediate control. Oral amiodarone is slower to take effect and would not provide the rapid stabilization needed in this situation. D. IV Metoprolol – Incorrect: IV metoprolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly used for controlling rate in arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia. However, in this case, the ECG findings (which are not specified here but might indicate a more complex arrhythmia) may require a more comprehensive antiarrhythmic like amiodarone for rhythm control. Beta-blockers are not typically used as the first-line treatment for all arrhythmias, especially in acute settings where amiodarone offers a broader spectrum of action.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 5 years or 21 years whichever is longer In this case, the 11-year-old patient presented with fever, polyarthritis, and a history of sore throat 45 days ago. The investigation shows that the patient tested positive for streptococcus and has a raised ESR. Echo findings show no valvular disease or carditis, and there is no history of prior rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Given this clinical presentation, the patient likely has acute rheumatic fever (ARF) with no evidence of valvular damage. According to current guidelines for rheumatic fever prophylaxis, the patient should receive benzathine penicillin every 3 weeks for 5 years, or until the age of 21 years, whichever is longer. This recommendation is based on the fact that the patient is under 21 years old and has no evidence of established rheumatic heart disease, so the goal is to prevent recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever that could lead to the development of rheumatic heart disease. The rationale behind 5 years or 21 years is that the period of prophylaxis continues at least until the patient reaches adulthood (age 21). Since rheumatic fever occurs more commonly in children and adolescents, and given the absence of heart disease, the 5 years or until 21 years of age provides appropriate protection during the period of risk. B. 10 years or 21 years whichever is longer – Incorrect: The 10-year period is not recommended for individuals with no prior evidence of rheumatic heart disease. For those who have had valvular damage from rheumatic fever (RHD), a longer duration of prophylaxis (up to 10 years or even lifelong) may be recommended, but in this patient, there is no evidence of carditis or past RHD. The correct duration of prophylaxis for this case is 5 years or until 21 years, not 10 years. C. Single dose – Incorrect: A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics is insufficient for a patient with rheumatic fever. The purpose of prophylaxis is to prevent further streptococcal infections and recurrent episodes of rheumatic fever, which could lead to rheumatic heart disease. Given this patient's presentation with acute rheumatic fever (with symptoms like fever and polyarthritis), the prophylaxis should be continued on a regular basis, not just a one-time dose. D. Lifelong – Incorrect: The lifelong prophylaxis is generally reserved for patients who have developed rheumatic heart disease due to recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In this case, since the patient has no evidence of valvular disease or a history of RHD, lifelong prophylaxis is not required. Instead, the recommended approach is a fixed duration of 5 years or until age 21.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypokalemia The patient is presenting with weakness after diuretic intake. The ECG findings of T wave inversion, ST depression, and prominent U waves are classic signs of hypokalemia. Diuretics, particularly loop diuretics or thiazides, can cause the excretion of potassium leading to a decrease in the serum potassium level, resulting in hypokalemia. In hypokalemia, potassium levels fall below normal, which affects the action potential of cardiac cells, leading to changes in the ECG. The inversion of T waves, ST depression, and the prominent U waves are all characteristic of potassium deficiency. Additionally, weakness is a common symptom due to impaired muscle function associated with low potassium levels. B. Hyperkalemia – Incorrect: Hyperkalemia is characterized by elevated potassium levels, which typically causes peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and prolonged PR intervals on the ECG. The ECG findings in this case (T wave inversion, ST depression, and prominent U waves) are not consistent with hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia would present with different ECG changes, not the ones described here. C. Hypernatremia – Incorrect: Hypernatremia refers to elevated sodium levels in the blood. While hypernatremia can lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness, confusion, and seizures, it does not typically cause the specific ECG findings seen in this patient. The ECG abnormalities associated with hypernatremia are not directly related to the T wave inversion or prominent U waves. Thus, hypernatremia is unlikely to explain the ECG findings in this case. D. Hyponatremia – Incorrect: Hyponatremia refers to low sodium levels in the blood. While it can cause neurological symptoms like confusion, nausea, and seizures, it does not typically result in the specific ECG changes seen in this case. The ECG findings of T wave inversion, ST depression, and prominent U waves are more suggestive of hypokalemia, not hyponatremia. Hyponatremia typically does not affect the ECG in the same way.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Absent a wave The patient presents with altered sensorium and an irregularly irregular pulse, which suggests the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF). In AF, the atrial contraction is disorganized and rapid, which leads to no effective atrial contraction during the irregularly irregular rhythm of the heart. The absence of the \"a wave\" on the jugular venous pulse (JVP) occurs because there is no atrial contraction to generate the \"a wave.\" The \"a wave\" typically occurs when the atria contract, contributing to the JVP, but in AF, the lack of coordinated atrial contraction results in its absence. A. Cannon a wave – Incorrect: A cannon a wave is seen in conditions where there is atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, such as third-degree heart block or ventricular tachycardia. This occurs when the atria contract against a closed tricuspid valve due to the lack of coordination between atrial and ventricular contractions. In the case of atrial fibrillation, the irregularly irregular pulse is due to the absence of coordinated atrial contractions, not due to AV dissociation. Therefore, a cannon a wave would not be seen in AF, making this option incorrect. C. Rapid y descent – Incorrect: The y descent on the JVP represents the rapid filling of the right atrium during ventricular systole. A rapid y descent is typically seen in conditions that cause increased right atrial pressure during ventricular systole, such as constrictive pericarditis or tricuspid regurgitation. In atrial fibrillation, the absence of coordinated atrial contraction leads to a disorganized flow of blood into the ventricles, but the rapid y descent is not a hallmark finding in this situation. Therefore, a rapid y descent is not expected in this case. D. Absent y descent – Incorrect: The y descent on the JVP reflects the fall in right atrial pressure during ventricular diastole as the right atrium empties. An absent y descent is typically seen in conditions such as tricuspid stenosis or pericardial disease, where there is impaired ventricular filling or impaired venous return. However, in the context of atrial fibrillation, the JVP is influenced by the lack of atrial contraction, which primarily affects the \"a wave\" rather than the \"y descent.\" While the y descent may appear blunted, it is not typically absent in atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the absence of the \"y descent\" would not be the primary finding in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ASD (Atrial Septal Defect) Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis is generally recommended for certain conditions that increase the risk of bacteremia leading to endocarditis. However, Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), which is a congenital heart defect characterized by a hole in the atrial septum, does not increase the risk of infective endocarditis significantly in the absence of other risk factors. As a result, prophylaxis is not indicated for individuals with ASD unless there are additional risk factors or complications, such as the presence of other structural heart defects or the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. The American Heart Association (AHA) no longer recommends routine antibiotic prophylaxis for most congenital heart conditions, including ASD, unless certain high-risk situations arise. B. Prior IE – Incorrect: A history of prior infective endocarditis is a strong risk factor for recurrent episodes of endocarditis. Prophylactic antibiotics are therefore recommended for individuals who have had a previous episode of infective endocarditis, especially before undergoing procedures that have a potential for causing bacteremia (such as dental or surgical procedures). This is because the risk of reinfection is higher in patients with a prior history of IE. Therefore, prophylaxis is indicated in patients with a history of infective endocarditis, making this option incorrect. C. Prosthetic valves – Incorrect: Individuals with prosthetic heart valves are at a significantly increased risk of developing infective endocarditis due to the presence of a foreign material (the prosthetic valve) within the heart, which provides a surface for bacteria to adhere to. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for patients with prosthetic valves before procedures that might cause bacteremia, such as dental procedures or invasive surgeries. This is to reduce the risk of infective endocarditis, making this option incorrect. D. Untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease – Incorrect: Cyanotic congenital heart disease is associated with a high risk of infective endocarditis due to abnormal blood flow patterns that create turbulent flow and increase the likelihood of bacterial colonization on the heart valves. For patients with untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to prevent infective endocarditis before any procedure that could cause bacteremia. This is because the abnormal blood flow in such conditions increases the risk of developing endocarditis, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ringer Lactate Ringer Lactate (also known as Lactated Ringer’s Solution) is a commonly used intravenous fluid that contains a balanced mixture of electrolytes designed to mimic the body’s plasma. It includes sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-), and lactate as the buffer. The lactate component is metabolized by the liver into bicarbonate, which helps in buffering acidosis. The specific composition of Ringer Lactate often includes: Sodium: 130-131 mEq/L Potassium: 4-5 mEq/L Calcium: 2-3 mEq/L Chloride: 109-110 mEq/L Lactate: 28-29 mEq/L This composition is suitable for fluid resuscitation in many clinical situations, including dehydration and surgical fluid replacement, and is frequently used in trauma or burn patients. Thus, the given figure's composition corresponds with Ringer Lactate, making this the correct choice. B. Isolyte P – Incorrect: Isolyte P is another type of balanced electrolyte solution but is different from Ringer Lactate in terms of its composition. It typically contains: Sodium: 140 mEq/L Potassium: 5 mEq/L Calcium: 3 mEq/L Chloride: 110 mEq/L Lactate: 28 mEq/L Although Isolyte P shares some common electrolytes with Ringer Lactate, it has different concentrations and is designed for different clinical indications. This makes it an incorrect answer when comparing the figure provided. C. Isolyte M – Incorrect: Isolyte M is yet another balanced electrolyte solution, but it differs in its composition, particularly in its higher levels of potassium and sodium. The composition of Isolyte M typically includes: Sodium: 145 mEq/L Potassium: 5 mEq/L Calcium: 2.5 mEq/L Chloride: 110 mEq/L Lactate: 27-28 mEq/L While it contains similar components, the concentrations of these electrolytes are different from Ringer Lactate, which is why it is not the correct answer. D. Hemacel – Incorrect: Hemacel is not a balanced electrolyte solution like Ringer Lactate or Isolyte solutions. It is actually a blood volume expander and contains hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a synthetic colloid used to maintain circulatory volume during hypovolemia or shock. Hemacel does not have the same electrolyte composition as the options listed above and is therefore an incorrect answer in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) SBP (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis) The patient with chronic alcoholic liver disease and ascites who develops diffuse abdominal pain and has an ascitic fluid analysis showing 600 polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs)/mm³ is most likely suffering from Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). SBP is a common and serious complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and it is characterized by infection of the ascitic fluid without an obvious source of infection. The key diagnostic criterion for SBP is the presence of >250 PMNs/mm³ in the ascitic fluid, which indicates a bacterial infection. The most common pathogens responsible for SBP in cirrhotic patients are gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, followed by gram-positive cocci like Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient's ascitic fluid analysis showing 600 PMNs/mm³ strongly suggests an infectious cause, and the presence of abdominal pain further supports the diagnosis of SBP. The management typically involves intravenous antibiotics, and prompt treatment is crucial to prevent complications like renal failure and sepsis in cirrhosis patients. A. Malignant Ascites – Incorrect: Malignant ascites occurs when cancer cells invade the peritoneal cavity, leading to the accumulation of fluid. While cancer (e.g., ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, or pancreatic cancer) can cause ascites, the fluid analysis for malignant ascites typically shows low white blood cell count, low protein levels, and a low glucose level, as well as the presence of malignant cells. The elevated PMN count (600/mm³) seen in this patient is more indicative of an infectious process rather than malignancy, making malignant ascites less likely. B. TB (Tuberculous Ascites) – Incorrect: Tuberculous ascites can occur due to peritoneal tuberculosis, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects the peritoneum, leading to fluid accumulation. However, the ascitic fluid in TB typically shows a lymphocytic predominance rather than neutrophils. The presence of 600 polymorphonuclear cells suggests an acute inflammatory process, which is more characteristic of bacterial infection (SBP) rather than tuberculosis, where the fluid would have a higher number of lymphocytes. Additionally, tuberculosis typically presents with more chronic symptoms (e.g., weight loss, fever, night sweats), and the ascitic fluid analysis would show low glucose and elevated adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels, which are not present in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute Hepatitis B The patient presents with anorexia, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain, which are classical symptoms of hepatitis. The laboratory findings further support the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B: HbsAg+ (Hepatitis B surface antigen positive): This indicates the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the bloodstream, which is a hallmark of acute or chronic HBV infection. Anti-Hbs –ve (Hepatitis B surface antibody negative): The absence of anti-HBs suggests that the patient is not yet immune to hepatitis B, which is typical in acute infection or during the early phase of infection before immunity develops. IgM Anti-HBc + (IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen positive): The presence of IgM anti-HBc is a specific marker of acute hepatitis B infection, as it indicates recent infection and active viral replication. Anti-HCV negative: This rules out hepatitis C as a cause of the symptoms, confirming the hepatitis is not due to HCV. In summary, the combination of HbsAg+, IgM anti-HBc+, and absence of anti-HBs strongly points to acute hepatitis B infection. B. Chronic Hepatitis B – Incorrect: Chronic hepatitis B is characterized by persistent or long-term infection with HbsAg+ for more than 6 months. In chronic cases, you would expect anti-HBs to eventually become positive, indicating that the patient has either cleared the infection or developed immunity. The presence of IgM anti-HBc is not typical in chronic hepatitis B, as it is a marker of acute infection. The patient also has a recent onset of symptoms, which is more consistent with acute hepatitis B, not chronic disease. C. Acute Hepatitis C – Incorrect: Acute hepatitis C can present with similar symptoms, but the laboratory findings for acute HCV infection would differ significantly. In acute hepatitis C, the anti-HCV test would be positive, indicating past or ongoing infection with the hepatitis C virus. Since the patient's anti-HCV is negative, this rules out acute hepatitis C as the diagnosis. D. Chronic Hepatitis C – Incorrect: Chronic hepatitis C is a long-standing infection that is often asymptomatic in the early stages. Laboratory findings would show anti-HCV positive and likely HCV RNA detectable in the blood. In addition, anti-HCV negative in this case excludes the possibility of chronic hepatitis C.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gluten Free Diet The patient presents with weight loss, bloating, and steatorrhea, which are classic symptoms of celiac disease, a condition triggered by an immune response to gluten. Additionally, the following findings support this diagnosis: HLA DQ2 positive: This genetic marker is commonly associated with celiac disease, making it a strong predictor for the condition. Intestinal biopsy showing villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia: These are hallmarks of celiac disease. Villous atrophy refers to the damage or flattening of the villi in the small intestine, which impairs nutrient absorption, and crypt hyperplasia is a compensatory increase in the crypts of the intestines. The treatment for celiac disease involves the strict elimination of gluten from the diet. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and its ingestion triggers the autoimmune reaction that causes the intestinal damage seen in this patient. Therefore, the dietary recommendation for this patient will be a gluten-free diet to prevent further damage and manage symptoms. B. CHO Restricted Diet – Incorrect: A CHO (carbohydrate) restricted diet is not indicated for celiac disease. The primary issue in celiac disease is the immune reaction to gluten, not to carbohydrates. While a low-carbohydrate diet may be recommended for other conditions like diabetes or insulin resistance, it is not effective in managing celiac disease. The main dietary concern for this patient is to avoid gluten-containing foods, not carbohydrates. C. High Fibre Diet – Incorrect: A high-fiber diet is generally recommended for conditions related to constipation or digestive health, but it is not specific to celiac disease. In fact, a high-fiber diet may need to be adjusted in some patients with celiac disease during the acute phase, especially if they have intestinal inflammation or malabsorption. Fiber itself does not address the underlying issue of gluten intolerance and is not the main focus of treatment in this case. D. Fat Restricted Diet – Incorrect: A fat-restricted diet is typically used in conditions such as pancreatitis or gallbladder disease, where fat digestion and absorption are impaired. While steatorrhea (fatty stools) is a symptom of celiac disease due to malabsorption, restricting fat does not address the root cause of the problem — the gluten-induced immune reaction. The primary treatment for this patient would still be a gluten-free diet, which will improve intestinal absorption and resolve steatorrhea, not a fat-restricted diet.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Obstructive jaundice The serum bilirubin levels in this patient are elevated, with a direct bilirubin level of 4 mg/dl, which indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This is commonly seen in obstructive jaundice, where bile flow from the liver to the intestine is blocked, leading to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin in the blood. The patient also has raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is a marker of cholestasis or biliary obstruction. The combination of pruritus (itching), elevated direct bilirubin, and raised ALP strongly suggests obstructive jaundice due to conditions like gallstones, biliary strictures, or pancreatic cancer that obstruct the bile ducts. B. Hemolytic jaundice – Incorrect: Hemolytic jaundice occurs when there is excessive destruction of red blood cells leading to increased unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. In this patient's case, the direct bilirubin is elevated, which points towards conjugated bilirubin rather than unconjugated bilirubin. Hemolysis typically causes an increase in unconjugated bilirubin with normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, which is not the case here. Therefore, hemolytic jaundice is unlikely in this scenario. C. Hepatitis – Incorrect: While hepatitis can cause elevated bilirubin levels, the pattern of bilirubin elevation in hepatitis is typically a mixture of both conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and it does not usually cause such a significant elevation in direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin). Additionally, hepatitis would more likely present with elevated liver enzymes like ALT and AST, rather than a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In this case, the raised ALP and significant direct bilirubin point more towards obstructive jaundice rather than hepatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Facial recognition Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a neurological condition characterized by the inability to recognize faces. This condition arises from damage to the fusiform gyrus in the brain, which is responsible for processing facial features. People with prosopagnosia can see and describe the facial features but struggle to recognize or differentiate between faces, even those of close family members or themselves. This disorder specifically affects the recognition of faces and does not impact other forms of visual processing. A. Hearing – Incorrect: Hearing loss is a condition related to the auditory system and would typically be associated with disorders like sensorineural hearing loss or conductive hearing loss, neither of which are related to prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia involves visual processing deficits, particularly the inability to recognize faces, but does not affect hearing or auditory functions. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Position sense – Incorrect: Position sense, or proprioception, refers to the body's ability to sense its position in space and is mediated by sensory receptors in the muscles and joints. Conditions like stroke, peripheral neuropathy, or spinal cord injuries might affect position sense, but prosopagnosia does not involve proprioception. The loss of position sense is unrelated to the condition of face blindness, making this option incorrect. D. Vibration – Incorrect: Vibration sense refers to the ability to perceive vibrations, often tested with a tuning fork, and is part of the somatosensory system. Loss of vibration sense may occur in conditions like peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord disorders. However, this is distinct from prosopagnosia, which primarily affects visual recognition of faces and does not involve the ability to perceive vibrations. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Antibody against NMJ receptor In myasthenia gravis, the pathology involves the formation of autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). These antibodies block, alter, or accelerate the destruction of the acetylcholine receptors, impairing the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscle. This results in muscle weakness and fatigue, which worsens with activity and improves with rest. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, specifically targeting the communication between nerves and muscles. A. Antibody against TSH receptor – Incorrect: This option is incorrect because antibodies against the TSH receptor are typically seen in Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that leads to hyperthyroidism, not myasthenia gravis. In Graves' disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excessive thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as weight loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations. Therefore, this is unrelated to the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis, making it an incorrect choice. C. Antibody against acetylcholine esterase – Incorrect: While acetylcholine esterase is involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis is not caused by antibodies against this enzyme. The issue in myasthenia gravis is that autoantibodies target the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle side of the neuromuscular junction, not the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. This makes this answer incorrect because the immune response in myasthenia gravis specifically targets the receptors, not the esterase enzyme. D. Antibody against thyroglobulin – Incorrect: This option is incorrect because antibodies against thyroglobulin are typically seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, another autoimmune disorder that causes hypothyroidism. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to inflammation and destruction of thyroid tissue, which reduces the production of thyroid hormones. This condition is unrelated to myasthenia gravis, which involves the neuromuscular junction and acetylcholine receptors, not thyroglobulin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Proprioception In Brown-Séquard syndrome, which is a hemisection (partial transection) of the spinal cord, the sensory loss on the same side (ipsilateral) of the lesion typically involves proprioception and touch. This is because the dorsal column pathway, responsible for proprioception and discriminatory touch, is disrupted on the same side of the body where the spinal cord injury occurs. The dorsal column carries sensations of vibration, proprioception, and fine touch, and since this pathway crosses at the medulla, a hemisection causes loss of these sensations on the same side as the lesion. A. Pain – Incorrect: Pain sensation is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which crosses over to the opposite side (contralateral) of the spinal cord immediately after entering. In Brown-Séquard syndrome, pain and temperature sensation will be lost on the opposite side (contralateral) of the lesion, not the same side. Therefore, pain sensation is not lost on the same side in this syndrome, making this option incorrect. B. Touch – Incorrect: While touch is lost on the same side (ipsilateral) in Brown-Séquard syndrome, it is due to the dorsal column pathway (which also carries proprioception). This is often mentioned alongside proprioception as both are part of the same pathway. However, proprioception is the more specifically affected sensation when isolating this particular option, making it the correct choice. Touch is also affected, but since proprioception more definitively describes the loss of sensory function in this syndrome, it is the more accurate answer. D. Temperature – Incorrect: Temperature sensation is also carried by the spinothalamic tract, similar to pain. Since the spinothalamic tract crosses over to the opposite side of the spinal cord, temperature sensation is lost on the opposite (contralateral) side in Brown-Séquard syndrome. It is not lost on the same side as the lesion, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Wallenberg syndrome Wallenberg syndrome, also known as lateral medullary syndrome, is caused by the obstruction or ischemia of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), which supplies the lateral medulla oblongata. This syndrome is characterized by a combination of neurological deficits, which may include: Ipsilateral (same side) loss of pain and temperature sensation on the face (due to damage to the trigeminal nerve pathway). Contralateral (opposite side) loss of pain and temperature sensation on the body (due to damage to the spinothalamic tract). Dysphagia and hoarseness (due to damage to the nucleus ambiguus, affecting the vagus nerve). Ataxia (due to damage to the cerebellum or its pathways). Nystagmus and vertigo (due to involvement of the vestibular nuclei). Thus, Wallenberg syndrome is the result of an obstruction of PICA, making this the correct answer. B. Medial medullary syndrome – Incorrect: Medial medullary syndrome, also known as Dejerine syndrome, is caused by the obstruction of the anterior spinal artery or its branches, not the PICA. It affects the medial part of the medulla and typically presents with: Contralateral hemiparesis (due to damage to the corticospinal tract). Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception (due to damage to the medial lemniscus). Ipsilateral tongue weakness (due to damage to the hypoglossal nerve nucleus). Since this syndrome is caused by a different vascular territory (the anterior spinal artery), it is not related to PICA obstruction, making this option incorrect. C. Brown-Séquard syndrome – Incorrect: Brown-Séquard syndrome is caused by a hemisection or damage to one half of the spinal cord. It results in: Ipsilateral motor paralysis and loss of proprioception (due to damage to the corticospinal tract and dorsal columns). Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (due to damage to the spinothalamic tract). This syndrome is not related to PICA obstruction, but rather to spinal cord injury, so this option is incorrect. D. Cerebellar atrophy – Incorrect: Cerebellar atrophy refers to the progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, which can result from various causes, including genetic conditions, alcoholism, and neurodegenerative diseases. It is not specifically caused by PICA obstruction. While PICA supplies the cerebellum, and obstruction may lead to cerebellar symptoms, it does not cause cerebellar atrophy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Oculomotor nerve Weber's syndrome is a type of midbrain stroke caused by a vascular lesion affecting the basis pedunculi of the midbrain, typically due to an infarction of the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery. The classic findings in Weber's syndrome are: Ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (due to damage to the oculomotor nerve or its nucleus). Contralateral hemiparesis (because of involvement of the corticospinal tract in the midbrain). The oculomotor nerve (Cranial Nerve III) is responsible for most of the eye's movements, and when affected, it leads to symptoms such as ptosis (drooping eyelid), pupil dilation (due to unopposed sympathetic stimulation), and inability to move the eye normally. Thus, the oculomotor nerve is the correct structure involved in Weber's syndrome. B. Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle – Incorrect: The inferior cerebellar peduncle is part of the cerebellum and is involved in transmitting sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and cerebellum. It is not typically associated with Weber's syndrome, which involves the midbrain and not the cerebellum. Damage to the inferior cerebellar peduncle would result in cerebellar signs such as ataxia, dysmetria, and intention tremor, but these are not features of Weber's syndrome. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Colliculus – Incorrect: The colliculi (superior and inferior) are located in the midbrain, but they are not the primary structures involved in Weber's syndrome. Damage to the superior colliculus may affect visual reflexes (e.g., saccades), and damage to the inferior colliculus may affect auditory pathways. However, in Weber's syndrome, the major involvement is in the oculomotor nerve and corticospinal tract in the midbrain, not the colliculi. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. D. Medial Geniculate Body – Incorrect: The medial geniculate body is part of the thalamus and is involved in auditory processing, as it relays auditory signals from the inferior colliculus to the auditory cortex. While lesions in the thalamus can cause sensory disturbances, the medial geniculate body is not typically affected in Weber's syndrome, which primarily involves the midbrain.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Down’s syndrome Explanation for Correct Answer: Down's syndrome (also known as trisomy 21) is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with Down's syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which carries the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This extra copy of the gene leads to overproduction of amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. As individuals with Down's syndrome age, they have a much higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's, typically presenting symptoms in their 40s or 50s. Therefore, Down's syndrome is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. A. Klinefelter's syndrome – Incorrect: Klinefelter's syndrome is a genetic condition in males caused by the presence of one or more extra X chromosomes (XXY). While Klinefelter's syndrome may be associated with certain cognitive and psychological challenges, it is not specifically a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. There is no strong evidence linking Klinefelter's syndrome with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B. Low BP – Incorrect: While low blood pressure (hypotension) may have some effects on brain function, it is not a direct risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In fact, research has shown that high blood pressure (hypertension), particularly in midlife, is a well-established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, low blood pressure may lead to issues like dizziness and fainting but does not directly contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's. Therefore, low blood pressure is not considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, making this option incorrect. D. None of the above – Incorrect: Since Down's syndrome is a well-established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, the statement \"None of the above\" is not correct. As a result, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Apo E4 Explanation for Correct Answer: Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) is a protein involved in lipid metabolism, and its different isoforms are strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease. The Apo E4 allele has been identified as a significant genetic risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. The Apo E4 isoform promotes the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's. This allele increases the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's, especially in individuals who inherit two copies of the Apo E4 gene (homozygous). Research has shown that individuals with one or two copies of Apo E4 are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's, making it the most important genetic risk factor for the disease. Therefore, Apo E4 is directly responsible for increasing the risk of Alzheimer's. B. Apo E3 – Incorrect: Apo E3 is considered the neutral allele of the Apo E gene and does not significantly increase or decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Individuals who carry the Apo E3 allele have a relatively normal risk for Alzheimer's, meaning that it is not associated with the disease in the same way as Apo E4. While Apo E3 is the most common isoform of the protein, it does not have the same detrimental effects as Apo E4, making this option incorrect. C. Apo E2 – Incorrect: Apo E2 is the least common isoform of the Apo E gene and has been found to have a protective effect against Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with Apo E2 have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's, as this allele is thought to help reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. Therefore, Apo E2 is not associated with Alzheimer's disease but may actually offer some protection, making this option incorrect. D. Apo E1 – Incorrect: There is no Apo E1 isoform. The main isoforms of the Apolipoprotein E gene are Apo E2, Apo E3, and Apo E4. Since Apo E1 does not exist, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Anterior Spinal Artery Explanation for Correct Answer: The clinical features described—acute onset left-sided weakness, loss of proprioception and vibration sense on the left side of the body, and facial sparing—are highly indicative of a medial medullary syndrome (also known as Dejerine syndrome), which is caused by an infarction in the region supplied by the anterior spinal artery. The anterior spinal artery supplies the medial portion of the medulla, where the pyramidal tract (for motor function) and medial lemniscus (for proprioception and vibration sense) are located. The deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion indicates right-sided hypoglossal nerve involvement, as the hypoglossal nerve nuclei are also located in the medulla. Thus, the anterior spinal artery is the artery most commonly involved in this type of presentation, causing both motor and sensory deficits with facial sparing. Incorrect Options: A. Middle Cerebral Artery – Incorrect: The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies most of the lateral convexity of the cerebral hemisphere, including areas responsible for motor and sensory functions of the face, arm, and hand. However, the MCA does not supply the medulla or the structures described in this case (proprioception, vibration sense, and hypoglossal nerve function). MCA involvement would typically result in contralateral hemiparesis, sensory loss, and facial involvement, unlike the facial sparing seen in this case. Therefore, the MCA is not the correct answer. B. Anterior Cerebral Artery – Incorrect: The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) supplies the medial aspect of the frontal lobes and the paracentral lobule, which is involved in motor and sensory functions of the contralateral leg and foot. ACA occlusion can cause contralateral leg weakness or sensory loss, but it does not affect the medulla or structures such as the hypoglossal nerve or medial lemniscus. Additionally, there would likely be involvement of the leg, not sparing of the face, which further rules out the ACA as the cause of this patient’s symptoms. C. Posterior Cerebral Artery – Incorrect: The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies the occipital lobe and the inferior temporal lobe, as well as portions of the thalamus and midbrain. While PCA occlusion can result in visual deficits (e.g., homonymous hemianopia) or thalamic sensory disturbances, it does not supply the medulla where the structures involved in the patient's symptoms are located. Therefore, PCA involvement is not associated with the symptoms of weakness, proprioceptive loss, and hypoglossal nerve deviation seen here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Loss of myelin sheath Explanation for Correct Answer: In multiple sclerosis (MS), the hallmark pathological feature is the immune-mediated demyelination of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). The myelin sheath, produced by oligodendrocytes, is essential for saltatory conduction, where electrical impulses jump between the nodes of Ranvier, dramatically increasing the speed of signal transmission along axons. When the myelin is lost, this rapid conduction is disrupted, leading to slowed or blocked transmission of action potentials in both motor and sensory pathways. This results in the varied neurological symptoms seen in MS, such as muscle weakness, sensory disturbances, visual problems, and coordination deficits. Thus, loss of the myelin sheath is the primary cause of slowed conduction in MS. Incorrect Options: A. Defect in node of Ranvier – Incorrect: The nodes of Ranvier are actually preserved in MS, but their function is impaired due to the absence of adjacent myelin. The defect is not inherently in the nodes themselves, but rather in the lack of insulation from myelin that disrupts their role in saltatory conduction. C. Leaking sodium channel – Incorrect: While demyelination may expose or alter the distribution of sodium channels, the fundamental problem in MS is not a primary defect in the sodium channels or their leakage. Sodium channel changes are a secondary adaptation rather than the root cause of slowed conduction. D. Oligodendrocyte – Incorrect: Although oligodendrocytes are the cells that produce and maintain myelin in the CNS and are targeted in MS, the loss of the myelin they produce—not the mere presence or absence of the oligodendrocyte—is the direct cause of conduction slowing. Hence, while oligodendrocyte injury contributes to pathology, the more accurate and specific answer is loss of myelin sheath.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Motor speech Explanation for Correct Answer: The inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere (typically the left in right-handed individuals) houses Broca’s area, which is primarily responsible for motor speech production. Damage to this area, often due to a vascular injury like a stroke, leads to Broca's aphasia, characterized by non-fluent, effortful, and grammatically impaired speech, while comprehension is relatively preserved. This condition directly affects the patient’s ability to formulate and articulate speech, making motor speech the correct functional area impacted by injury to the inferior frontal gyrus. Incorrect Options: A. Visual – Incorrect: The visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe, not in the frontal gyrus. Therefore, a lesion in the inferior frontal gyrus would not primarily affect visual function. B. Auditory – Incorrect: The primary auditory cortex resides in the superior temporal gyrus, particularly in Heschl's gyrus, not in the inferior frontal gyrus. Hence, auditory function would not be directly impacted by a lesion in the frontal region. C. Wernicke – Incorrect: Wernicke’s area, responsible for language comprehension, is located in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. Damage here results in fluent but nonsensical speech with poor comprehension, distinct from the speech production deficits caused by inferior frontal gyrus lesions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fluent aphasia Explanation for Correct Answer: Injury to the posterior end of the superior temporal gyrus, particularly in the dominant hemisphere (usually the left), affects Wernicke’s area, which is critical for language comprehension. Damage here results in fluent aphasia, also known as Wernicke’s aphasia. In this condition, speech remains fluent and grammatically correct, but it becomes nonsensical or irrelevant, and the patient has significant difficulty understanding spoken and written language. The hallmark is impaired comprehension with preserved fluency, which distinguishes it from other types of aphasia. Given the anatomical location of the lesion described (posterior superior temporal gyrus), fluent aphasia is the expected outcome. Incorrect Options: B. Non fluent aphasia – Incorrect: This is typically associated with lesions in Broca’s area, located in the inferior frontal gyrus, not the superior temporal gyrus. It is characterized by effortful, halting speech with relatively intact comprehension — a pattern inconsistent with the location of the injury described. C. Conduction aphasia – Incorrect: Conduction aphasia arises from damage to the arcuate fasciculus, the white matter tract connecting Broca's and Wernicke's areas. It is characterized by fluent speech and good comprehension, but impaired repetition. This specific tract is not located at the posterior end of the superior temporal gyrus. D. Nominal aphasia – Incorrect: Also known as anomic aphasia, this type is characterized by difficulty in word-finding, especially naming objects, while speech fluency and comprehension are largely preserved. It is typically due to lesions in various cortical regions, including the angular gyrus or inferior temporal lobe, not specifically the posterior superior temporal gyrus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Explanation for Correct Answer: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, a structural protein crucial for maintaining the integrity of muscle cell membranes. In DMD, there is a complete absence or severe deficiency of functional dystrophin due to frameshift or nonsense mutations. This results in progressive muscle degeneration, weakness (starting in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs), and loss of ambulation by adolescence. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are markedly elevated early in the disease. The absence of dystrophin is the hallmark that distinguishes DMD from other neuromuscular disorders, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B. Becker Muscular Dystrophy – Incorrect: Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) also involves the dystrophin gene, but unlike DMD, it is due to in-frame mutations, leading to reduced or abnormal dystrophin rather than complete absence. It is a milder and more slowly progressive disorder compared to DMD. C. Myotonic Dystrophy – Incorrect: This is a trinucleotide repeat disorder (CTG expansion in the DMPK gene) and is not related to dystrophin. It presents with distal muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, and other systemic features, but dystrophin levels are normal. D. Myasthenia Gravis – Incorrect: Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder involving antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. It causes fluctuating muscle weakness but does not involve dystrophin at all.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) Explanation for Correct Answer: The most probable diagnosis is Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition characterized by the classic triad of urinary incontinence, gait disturbance (ataxia), and cognitive impairment—sometimes remembered as \"wet, wobbly, and wacky.\" In this case, the patient exhibits all three hallmark features: urinary incontinence, ataxia, and memory loss with difficulty in calculations (a sign of cognitive dysfunction). NPH typically affects elderly patients and results from impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption, leading to ventricular enlargement without a corresponding increase in CSF pressure—hence the name. The diagnosis is often supported by neuroimaging (e.g., CT or MRI showing dilated ventricles) and clinical response to large-volume lumbar puncture or CSF shunting. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Vascular dementia – Incorrect: While vascular dementia can cause cognitive decline and gait disturbances, it rarely presents with the full triad of NPH and does not typically cause urinary incontinence early in the disease. It is more associated with a stepwise progression of symptoms and focal neurological deficits depending on the location of vascular insults. C. Vitamin B12 deficiency – Incorrect: Vitamin B12 deficiency may present with cognitive impairment, ataxia, and sensory deficits, but urinary incontinence is not a typical early feature. Moreover, B12 deficiency often causes peripheral neuropathy and posterior column involvement, which are not mentioned here. D. Tabes dorsalis – Incorrect: Tabes dorsalis, a form of neurosyphilis, can cause sensory ataxia and urinary incontinence, but it typically presents with lightning-like pains, positive Romberg sign, and loss of proprioception. Cognitive decline is less common and not a dominant early feature. It is also now rare due to improved syphilis detection and treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Oligodendrocyte Explanation for Correct Answer: The cell most affected in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the oligodendrocyte, which is responsible for producing and maintaining the myelin sheath in the central nervous system (CNS). MS is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, leading to slowed nerve conduction and neurological deficits. Since oligodendrocytes are the cells that form and sustain myelin in the CNS, they are directly targeted and damaged in the disease process. The destruction of oligodendrocytes results in patches of demyelination (plaques), leading to the characteristic relapsing and remitting or progressive symptoms seen in MS, such as visual disturbances, limb weakness, sensory loss, and coordination issues. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Astrocyte – Incorrect: Astrocytes are glial cells that support neurons and maintain the blood-brain barrier, but they are not the primary target in MS. They may become reactive (forming gliosis) after demyelination has occurred, but the initial and most significant cellular damage is to oligodendrocytes. C. Glial – Incorrect: This is a broad term encompassing several types of support cells in the CNS, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. While glial involvement is part of the inflammatory response, this option is non-specific and does not identify the key cell most affected, which is the oligodendrocyte.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Arachnoid Explanation for Correct Answer: In a lumbar puncture, the needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The last layer punctured before reaching this space is the arachnoid mater. The sequence of layers traversed during a lumbar puncture, from superficial to deep, includes: skin → subcutaneous tissue → supraspinous ligament → interspinous ligament → ligamentum flavum → epidural space → dura mater → arachnoid mater. Once the needle pierces the arachnoid mater, it enters the subarachnoid space, where the CSF is located. The pia mater closely adheres to the surface of the spinal cord and is not penetrated during lumbar puncture, as the procedure is typically performed at the L3–L4 or L4–L5 level, below the end of the spinal cord (conus medullaris). Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Piamater – Incorrect: The pia mater is the innermost meningeal layer, tightly bound to the spinal cord. Since the lumbar puncture is performed below the conus medullaris, the spinal cord is not punctured, and thus, the pia mater remains intact. C. Duramater – Incorrect: The dura mater is the outermost meningeal layer and is punctured before the arachnoid mater. Both the dura and arachnoid must be traversed to access the CSF in the subarachnoid space, but the arachnoid is the final barrier. D. Ligamentum flavum – Incorrect: This is a ligament located between the laminae of adjacent vertebrae. It is punctured earlier, before reaching the epidural space, dura mater, and arachnoid mater. It provides characteristic resistance during the procedure but is not the last layer punctured.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Myasthenia Gravis Explanation for Correct Answer: The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Myasthenia Gravis (MG). MG is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, a phenomenon known as fatigability. The presence of ptosis (drooping eyelids), speech disturbance (dysarthria), and generalized weakness—especially if symptoms improve after rest—is classical for MG. The underlying pathology involves autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to impaired signal transmission. Ocular and bulbar muscles are often involved early, resulting in ptosis and speech changes. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy – Incorrect: This is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of dystrophin, typically presenting in young boys, not adults. It causes progressive proximal muscle weakness, but not fluctuating weakness or improvement with rest. Ptosis and bulbar symptoms are not typical early features. B. Lambert-Eaton Syndrome – Incorrect: Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is also a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, but it is caused by autoantibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to decreased acetylcholine release. Unlike MG, in LEMS, muscle strength improves with activity, not rest. Ptosis and bulbar involvement are less common, and it is often associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, especially small-cell lung cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Medicine Overuse Headache Explanation for Correct Answer: The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is Medicine Overuse Headache (MOH), also known as rebound headache. This condition typically arises in patients with a pre-existing headache disorder (often migraine or tension-type) who begin to use analgesics frequently to manage their symptoms. Over time, the headache becomes more frequent, occurring daily or near-daily, and paradoxically, the medications used to treat the headache start to worsen it. The key feature in this case is that the headache was initially relieved by analgesics, but with continued use, its frequency increased, and withholding the medication leads to improvement, which is characteristic of MOH. The diagnosis is clinical and is confirmed when headache frequency decreases after stopping the overused medication. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Chronic Migraine – Incorrect: While chronic migraine is defined as a headache occurring ≥15 days per month for more than 3 months, it usually does not improve simply by stopping medications. Chronic migraine often requires preventive therapy and does not typically show such a clear pattern of analgesic overuse followed by worsening and relief upon cessation. C. Tension-Type Headache – Incorrect: Tension-type headache is generally described as a bilateral, dull, pressing pain without the nausea or photophobia seen in migraine. It usually doesn’t worsen with overuse of analgesics in the way seen in MOH. Moreover, tension-type headache doesn’t typically show significant response to or dependence on medications. D. Cluster/Persistent Headache – Incorrect: Cluster headaches are severe, unilateral, and often associated with autonomic symptoms like lacrimation or nasal congestion. They follow a cyclical pattern, and their treatment and behavior are very different from what is described here. Medication overuse does not typically cause or affect the pattern of cluster headaches.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Subthalamus Explanation for Correct Answer: The wild flinging movements described in the question are characteristic of hemiballismus, a condition marked by involuntary, violent, and irregular flinging movements of the limbs, typically on one side of the body. This is most commonly caused by a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus, a part of the basal ganglia involved in motor control. The subthalamic nucleus is an essential part of the indirect pathway in the basal ganglia, which normally helps regulate movement by inhibiting unwanted motor activity. Damage to this area, typically due to stroke or other neurological events, disrupts this inhibitory control, leading to the exaggerated, involuntary movements seen in hemiballismus. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Globus Pallidus – Incorrect: Lesions in the globe pallidus, particularly the internal segment (GPi), are associated with movement disorders like Parkinsonism or dystonia, but not hemiballismus. The globus pallidus is involved in both direct and indirect pathways in the basal ganglia. While its dysfunction can lead to motor symptoms, it does not typically cause the flinging movements characteristic of hemiballismus. C. Substantia Nigra – Incorrect: The substantia nigra is primarily associated with Parkinson’s disease, where dopamine-producing neurons are degenerated, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Lesions in the substantia nigra generally do not cause the type of wild flinging movements seen in hemiballismus. The substantia nigra is involved in the direct pathway that facilitates movement, but damage here typically results in hypokinetic symptoms, not hyperkinetic ones. D. Putamen – Incorrect: Lesions in the putamen, another structure of the basal ganglia, are more commonly associated with Parkinsonism, dystonia, or tardive dyskinesia, but not typically with hemiballismus. The putamen plays a role in both motor control and the regulation of voluntary movements, but it is not usually the site of lesions that produce the specific symptoms of hemiballismus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sumatriptan Explanation for Correct Answer: The symptoms described in the question, acute headache, nausea, and photophobia, are suggestive of a migraine attack. The immediate treatment for an acute migraine attack involves the use of abortive therapies to relieve the headache and associated symptoms. Sumatriptan, a triptan class drug, is a first-line treatment for acute migraine attacks. It works by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain, which helps to constrict blood vessels, reduce inflammation, and inhibit pain transmission. This makes sumatriptan effective in providing rapid relief from acute migraine symptoms. It is typically administered orally or via an injectable form, depending on the severity of the migraine. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Flunarizine – Incorrect: Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker often used as a prophylactic treatment for migraines rather than for acute attacks. It helps to reduce the frequency of migraine episodes when taken regularly, but it is not effective for the immediate relief of an acute migraine attack. Hence, it is not the appropriate choice for this scenario where the patient is experiencing an acute headache. C. Topiramate – Incorrect: Topiramate is another medication used for migraine prevention rather than for acute treatment. It is often prescribed as a prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines, but it is not suitable for use in treating an acute migraine once symptoms have already occurred. For immediate relief, abortive medications like sumatriptan are preferred. D. Propranolol – Incorrect: Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly used as a preventive treatment for chronic migraines, especially in patients with frequent or long-lasting migraine attacks. Like flunarizine and topiramate, propranolol is not effective for acute treatment of migraines. It works to reduce the frequency of migraines but does not help relieve symptoms during an active attack.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Selegiline Explanation for Correct Answer: The patient described is showing signs of Parkinson's disease, which typically presents with bradykinesia, rigidity, and a mask-like face (a characteristic facial expression in Parkinson's disease). These symptoms are primarily due to a dopamine deficiency in the brain, especially in the basal ganglia, which controls movement. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor that works by inhibiting the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, thereby increasing the levels of dopamine available to stimulate movement and alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is often used in the early stages of Parkinson's disease or in combination with other treatments to help manage symptoms and improve motor function. Hence, Selegiline is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Donepezil – Incorrect: Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a condition characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, not motor symptoms like those seen in Parkinson's disease. Donepezil increases the levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in cognitive function, and is not effective in treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease like bradykinesia and rigidity. Thus, it is not appropriate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. C. Promethazine – Incorrect: Promethazine is an antihistamine that is commonly used for allergic reactions and motion sickness. It has sedative effects and anticholinergic properties. While it may help with symptoms like nausea, it is not used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In fact, its anticholinergic properties can worsen cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's patients and may increase the risk of side effects like dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation. Therefore, promethazine is not suitable for managing Parkinson's disease symptoms. D. Clozapine – Incorrect: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other severe psychiatric conditions, particularly when other medications are ineffective. Although clozapine has dopaminergic effects, it is not used for Parkinson's disease because it blocks dopamine receptors in the brain, which can exacerbate Parkinsonian symptoms like rigidity and bradykinesia. Additionally, clozapine has significant side effects, including the risk of agranulocytosis, making it an inappropriate choice for treating Parkinson's disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) TBM (Tuberculous Meningitis) Explanation for Correct Answer: The patient presenting with features of meningitis (such as headache, fever, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness), along with CSF findings of increased proteins, mildly decreased glucose, and the provided imaging findings, most likely has Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM). TBM is a form of meningitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it typically presents with increased protein levels and decreased glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These findings are suggestive of an inflammatory process in the meninges due to tuberculosis infection. Imaging often shows basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, or cerebral infarcts, which are commonly seen in TBM. This condition requires prompt diagnosis and treatment with antituberculous therapy to prevent severe complications, such as brain damage or death. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Aseptic Meningitis – Incorrect: Aseptic meningitis is a condition that is typically caused by viral infections (e.g., enteroviruses, mumps, herpes simplex virus). It presents with similar symptoms to bacterial meningitis, but the CSF findings are usually characterized by mildly elevated white blood cells (pleocytosis) and normal glucose levels, with moderately elevated protein levels. While aseptic meningitis can cause increased protein levels in the CSF, decreased glucose levels are not typically seen in viral causes, which makes this diagnosis less likely. Moreover, the imaging findings and patient’s history might not align with the viral etiology of aseptic meningitis. C. Chemical Meningitis – Incorrect: Chemical meningitis can result from an irritation of the meninges due to non-infectious substances, such as intrathecal injections, contrast agents, or medications. The CSF in chemical meningitis may show elevated protein levels, but typically, the glucose levels are normal and there is a low white blood cell count (predominantly lymphocytes). The presence of a mild decrease in glucose in this case, combined with the imaging findings and the clinical scenario, does not support a diagnosis of chemical meningitis. Chemical meningitis is generally diagnosed when no infectious or inflammatory cause is present and when a history of exposure to a chemical irritant is evident. D. Pyogenic Meningitis – Incorrect: Pyogenic meningitis, caused by bacterial infections (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis), often presents with severe symptoms (fever, altered consciousness, headache, etc.) and typically shows markedly elevated white blood cells (neutrophils), very low glucose levels, and high protein levels in the CSF. While the CSF findings in pyogenic meningitis include increased protein, the glucose levels are typically much lower than in this case, which shows only a mild decrease. Additionally, the imaging features of pyogenic meningitis often show signs of brain abscesses or sinus thrombosis, which would be absent in TBM, making pyogenic meningitis less likely in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pegvisomant Explanation for Correct Answer: Pegvisomant is a GH receptor blocker used in the treatment of acromegaly. It is a growth hormone receptor antagonist that works by binding to the GH receptor and preventing its activation, which ultimately blocks the effects of growth hormone (GH) on tissues, including its growth-promoting effects. By inhibiting GH from acting on its receptor, pegvisomant helps to normalize insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, which are elevated in acromegaly due to excessive GH production. This makes pegvisomant an effective therapy for patients with acromegaly, especially when other treatments like surgery or somatostatin analogs are not sufficient or suitable. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Octreotide – Incorrect: Octreotide is a somatostatin analog used in the treatment of acromegaly. It works by mimicking the action of somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits the secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland. While octreotide reduces GH levels, it does not act as a GH receptor blocker. Instead, it acts by suppressing GH secretion. Therefore, octreotide is a GH secretion inhibitor rather than a GH receptor blocker, which is why it is not the correct answer to this question. C. Bromocriptine – Incorrect: Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that is primarily used for prolactinomas and sometimes for acromegaly, particularly when the patient has coexisting hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine works by stimulating dopamine receptors, which in turn inhibits the release of GH from the pituitary. However, it does not directly block the GH receptor. While bromocriptine may help reduce GH levels in some patients with acromegaly, it is not considered a GH receptor blocker, which makes it an incorrect choice for this question.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bromocriptine Explanation for Correct Answer: The most likely diagnosis for a young female presenting with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and a pituitary macroadenoma is prolactinoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that secretes excess prolactin. In this scenario, bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, is the treatment of choice. Bromocriptine works by increasing dopamine activity, which inhibits the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. This helps to reduce the size of the tumor and correct prolactin levels, thereby alleviating the symptoms of amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Bromocriptine is effective in treating prolactinomas and can often shrink the tumor significantly. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Leuprolide – Incorrect: Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that is primarily used to treat conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and precocious puberty. It works by suppressing gonadotropin secretion, which leads to a decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels. However, leuprolide is not effective in treating prolactinomas as it does not target the prolactin-producing cells of the pituitary. Therefore, leuprolide is not the appropriate treatment for a prolactinoma. C. Boserelin – Incorrect: Boserelin is another GnRH agonist used for similar indications as leuprolide, such as endometriosis, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids. Like leuprolide, it works by suppressing gonadotropin secretion, which lowers sex hormone levels. Boserelin is not effective in treating prolactinomas and does not address the underlying problem of excessive prolactin secretion. It is therefore not the correct treatment option for this patient. D. Nafarelin – Incorrect: Nafarelin is yet another GnRH agonist used for conditions like endometriosis and precocious puberty. Similar to leuprolide and boserelin, it works by reducing the production of sex hormones. Nafarelin is not effective for treating prolactinomas as it does not target prolactin production. Its mechanism of action does not address the excess prolactin production in this case, making it an inappropriate treatment for the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) IV fluids + regular insulin Explanation for Correct Answer: The patient presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, confusion, and clinical signs such as tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension (BP 90/60), and a blood glucose level of 538 mg/dL, which are all suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Additionally, urine ketones 3+ and ECG showing tall T waves (likely due to hyperkalemia) further support this diagnosis. The immediate treatment for DKA involves IV fluids to correct dehydration and regular insulin to lower the high blood glucose levels and address the ketosis. Regular insulin is preferred initially because it acts quickly, helping to lower the blood glucose levels and correct the acidosis associated with DKA. Therefore, the appropriate treatment is IV fluids to rehydrate and regular insulin to treat the hyperglycemia and ketosis. The use of both together is critical to stabilize the patient. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. IV fluids – Incorrect: While IV fluids are essential in treating DKA, they alone are insufficient to address the elevated blood glucose and ketosis that define DKA. Insulin therapy is crucial to correct the underlying metabolic derangements of DKA, including hyperglycemia and acidosis. Therefore, only IV fluids would not be adequate without insulin administration. B. Regular insulin – Incorrect: While regular insulin is an essential part of DKA treatment, insulin therapy alone is insufficient without the supportive measure of IV fluids to correct dehydration and help improve circulation. The insulin will lower blood glucose levels, but it cannot address the dehydration, hypotension, or the electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, present in DKA. Fluids are crucial to prevent shock and kidney damage. D. IV fluids + long acting insulin – Incorrect: In DKA, the initial treatment requires regular insulin, not long-acting insulin. Regular insulin acts rapidly to decrease blood glucose levels and correct the ketotic state. Long-acting insulin, such as glargine or detemir, works more slowly and is typically used for basal insulin coverage but is not effective for the acute management of DKA. Therefore, long-acting insulin is not appropriate in this acute setting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The skin abnormality shown in the figure (which could be something like acanthosis nigricans, a condition characterized by dark, thickened skin, usually around the neck, armpits, and groin) is commonly associated with insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome. Obesity is a significant risk factor for metabolic syndrome, and skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans often occur in individuals with excess abdominal fat and insulin resistance. Therefore, this patient’s skin abnormality and obesity are consistent with metabolic syndrome. Incorrect Answers: A. Addison Disease Addison disease is a disorder of the adrenal glands that results in insufficient production of cortisol and aldosterone. One of the hallmarks of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, particularly in areas exposed to friction, such as the elbows, knees, and knuckles. However, Addison's disease does not typically present with the same skin changes seen in metabolic syndrome, like acanthosis nigricans. Addison's disease would also likely present with symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, salt cravings, and hypotension, which are not necessarily observed in this patient. B. Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, and hair loss. While hypothyroidism may lead to some skin changes, such as dry or pale skin, it is not typically associated with acanthosis nigricans. In addition, hypothyroidism does not directly relate to metabolic syndrome, though both conditions can contribute to obesity. The presence of a skin abnormality like acanthosis nigricans would make hypothyroidism less likely in this case. C. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism is the condition where the thyroid gland overproduces thyroid hormones. This can lead to symptoms like weight loss, increased heart rate, sweating, and anxiety. Although it can affect skin appearance, such as thinning hair or skin that is more prone to irritation, hyperthyroidism is not commonly associated with the skin changes observed in metabolic syndrome. Moreover, hyperthyroidism is not typically linked to obesity, which is a primary feature of metabolic syndrome. This is a case of acanthosis nigricans which is a metabolic syndrome.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyponatremia The patient's low serum osmolality of 270 mosm/kg indicates that the blood is diluted, which is a key sign of hyponatremia, a condition where there is too little sodium in the blood. Normally, serum osmolality should be around 280–295 mosm/kg. The high urine osmolality of 1000 mosm/kg suggests that the kidneys are conserving water and producing concentrated urine, which is typically seen when there is a discrepancy between the body's need to retain water (due to low sodium levels) and a diluted serum state. This combination of low serum osmolality and high urine osmolality is characteristic of hyponatremia, which is often associated with conditions like syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), heart failure, or liver disease. Incorrect Answers: A. Hypokalemia Hypokalemia refers to low potassium levels in the blood, but it is not indicated by the patient's serum or urine osmolality. Hypokalemia typically causes muscle weakness, fatigue, and arrhythmias, but it does not correlate with low serum osmolality and high urine osmolality. Therefore, this electrolyte abnormality does not explain the patient’s presentation. C. Hypernatremia Hypernatremia, or high sodium levels, would result in a high serum osmolality, as the body’s osmolality is primarily determined by sodium concentration in the blood. In this case, the serum osmolality is abnormally low (270 mosm/kg), which excludes hypernatremia as a possibility. Additionally, high serum osmolality is usually associated with concentrated urine (low urine osmolality), which contrasts with the high urine osmolality seen in this patient. D. Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia refers to high potassium levels in the blood, which can cause serious cardiac issues like arrhythmias. However, this condition does not affect serum or urine osmolality in the way described in this case. The low serum osmolality and high urine osmolality point to an issue with sodium (hyponatremia), rather than potassium. Hyperkalemia would not cause this pattern of osmolality changes, so it is not the correct diagnosis here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypertension Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency that occurs when there is sudden hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, often due to an existing pituitary adenoma. Common clinical manifestations include shock, loss of consciousness, and severe headache, which result from the acute endocrine dysfunction and the mass effect of the hemorrhage or infarction. Hypertension, however, is not typically associated with pituitary apoplexy. In fact, the acute crisis often leads to hypotension, rather than hypertension, due to the loss of pituitary hormone production (such as cortisol), leading to adrenal insufficiency and shock. Incorrect Answers: B. Shock Shock is a common feature of pituitary apoplexy, particularly due to the acute onset of adrenal insufficiency resulting from the impaired secretion of cortisol. When the pituitary gland hemorrhages or becomes infarcted, the normal hormonal regulation is disrupted, leading to a state of relative adrenal insufficiency and hypovolemia, which causes hypotension and shock. Therefore, shock is a characteristic sign of pituitary apoplexy. C. Loss of Consciousness Loss of consciousness can occur in pituitary apoplexy due to the sudden rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) from hemorrhage, mass effect, or infarction of the pituitary gland. This may lead to compression of adjacent structures, such as the hypothalamus or optic chiasm, and disrupt normal brain function. The sudden and severe nature of the condition can result in a diminished level of consciousness or even a coma. D. Headache Headache is a classic symptom of pituitary apoplexy. It typically occurs suddenly and is often described as severe and unusual, due to the rapid enlargement of the pituitary gland and the increase in intracranial pressure. The headache is often localized to the retro-orbital region and can be associated with visual disturbances due to compression of the optic chiasm. Thus, headache is strongly suggestive of pituitary apoplexy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Addisonian Crisis The patient in this case has undergone bilateral adrenalectomy for bilateral pheochromocytoma, which results in the removal of both adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce important hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and catecholamines. After bilateral adrenalectomy, the patient is at risk for developing Addisonian crisis, a life-threatening condition caused by insufficient cortisol and aldosterone. Symptoms of Addisonian crisis include lethargy, fatigue, low blood pressure, and normal pulse, as seen in this patient. The lack of volume deficit (normal hydration status) is consistent with adrenal insufficiency rather than other causes of hypotension, such as hypovolemia. The patient is unable to produce sufficient cortisol and aldosterone post-surgery, leading to inadequate regulation of blood pressure, which explains the observed clinical picture. Incorrect Answers: B. SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion) SIADH is characterized by the excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention, hyponatremia, and often low blood osmolality. In this case, the patient's symptoms of lethargy, fatigue, and low blood pressure are not consistent with SIADH, as SIADH would typically present with low sodium levels, and the patient would likely have signs of volume overload (such as edema) or hyponatremia, neither of which are present here. Additionally, SIADH is not typically associated with normal pulse and is less likely following bilateral adrenalectomy. C. DI (Diabetes Insipidus) Diabetes insipidus is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, leading to polyuria and polydipsia, often resulting in dehydration. However, the patient's normal hydration status and lack of significant urinary symptoms make diabetes insipidus an unlikely cause of the lethargy, fatigue, and low blood pressure. Furthermore, DI is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency symptoms like those seen in Addisonian crisis. D. Cerebral Salt-Wasting Syndrome (CSWS) Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome is a condition where there is excessive renal loss of sodium, often associated with neurological injury. While this could lead to low sodium and hypotension, the patient in this case does not exhibit signs of volume depletion or hyponatremia, which are common in CSWS. Additionally, CSWS is typically seen in patients with brain injuries or neurosurgical procedures, neither of which is mentioned in this case, making it an unlikely diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypothalamic Lesion A hypothalamic lesion can lead to secondary hypothyroidism by reducing the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4. In this case, the patient has low TSH, but after TRH administration, TSH levels improve—indicating that the pituitary is functioning and capable of producing TSH when stimulated. This response strongly suggests that the defect lies in the hypothalamus, where insufficient TRH is being produced under normal conditions, but external TRH restores TSH production. Incorrect Answers: B. Pituitary Lesion In a pituitary lesion causing secondary hypothyroidism, the pituitary gland is unable to produce TSH even when stimulated by TRH. Therefore, in such cases, TSH would remain low despite TRH administration. Since the patient’s TSH increases after TRH stimulation, this rules out a pituitary defect. C. Primary Hypothyroidism (Option written as \"10 Hypothyroidism\") Primary hypothyroidism refers to a problem in the thyroid gland itself, where it fails to produce sufficient thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). In such cases, the TSH level is typically elevated due to lack of negative feedback from thyroid hormones. Low TSH is not characteristic of primary hypothyroidism, making this diagnosis incorrect in the context of low baseline TSH. D. De Quervain Thyroiditis De Quervain (subacute) thyroiditis is a transient inflammatory condition of the thyroid that often presents with initial hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. During the hyperthyroid phase, TSH is low, but this is due to high circulating thyroid hormones, not a central problem. TRH stimulation would not significantly change TSH levels in the hyperthyroid phase, and in the later hypothyroid phase, TSH would be elevated. Thus, TRH responsiveness does not fit the clinical picture of De Quervain thyroiditis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyperpigmentation Hyperpigmentation is not a feature of ACTH deficiency. In fact, it is seen in conditions where ACTH is elevated, such as primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease). ACTH is derived from the precursor molecule POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin), which also gives rise to melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). Elevated ACTH leads to increased MSH, causing hyperpigmentation. In ACTH deficiency, such as in secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary dysfunction, ACTH levels are low, so there is no stimulation of melanocytes—hence, no hyperpigmentation. This makes hyperpigmentation inconsistent with ACTH deficiency and therefore the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: B. Weight loss Weight loss is a common feature of ACTH deficiency due to reduced cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that supports appetite and energy metabolism. Its deficiency leads to fatigue, poor appetite, and catabolism, contributing to weight loss. Therefore, weight loss is a feature of ACTH deficiency. C. Increased TSH In some cases of combined pituitary hormone deficiency, which may include ACTH deficiency, TSH may paradoxically be elevated or inappropriately normal, due to altered feedback mechanisms or associated hypothyroidism. However, even isolated ACTH deficiency can affect metabolism and hypothalamic-pituitary balance, sometimes indirectly influencing TSH levels. Thus, while not a primary feature, increased TSH can be seen and is not inconsistent with ACTH deficiency. D. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is a hallmark of ACTH deficiency. Cortisol, stimulated by ACTH, plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels, especially during fasting or stress. In ACTH deficiency, cortisol levels are low, impairing gluconeogenesis and leading to increased risk of hypoglycemia, particularly in children or during illness. Hence, hypoglycemia is a classic feature of ACTH deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Low TSH and High T3/T4 The clinical presentation—fatigue, inability to gain weight, warm body, staring look, and bilateral proptosis—is classic for Graves’ disease, the most common cause of primary hyperthyroidism. In this condition, autoantibodies (TSI – thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins) stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excess T3 and T4, independent of pituitary control. As a result of negative feedback, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) from the pituitary is suppressed, leading to the laboratory picture of low TSH and high T3/T4. The staring look and bilateral proptosis are due to thyroid eye disease (ophthalmopathy), a hallmark of Graves’ disease. Therefore, this pattern confirms the diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: B. High TSH and High T3 This pattern is not consistent with primary hyperthyroidism. If T3 is high due to increased thyroid hormone production, TSH should be suppressed due to negative feedback. High TSH with high T3 would suggest a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (secondary hyperthyroidism), which is rare and typically does not present with proptosis or the other features seen here. Thus, this option does not match the clinical scenario. C. High TSH and Low Free T3 This pattern is characteristic of primary hypothyroidism, where the thyroid fails to produce hormones, leading to low T3/T4 and compensatory elevation of TSH. However, this does not match the warm body, weight loss or proptosis—all of which are symptoms of hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Hence, this is not the correct answer. D. Normal TSH and High T3 In true hyperthyroidism, especially due to Graves’ disease, TSH is suppressed, not normal. A normal TSH with high T3 might suggest early or subclinical hyperthyroidism or a lab error. However, in a patient with clear signs and symptoms of overt hyperthyroidism (including proptosis), TSH would be expected to be low. Therefore, this pattern is not consistent with the clinical presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 200 mcg/dl A serum prolactin level >200 mcg/dl (or ng/mL) is strongly suggestive of a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma, also known as a hyperprolactinoma. While mild to moderate elevations in prolactin can be caused by various physiological or pathological conditions (e.g., stress, medications, hypothyroidism), very high levels—especially above 200 mcg/dl—are typically only seen in prolactinomas, particularly macroprolactinomas. This threshold is used clinically to distinguish prolactinomas from other causes of hyperprolactinemia and helps guide further imaging and treatment strategies. Incorrect Answers: A. 100 mcg/dl Although a prolactin level of 100 mcg/dl is elevated, it is not definitively diagnostic of a prolactinoma. Levels in this range could be due to secondary causes like medications (e.g., antipsychotics), pituitary stalk compression, or hypothyroidism. Therefore, while concerning, this level is not specific enough to confirm a prolactinoma without additional context. B. 55 mcg/dl A prolactin level of 55 mcg/dl is moderately elevated and could occur due to various benign causes such as stress, nipple stimulation, pregnancy, or drug-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is far below the diagnostic threshold for a prolactinoma and would typically prompt a search for secondary causes before imaging or labeling it a prolactinoma. C. 150 mcg/dl A level of 150 mcg/dl is suggestive of a significant prolactin elevation, but it still falls short of the commonly accepted threshold of 200 mcg/dl that reliably indicates a prolactinoma. While a prolactinoma can’t be ruled out at this level, it remains in the gray zone and would require imaging (MRI of the pituitary) and clinical correlation for confirmation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Isoniazid and Rifampicin Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), the two most powerful first-line anti-tubercular drugs. Resistance to these key drugs significantly reduces the effectiveness of standard TB treatment regimens and requires the use of second-line drugs, which are often less effective, more toxic, and need to be administered for a longer duration. Confirming resistance to both INH and RIF is essential to classify a case as MDR-TB and initiate appropriate therapy. Incorrect Answers: B. Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Fluoroquinolone Resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, and any fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) falls under a broader category known as pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR TB). If resistance to injectable second-line drugs is also present, it is termed extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Thus, this option describes a more advanced drug resistance pattern than MDR-TB. C. Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Kanamycin Resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, along with an injectable second-line drug like kanamycin, also suggests pre-XDR or XDR-TB, not plain MDR-TB. While such resistance patterns are more serious, MDR-TB by definition requires resistance only to isoniazid and rifampicin, and not to second-line drugs. D. Isoniazid & Ethambutol This combination does not fulfill the criteria for MDR-TB, because rifampicin resistance is essential for MDR-TB diagnosis. Resistance to isoniazid and ethambutol is concerning but does not represent multidrug resistance unless rifampicin is also involved.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vitamin B6 The patient is undergoing anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) and has developed tingling sensations, which is indicative of peripheral neuropathy. One of the most common causes of neuropathy during ATT is a deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), primarily due to the use of isoniazid (INH). Isoniazid interferes with pyridoxine metabolism by forming a hydrazone complex, leading to a functional deficiency. As pyridoxine is essential for proper nerve function, its deficiency can result in paresthesias, tingling, and numbness, particularly in the extremities. Therefore, vitamin B6 supplementation is routinely co-administered with INH to prevent such neurological side effects. Incorrect Answers: A. Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Vitamin B2 deficiency typically presents with oral symptoms like angular cheilitis, glossitis, and sore throat, rather than neurological signs such as tingling. It is not commonly associated with anti-tubercular therapy and is therefore an unlikely cause in this clinical setting. B. Vitamin B3 (Niacin) Niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, which is characterized by the classic triad of dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Neuropathy is not a typical or early symptom of niacin deficiency, and ATT drugs like INH do not primarily deplete niacin. Thus, it is not the most likely deficiency in this patient. D. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Vitamin B12 deficiency can indeed cause neurological symptoms like tingling and numbness due to its role in myelin synthesis. However, it is usually seen in malabsorption syndromes, strict vegan diets, or pernicious anemia, and is not directly caused by anti-TB drugs. While B12 deficiency may contribute to neuropathy, in the context of ATT and INH use, B6 deficiency is the most direct and common cause.",

The low pH indicates acidemia, and the markedly elevated PaCO? (normal: 35–45 mmHg) points to respiratory acidosis as the primary disturbance. The elevated bicarbonate (HCO??) indicates a compensatory metabolic response, where the kidneys retain bicarbonate to buffer the excess CO?. This profile is consistent with chronic or partially compensated respiratory acidosis, which may occur in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or hypoventilation syndromes. Incorrect Answers: B. Respiratory Alkalosis Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a high pH and low PaCO?, usually due to hyperventilation. However, in this case, both the pH is low and PaCO? is high, which is the opposite pattern, ruling this option out. C. Metabolic Acidosis In metabolic acidosis, the HCO?? is low (typically <22 mmol/L) and the pH is also low.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sarcoidosis The clinical picture described — fever, chronic cough, night sweats, along with bilateral facial muscle weakness, unilateral red eye, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray — is most consistent with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. Bilateral facial nerve palsy is a characteristic neurologic manifestation (part of neurosarcoidosis), and uveitis or other ocular inflammation can present as red eye. The classic radiologic hallmark is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which helps distinguish sarcoidosis from other diseases. The chronic course and multisystem involvement strongly support this diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Tuberculosis TB may present with fever, chronic cough, night sweats, and even hilar lymphadenopathy, but bilateral facial palsy and eye involvement (like uveitis) are uncommon in typical pulmonary TB. Additionally, TB more commonly presents with asymmetric or unilateral hilar adenopathy, and if lymphadenopathy is present, it is usually accompanied by cavitary lesions in the lungs. Therefore, while TB may be a close differential, the constellation of signs here is more characteristic of sarcoidosis. C. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis This condition is an immune-mediated lung disease resulting from repeated inhalation of antigens (e.g., mold, bird proteins). It presents with cough, dyspnea, and fever, but typically lacks facial palsy, eye involvement, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Imaging usually shows diffuse interstitial infiltrates, not isolated hilar lymphadenopathy. Therefore, this option does not fit the full clinical picture. D. Lymphoma Lymphoma can cause systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats) and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but it rarely causes bilateral facial nerve palsy or red eye. Neurological involvement is usually central or peripheral due to mass effect, not isolated cranial nerve dysfunction. Additionally, ocular symptoms are uncommon unless there is direct infiltration, which would typically present differently.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Metformin Metformin is an oral antidiabetic agent commonly used in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not associated with pleural effusion as a side effect. While it can cause lactic acidosis in rare instances—especially in patients with renal impairment—there is no established link between metformin use and pleural or pulmonary fibrosis, effusion, or serosal inflammation. Hence, it is the least likely among the given options to cause pleural effusion. Incorrect Answers: A. Methylsergide Methylsergide is an ergot derivative previously used for migraine prophylaxis. It is known to cause retroperitoneal, pleural, and pericardial fibrosis as part of its long-term side effects. The fibrotic reaction can lead to pleural effusion, making it a recognized culprit in drug-induced pleuropathy. B. Bromocriptine Bromocriptine, another ergot derivative used in conditions like Parkinson’s disease and hyperprolactinemia, has also been linked with fibrotic complications, including pleural and pulmonary fibrosis, and can result in pleural effusions. These adverse effects are more likely with prolonged use. D. Nitrofurantoin Nitrofurantoin, an antibiotic commonly used for urinary tract infections, can cause pulmonary toxicity, especially with chronic use. It may lead to hypersensitivity reactions, interstitial lung disease, and in some cases, pleural effusion. This risk is well documented, particularly in elderly patients or those on long-term prophylaxis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Anthracosis The finding of abundant black pigment in the cytoplasm of macrophages in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and mediastinal lymphadenopathy is most consistent with anthracosis. Anthracosis refers to the accumulation of carbon particles (from inhaled pollution, smoke, or coal dust) within the lungs and regional lymph nodes. These particles are phagocytosed by macrophages, leading to the characteristic black pigmentation seen cytologically. This is especially common in smokers, individuals exposed to polluted environments, or those with a history of occupational exposure (e.g., coal workers). Importantly, anthracosis is benign and non-neoplastic, and the pigment is non-refractile, fine, and black in appearance under the microscope. Incorrect Answers: A. Hemosiderosis Hemosiderosis involves deposition of hemosiderin, an iron-storage complex derived from hemoglobin breakdown. This occurs typically in chronic pulmonary hemorrhage or left-sided heart failure. The pigment appears golden-brown and granular, not black, and stains positively with Prussian blue stain for iron. Therefore, it does not match the described black pigment in the cytoplasm. B. Melanoma Melanoma, particularly metastatic melanoma, can produce melanin pigment, which is also dark and may be mistaken for carbon. However, melanoma would usually show atypical melanocytic cells and often has other histologic features of malignancy. The clinical context of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and the presence of pigment in macrophages (not tumor cells) make melanoma unlikely. D. Lipofuscin deposit Lipofuscin is known as the “wear-and-tear” pigment and accumulates in aging cells. It appears yellow-brown and finely granular, typically in cardiac and hepatic cells, and not in lung macrophages. Lipofuscin is not black, and it is not a feature of environmental exposure or lung pathology, making this option inappropriate here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IV Antibiotics + Ward Treatment The patient is 68 years old and has pneumonia, but she is conscious, oriented, and has stable vital signs: BP 100/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 20/min (normal range), and blood urea 44 mg/dL, which suggests a moderate degree of renal function compromise. Despite the elevated blood urea level, the patient’s stable hemodynamics and respiratory status (normal BP and RR) indicate that she does not need immediate intensive care. Therefore, IV antibiotics and admission to a general ward for close monitoring are appropriate. IV antibiotics are preferred initially for pneumonia in elderly patients, especially those with comorbidities, to ensure adequate coverage and rapid improvement. Incorrect Answers: A. Oral Antibiotics and Send Home While oral antibiotics may be appropriate for patients with mild pneumonia and no risk factors for severe disease, this patient has elevated blood urea (which can indicate impaired renal function), which raises concerns about possible comorbidities and the need for more intensive treatment. Moderate to severe pneumonia typically requires IV antibiotics initially, especially in elderly patients, as they are at higher risk for complications. Therefore, sending the patient home with oral antibiotics is not appropriate here. C. IV Antibiotics + ICU Admission + Non-Invasive Ventilation The patient is not showing signs of respiratory distress, such as increased work of breathing or hypoxia, and her BP and respiratory rate are stable. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) would only be considered in cases of significant respiratory compromise, which is not present here. ICU admission is unnecessary given the patient's stable condition, so this approach would be overly aggressive. D. IV Antibiotics + ICU Admission + Invasive Ventilation This option would be appropriate if the patient had severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, septic shock, or acute organ dysfunction (e.g., respiratory rate >30/min, hypotension, altered mental status, need for invasive ventilation). However, the patient's normal vital signs, conscious state, and lack of signs of respiratory failure make ICU admission and invasive ventilation unnecessary.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Alkalosis The patient is hyperventilating and develops carpopedal spasm (a spasm of the hands and feet), which is most likely due to alkalosis, specifically respiratory alkalosis. Hyperventilation leads to excessive loss of CO?, which causes the blood pH to rise, resulting in alkalosis. This condition increases albumin binding to calcium, lowering the free ionized calcium levels in the blood. The resulting hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular irritability, which manifests as carpopedal spasms. This is a common finding in respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation. Incorrect Answers: A. Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood) would typically result in muscle weakness, fatigue, and depressed reflexes, not spasms. It is unlikely to cause carpopedal spasms, which are more commonly associated with hypocalcemia seen in alkalosis. Therefore, this option is not correct. B. Acidosis Acidosis (either respiratory or metabolic) generally leads to decreased neuromuscular excitability, resulting in muscle weakness and fatigue rather than spasms. In acidosis, the calcium levels are usually normal or slightly elevated, and there is no mechanism for causing the hypocalcemia that triggers carpopedal spasms. Thus, acidosis is not the likely cause in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Metabolic Acidosis The given lab values show the following: pH = 7.20 (low, indicating acidemia) HCO?? = 10 mEq/L (low, indicating metabolic acidosis) PCO? = 22 mm Hg (lower than the normal range of 35-45 mm Hg) These findings are consistent with metabolic acidosis, a condition in which there is a primary decrease in bicarbonate (HCO??), causing a reduction in pH. The low HCO?? indicates the primary disorder, and the PCO? of 22 mm Hg is low due to the compensatory respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) that occurs in metabolic acidosis to blow off CO? and help correct the acidosis. The body compensates by reducing the CO? level, but the primary disturbance remains metabolic acidosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Respiratory Acidosis Respiratory acidosis occurs when PCO? is elevated due to impaired ventilation, which leads to an increase in carbonic acid and a decrease in pH. In this case, the PCO? is low (22 mm Hg), ruling out respiratory acidosis, where the CO? would be elevated. B. Respiratory Alkalosis Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by elevated pH and decreased PCO? due to hyperventilation. While the low PCO? (22 mm Hg) fits with this condition, the pH of 7.20 is acidic, not alkalotic, which rules out respiratory alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis would result in a pH above 7.40, which is not the case here. D. Metabolic Alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in bicarbonate (HCO??), which would cause an elevated pH. In this case, the HCO?? is low (10 mEq/L), and the pH is low, making metabolic alkalosis an incorrect diagnosis.",

TPE is a condition caused by an immune response to filarial parasites, commonly in areas where filarial infections are endemic (such as tropical regions). The condition is characterized by eosinophilia (high eosinophil count), pulmonary symptoms (cough, wheezing, and fever), and distinctive radiological findings, such as miliary mottling on chest X-ray, which are typical of the disease. The elevated eosinophil count and radiological findings point directly to TPE. Incorrect Answers: A. Miliary TB Miliary tuberculosis (TB) can also cause fever, nocturnal cough, and miliary mottling on chest X-ray. However, miliary TB typically does not cause such a marked eosinophilia. TB is usually associated with a normal eosinophil count or mild elevations. Additionally, the elevated eosinophils (over 5000/mm³) in this patient makes tropical pulmonary eosinophilia more likely, as TB typically doesn't present with such a high eosinophil count. Therefore, miliary TB is an unlikely diagnosis here. C. Bronchial Asthma While bronchial asthma can cause wheezing, cough, and sometimes eosinophilia, the patient’s symptoms of fever and the presence of miliary mottling on X-ray are not typical for asthma. Asthma typically presents with a normal chest X-ray and usually does not have such a high level of eosinophilia unless there is a specific allergic reaction.

Additionally, the patient's CD4 count is 55/mm³, indicating severe immunosuppression. In HIV patients with severe immunosuppression, Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common organisms responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It often presents with lobar consolidation on chest X-ray, which is the case in this patient. Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause pneumonia with bronchial breath sounds, crepitations, and often consolidation in one lobe, which fits the clinical picture described. Incorrect Answers: A. Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with a CD4 count <200/mm³, and typically causes a diffuse, bilateral infiltrate on chest X-ray rather than lobar consolidation. Additionally, PCP generally presents with more gradual onset of symptoms, including shortness of breath, and dry cough (non-productive), which is different from this patient's productive cough with sputum. The clinical presentation and radiological findings here are more consistent with Streptococcus pneumonia. C. Mycoplasma Mycoplasma pneumoniae is typically seen in young, healthy individuals and is more often associated with atypical pneumonia. It generally causes patchy infiltrates or interstitial pneumonia rather than lobar consolidation. While it can cause cough and fever, the radiological findings of lobar consolidation are not characteristic of Mycoplasma pneumonia, making it less likely in this patient with severe immunosuppression. D. Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus can cause lobar pneumonia, but it is more commonly associated with necrotizing pneumonia and abscess formation. It is also known to cause rapid progression of disease and can often lead to complicated pneumonia with empyema or lung abscesses, which is not described in this case. While Staphylococcus aureus can indeed be an opportunistic pathogen in HIV patients, the clinical and radiological findings in this patient point more strongly to Streptococcus pneumoniae as the causative organism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Metabolic Acidosis The patient presents with tachypnea (rapid breathing), mental confusion, and an elevated blood glucose of 350 mg/dL, which suggests hyperglycemia likely due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or another form of metabolic acidosis. The pH of 7.20 is low, indicating acidemia, which confirms the presence of an acid-base disorder. In metabolic acidosis, the body compensates by hyperventilating (tachypnea) to reduce CO? and increase pH, which the patient is displaying. The low pH, elevated blood glucose, and respiratory compensation strongly suggest metabolic acidosis, likely from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), given the blood glucose level. Incorrect Answers: A. Metabolic Alkalosis Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by elevated pH and increased bicarbonate (HCO??) levels, often due to factors like vomiting, diuretic use, or excessive bicarbonate intake. This patient has a low pH (7.20) and is experiencing tachypnea, which suggests an acidosis, not alkalosis. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is unlikely in this case. B. Respiratory Alkalosis Respiratory alkalosis occurs when there is hyperventilation leading to excessive CO? elimination and an increase in pH. In this case, the patient has a low pH (7.20), which is more consistent with acidosis rather than alkalosis. The patient’s tachypnea is likely a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis, not a cause of respiratory alkalosis. D. Respiratory Acidosis Respiratory acidosis occurs when there is hypoventilation leading to CO? retention, which results in an increase in carbonic acid and a decreased pH. This patient’s tachypnea (rapid breathing) indicates that the body is attempting to compensate for an acidotic state by eliminating CO?, rather than retaining it. The clinical picture of tachypnea, mental confusion, and a low pH is more consistent with metabolic acidosis than respiratory acidosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Noninvasive ventilation is not indicated In the context of acute exacerbation of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) with Type II respiratory failure (elevated CO? levels), noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is actually indicated and is a key therapeutic intervention. NIV, typically provided using BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) or CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), is widely used to reduce the work of breathing, improve gas exchange, and prevent the need for intubation in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, stating that NIV is not indicated is incorrect, as it is actually a common and effective management strategy in these cases. Incorrect Answers: B. O2 Inhalation Oxygen therapy is a critical part of managing acute exacerbations of COPD with Type II respiratory failure. However, oxygen administration must be carefully titrated, as too much oxygen can worsen hypercapnia (elevated CO? levels). The goal is to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation level (usually 88-92% in COPD patients), avoiding excessively high oxygen concentrations that could suppress the respiratory drive. Oxygen therapy is not only indicated but essential in managing acute exacerbations. C. Salbutamol Inhalation Salbutamol (a beta-agonist) inhalation is an essential part of the treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. It helps relax the smooth muscles in the airways and open up the air passages, improving airflow. It is a first-line treatment for managing exacerbations, often given in combination with anticholinergics (like ipratropium bromide) in the form of nebulizers or metered-dose inhalers. D. IV Dexamethasone IV corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are commonly used in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD to reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function. The use of corticosteroids in such situations is well-supported in clinical guidelines to decrease the duration of the exacerbation, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce the risk of recurrence. Therefore, this option is appropriate in the management of the patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) High risk according to Well's score The Well's scoring system is used to assess the clinical probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Based on the information provided: The patient has a history of bladder cancer, which is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient has a history of prior pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a significant risk factor for recurrence of PE. The recent surgery (3 weeks ago) is another risk factor for thrombosis, especially considering the postoperative period when the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is higher. The symptoms of left leg pain and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are concerning for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), which further raises the clinical suspicion. Given these multiple risk factors, the patient is classified as having a high clinical probability of thrombosis, specifically high risk for pulmonary embolism according to the Well's score. Therefore, the correct answer is Option D (High risk). Incorrect Answers: A. Wells scoring cannot be calculated as D-dimer levels not mentioned While the D-dimer test is helpful in ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE), the Well's scoring system is based on clinical signs and history and does not require D-dimer levels to be included. The clinical factors presented, such as history of PE, recent surgery, and symptoms of hemoptysis and leg pain, are enough to determine the patient's risk. Therefore, Wells scoring can still be calculated based on the clinical information alone, making this option incorrect. B. Low risk according to Well's score Given the patient's history of bladder cancer, prior PE, and recent surgery, the patient is at high risk for thrombosis. Low risk is not appropriate in this case, as there are multiple factors that increase the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism. The Well's score would not categorize this patient as low risk. C. Moderate risk according to Well's score While this patient does have a history of PE and recent surgery, the overall clinical presentation points toward a high risk for thrombosis. The combination of multiple risk factors, along with symptoms such as hemoptysis, strongly supports the high-risk category rather than moderate. A moderate risk score would be assigned if there were fewer or less concerning clinical signs and risk factors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Gamma Interferon The Gamma Interferon (IFN-γ) test, also known as the Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), is a blood test used to detect latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The test measures the amount of interferon-gamma released by T-cells in response to specific proteins found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test exclusively requires whole blood from the patient. It is used as an alternative to the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), especially in patients who may have received the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine or those with a history of previous TB exposure. Incorrect Answers: A. Bactec The Bactec system is used for culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a liquid medium. This test requires sputum samples or other clinical samples (such as tissue or body fluids), not whole blood. The system detects the growth of the bacteria by measuring the consumption of oxygen or the release of carbon dioxide, making this option incorrect for the blood-based requirement. B. Culture Tuberculosis cultures typically use sputum or other relevant clinical specimens for growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A whole blood sample is not used for culturing purposes, as the bacteria primarily reside in the lungs or other affected tissues. Therefore, culture does not require whole blood from the patient, making this option incorrect. D. Gene Expert The GeneXpert system is a molecular test that detects the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA and also tests for resistance to rifampicin. This test is primarily performed using sputum samples or other bodily fluids, not whole blood. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it does not exclusively require whole blood.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bosentan Bosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that is specifically used in the management of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). It works by blocking the effects of endothelin-1, a vasoconstrictor that contributes to the vasoconstriction and remodeling of pulmonary arteries, which are characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. By inhibiting endothelin receptors, Bosentan helps to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance, improve exercise capacity, and delay disease progression in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), including primary pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, Bosentan is an appropriate choice in the management of this condition. Incorrect Answers: A. Icatibant Icatibant is a bradykinin receptor antagonist used primarily for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. It is not indicated for the management of primary pulmonary hypertension. While it may be useful in other settings, it does not have a role in treating pulmonary hypertension, making this option incorrect. C. Labetalol Labetalol is a beta-blocker that is mainly used to treat conditions like hypertension and heart failure. However, it does not have a direct role in managing primary pulmonary hypertension. In fact, beta-blockers may be contraindicated in some forms of pulmonary hypertension because they can reduce heart rate and cardiac output, potentially worsening the patient's condition. Therefore, Labetalol is not suitable for treating primary pulmonary hypertension. D. Sodium Nitroprusside Sodium nitroprusside is a vasodilator that is primarily used in acute hypertensive emergencies or congestive heart failure. While it can lower pulmonary arterial pressure temporarily, it is not a first-line treatment for primary pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, nitroprusside requires careful monitoring due to potential cyanide toxicity with prolonged use. It is not typically used as a long-term solution for pulmonary hypertension, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) FEV1/FVC less than 0.7 and FEV1 less than 50% In severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the severity is defined by both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the FEV1 percentage. The FEV1/FVC ratio is typically less than 0.7, indicating airflow limitation. The FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) reflects the severity of airflow obstruction, and when FEV1 is less than 50% of the predicted value, it is classified as severe COPD. This means that the patient has significant airflow limitation and a marked reduction in lung function, which is characteristic of severe COPD. Therefore, Option B is the correct definition for severe COPD. Incorrect Answers: A. FEV1/FVC less than 0.7 and FEV1 more than 80% This option describes mild COPD or early-stage COPD. In mild COPD, the FEV1 is still greater than 80% of the predicted value but the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced to less than 0.7. This suggests airflow obstruction, but it does not meet the criteria for severe COPD, which requires FEV1 to be less than 50%. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. FEV1/FVC more than 0.7 and FEV1 less than 30% While a FEV1 of less than 30% is indeed consistent with very severe COPD, this option incorrectly lists a FEV1/FVC ratio of more than 0.7, which would indicate that there is no significant airflow limitation. The hallmark of COPD is airflow obstruction, so the FEV1/FVC ratio in severe COPD should be less than 0.7. This makes this option incorrect for defining severe COPD. D. FEV1/FVC more than 0.7 and FEV1 less than 20% Similar to Option C, this option describes an extremely severe level of COPD based on FEV1 (less than 20%), but the FEV1/FVC ratio should be less than 0.7 in COPD, not more than 0.7. A FEV1 of less than 20% would indeed indicate a very severe disease stage, but the ratio of FEV1/FVC must reflect airflow obstruction, which is not consistent with a ratio of more than 0.7.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Liddle’s syndrome Liddle's syndrome is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and alkalosis, which is the classic triad seen in this disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), leading to excessive sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys. This results in water retention, increased blood volume, and ultimately hypertension. The hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis occur due to increased potassium secretion in exchange for sodium in the kidneys. These features make Liddle's syndrome the most likely diagnosis in this case. Incorrect Answers: A. Bartter’s syndrome Bartter’s syndrome is a renal tubular disorder that also causes hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria, but it is characterized by normal or low blood pressure, not hypertension. This is because Bartter’s syndrome leads to increased renal sodium loss, which causes a compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to fluid retention and hyperkalemia. Despite its similarities in electrolyte disturbances, the absence of hypertension differentiates Bartter’s syndrome from Liddle's syndrome. C. Gitelman’s syndrome Gitelman’s syndrome is another renal tubular disorder that causes hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but it is associated with low blood pressure (hypotension), not hypertension. It is caused by mutations in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to impaired sodium and chloride reabsorption. Although it shares some electrolyte abnormalities with Liddle’s syndrome, the hypotension in Gitelman’s syndrome makes it distinct from the hypertension seen in Liddle's syndrome. D. East syndrome East syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by epilepsy, ataxia, dystonia, and muscle rigidity, among other neurological symptoms. It may also have electrolyte abnormalities, but the primary features do not align with the classic presentation of hypertension, hypokalemia, and alkalosis seen in Liddle’s syndrome. Therefore, East syndrome is not the correct diagnosis in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thick ascending limb Bartter's syndrome is a renal tubular disorder that primarily affects the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The condition is caused by mutations in the transporters that are responsible for sodium, potassium, and chloride reabsorption in this segment. Specifically, the mutation usually affects the Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC2), which impairs the reabsorption of these electrolytes. This results in sodium loss, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and increased renin and aldosterone levels, which are characteristic of Bartter's syndrome. Because the thick ascending limb is responsible for the active transport of sodium and chloride, its dysfunction leads to the classic features of the syndrome. Incorrect Answers: B. Thin ascending limb The thin ascending limb is involved in the passive reabsorption of sodium and chloride, but it is not typically the site affected in Bartter's syndrome. The pathology in Bartter’s syndrome involves the thick ascending limb due to mutations in transporters such as the NKCC2 and the ROMK potassium channel. Although the thin ascending limb does play a role in electrolyte balance, it is not the primary location for the dysfunction in Bartter's syndrome, making this option incorrect. C. DCT (Distal Convoluted Tubule) The Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT) is responsible for further sodium reabsorption, particularly under the influence of aldosterone, and plays a role in regulating potassium levels. However, Bartter's syndrome is specifically caused by defects in the thick ascending limb, not the DCT. Conditions like Gitelman’s syndrome involve the DCT, but Bartter’s syndrome is not associated with this part of the nephron. D. PCT (Proximal Convoluted Tubule) The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is involved in the reabsorption of water, sodium, glucose, and amino acids, but it is not the primary site of dysfunction in Bartter's syndrome. The pathophysiology of Bartter's syndrome revolves around defects in the transporters in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, so the PCT is not implicated in the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lupus nephritis The patient’s symptoms, including arthralgia, oral ulcers, skin rashes, hypertension (BP 148/90 mmHg), and urine showing WBCs and RBCs casts, are strongly suggestive of lupus nephritis. Lupus nephritis is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that commonly affects young women. The presence of arthralgia, oral ulcers, and skin rashes in conjunction with renal involvement (such as WBCs and RBCs casts in the urine) is characteristic of lupus nephritis, as it is a common manifestation of SLE. In lupus nephritis, immune complex deposition in the kidneys can cause inflammation, leading to hematuria, proteinuria, and other renal abnormalities. The presence of hypertension further supports the diagnosis of lupus nephritis, as kidney involvement often leads to elevated blood pressure. Incorrect Answers: A. PSGN (Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) PSGN is a condition that typically occurs after a streptococcal throat or skin infection, especially in children. While it can present with hematuria, edema, hypertension, and red blood cell casts in the urine, the patient’s systemic symptoms, such as arthralgia, oral ulcers, and skin rashes, are not characteristic of PSGN. Additionally, PSGN usually presents 2-4 weeks after the initial infection, and the patient in this case does not have a history of recent streptococcal infection. Therefore, PSGN is unlikely in this scenario. B. IgA nephropathy IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger’s disease) is the most common cause of glomerulonephritis in young adults. It typically presents with hematuria, often after an upper respiratory tract infection, and can also be associated with hypertension. However, IgA nephropathy typically lacks the systemic symptoms seen in this patient, such as arthralgia, oral ulcers, and skin rashes, which are much more consistent with lupus nephritis. The absence of a clear precipitating infection and the systemic involvement makes IgA nephropathy less likely in this case. D. Goodpasture disease Goodpasture disease is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage due to antibodies against the type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the lungs and kidneys. While this condition can cause hematuria, RBC casts, and hypertension, it typically presents with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and is not commonly associated with the systemic symptoms seen in this patient, such as arthralgia, oral ulcers, and skin rashes. The absence of pulmonary symptoms (such as hemoptysis) makes Goodpasture disease unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) In the case of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, the first-line treatment is N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC acts as an antidote by replenishing glutathione stores in the liver, which is crucial for detoxifying the reactive metabolite of paracetamol (NAPQI). Paracetamol, when taken in excessive amounts, overwhelms the liver’s ability to detoxify it, leading to hepatotoxicity. NAC works by restoring the liver’s ability to detoxify this metabolite and helps prevent or mitigate liver damage. The administration of NAC is most effective if given within 8 hours of the overdose, though it can still be beneficial later in some cases. Incorrect Answers: A. Naloxone Naloxone is used for opioid overdoses as it is an opioid antagonist that reverses the effects of opioids, such as respiratory depression. However, it has no effect on paracetamol toxicity. Since paracetamol overdose does not involve opioid receptors, naloxone is not indicated in this situation. Therefore, it is not appropriate for this case. C. L-ornithine L-ornithine is primarily used to reduce ammonia levels in conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy, where liver function is severely impaired. While it may be helpful in some liver diseases, it is not used for treating paracetamol overdose or liver toxicity caused by it. Therefore, L-ornithine is not the correct treatment for paracetamol overdose. D. L-glutamine L-glutamine is an amino acid involved in various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of glutathione in the liver. However, while glutamine is important for many cellular functions, it is not the specific treatment for paracetamol overdose. The effective antidote for paracetamol toxicity is N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as it directly replenishes glutathione levels and helps detoxify the harmful metabolites. Therefore, L-glutamine is not the correct treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Systemic sclerosis The patient presents with a mask-like face, which is a classic sign seen in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), a condition characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The positive ANA (antinuclear antibody) with a nucleolar pattern is also highly suggestive of systemic sclerosis. This specific pattern is often associated with systemic sclerosis, particularly the limited cutaneous form, which can present with features such as Raynaud's phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, and skin changes like the \"mask-like\" face due to skin tightening and thickening. The nucleolar pattern of ANA staining is often seen in patients with systemic sclerosis, making it the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A. SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) While SLE can also present with a positive ANA and facial changes (such as a malar rash, which is different from the mask-like face in systemic sclerosis), it does not typically show a nucleolar pattern on ANA testing. SLE is more commonly associated with speckled or homogeneous patterns of ANA staining. Additionally, the mask-like face described here is more characteristic of systemic sclerosis due to skin thickening, whereas SLE usually involves inflammatory skin rashes and is associated with other systemic features, such as nephritis and arthritis. C. RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is primarily an autoimmune disease that causes joint inflammation and damage. While RA can cause some skin changes, it is not typically associated with a mask-like face or a nucleolar pattern on ANA testing. RA is more commonly associated with positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies rather than ANA, especially with the nucleolar pattern. The hallmark of RA is joint involvement, especially in the small joints, and the systemic features include morning stiffness and joint deformities. D. MCTD (Mixed Connective Tissue Disease) MCTD is an overlap syndrome that includes features of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis, among others. While it can present with a positive ANA and nucleolar pattern, it typically presents with a combination of features from these diseases, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, joint involvement, and pulmonary manifestations. The mask-like face is more characteristic of systemic sclerosis, and while MCTD can share some features of systemic sclerosis, the overall presentation with the described face and the nucleolar ANA pattern is more indicative of systemic sclerosis rather than MCTD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) The presentation of oral ulcers, photosensitivity, and a malar rash (which spares the nasolabial folds) is highly suggestive of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The malar rash, often referred to as a \"butterfly rash,\" is a classic feature of SLE and is characterized by redness over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose, sparing the nasolabial folds. This is a key distinguishing feature from other conditions. Additionally, oral ulcers and photosensitivity are also common in SLE, making this diagnosis the most likely. Incorrect Answers: A. Sturge-Weber syndrome Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial port-wine stains (a type of vascular malformation), neurological involvement (such as seizures), and ocular abnormalities. It does not typically present with a malar rash, oral ulcers, or photosensitivity, which are more characteristic of SLE. The nasolabial fold sparing feature seen in SLE is not seen in Sturge-Weber syndrome, so this is not the correct diagnosis. C. Dermatitis Dermatitis is a general term for skin inflammation, which can have various causes such as allergic reactions, irritant exposure, or infection. While some forms of dermatitis can cause skin rashes, it does not typically cause the malar rash that spares the nasolabial folds or the oral ulcers seen in SLE. The photosensitivity described in the question is also more specific to SLE, rather than dermatitis, making this option less likely. D. Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that often presents with scaly, erythematous plaques on the elbows, knees, and scalp, among other areas. It does not typically present with a malar rash, oral ulcers, or photosensitivity, which are hallmark features of SLE. Psoriasis also does not cause a rash that spares the nasolabial folds, further distinguishing it from SLE.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Add sulfasalazine. In the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially in cases where monotherapy with methotrexate (MTX), steroids, and NSAIDs is insufficient, the next rational step is to escalate to combination DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) therapy. Since the patient has already been on MTX (a conventional DMARD) for 4 months with ongoing disease progression, it is appropriate to consider adding another conventional synthetic DMARD, such as sulfasalazine. This combination (often with hydroxychloroquine as well) forms a widely accepted and cost-effective regimen called triple therapy, known for its efficacy in patients with inadequate response to MTX alone. According to guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), step-up therapy using combination conventional DMARDs is recommended before switching to biologics in patients with mild to moderate disease activity. A. Start monotherapy with anti-TNF alpha drugs – Incorrect. While anti-TNF agents (like etanercept or adalimumab) are effective in moderate-to-severe RA, they are not first-line agents after methotrexate failure, especially in mild disease. Current guidelines recommend trying combination conventional DMARD therapy before initiating biologics due to higher cost, need for screening (e.g., TB), and risk of immunosuppression. B. Continue the same treatment – Incorrect. Continuing the current regimen despite evidence of disease progression after 4 months is inappropriate. Persistent inflammation indicates inadequate disease control, and continuing ineffective therapy would increase the risk of joint damage and disability. C. Start oral MTX and parenteral MTX – Incorrect. There is no rationale for using both oral and parenteral methotrexate simultaneously. If MTX in oral form is not effective, switching to the parenteral form (which has better bioavailability at higher doses) is reasonable, but that would not be sufficient as monotherapy in this case given ongoing progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton, particularly the sacroiliac joints and spine. The hallmark clinical features include low back pain that improves with activity, early morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes, and reduced chest expansion due to involvement of the costovertebral joints. These symptoms are typically seen in young males, often presenting before the age of 45. The combination of inflammatory back pain and restriction of spinal and chest mobility is characteristic of AS and should prompt further evaluation, such as HLA-B27 testing and pelvic X-rays for sacroiliitis. A. Osteoporosis – Incorrect. Osteoporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. It does not present with inflammatory back pain or chest expansion restriction. It’s more common in elderly individuals and postmenopausal women, and does not cause early morning stiffness. B. Disc prolapse – Incorrect. Disc prolapse typically presents with acute or subacute localized back pain that may radiate to the limbs (sciatica) and worsen with activity, not improve with it. It is mechanical, not inflammatory, and chest expansion is typically unaffected. C. TB spine – Incorrect. Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) can cause back pain, but it is usually associated with constitutional symptoms like fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Chest expansion is not typically reduced, and the stiffness is not characteristically worse in the morning or relieved by activity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy that primarily affects young males and involves chronic inflammatory back pain, often beginning before the age of 40. A key characteristic of AS is inflammatory enthesitis — inflammation at the sites where ligaments or tendons insert into bone — which commonly affects the heel, particularly the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia, leading to bilateral heel pain. Additionally, AS is associated with extra-articular manifestations, most notably acute anterior uveitis, which presents as red, painful eyes with photophobia and blurred vision. The combination of chronic back pain, bilateral heel pain, and red eyes (suggestive of uveitis) is highly indicative of ankylosing spondylitis. This constellation of findings, especially in a young male, strongly supports the diagnosis. B. Spinal TB – Incorrect. Spinal tuberculosis (Pott’s disease) usually presents with localized back pain and may cause deformity or neurological symptoms due to vertebral destruction. It is typically accompanied by constitutional symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Heel pain and uveitis are not characteristic features of spinal TB. C. Mechanical low back pain – Incorrect. Mechanical back pain is generally activity-related, improves with rest, and is not associated with systemic or inflammatory signs. It does not cause enthesitis (heel pain) or ocular inflammation. Chronic duration without inflammation makes this option less likely. D. Gout – Incorrect. Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that usually affects peripheral joints, such as the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and occurs in episodic flares. It is not associated with chronic back pain, bilateral heel involvement, or uveitis. Gout is also more common in older males and is typically linked to dietary factors or metabolic disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hepatic dysfunction. In long-standing chronic seropositive arthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple systemic complications can occur due to chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, or side effects of treatment. However, hepatic dysfunction is not a typical direct manifestation of RA itself. While liver enzyme abnormalities may sometimes be seen due to drug-induced hepatotoxicity (e.g., from methotrexate or leflunomide), the disease itself does not commonly cause primary liver dysfunction. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction is not considered a characteristic feature of the chronic disease process in seropositive RA. A. Neutropenia – Incorrect. Neutropenia can occur in long-standing RA, especially in the context of Felty’s syndrome, a triad of RA, splenomegaly, and neutropenia. This syndrome is more common in seropositive patients with long-standing disease and is a recognized hematologic complication. C. Peripheral neuropathy – Incorrect. Peripheral neuropathy, especially mononeuritis multiplex, can occur in RA due to vasculitis involving the vasa nervorum. This is a known extra-articular complication of severe, long-standing seropositive RA. D. Anemia – Incorrect. Anemia of chronic disease is one of the most common hematologic findings in RA due to chronic inflammation interfering with iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. Additionally, anemia may be worsened by medications or gastrointestinal blood loss from NSAIDs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Steroids. In giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, the first-line treatment is high-dose corticosteroids, typically prednisone. GCA is a large-vessel vasculitis that most commonly affects older adults and can lead to serious complications like irreversible vision loss due to ischemic optic neuropathy. Symptoms such as new-onset headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness are classic features. Because of the risk of sudden vision loss, treatment with steroids should be initiated immediately, even before biopsy confirmation. Steroids rapidly reduce vascular inflammation and help prevent complications, making them the cornerstone of initial therapy. A. Methotrexate – Incorrect. While methotrexate can be used as a steroid-sparing agent in some patients with GCA, it is not first-line therapy for acute presentation. It may be considered in patients with frequent relapses or when long-term steroid use is contraindicated. C. Tocilizumab – Incorrect. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, has shown benefit in GCA and may be used for patients with relapsing or refractory disease, or to reduce steroid burden. However, it is not the initial treatment in an acute setting with active symptoms. D. Infliximab – Incorrect. Infliximab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, is not standard treatment for GCA and lacks strong evidence in this condition. It is primarily used in other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s disease, but not recommended in GCA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis is a large-vessel granulomatous vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and its major branches, and it commonly occurs in young women under 40 years of age. The disease typically presents in two phases: an initial systemic phase with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss, followed by a vascular phase characterized by claudication of limbs, diminished or absent peripheral pulses, and bruits over large arteries — hence the name “pulseless disease.” Forearm claudication and absence of upper limb pulses are classic features. Ocular involvement, including visual disturbances and retinal hemorrhages, can occur due to arterial occlusion or ischemia affecting the ocular vessels. This combination of systemic symptoms, pulse deficits, limb claudication, and visual signs is characteristic of Takayasu arteritis. A. Microscopic polyangiitis – Incorrect. Microscopic polyangiitis is a small-vessel vasculitis that typically causes glomerulonephritis and pulmonary capillaritis, not large artery occlusion or pulse deficits. It does not explain absent upper limb pulses or forearm claudication, making it an unlikely cause here. B. Thromboangiitis obliterans – Incorrect. Also known as Buerger’s disease, this condition primarily affects young male smokers and involves distal small- and medium-sized arteries, particularly in the lower limbs. It does not involve systemic symptoms or retinal findings, and upper limb large vessel involvement is unusual. D. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) – Incorrect. PAN is a medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis that can involve multiple organs but typically spares the lungs and the retina. It often causes mononeuritis multiplex, hypertension, or abdominal pain, but visual disturbances and absent limb pulses are not typical features.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Steroid. The child in this case presents with palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and melena, which are classic features of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), now called IgA vasculitis. It is the most common systemic vasculitis in children and involves small vessels with deposition of IgA immune complexes. The disease often affects the skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. While HSP is typically self-limiting, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) are used in moderate to severe cases, particularly when there is severe abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding (like melena), or renal involvement. Steroids help in rapidly reducing inflammation and alleviating symptoms, especially abdominal and joint-related issues. B. Azathioprine – Incorrect. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent used in chronic autoimmune conditions or for maintaining remission in diseases like lupus nephritis or inflammatory bowel disease. It is not used in the acute treatment of HSP in children. C. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) primarily used in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. It has no role in the routine management of IgA vasculitis, especially in children. D. Cyclophosphamide – Incorrect. Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressant reserved for life-threatening or severe systemic vasculitis, such as ANCA-associated vasculitis with renal or pulmonary involvement. It is not indicated in typical or even complicated HSP, particularly in children where the disease is usually self-limited or steroid-responsive.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Behçet’s disease. Behçet’s disease is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder that often presents in young adults, especially males, and is characterized by a triad of recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis (eye inflammation). In this case, the patient has recurrent oral ulcers, eye redness (likely uveitis or conjunctivitis), and a history of venous thrombosis, which is a well-known vascular complication in Behçet’s due to its predilection for causing both arterial and venous inflammation (vasculitis). The presence of mucocutaneous, ocular, and vascular symptoms in a young adult strongly supports the diagnosis of Behçet’s disease. This condition is common along the “Silk Road” region (Middle East to East Asia), but it can be seen globally. A. SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) – Incorrect. While SLE can present with oral ulcers and vascular thrombosis (especially in antiphospholipid syndrome), it is more common in females, and ocular involvement typically presents as retinal vasculitis or lupus retinopathy rather than uveitis. Genital ulcers are not typical of SLE, making Behçet’s more likely in this presentation. B. Reiter’s syndrome (Reactive arthritis) – Incorrect. Reiter’s syndrome presents with the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, often after a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection. However, oral ulcers and venous thrombosis are not characteristic, and the absence of arthritis or a preceding infection argues against this diagnosis. D. Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) – Incorrect. Wegener’s typically involves upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., sinusitis, nasal ulcers, hemoptysis) and glomerulonephritis. Although it may cause oral or nasal ulcers, it does not typically present with venous thrombosis or conjunctival injection without respiratory or renal signs. Also, it's rare in young adults.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mitral regurgitation. The murmur depicted in the image (presumably a phonocardiogram) is characteristic of mitral regurgitation (MR). MR produces a high-pitched, blowing holosystolic murmur that begins with S1 (first heart sound) and continues through S2 (second heart sound) without a gap. It is best heard at the apex of the heart and typically radiates to the axilla. This murmur results from retrograde blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole due to an incompetent mitral valve. MR can occur due to causes such as mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic heart disease, or infective endocarditis. B. Aortic regurgitation – Incorrect. Aortic regurgitation produces an early diastolic decrescendo murmur, not a systolic one. It is best heard at the left sternal border with the patient leaning forward and holding their breath in expiration. The murmur occurs after S2, which doesn’t match the timing of the murmur seen in MR. C. Aortic stenosis – Incorrect. Aortic stenosis presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, best heard at the right upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. While it's a systolic murmur like MR, it has a diamond-shaped (ejection) profile, not a flat, holosystolic one. D. Mitral stenosis – Incorrect. Mitral stenosis causes a low-pitched, rumbling diastolic murmur, often preceded by an opening snap. It’s best heard at the apex in the left lateral position. It occurs after S2, during diastole, and is not a systolic murmur like in MR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ankylosing Spondylitis The most probable diagnosis is Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to stiffness and pain. This patient presents with early morning backache and stiffness that improves with exercise, a hallmark of AS. The persistent red eyes are likely due to associated iritis or uveitis, which are common extra-articular manifestations of AS. The reduced lung expansion (<3 cm) can be explained by the progressive spinal involvement and thoracic cage stiffness, which limits lung expansion. On X-ray, characteristic findings of AS, such as sacroiliitis and the bamboo spine, may be visible, confirming the diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: B. Paget’s Disease Paget's disease of bone typically causes bone deformities and fractures, but it does not commonly present with early morning backache or stiffness improving with exercise. The hallmark feature of Paget's disease is abnormal bone remodeling, often seen in the pelvis, spine, and skull. However, it is not typically associated with red eyes or significant lung involvement. X-ray findings in Paget’s disease show bone enlargement and thickening, not the typical features of AS. C. Healed Tuberculosis Healed tuberculosis can cause residual effects, such as fibrosis or lung restriction, but it would not typically present with early morning back stiffness that improves with exercise or red eyes. Moreover, healed TB would not lead to the characteristic sacroiliac joint involvement or bamboo spine seen in AS. The X-ray may show old pulmonary scars, but the patient's clinical symptoms and presentation do not align with healed TB. D. Osteopetrosis Osteopetrosis, or marble bone disease, is a genetic condition characterized by abnormal bone hardening due to defective osteoclast function. It leads to increased bone density, which may be evident on X-ray, but it typically presents with bone fractures, cranial nerve palsies, and hearing loss rather than back stiffness or red eyes. This condition does not involve the spine in a manner consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, nor does it cause lung restriction or extra-articular manifestations like uveitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) IV Mannitol The most likely diagnosis here is dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, a rare but serious complication that can occur during or shortly after dialysis. It is characterized by neurological symptoms such as drowsiness, seizures, and hypotension. The condition arises due to an osmotic gradient between the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the rapid reduction of urea and other solutes during dialysis. This leads to water shifting into the brain, causing cerebral edema and the associated neurological symptoms. IV Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can help reduce cerebral edema by drawing water out of the brain and into the bloodstream, which helps alleviate the symptoms of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Incorrect Answers: A. Bumetanide Bumetanide is a loop diuretic used to treat conditions like edema and fluid retention. It acts on the kidneys to increase urine output. While it can help manage fluid balance, it is not effective for treating cerebral edema or the neurological complications of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. The issue in this case is not fluid overload but rather the osmotic imbalance caused by dialysis, which makes bumetanide inappropriate. B. Ethacrynic Acid Ethacrynic acid, like bumetanide, is a loop diuretic used for conditions involving fluid retention. It functions similarly to bumetanide, increasing urine output. However, it does not address the underlying issue of cerebral edema caused by the osmotic shifts that occur during dialysis. Therefore, it is not the correct treatment in this situation. C. Nesiritide Nesiritide is a recombinant form of B-type natriuretic peptide used to treat acute decompensated heart failure by reducing fluid overload and vasodilation. While it can reduce symptoms of heart failure, it does not help with the cerebral edema associated with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. It is primarily used for cardiac issues, not for managing neurological complications after dialysis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Diltiazem The patient is presenting with symptoms that strongly suggest thyroid storm—a severe form of hyperthyroidism, which can manifest with symptoms like restlessness, palpitations, tremors, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the swollen neck indicates a possible goiter, a classic sign of thyroid dysfunction. The immediate management of thyroid storm involves controlling the heart rate and managing the underlying hyperthyroidism. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is used in this situation to control the tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. It is preferred in patients with thyroid storm who have a history of bronchial asthma because, unlike beta-blockers, it does not cause bronchoconstriction and is safe for asthmatic patients. Incorrect Answers: B. Propranolol Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used in the management of thyroid storm to control tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. However, it should be avoided in this patient because she has bronchial asthma, and beta-blockers can worsen bronchoconstriction, leading to an asthma attack. Although propranolol can be beneficial in controlling heart rate, it poses a risk in patients with respiratory conditions, making it less suitable for this case. C. Esmolol Esmolol is a short-acting beta-blocker that is typically used in cases where rapid heart rate control is needed. While it could theoretically help control the tachycardia in thyroid storm, it is not ideal for this patient because, like propranolol, it can cause bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. Therefore, its use is contraindicated in this case due to the risk of exacerbating asthma symptoms. D. Propylthiouracil Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid medication that can be used to block the synthesis of thyroid hormones and treat hyperthyroidism. While it is an important part of the management of thyroid storm, PTU does not provide immediate control of tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, which are the acute concerns in this patient. Immediate management focuses on controlling the heart rate and symptoms, which is why a drug like diltiazem is preferred in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tenofovir for > 40 weeks The patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B, indicated by the presence of HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen), which suggests active viral replication. The patient has an elevated viral load (2 x 10^5 copies/mL), which confirms active replication of the virus, along with a doubling of SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), indicating liver inflammation. Given these findings, Tenofovir, a nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), is an appropriate treatment for chronic hepatitis B due to its high potency and low resistance profile. Tenofovir is typically used for long-term management, often for >40 weeks (and potentially indefinitely, depending on response). It effectively reduces viral replication and liver inflammation, reducing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Incorrect Answers: A. Lamivudine for 30+ weeks Lamivudine is another NRTI used to treat chronic hepatitis B, but it is less ideal in this patient. Lamivudine has a higher rate of resistance over time, especially in patients with high viral loads, such as this one. While it can be used initially, it is generally not recommended for long-term therapy in patients with significant viral replication due to the risk of resistance. Therefore, Tenofovir is preferred over lamivudine for longer-term therapy. C. Pegylated interferon for 52 weeks Pegylated interferon is an immune-modulating agent that can be used to treat chronic hepatitis B. However, it is usually reserved for patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B or those who do not have high viral loads. It is not the first-line therapy for patients with high viral loads and active hepatitis, as in this case, due to its adverse side effects, including flu-like symptoms, bone marrow suppression, and potential thyroid dysfunction. The treatment duration (52 weeks) can also be challenging for some patients. Therefore, Tenofovir is the more appropriate choice in this case. D. Combined pegylated interferon with lamivudine Combining pegylated interferon with lamivudine is not standard practice in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. While the combination therapy might have some theoretical benefits, it is not preferred due to the increased risk of resistance with lamivudine and the significant side effects associated with interferon therapy. This combination does not offer any clear advantage over Tenofovir monotherapy, which is both safer and more effective in reducing viral load and liver inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Thyroid receptor antibody The patient presents with symptoms like palpitations, sweating, restlessness, and sweaty palms, which are suggestive of hyperthyroidism or an overactive thyroid. The clinical findings, likely involving signs like exophthalmos (protruding eyes) or a goiter, suggest the possibility of Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The key diagnostic finding in this condition is the presence of thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb), which are autoantibodies that stimulate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, leading to increased thyroid hormone production. These antibodies are characteristic of Graves' disease, confirming the diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Anti-thyroglobulin antibody Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are often associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition that causes hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. These antibodies can be elevated in autoimmune thyroid diseases, but they are not specific to Graves' disease or hyperthyroidism. Therefore, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies would not be the diagnostic finding in this patient with symptoms of hyperthyroidism. B. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies are also primarily associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and some cases of autoimmune thyroid disease. They are markers of thyroid inflammation and can be found in patients with hypothyroidism. Like anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, they are not specific to Graves' disease or hyperthyroidism. Thus, this would not be the correct diagnostic finding for a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism. D. Elevated ultrasensitive thyrotropin levels In hyperthyroidism, thyrotropin (TSH) levels are typically low, not elevated. This is because the body decreases TSH production in response to high levels of circulating thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). An elevated ultrasensitive TSH level would be seen in hypothyroidism, where the feedback mechanism causes TSH levels to rise. Therefore, elevated TSH levels would not support a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Kaposi Sarcoma The most likely diagnosis in this 50-year-old HIV-positive patient with a painful skin lesion is Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor associated with Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and occurs most commonly in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with AIDS. It presents as painful, purple or dark red plaques or nodules that can appear on the skin, oral mucosa, and internal organs. The lesions are often multiple and may be non-blanching due to their vascular nature. Kaposi sarcoma is a common AIDS-defining illness and is strongly linked to low CD4 counts. The appearance of the lesion in an HIV-positive patient is characteristic and highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, but it typically presents as a pearly papule with rolled borders and central ulceration, usually in sun-exposed areas like the face. BCC grows slowly and is rarely painful. It is not associated with HIV or immunosuppression and does not appear as violaceous or vascular lesions, making it unlikely in this case. C. Malignant Melanoma Malignant melanoma often presents as a pigmented lesion with features described by the ABCDE rule (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter >6 mm, Evolving). While melanoma can occur in immunocompromised patients, it is generally not painful in early stages and is not associated with the typical vascular, purplish lesions seen in Kaposi sarcoma. The clinical context and lesion appearance are more consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. D. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) SCC can present as a scaly, crusted, or ulcerated lesion, often in sun-exposed areas, and can become painful. However, SCC usually lacks the violaceous or reddish-purple vascular appearance of Kaposi sarcoma and is more common in older individuals with a history of chronic sun exposure or immunosuppression (e.g., transplant recipients). Although HIV patients are at increased risk for SCC, the lesion described is more typical of Kaposi sarcoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Basal Ganglia The patient presents with resting tremors, rigidity, and reduced emotional expression and motivation, all of which are classic features of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the basal ganglia, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to a deficiency in dopamine. The basal ganglia are deeply involved in the regulation of voluntary motor control, muscle tone, and movement initiation, as well as certain non-motor functions like motivation and emotional expression. The hallmark motor features (resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor features (affective flattening, apathy) seen in this patient directly result from basal ganglia dysfunction, confirming it as the affected region. Incorrect Answers: B. Hippocampus The hippocampus is primarily involved in learning and memory formation, particularly in short-term to long-term memory consolidation. Damage to the hippocampus is typically associated with memory loss or amnesia, not with motor symptoms like tremors and rigidity. Therefore, it does not explain the clinical picture seen in this patient. C. Cerebellum The cerebellum coordinates balance, posture, and fine motor movements, especially during active movement. Cerebellar lesions typically result in ataxia, intention tremor, and dysmetria, not the resting tremor and rigidity seen in this patient. Hence, while the cerebellum is important for motor function, the nature of the motor symptoms points away from cerebellar involvement. D. Premotor Cortex The premotor cortex helps plan and organize voluntary movements. Lesions here may cause difficulty initiating voluntary movement (apraxia), but they do not typically cause the tremor, rigidity, or emotional blunting observed in Parkinson's disease. Thus, while this area plays a role in motor planning, it is not the primary site affected in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HIV with disseminated histoplasmosis The clinical presentation of a 45-year-old HIV-positive male with persistent cough, weight loss, umbilicated papular skin lesions, and bilateral nodular infiltrates on chest X-ray, combined with a negative CBNAAT for tuberculosis and low CD4 count, strongly suggests disseminated histoplasmosis. Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that commonly affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with AIDS and CD4 counts <150 cells/mm³. The disease often begins as a pulmonary infection and can progress to disseminated disease, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Skin lesions in disseminated histoplasmosis may mimic molluscum contagiosum (umbilicated papules), and the lung involvement with systemic symptoms like weight loss is consistent with fungal dissemination. This constellation of findings points toward disseminated histoplasmosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients in endemic areas. Incorrect Answers: B. HIV with disseminated cryptococcosis Cryptococcosis, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, typically presents in HIV patients with central nervous system symptoms, such as meningitis, and less commonly with pulmonary or cutaneous manifestations. Although disseminated cryptococcosis can involve the lungs and skin, umbilicated papular skin lesions are less classic, and cough and bilateral pulmonary nodules are more characteristic of histoplasmosis. Moreover, cryptococcal skin lesions are often less numerous and not primarily distributed on the face and trunk. C. HIV with molluscum contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection caused by a poxvirus, which presents with umbilicated papules and is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV. However, molluscum contagiosum is limited to the skin and does not cause systemic symptoms like cough, weight loss, or pulmonary infiltrates. The presence of systemic signs and pulmonary nodular infiltrates rules out molluscum contagiosum as the primary diagnosis. D. HIV with tuberculosis While tuberculosis (TB) is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients and can present with cough and weight loss, the diagnosis is unlikely here because the CBNAAT for TB was negative. Moreover, TB does not typically present with umbilicated skin lesions, which are much more characteristic of fungal infections like histoplasmosis. Also, bilateral nodular infiltrates are more typical of fungal dissemination than TB in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Herpes simplex virus The most likely etiology for a patient presenting with seizures, fever, headache, confusion, and MRI showing inflammation of the bitemporal lobes is Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis, particularly caused by HSV-1. HSV encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis in adults. It characteristically affects the temporal lobes, leading to necrosis, edema, and hemorrhagic inflammation, which explains the bitemporal involvement seen on MRI. Clinically, patients often present with altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic signs, and if left untreated, the condition can rapidly progress to coma or death. Early recognition and treatment with IV acyclovir are crucial to improve outcomes. Incorrect Answers: A. Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV) typically causes ventriculoencephalitis or polyradiculopathy in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with advanced HIV/AIDS. It does not usually cause isolated bitemporal lobe inflammation, and seizures are less commonly the initial presenting symptom compared to HSV. Thus, CMV is unlikely in this scenario. B. Toxoplasma gondii Toxoplasma gondii is a parasitic infection that commonly affects HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts <100. It typically presents with ring-enhancing lesions on MRI, primarily in the basal ganglia or corticomedullary junction, rather than the temporal lobes. The presence of bitemporal inflammation makes HSV a more probable diagnosis. D. Mycobacterium tuberculosis CNS tuberculosis usually manifests as tuberculous meningitis, tuberculomas, or abscesses, often involving the basal cisterns or posterior fossa and not specifically the temporal lobes. The presentation is more subacute or chronic, with cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, and meningeal signs, rather than acute seizures and bitemporal inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Subacute combined degeneration of the cord The most probable diagnosis is Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord, which is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition leads to demyelination of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, resulting in the characteristic combination of sensory loss (especially proprioception and vibration sense), upper motor neuron (UMN) signs in the lower limbs (e.g., spasticity, weakness), and absent deep tendon reflexes due to peripheral nerve involvement. The presence of angular stomatitis supports a nutritional deficiency, particularly of B vitamins. The chronic progression over 3 months also aligns with SCD. Patients may also have ataxia, a positive Romberg sign, and in advanced cases, neuropsychiatric symptoms. Incorrect Answers: A. Extradural cord compression Extradural compression (e.g., from tumor or abscess) typically causes localized back pain, progressive motor weakness, and sensory level deficits, often with a more acute or subacute onset. It doesn't explain the nutritional signs like angular stomatitis, and loss of vibration and proprioception with UMN signs in the absence of a discrete sensory level is more suggestive of SCD. B. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ALS affects both upper and lower motor neurons, causing progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and fasciculations. However, sensory pathways are typically spared, so loss of proprioception and vibration sense would not be explained. The presence of angular stomatitis also makes ALS less likely. C. Multiple sclerosis (MS) MS may cause multifocal neurological deficits, including UMN signs and sensory loss, but it typically presents in younger patients (20–40 years old), often with relapsing-remitting episodes. It also rarely causes nutritional deficiency signs like angular stomatitis. Moreover, MS would not classically present with such symmetrical and chronic sensory-motor findings.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tricuspid Stenosis The most likely diagnosis is Tricuspid Stenosis (TS), which is characterized by chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, a mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border, and a prominent ‘a’ wave in the jugular venous pulse (JVP). Tricuspid stenosis impedes the flow of blood from the right atrium to the right ventricle during diastole, causing right atrial enlargement, which in turn leads to a prominent 'a' wave on JVP due to increased resistance during atrial contraction. The diastolic murmur is due to turbulent flow across the narrowed tricuspid valve during diastole. This condition is more common in rheumatic heart disease and is often associated with other valvular lesions. Incorrect Answers: A. Mitral Stenosis Mitral stenosis also causes a mid-diastolic murmur, but it is typically heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, not at the left sternal border. It causes pulmonary congestion and left atrial enlargement, which may produce a tapping apex beat or opening snap, but does not cause a prominent 'a' wave on JVP, as it affects the left heart. C. Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation presents with a pansystolic murmur heard best at the apex and radiating to the axilla, not a mid-diastolic murmur. It leads to volume overload of the left atrium and ventricle, but again, does not affect JVP or produce a prominent 'a' wave. D. Tricuspid Regurgitation Tricuspid regurgitation produces a pansystolic murmur that increases with inspiration (Carvallo’s sign) and is best heard at the lower left sternal border. It may cause giant v waves in the JVP due to regurgitant flow during systole, not prominent 'a' waves. Hence, it does not fit the auscultatory or JVP findings in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Spironolactone The ECG in a hypertensive patient on multiple antihypertensives likely shows peaked T waves, widened QRS, or other signs consistent with hyperkalemia—a known side effect of spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic. Spironolactone acts as an aldosterone antagonist, reducing sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal nephron. This leads to potassium retention, which can result in hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal impairment or those on other medications that affect potassium balance. ECG changes in hyperkalemia include tall, peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, flattened P waves, and eventually widened QRS complex—which can be life-threatening. Therefore, spironolactone is the most likely drug responsible for these ECG findings. Incorrect Answers: A. Prazosin Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker used for hypertension. It primarily causes vasodilation and may lead to postural hypotension, but it does not typically affect serum potassium levels or produce ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia. Hence, it is unlikely to be responsible for the ECG findings. B. Metoprolol Metoprolol is a beta-1 selective blocker that may cause bradycardia or AV nodal delay, but it is not associated with electrolyte imbalances like hyperkalemia. It may cause flattened T waves or prolonged PR interval in overdose, but not the characteristic changes of hyperkalemia. C. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that leads to potassium loss (hypokalemia), not hyperkalemia. Hypokalemia typically produces ECG findings such as U waves, flattened T waves, and ST depression, which are opposite to the changes seen in hyperkalemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Parkinson’s disease The most likely diagnosis is Parkinson’s disease, particularly a Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) variant, given the patient's progressive functional decline, visual hallucinations, convulsions, and neuropathology showing Lewy bodies in neurons. Lewy bodies are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions composed primarily of alpha-synuclein, and are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. While the classic presentation of Parkinson’s includes motor symptoms like resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability, cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations often develop in later stages. The behavioral symptoms like social withdrawal and fixed gaze behavior further support a neurodegenerative process involving subcortical and cortical structures. Incorrect Answers: B. Prion disease Prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) can present with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and EEG abnormalities, but Lewy bodies are not found in prion disorders. Prion diseases are marked by spongiform changes, not alpha-synuclein aggregates. Additionally, visual hallucinations are less characteristic, and the course is typically more rapid than described here. C. Huntington’s chorea Huntington’s disease is a genetic disorder that presents earlier (typically in the 30s–50s) with a triad of chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. It is autosomal dominant and caused by CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene. Lewy bodies are not seen in Huntington’s disease, and seizures and hallucinations are not early or prominent features. D. Alzheimer’s disease Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, usually associated with gradual memory loss and executive dysfunction. While hallucinations can occur, they are not as prominent or early as in Parkinson-related dementias. Pathology in Alzheimer’s shows amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, not Lewy bodies. Convulsions are also not typical in early Alzheimer's.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) DDAVP supplements for lifelong The patient presents with polyuria, hypernatremia (Na? = 155 mEq/L), and low urine osmolality (200 mOsm/kg), in the context of a history of total hypophysectomy, strongly indicating central diabetes insipidus (CDI). CDI results from deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) due to damage or removal of the posterior pituitary or hypothalamus. The definitive treatment is lifelong desmopressin (DDAVP) supplementation, a synthetic analog of ADH, which helps concentrate the urine and correct the water imbalance. Without ADH, patients are unable to retain free water, leading to high serum sodium levels and dilute urine, which can result in dehydration and neurologic symptoms if left untreated. Lifelong therapy is essential because the underlying cause (hypophysectomy) is permanent and irreversible. Incorrect Answers: A. DDAVP for 2 weeks and then discontinue This is incorrect because CDI due to total hypophysectomy is a permanent condition, and the body cannot regenerate ADH production. Temporary treatment would not address the chronic nature of the hormone deficiency. C. Upsetting of receptors so no treatment required This option confuses nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (where ADH receptors are dysfunctional) with central DI. In central DI, the problem lies in ADH production, not receptor sensitivity. Thus, treatment is required, and receptor function is intact. D. Thiazides for 2 weeks Thiazides may be used as a symptomatic treatment in nephrogenic DI, where they reduce polyuria through paradoxical mechanisms. However, in central DI, thiazides do not address the hormonal deficiency and are not definitive treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pancoast tumor The most likely diagnosis is Pancoast tumor, a type of lung cancer that typically occurs at the apex of the lung, often involving the superior pulmonary sulcus. This type of tumor can cause upper chest discomfort and radiating pain due to its proximity to the brachial plexus and sympathetic nerve chain. The symptoms described, including drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), pain radiating to the upper arm, and tingling in the 4th and 5th digits of the left hand, are classic signs of Horner’s syndrome, which occurs when the sympathetic nerves are involved. Horner’s syndrome can result from the tumor compressing the sympathetic pathway, leading to ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Chest x-ray findings of a mass at the apex of the lung would support this diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: B. Upper lobe pneumonia While upper lobe pneumonia can cause chest discomfort and pain, it is less likely to cause Horner’s syndrome or the neurological symptoms described (e.g., tingling in the 4th and 5th digits). Pneumonia would typically present with symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea, and would show consolidation or infiltrates in the upper lobe on chest x-ray, not a mass like a Pancoast tumor. C. Superior vena cava obstruction Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction presents with symptoms such as facial and upper extremity edema, jugular venous distension, and cyanosis, due to the impaired venous return to the heart. While this could cause chest discomfort, it would not explain the ptosis or the tingling in the hand. The x-ray would show features of SVC obstruction, such as a mediastinal mass or enlarged veins. The absence of these signs and the specific neurological findings make SVC obstruction less likely in this case. D. Aspergilloma Aspergilloma, or a fungal ball, typically forms in pre-existing lung cavities, often in individuals with previous lung disease, such as tuberculosis or emphysema. It usually causes hemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea rather than the neurological symptoms seen in this patient. The x-ray findings would typically show a fungal ball within a lung cavity, which is not consistent with the findings of a Pancoast tumor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 1. Acute pain and swelling of the great toe (podagra): This is the most common initial presentation of gout. 2. Chronic alcoholic patient: Alcohol consumption, especially beer and spirits, is a significant risk factor for gout because it increases uric acid production and inhibits its excretion. 3. Normal serum uric acid levels during an acute flare: It is a common misconception that serum uric acid levels must be elevated during an acute gout attack. In fact, during an acute flare, uric acid can precipitate out of the blood and into the joint, leading to normal or even transiently low serum levels. A definitive diagnosis of gout is made by finding monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid, but clinically, this presentation is highly suggestive. 4. Raised leukocytes in synovial fluid: This indicates an inflammatory process, consistent with any acute arthritis, including gout. Incorrect Options: Other options (A. Pseudogout) Explanation: Pseudogout (Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Deposition Disease - CPPD) is caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals. While it can cause acute arthritis, it less commonly affects the great toe as the primary site and is more often seen in larger joints (e.g., knee, wrist). Chronic alcoholism is not a direct primary risk factor for pseudogout as it is for gout. Other Options (C. Reactive arthritis) Explanation: Reactive arthritis typically follows a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection and often presents as an asymmetric oligoarthritis (affecting a few joints) with features like dactylitis (\"sausage digits\") or enthesitis. There is no mention of a preceding infection in this patient's history. Other Options (D. Septic arthritis) Explanation: Septic arthritis (joint infection) is always a critical consideration in any acutely inflamed joint, especially in an immunocompromised patient (which chronic alcoholics can be). It would also show raised leukocytes in synovial fluid. However, the specific presentation of acute great toe pain in a chronic alcoholic strongly points towards gout as the most likely diagnosis, given its high prevalence in this demographic and classic joint involvement. While septic arthritis must be ruled out (e.g., by synovial fluid culture), gout is the more common diagnosis for this precise clinical picture.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Constrictive pericarditis The most likely diagnosis is constrictive pericarditis. This condition occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic, restricting the normal diastolic filling of the heart and leading to right heart failure symptoms. The key features in this case are: Right heart failure: Causing symptoms such as edema, ascites, and jugular venous distension (JVD). The irregularly irregular pulse could suggest atrial fibrillation, which is common in constrictive pericarditis due to atrial stretch. The loud diastolic sound is likely an opening snap associated with constrictive pericarditis due to rapid filling during diastole. The rapid Y descent in the JVP is a hallmark sign of constrictive pericarditis. This occurs because, during inspiration, the heart is unable to expand properly due to the rigid pericardium, leading to a rapid fall in the JVP. Incorrect Answers: B. Cardiac tamponade Cardiac tamponade presents with hypotension, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, and JVD, but it is characterized by a blunted Y descent on the JVP, not a rapid one. The heart is restricted from pumping effectively due to fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, which compresses the heart. Unlike constrictive pericarditis, there is no thickening of the pericardium, and the diastolic sound is not typical in tamponade. C. Mitral stenosis Mitral stenosis leads to left heart failure rather than right heart failure, and the symptoms are usually characterized by dyspnea, orthopnea, and pulmonary congestion. On auscultation, a diastolic murmur (not a loud diastolic sound) is typically heard due to the stenotic mitral valve. A loud S1 and opening snap may be present, but the findings on the JVP and the presence of right heart failure symptoms make mitral stenosis unlikely in this case. D. Aortic regurgitation Aortic regurgitation typically presents with left heart failure, characterized by dyspnea, orthopnea, and pulmonary edema. On physical examination, there is usually a bounding pulse, wide pulse pressure, and a diastolic murmur. The loud diastolic sound mentioned here would not be typical in aortic regurgitation, and the JVP findings (rapid Y descent) also suggest a right heart problem, which is not characteristic of aortic regurgitation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Valsalva maneuver In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the murmur typically increases with maneuvers that decrease venous return or reduce preload. The Valsalva maneuver is a classic test for this, and it increases the intensity of the murmur in HCM. This maneuver reduces the return of blood to the heart, leading to a decreased left ventricular volume. As a result, the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction becomes more pronounced in HCM, causing the murmur to intensify. In HCM, the hypertrophied septum obstructs the outflow of blood, and this obstruction worsens when the heart has less blood volume (as during the Valsalva maneuver), thereby increasing the murmur. Incorrect Answers: A. Handgrip Handgrip increases afterload, which typically decreases the murmur in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. By increasing afterload, it reduces the degree of outflow tract obstruction, because the increased resistance makes it harder for the blood to flow out of the heart. Therefore, the murmur will typically decrease with handgrip. C. Squatting Squatting increases venous return and preload to the heart, which increases the left ventricular volume and reduces the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This results in decreased intensity of the murmur, as the increased volume helps to relieve the obstruction. D. Increase on leaning forwards Leaning forwards typically accentuates murmurs of aortic regurgitation, as it brings the heart closer to the chest wall, allowing for better auscultation of the murmur. However, it does not significantly affect the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is primarily influenced by changes in preload or afterload, such as with the Valsalva maneuver or squatting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4 The correct matching is based on the typical characteristics of each arrhythmia: A. Atrial fibrillation (A-1): Atrial fibrillation is a chaotic electrical activity in the atria, leading to irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm. It is one of the most common arrhythmias, especially in older adults or those with structural heart disease. It is characterized by no distinct P waves and an irregular ventricular response. B. Atrial flutter (B-2): Atrial flutter is a reentrant tachyarrhythmia that leads to a regular rapid atrial rhythm (typically 250-350 beats per minute), often with a sawtooth pattern of flutter waves on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The conduction is typically 2:1 or 4:1 to the ventricle, leading to a regular ventricular response. C. PSVT (C-3): Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is an arrhythmia originating above the ventricles, typically characterized by a sudden onset and termination. It involves narrow QRS complexes and is usually regular. PSVT is commonly caused by reentrant circuits. D. Ventricular tachycardia (D-4): Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a life-threatening arrhythmia that originates in the ventricles. It typically presents with a wide QRS complex and a regular rhythm. VT can result in hemodynamic instability and is often associated with heart disease. Incorrect Answers: B. A-2, B-1, C-3, D-4 This option wrongly swaps the characteristics of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Atrial fibrillation (A) is not characterized by a regular rhythm (it is irregular), and atrial flutter (B) is characterized by a regular, sawtooth pattern of waves. The rest of the matches for PSVT and VT are correct, but the first two are swapped. C. A-1, B-2, C-4, D-3 This option incorrectly matches PSVT (C) with the characteristic of ventricular tachycardia (D-3), and vice versa. PSVT typically presents with narrow QRS complexes and is usually regular, whereas ventricular tachycardia (D) presents with wide QRS complexes and is often life-threatening. D. A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1 This option matches ventricular tachycardia (D) with the characteristics of atrial fibrillation (A-4), which is incorrect. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by irregularly irregular rhythms, not the wide QRS complex seen in VT. Similarly, PSVT is not a reentrant circuit but typically causes a regular rhythm, so the second matching is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Astemizole Astemizole is an antihistamine that can cause Torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia, when taken in combination with erythromycin. Both erythromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) and astemizole can prolong the QT interval, and when used together, this effect is synergistic, significantly increasing the risk of Torsades de pointes. Erythromycin inhibits the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which increases the levels of astemizole in the body, further prolonging the QT interval and potentially leading to the arrhythmia. Incorrect Answers: B. Levofloxacin Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that can also prolong the QT interval but does so less significantly than astemizole. While erythromycin can interact with levofloxacin in terms of QT prolongation, the risk of Torsades de pointes is much lower than with astemizole. The combination of erythromycin and levofloxacin does not carry the same high risk of arrhythmia as with astemizole. C. Amoxicillin Amoxicillin is a penicillin antibiotic and does not have significant effects on the QT interval. It does not interact with erythromycin in a way that would predispose a patient to Torsades de pointes. Therefore, this option is not correct as it does not contribute to the risk of arrhythmia. D. Ceftriaxone Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin and, like amoxicillin, does not significantly affect the QT interval. It does not have an interaction with erythromycin that would lead to Torsades de pointes. Thus, ceftriaxone is not a drug that would increase the risk of arrhythmia when given with erythromycin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pericardiocentesis The patient's presentation suggests cardiac tamponade, a condition where there is fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, leading to increased pressure on the heart. The diastolic collapse of the ventricles seen on the echocardiogram is a classic sign of tamponade, which prevents proper filling of the heart and causes hypotension (BP = 80/60 mm Hg) and tachycardia (HR = 120/min) as compensatory mechanisms. The most effective management in this situation is pericardiocentesis, which involves removal of the excess fluid from the pericardial space to relieve the pressure on the heart, improving cardiac output and stabilizing the patient's condition. Incorrect Answers: A. Start Diuretic with BP monitoring While diuretics are commonly used for conditions involving fluid overload (such as heart failure), they are not the first-line treatment for cardiac tamponade. In tamponade, fluid accumulation is in the pericardium, not the body, and diuretics would not address the underlying problem of pressure on the heart. Diuretics would also be counterproductive in a patient who is already hypotensive. B. Intra-aortic balloon pump The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is used in cases of cardiogenic shock to improve coronary perfusion and reduce afterload, but it is not the treatment of choice for cardiac tamponade. While it may improve circulation in some cases, it does not address the fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, which is the cause of the tamponade. D. Ventricular assist device A ventricular assist device (VAD) is used to support severely failing hearts in conditions like end-stage heart failure, but it is not appropriate for cardiac tamponade, which is caused by pericardial effusion and requires fluid drainage. A VAD does not address the cause of tamponade, which is external pressure on the heart.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Defibrillate and continue chest compression In a pulseless patient with a rhythm that is likely to be ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), the immediate action is defibrillation. These arrhythmias cause ineffective cardiac output and require prompt defibrillation to restore normal rhythm. In addition to defibrillation, it is crucial to continue chest compressions as soon as possible, as this improves circulatory support until a successful rhythm is achieved. The key principles of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) emphasize immediate defibrillation followed by continuous chest compressions. Incorrect Answers: B. Defibrillate and check pulse While defibrillation is the correct initial intervention, checking the pulse immediately after defibrillation is not the priority. Chest compressions should continue immediately after each shock to maintain circulation until the rhythm is stabilized and the patient regains a pulse. Waiting to check the pulse delays critical life-saving actions. C. Check pulse and give synchronized DC Checking the pulse first is not the appropriate approach in a pulseless patient. In cases of pulseless ventricular arrhythmias, immediate defibrillation is required rather than synchronized direct current (DC) shock, which is typically used for atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Giving synchronized shocks would not be effective for VF or pulseless VT. D. Give synchronized DC and continue chest compressions While synchronized DC is used in cases of stable supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, it is not appropriate for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. These conditions require unsynchronized defibrillation, as attempting a synchronized shock would not restore the normal rhythm in these life-threatening arrhythmias.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Absent a In a hypertensive patient presenting with an irregularly irregular pulse (which strongly suggests atrial fibrillation) and a loud P2 (indicating pulmonary hypertension), the most likely jugular venous pressure (JVP) finding is absent 'a' waves. The 'a' wave in JVP represents atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. In atrial fibrillation, there is no effective atrial contraction, so the 'a' wave disappears. This absent 'a' wave is a hallmark finding in JVP of patients with atrial fibrillation. The loud P2 also suggests pulmonary hypertension, which commonly coexists with atrial fibrillation due to increased right heart strain. Incorrect Answers: B. Cannon a Cannon 'a' waves are caused by atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, such as in complete heart block, where the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve. This does not occur in atrial fibrillation, as atrial contractions are absent or chaotic. C. Rapid x A rapid x descent may be seen in constrictive pericarditis or cardiac tamponade, but it is not the characteristic JVP finding in atrial fibrillation. It also does not explain the absent coordinated atrial contraction seen in this case. D. Rapid y Rapid y descent is typically seen in constrictive pericarditis and severe tricuspid regurgitation, where there is rapid ventricular filling.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyperkalemia The most likely diagnosis in a patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) showing specific ECG changes is hyperkalemia. In CKD, the kidneys lose the ability to excrete potassium effectively, leading to elevated serum potassium levels. ECG findings typical of hyperkalemia include tall, peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, flattened or absent P waves, and in severe cases, a sine wave pattern. These changes reflect progressive cardiac conduction abnormalities caused by elevated extracellular potassium, which reduces the myocardial resting membrane potential and slows depolarization. Hyperkalemia is a life-threatening emergency, and prompt recognition on ECG is critical for management. Incorrect Answers: B. Hypokalemia Hypokalemia presents with ECG findings such as flattened T waves, U waves, ST depression, and prolonged QT interval, which are opposite of what is seen in hyperkalemia. It is less common in CKD due to the kidney’s impaired ability to excrete potassium. C. Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia causes shortening of the QT interval, primarily by shortening the ST segment. It does not cause the tall, peaked T waves or widened QRS complexes seen in hyperkalemia. It is not typically associated with CKD unless there is secondary hyperparathyroidism with high calcium-phosphate product. D. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia is associated with QT prolongation due to a prolonged ST segment, and may lead to tetany or seizures rather than the cardiac conduction abnormalities seen in hyperkalemia. Its ECG findings differ significantly from those seen in this scenario.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased oxygen consumption in heart The chest pain (angina pectoris) seen in aortic stenosis is primarily due to increased oxygen consumption in the heart, particularly the left ventricle. In aortic stenosis, the left ventricle has to work harder to overcome the outflow obstruction caused by the narrowed aortic valve. This results in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Hypertrophied myocardium demands more oxygen, and the thickened walls may also impair coronary perfusion, especially during diastole, leading to a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand. This ischemia causes angina, even in the absence of coronary artery disease, especially in elderly patients. Incorrect Answers: A. Increased pressure in aorta This is not the cause of angina in aortic stenosis. In fact, pressure in the aorta is often lower than expected due to the obstruction at the aortic valve. Elevated pressures are typically found in the left ventricle, not the aorta. B. Decrease pressure in aorta While it is true that aortic pressure may be reduced distal to the stenosis, this is not the primary cause of chest pain. The key mechanism of angina in aortic stenosis is myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance, not aortic hypotension. D. Increase in volume overload of heart Aortic stenosis causes pressure overload, not volume overload. Volume overload is more characteristic of conditions like aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation. Thus, this option does not correctly explain the chest pain mechanism in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute rheumatic fever The most likely diagnosis is Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF), which typically presents with joint swelling (migratory polyarthritis), a pansystolic murmur (indicating valvular involvement—usually mitral regurgitation), elevated ESR (a marker of inflammation), and a negative rheumatoid factor (RF). ARF is a sequela of untreated or poorly treated group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The Jones criteria (major: carditis, arthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules; minor: fever, arthralgia, elevated acute phase reactants, prolonged PR interval) are used to diagnose ARF. In this case, the carditis (murmur), arthritis, and inflammatory markers (ESR) fit the criteria well. RF negativity helps rule out rheumatoid arthritis, supporting ARF as the correct diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: B. Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis Though seronegative RA can present with joint swelling and negative RF, it usually occurs in older individuals, involves small joints in a symmetric pattern, and is not associated with a pansystolic murmur, which strongly suggests cardiac involvement as seen in ARF. C. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is primarily a pediatric diagnosis and would be unlikely in an adult patient unless specified. Also, it does not commonly present with cardiac murmurs or valvular involvement, which is key in this case. D. Ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with axial skeletal involvement, such as low back pain and stiffness, and is associated with HLA-B27. Joint swelling can occur, but a pansystolic murmur and elevated ESR in this context are not characteristic. Additionally, it often affects the sacroiliac joints rather than peripheral joints.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Add an inhaled corticosteroid The most appropriate treatment is to add an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). This patient has persistent asthma, as indicated by the variability in FEV1 (70–83%) and nighttime symptoms occurring more than once per week. According to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) guidelines, patients with persistent symptoms should not rely on a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) like albuterol alone. ICS are the mainstay of long-term control therapy in asthma because they reduce airway inflammation, prevent exacerbations, and improve lung function. This step-up approach targets the underlying pathophysiology of asthma rather than just symptomatic relief. Incorrect Answers: A. Continue with albuterol This option is inappropriate because albuterol is only a rescue medication and does not address airway inflammation. Continued use alone in a patient with nighttime symptoms and FEV1 variability increases the risk of exacerbations. B. Replace with salmeterol twice daily Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) and should never be used as monotherapy in asthma. It can increase the risk of asthma-related death if not combined with an ICS. LABAs are only added to ICS when symptoms are not adequately controlled. C. Start Tab prednisolone Oral corticosteroids like prednisolone are reserved for acute exacerbations or severe asthma, not for regular maintenance in a patient with mild persistent asthma. Chronic systemic steroid use carries significant side effects and is not first-line therapy.",

The arterial blood gas shows acidemia (pH = 7.20), a low bicarbonate level (HCO?? = 6 mEq/L), and a low pCO? (13 mmHg), indicating primary metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation. To classify the type of metabolic acidosis, the anion gap (AG) should be calculated: Anion Gap = Na? - (Cl? + HCO??) = 136 - (110 + 6) = 136 - 116 = 20 A normal anion gap is typically 8–12 mEq/L. Since the calculated AG is 20, this indicates a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, commonly caused by conditions like diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or ingestion of toxins (e.g., methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates). Incorrect Answers: A. Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis This is incorrect because the calculated anion gap (20) is elevated, not normal. Normal AG acidosis is typically associated with conditions like diarrhea or renal tubular acidosis (RTA), where chloride is increased to compensate, hence also called hyperchloremic acidosis. C. Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis This does not fit the ABG findings. Respiratory acidosis would have a high pCO?, but here the pCO? is low (13 mmHg). Metabolic alkalosis would also show elevated HCO??, but this patient has low HCO?? (6 mEq/L). D. Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic acidosis This is partially tempting due to low pCO?, but the primary process here is metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Respiratory alkalosis as a primary disorder would not cause such a significant decrease in bicarbonate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Primary Adrenal Insufficiency The clinical presentation of hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperpigmentation (e.g., blackening of palmar creases) is classic for primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease. In this condition, there is destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal cortex leading to decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. The hypotension and hyponatremia result from aldosterone deficiency (which impairs sodium retention), while cortisol deficiency contributes to poor vascular tone and increased ACTH secretion. The hyperpigmentation is due to elevated ACTH, which shares a precursor (POMC) with melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), stimulating melanin production. A. Conn syndrome Incorrect. Conn syndrome, or primary hyperaldosteronism, typically presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, not hypotension or hyperpigmentation. Sodium is retained in this condition, leading to elevated blood pressure—not hyponatremia. B. Cushing’s syndrome Incorrect. Cushing’s syndrome results from excess cortisol. It typically presents with weight gain, moon face, truncal obesity, purple striae, and sometimes hypertension, not hypotension or hyperpigmentation. While ACTH-dependent Cushing’s can cause pigmentation, it is not commonly associated with hyponatremia and hypotension. D. Secondary adrenal deficiency Incorrect. Secondary adrenal insufficiency involves pituitary failure leading to low ACTH, hence no hyperpigmentation. Aldosterone levels are typically preserved (as it is primarily regulated by the renin-angiotensin system), so hypotension and hyponatremia are usually less prominent than in primary insufficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lead poisoning Lead poisoning is the most likely diagnosis when a copro-porphyrin test is performed. Lead interferes with heme synthesis, particularly inhibiting enzymes like ferrochelatase and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD). This leads to the accumulation of porphyrin precursors, such as coproporphyrin and δ-ALA, in urine. Measurement of these porphyrins is helpful in diagnosing lead exposure, especially in occupational settings like battery manufacturing, painting, or metal work. In chronic lead poisoning, neuropsychiatric symptoms, abdominal colic, anemia with basophilic stippling, and peripheral neuropathy may also be present. B. Berylliosis Incorrect. Berylliosis is a granulomatous lung disease caused by inhalation of beryllium dust, typically in aerospace or electronics industries. It presents with respiratory symptoms and radiological findings but does not involve porphyrin metabolism, so copro-porphyrin levels are not relevant to its diagnosis. C. Silicosis Incorrect. Silicosis results from prolonged inhalation of silica dust, leading to pulmonary fibrosis. It is common among workers involved in mining, sandblasting, and quarrying. The diagnosis relies on chest imaging and occupational history—not porphyrin studies. D. Asbestosis Incorrect. Asbestosis is a fibrotic lung disease caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers. It is associated with occupations in construction, shipbuilding, and insulation. While it increases the risk of lung cancer and mesothelioma, it has no effect on porphyrin metabolism, making copro-porphyrin testing irrelevant here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Intravenous thiamine infusion followed by dextrose The correct treatment for an alcoholic patient presenting with hypoglycemia and altered mental status is intravenous thiamine followed by dextrose. Chronic alcoholics are commonly thiamine-deficient due to poor nutrition and impaired absorption. Administering dextrose before thiamine can precipitate Wernicke’s encephalopathy, a life-threatening neurologic disorder characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. Thiamine is a critical cofactor for glucose metabolism, and giving glucose first can suddenly increase metabolic demand, exacerbating neurologic damage if thiamine is deficient. Therefore, to prevent this complication, IV thiamine must be given before any glucose infusion. B. Intravenous dextrose followed by thiamine infusion Incorrect. This sequence is dangerous in chronic alcoholics as giving glucose first can trigger or worsen Wernicke’s encephalopathy, due to the sudden demand for thiamine in glucose metabolism pathways. C. Only dextrose infusion Incorrect. While dextrose is needed to treat hypoglycemia, it should never be given alone in alcoholic patients. Doing so can cause irreversible neurologic damage in the setting of thiamine deficiency. D. Oral thiamine followed by dextrose Incorrect. Oral thiamine has delayed absorption and is not appropriate in emergencies or in patients with altered sensorium or unconsciousness. Intravenous administration ensures rapid and effective delivery in acute settings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hydrocortisone The patient presents with classic features of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) — including perioral pigmentation, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia — all of which indicate glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. The pigmentation is due to elevated ACTH levels that cross-react with melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptors. The best treatment in this scenario is hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid activity, making it ideal for both acute and maintenance therapy in adrenal insufficiency. In acute adrenal crisis or symptomatic presentations, IV hydrocortisone is the drug of choice as it rapidly corrects both the cortisol and aldosterone deficits. A. ACTH Incorrect. ACTH is used diagnostically in the cosyntropin stimulation test, not therapeutically. In primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands are unresponsive to ACTH, so giving it would not improve symptoms or correct hormone deficiencies. C. Dexamethasone Incorrect. Although dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid, it lacks mineralocorticoid activity, which is essential in treating Addison's disease. It is primarily used when a glucocorticoid without interference in cortisol assays is needed, such as in suppression testing. D. Sodium chloride infusion Incorrect. While normal saline may provide temporary improvement in volume depletion, it does not address the underlying hormonal deficiency. It can be used as supportive therapy in adrenal crisis but not as definitive treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lung abscess The patient presents with fatigue, fever (102°F), foul-smelling sputum, and digital clubbing. These clinical features, along with the imaging findings from the chest X-ray, are highly suggestive of a lung abscess. Lung abscesses are typically caused by bacterial infections (often anaerobic bacteria) and lead to localized pus formation within the lung parenchyma. The foul-smelling sputum is characteristic of anaerobic infections, which are a common cause of lung abscesses. Additionally, digital clubbing can be seen in chronic pulmonary infections like lung abscesses. A. Community-acquired pneumonia Incorrect. While pneumonia can present with fever, fatigue, and sputum production, foul-smelling sputum and digital clubbing are not typical features of community-acquired pneumonia. Pneumonia usually presents with more acute symptoms like cough, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea, and typically does not cause the chronic, persistent nature or the clubbing seen in lung abscesses. B. Pleural effusion Incorrect. Pleural effusion presents with symptoms like shortness of breath, dullness to percussion, and decreased breath sounds over the affected area. The foul-smelling sputum and digital clubbing are not consistent with pleural effusion, which is primarily related to fluid accumulation in the pleural space rather than a pus-filled infection in the lung parenchyma. C. Pneumothorax Incorrect. A pneumothorax typically presents with sudden sharp chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia, rather than with fever and foul-smelling sputum. Pneumothorax is a condition where air enters the pleural space, causing lung collapse, and is not associated with the chronic infection or clubbing seen in a lung abscess.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tuberculosis The pleural fluid analysis shows an LDH level greater than 0.4 times the serum LDH and protein greater than 0.5 times the serum protein, which is consistent with an exudative pleural effusion. Exudative effusions are typically caused by inflammation or infection. Tuberculosis (TB) is a common cause of exudative pleural effusions, especially in patients with a history of chronic cough, weight loss, or hemoptysis. The biochemical findings in the pleural fluid—elevated LDH and protein—are often seen in tuberculosis and are indicative of a cellular inflammatory response to the infection. B. Heart failure Incorrect. Heart failure usually causes a transudative pleural effusion, not exudative. Transudative effusions are characterized by a low protein and low LDH in the pleural fluid. The high protein and LDH levels seen here are more typical of an exudative effusion, which occurs in conditions such as tuberculosis, malignancy, and pneumonia, rather than heart failure. C. Hepatic failure Incorrect. Hepatic failure can lead to ascites and occasionally to a transudative pleural effusion, typically through hepatic hydrothorax. However, the biochemical profile described—elevated LDH and protein—is more consistent with an exudative effusion, which is not typical of hepatic failure, where pleural effusions are usually transudative. D. Nephrotic syndrome Incorrect. In nephrotic syndrome, the pleural effusions are also typically transudative due to the hypoalbuminemia caused by excessive protein loss in the urine. Pleural fluid in nephrotic syndrome typically has low protein and low LDH levels, unlike the exudative pattern seen in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema The patient's presentation with acute epigastric pain and an increase in serum lipase levels suggests acute pancreatitis. In the setting of acute pancreatitis, especially after stabilization, one of the common complications is non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This occurs due to the systemic inflammatory response associated with pancreatitis, which can increase vascular permeability and lead to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, even without underlying cardiac issues. This condition typically presents with bilateral fluffy infiltrates on a chest X-ray and is associated with a normal or low PCWP (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), distinguishing it from cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema. A. Increased PCWP Incorrect. Increased PCWP is typically seen in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, where the left heart cannot handle the volume of blood returning to it, causing fluid to back up into the lungs. However, in this case, the chest X-ray findings are more consistent with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to acute pancreatitis, which does not involve increased left-sided heart pressure. B. Pulmonary thromboembolism Incorrect. While pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) can cause acute respiratory symptoms, it typically presents with sudden-onset shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and hypoxia rather than the bilateral infiltrates seen on chest X-ray. The X-ray in PE usually shows a unilateral wedge-shaped opacity (infarct), and the patient would likely have a history of risk factors for PE, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), rather than acute pancreatitis. D. Aspiration pneumonitis Incorrect. Aspiration pneumonitis can occur if the patient aspirates gastric contents, leading to inflammation of the lungs and bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray. However, this would typically be associated with a history of vomiting or loss of consciousness (e.g., in the setting of alcohol intoxication or sedation) and would not directly relate to the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. Additionally, the patient in this case has increased lipase, which supports a diagnosis of pancreatitis rather than aspiration pneumonitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Foville syndrome The clinical presentation of left-sided arm and leg weakness, right-side facial paralysis, lateral rectus gaze palsy, and nystagmus is most consistent with Foville syndrome. This syndrome results from a stroke in the lateral part of the pons, affecting the pontine tegmentum. It involves the corticospinal tract, which explains the contralateral weakness (left-sided in this case), and the facial nerve nucleus, leading to contralateral facial paralysis (right-sided in this case). Additionally, the lateral rectus gaze palsy (indicating a 6th cranial nerve palsy) and nystagmus are seen due to the involvement of the pontine gaze centers and vestibular system. B. Benedict's syndrome Incorrect. Benedict's syndrome is caused by a midbrain stroke, usually involving the red nucleus, the oculomotor nerve (CN III), and the corticospinal tract. The hallmark signs of Benedict's syndrome include contralateral hemiparesis (due to the corticospinal tract involvement) and ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (resulting in ptosis, dilated pupil, and impaired eye movement). However, this syndrome does not typically cause facial paralysis or lateral rectus gaze palsy, which are seen in this patient, making it inconsistent with the presented symptoms. C. Millard-Gubler syndrome Incorrect. Millard-Gubler syndrome occurs due to a stroke in the lower pons that affects the 6th and 7th cranial nerves (responsible for facial movements and lateral rectus muscle). It causes contralateral hemiparesis (due to corticospinal tract involvement) and ipsilateral facial paralysis and lateral rectus palsy. While this is similar to some aspects of the patient's presentation (especially the contralateral weakness and facial paralysis), the presence of nystagmus (which is not typical in Millard-Gubler syndrome) and the specific location of the stroke make Foville syndrome a more accurate diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hepatic copper content The best diagnostic modality for Wilson's disease in a patient with neurological manifestations is hepatic copper content. Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder in which there is defective copper transport, leading to copper accumulation in various organs, especially the liver and brain (causing neurological symptoms). The most definitive test for diagnosing Wilson's disease is the measurement of copper content in the liver, typically obtained through a liver biopsy. An elevated hepatic copper content is a strong indicator of Wilson’s disease and helps confirm the diagnosis, especially in patients presenting with neurological symptoms. A. Serum ceruloplasmin Incorrect. Serum ceruloplasmin is often low in Wilson’s disease, but it is not the most reliable test for diagnosis, particularly in patients with neurological symptoms. Ceruloplasmin is a copper-carrying protein, and its levels are typically low in Wilson's disease due to impaired copper incorporation. However, low ceruloplasmin levels can also be seen in other conditions (such as malnutrition or cirrhosis), making it less specific for diagnosis. It is useful as an adjunct, but hepatic copper content is a more definitive test. B. Urinary copper excretion Incorrect. Urinary copper excretion can be elevated in Wilson's disease, but this test is not as definitive as measuring hepatic copper content. The urinary copper excretion test requires careful interpretation, as it can be influenced by hydration status and other factors. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease may not show high urinary copper levels due to impaired renal function. Although useful, it is not as conclusive as assessing copper levels in the liver. D. Serum copper Incorrect. Serum copper levels can be low or normal in Wilson’s disease, especially in the early stages or in patients with neurological symptoms, where the copper is primarily deposited in the brain and liver. The serum copper test alone is not sufficiently sensitive or specific for diagnosing Wilson’s disease. Hepatic copper content is a much more accurate diagnostic modality for confirming the diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Start β-blocker This is correct if the patient is hemodynamically stable but has symptoms of heart failure (e.g., shortness of breath and basal crackles) and uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. In such cases, rate control is the first and most important step. Beta-blockers (like metoprolol) are effective in reducing ventricular rate, improving diastolic filling, and relieving symptoms. It's especially useful in patients with hypertension-related atrial fibrillation and preserved ejection fraction (often seen in hypertensive heart disease). Incorrect options: A. Start on anticoagulants Anticoagulation is essential in atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke, especially if the AF has persisted for more than 48 hours or based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score. However, it is not the first priority in acute symptomatic management. C. Cardioversion to correct rhythm if hemodynamically remain unstable even after medical management This is appropriate only if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, such as having hypotension, chest pain, altered sensorium, or shock. In this case, the patient has shortness of breath but no clear indication of severe instability, so cardioversion is not the immediate step. D. IV Digoxin for control rate Digoxin is a rate control agent but works more slowly than beta-blockers and is less effective during high sympathetic states (e.g., exertion or stress). It’s typically considered in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction or in those who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) First degree heart block The PR interval represents the time it takes for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricles. A PR interval of 0.21 seconds is prolonged, but still within the range of a first-degree heart block, which is characterized by a PR interval greater than 0.20 seconds. In first-degree heart block, there is a delay in the conduction through the AV node, but all electrical impulses still reach the ventricles. It does not typically result in dropped beats or other symptoms. This is a benign condition and is commonly seen in healthy individuals, especially athletes, or may be associated with certain medications. A. Second-degree heart block Incorrect. Second-degree heart block involves intermittent failure of the electrical impulse to be conducted through the AV node to the ventricles. This results in dropped beats, with a normal PR interval before the block occurs. This is different from first-degree heart block, where there is a constant, prolonged PR interval but no dropped beats. Second-degree type I (Wenckebach) typically has progressively lengthening PR intervals before a beat is dropped, while type II has a constant PR interval with some beats blocked. A PR interval of 0.21 seconds does not indicate a second-degree block. C. Normal rhythm Incorrect. A normal PR interval is between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds. Since the PR interval in this patient is 0.21 seconds, it is slightly prolonged and not within the normal range, indicating first-degree heart block, not a normal rhythm. D. Complete heart block Incorrect. Complete heart block (also known as third-degree heart block) is a condition where there is a complete dissociation between the atria and ventricles. The electrical impulses from the atria do not conduct to the ventricles at all. In complete heart block, the PR interval is highly variable or absent altogether because the atrial and ventricular rhythms are completely independent. This patient's PR interval of 0.21 seconds does not suggest complete heart block.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis with high anion gap The patient's ABG values suggest metabolic acidosis due to the low bicarbonate level (HCO3 = 6 mEq/L) and a low pH (7.2). The pCO2 of 22 mmHg indicates compensatory respiratory alkalosis, where the body attempts to compensate for the metabolic acidosis by hyperventilating (decreasing pCO2). This compensation is not complete, as the pH is still low, indicating significant acidosis. Additionally, the anion gap is calculated as: Anion gap = [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]) Anion gap = 136 - (112 + 6) Anion gap = 136 - 118 = 18 mEq/L The normal anion gap is usually around 8-12 mEq/L, and a value of 18 mEq/L indicates a high anion gap, which is characteristic of metabolic acidosis due to conditions like lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or renal failure. A. Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis with normal anion gap Incorrect. This option suggests a respiratory acidosis (high pCO2) and metabolic alkalosis (high HCO3), which is not consistent with the given values. The patient has metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, as evidenced by the low bicarbonate (HCO3 = 6 mEq/L). Additionally, the pCO2 of 22 mmHg indicates respiratory alkalosis, not acidosis. B. Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis with high anion gap Incorrect. This option suggests respiratory acidosis (high pCO2) and metabolic alkalosis (high HCO3). However, the patient's pCO2 is low (22 mmHg), indicating respiratory alkalosis, not acidosis. The low bicarbonate level further confirms metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis. C. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis with normal anion gap Incorrect. This option suggests metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis, which is correct, but it suggests a normal anion gap, which does not match the patient's calculated anion gap of 18 mEq/L. The patient has a high anion gap, which indicates the presence of conditions such as lactic acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, or renal failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) The most likely condition associated with hypercalcemia in a patient with myasthenia gravis, who is on mycophenolate and physostigmine, is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In myasthenia gravis, patients are at increased risk for paraneoplastic syndromes, particularly those related to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or NSCLC. Hypercalcemia is commonly seen as a paraneoplastic phenomenon in cancer, particularly due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by tumor cells. NSCLC is one of the common malignancies that can be associated with this paraneoplastic syndrome. A. Drug induced Incorrect. Although mycophenolate and physostigmine can have side effects, they are not typically associated with hypercalcemia. Mycophenolate can cause immunosuppression, and physostigmine is used to manage myasthenia gravis symptoms, but neither is directly linked to causing hypercalcemia. Drug-induced hypercalcemia is usually related to medications like thiazide diuretics, lithium, or calcium supplements, but these are not implicated here. B. Parathyroid adenoma Incorrect. Parathyroid adenoma can cause primary hyperparathyroidism, which leads to elevated calcium levels. However, the patient's history of myasthenia gravis, as well as the current treatment regimen, suggests a paraneoplastic syndrome (associated with NSCLC) rather than a primary parathyroid issue. Hypercalcemia due to parathyroid adenoma would be accompanied by elevated PTH levels, which is not indicated in this case. C. SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer) Incorrect. While small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a known cause of paraneoplastic syndromes, including hypercalcemia, it is more commonly associated with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) and Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic hormone production. While hypercalcemia can occasionally occur in SCLC, NSCLC is a more frequent cause of hypercalcemia through the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Therefore, NSCLC is a more likely association in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Respiratory failure The most common cause of death in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is respiratory failure. IPF is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by the scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue, which leads to impaired gas exchange and decreased lung compliance. Over time, as fibrosis progresses, the patient experiences worsening shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure. This progressive decline in lung function is the leading cause of mortality in IPF patients. The inability to maintain adequate oxygen levels in the blood, combined with the declining ability of the lungs to expand, results in respiratory failure as the most common cause of death. B. Pulmonary edema Incorrect. Pulmonary edema can occur in various conditions, including heart failure and some lung diseases, but it is not the most common cause of death in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In IPF, the primary issue is fibrosis and progressive scarring of the lung tissue, not fluid accumulation in the lungs as seen in pulmonary edema. While pulmonary edema may develop secondary to other complications (such as heart failure), it is not the direct cause of death in IPF. C. Cancer Incorrect. While patients with IPF are at increased risk for lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, cancer is not the most common cause of death in IPF. The primary cause of death remains respiratory failure, although cancer can be a contributing factor in some cases. However, the overwhelming cause of death in IPF is due to progressive respiratory decline rather than malignancy. D. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Incorrect. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can develop as a complication of IPF due to the remodeling of pulmonary vasculature as a result of the fibrotic process. However, PAH itself is not the leading cause of death. It is considered a secondary complication of IPF, and although it can contribute to worsening symptoms and may contribute to respiratory failure, respiratory failure remains the primary cause of death.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) GH levels after glucose suppression The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of acromegaly, a condition caused by growth hormone (GH) excess, typically due to a pituitary adenoma. The characteristic features of acromegaly include macroglossia, frontal bossing, and large sweaty hands. The best diagnostic test for confirming acromegaly is measuring GH levels after glucose suppression. In a healthy individual, the glucose challenge test typically leads to a suppression of GH levels. However, in a patient with acromegaly, GH levels do not decrease adequately after glucose administration, confirming the diagnosis. This is because the pituitary adenoma producing excess GH is resistant to suppression by glucose. A. GHRH levels Incorrect. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) levels are not the best test to confirm acromegaly. GHRH is a hypothalamic hormone that stimulates the release of GH from the pituitary. In acromegaly, if the cause is a pituitary adenoma, GHRH levels might be elevated or normal. However, the glucose suppression test is more specific and reliable for diagnosing acromegaly, as it directly measures GH suppression, which is the key pathological feature of the disease. B. IGF-1 Incorrect. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is often elevated in patients with acromegaly because GH stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1. IGF-1 levels are typically measured as part of the diagnostic workup for acromegaly, but it is not the most definitive test. While an elevated IGF-1 can suggest acromegaly, the glucose suppression test provides a more direct and specific confirmation by assessing GH secretion dynamics. C. IGF-2 Incorrect. IGF-2 is a growth factor similar to IGF-1, but it does not play the same critical role in the diagnosis of acromegaly. While IGF-2 levels may be elevated in some endocrine disorders, it is not typically used as a primary diagnostic test for acromegaly. The focus is on IGF-1 and GH suppression in acromegaly diagnosis, and IGF-2 is not as relevant or specific for confirming this condition.",
