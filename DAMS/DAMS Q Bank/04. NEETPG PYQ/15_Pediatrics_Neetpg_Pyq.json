      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Newborns are expected to pass urine within the first 24 hours of life. However, a delay in passing urine does not always indicate a pathological condition. Most healthy newborns urinate soon after birth, but a small percentage may take up to 24-48 hours Observation is key in the first 24-48 hours: If the baby is otherwise well (active, feeding, with no signs of dehydration or distress), it is appropriate to continue breastfeeding and observe closely for urine output. Breastfeeding ensures hydration and helps stimulate urine production Other options: A) IV fluids: Not indicated immediately unless the baby shows signs of dehydration or systemic illness B) Formula feed: Breastfeeding is preferred, as formula feeding unnecessarily replaces the benefits of breast milk D) Admit in NICU and start antibiotics: Antibiotics are unnecessary without evidence of infection or systemic illness (e.g., sepsis)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Oligohydramnios refers to decreased amniotic fluid volume commonly associated with fetal urinary tract abnormalities. Amniotic fluid production is largely dependent on fetal urine output after the first trimester Renal agenesis (the absence of one or both kidneys) leads to reduced or absent urine production, causing oligohydramnios. This condition is often associated with the Potter sequence, which includes pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformities, and characteristic facial features Other options: B) Fetal anemia: Fetal anemia is more commonly associated with polyhydramnios due to high-output cardiac failure C) Jaundice: Maternal or fetal jaundice has no direct relationship with amniotic fluid volume D) Anencephaly: Anencephaly is associated with polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid, not oligohydramnios",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A TSH level of 100 IU/mL in a 4-day-old child is indicative of congenital hypothyroidism, which requires confirmation and further evaluation of the underlying cause. A radionuclide thyroid scan using technetium-99m or iodine-123 can determine 1. Presence or absence of thyroid tissue (agenesis or ectopia) 2. Functionality of the thyroid gland This test helps differentiate between thyroid dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopia) and dyshormonogenesis (a defect in thyroid hormone synthesis) Other options: A) Anti-TPO antibodies: These are markers of autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto's), which is rare in neonates and not relevant in congenital hypothyroidism C) Urinary iodide levels: Useful in iodine deficiency or excess but not for confirming congenital hypothyroidism D) Serum TRAB levels: These are checked in neonatal hyperthyroidism secondary to maternal Graves' disease, not hypothyroidism",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In a 4-month-old child born to an HIV-positive mother, recurrent diarrhea is a concerning symptom and could indicate possible HIV infection. HIV dried blood spot PCR (or an early infant diagnosis PCR test) is the most appropriate investigation to confirm or exclude HIV infection in infants under 24 months of age, as maternal antibodies can persist in the child's blood and make antibody tests unreliable Other options: A) Stop breastfeeding and start ART: Breastfeeding should not be abruptly stopped without a confirmed diagnosis and careful consideration, as it remains an important source of nutrition and immunity, especially if the child is uninfected. In HIV-infected mothers, exclusive breastfeeding is often recommended if the mother is on ART C) Antibodies detection: This test is not reliable in children below 24 months because maternal HIV antibodies may still be present, leading to false-positive results D) IgM for giardiasis and antibiotics: Although giardiasis or another enteric infection may be a cause of diarrhea, it does not address the underlying concern about HIV status, which must be clarified first",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of a preterm baby, the primary pathology is a deficiency of surfactant, which is produced by type 2 alveolar cells. Surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing their collapse during expiration. In preterm infants, the lungs are underdeveloped, and type 2 alveolar cells are often immature, leading to inadequate surfactant production and resultant respiratory distress Other options: A) Type 1 alveolar cells: These cells are responsible for gas exchange but do not produce surfactants. The problem in RDS is primarily related to a lack of surfactant rather than impaired gas exchange capacity C) Alveolar capillary endothelial cells: These cells form part of the blood-air barrier and are involved in gas exchange but are not directly related to surfactant production D) Bronchial mucosal epithelial cells: These cells are part of the airway lining and play a role in mucus production and airway defense but are unrelated to surfactant deficiency or alveolar function",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It occurs when a person inherits two mutated copies of the CFTR gene, one from each parent. The mutations in this gene cause thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system, leading to chronic respiratory and gastrointestinal problems Other options: B) Osteogenesis imperfecta: This condition, also known as brittle bone disease, can be autosomal dominant, although some forms may be recessive. Most commonly, it follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern C) Treacher Collins syndrome: This syndrome is caused by mutations in the TCOF1 gene and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The clinical scenario suggests Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, frequent falls, difficulty standing from a squatting position (due to weak hip extensors), and delayed motor milestones in early childhood. The muscle biopsy typically shows muscle fiber degeneration, fatty infiltration, and fibrosis, consistent with DMD Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness starting in early childhood Other options: B) Early intervention has excellent prognosis: While physical therapy and other interventions may help manage symptoms, there is currently no cure for DMD. The prognosis remains poor despite early intervention. Children with DMD typically experience a progressive decline in muscle function and mobility, and most are wheelchair-bound by their teens C) Mitochondrial storage disorder: Mitochondrial disorders can cause muscle weakness, but they are not typically characterized by the pattern of proximal muscle weakness and the early onset seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In addition, mitochondrial disorders would typically show abnormalities in mitochondrial function, not dystrophin deficiency D) It is a post-viral: DMD is not caused by a viral infection. It is a genetic condition, and viral infections would not cause the pattern of muscle weakness seen in this child",

CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to thick, sticky mucus production affecting the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. A common complication in children with CF is meconium ileus, which often presents with distal bowel obstruction. This results from thickened stool in the intestines, particularly in the ileum Other options: A) Hypernatremia: While CF affects sweat glands, leading to a high concentration of sodium and chloride in sweat (a hallmark diagnostic feature), hypernatremia is not the most commonly observed finding in CF C) Protein-losing enteropathy: While protein-losing enteropathy can be a complication of CF, it is less common than distal bowel obstruction D) Rectal prolapse: This can occur in CF due to chronic constipation or gastric distention, but it is not the most common complication after treatment.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Low height for age, also known as stunting, is a key indicator of chronic malnutrition. It reflects a long-term deficiency of essential nutrients that affects growth and development over time Other options: A) Recent infection: Infections can affect weight in the short term, but typically they do not cause a significant long-term reduction in height unless they lead to repeated cycles of malnutrition and poor growth B) Acute malnutrition: This refers to a sudden, severe lack of nutrition that affects weight more than height. In contrast, stunting is linked to a longer duration of malnutrition, not short-term deficiencies D) No malnutrition: If no malnutrition were present, a child would typically have a height for age within the normal range for their growth pattern",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ACTH is generally considered the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of infantile spasms, also known as West syndrome. Hypsarrhythmia is the characteristic EEG pattern associated with infantile spasms. ACTH is thought to work by suppressing the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and potentially by other immunomodulatory mechanisms, thereby reducing seizure activity and improving developmental outcomes. Incorrect Options: Option (B) Valproate Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug effective for various seizure types, including generalized seizures and myoclonic seizures. While it can sometimes be used in the management of infantile spasms, it is not typically the first-line treatment, especially when hypsarrhythmia is present. ACTH is generally preferred due to its higher efficacy in controlling spasms and improving the EEG pattern. Option (C) Vigabatrin Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic drug that irreversibly inhibits GABA transaminase, increasing GABA levels in the brain. It is a highly effective treatment for infantile spasms, particularly those associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. However, due to the risk of irreversible visual field defects, it is often considered a second-line treatment after ACTH or may be used as first-line specifically in the context of tuberous sclerosis. Option (D) Levetiracetam Levetiracetam is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug with a novel mechanism of action, thought to involve binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). While it is used to treat various seizure types in infants and children, its efficacy as a first-line treatment for infantile spasms and the associated hypsarrhythmia is generally lower compared to ACTH and, in some cases, vigabatrin (especially in tuberous sclerosis). It might be considered as an adjunctive therapy or in cases where first-line treatments are not tolerated or effective.",

This reflects normal physical growth, as their bones and body structure expand significantly Other options: Weight gain: Infants are expected to double their birth weight by 4-6 months and triple it by 12 months. A weight gain of 300 g per month is typical but not as specific an indicator of overall growth compared to length Fontanelle closure: The anterior fontanelle generally closes around 18-24 months, not necessarily by 6 months. Its closure is not a reliable sign of adequate growth during the first year Weight and height percentiles: Being below the 75th percentile for weight or the 25th percentile for height does not necessarily indicate inadequate growth unless there is a concern about failure to thrive or growth delay",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pendrin is a chloride/iodide transport protein involved in iodide transport in the thyroid and ion homeostasis in the inner ear and kidney. It plays a role in thyroid hormone synthesis and mutations are linked to Pendred syndrome Other options: A) Sodium iodide symporter: This protein actively transports iodide into thyroid follicular cells for thyroid hormone synthesis C) Potassium chloride cotransporter: This transporter moves potassium and chloride ions across the membrane, regulating cell volume and electrical gradients D) Sodium chloride exchanger: This exchanger moves sodium into cells while extruding chloride, typically for maintaining ionic balance in various tissues",
