      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glucose is transported across the intestinal lumen primarily through secondary active transport, which involves the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT). This mechanism relies on the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane. Sodium ions move into the cell along with glucose, providing the energy for glucose transport Other options: A. Primary active transport involves direct energy expenditure (e.g., ATP hydrolysis) for transport, but glucose transport does not directly use ATP C. Facilitated diffusion occurs via GLUT transporters but is primarily involved in the movement of glucose from the cell into the bloodstream, not across the intestinal lumen D. Pinocytosis is the process of cellular \"drinking\" for fluid and solutes, which is not involved in glucose transport",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The c wave in the JVP represents the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during isovolumetric contraction of the right ventricle. This occurs due to the increase in intraventricular pressure during early systole, causing the tricuspid valve to momentarily bulge backward into the atrium before it is fully closed. Other options: B. Atrial contraction is responsible for the ‘a’ wave in the JVP C. Flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta does not directly affect the JVP waveform D.

High serum sodium levels decrease the need for aldosterone. Other options: B. Increased serum potassium stimulates aldosterone release to promote potassium excretion and maintain electrolyte homeostasis C. ACTH secretion can transiently stimulate aldosterone production, though its effect is weaker compared to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) D. Decreased water volume (often due to hypovolemia) activates the RAAS, leading to increased aldosterone secretion to conserve sodium and water",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The release of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic terminals is primarily triggered by the influx of calcium ions (Ca²?) through voltage-gated calcium channels. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, it causes the channels to open, allowing calcium to enter and trigger the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the membrane, leading to neurotransmitter release. Other options: A. Preventing repolarization of the nerve terminal would disrupt the action potential but does not directly block vesicle release B. Inhibition of conduction of the nerve impulse would prevent the action potential from reaching the terminal, but it is the Ca²? influx that directly controls vesicle release D. Prevention of Na? influx would block the generation of the action potential, but the essential step for vesicle release is the Ca²? influx",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ruffini endings are proprioceptors that play a crucial role in detecting the position and movement of joints. They are slowly adapting receptors, meaning they provide sustained feedback about joint position and the angle of joint movement over time. These receptors are essential for detecting stretch and tension in the skin and joint capsules. Other options: B. Rapidly adapting receptors, such as Pacinian corpuscles, respond to quick changes in stimuli but are not involved in the detection of joint position or movement. C. Non-adapting receptors do not exist in the strictest sense for proprioception; most proprioceptors do adapt to varying extents D. Adapt differently for different stresses is not the primary characteristic of proprioceptors, as they are generally slowly adapting to provide sustained information about body position",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The Bainbridge reflex is a physiological response to an increase in venous return (such as when blood volume increases) that results in an increased heart rate. This reflex is mediated by stretch receptors in the right atrium. When these receptors are activated by increased venous return, they send signals to the brain, which triggers an increase in heart rate via the sympathetic nervous system. Other options: A. Bradycardia is the opposite of the Bainbridge reflex, as this reflex leads to an increase, not a decrease, in heart rate B. Increased cardiac output can result from the Bainbridge reflex due to the increase in heart rate, but the reflex itself directly causes the heart rate to increase, not the cardiac output directly C. Decreased venous return is not a result of the Bainbridge reflex; it actually occurs when there is an increase in venous return, triggering the reflex",

These chemoreceptors respond to hypoxia by inhibiting the efflux of potassium ions (K+) through potassium channels, leading to depolarization of the chemoreceptor cells. This depolarization triggers the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in the release of neurotransmitters that send signals to the respiratory centres in the brain, ultimately increasing ventilation. Other options: A. Calcium: While calcium plays a role in neurotransmitter release, the primary ion involved in the initial depolarization of the chemoreceptor cells is potassium B. Sodium: Sodium ions play a role in generating action potentials but are not the primary ion for the hypoxic response in peripheral chemoreceptors D. Chloride: Chloride ions are not directly involved in the response to hypoxia in peripheral chemoreceptors",

This results in an increase in compliance (the ability of the lungs to expand), although the lungs' efficiency in returning to their resting volume is reduced. Other options: B. Residual volume decreases: Residual volume (the volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximal exhalation) increases with age, due to decreased elastic recoil and weakening of the respiratory muscles C. Mucociliary clearance increases: Mucociliary clearance tends to decrease with age, as the ciliary activity declines, and mucus production can increase, leading to a higher risk of respiratory infections D. Fibrosis of interstitium decreases: With age, there is an increase in fibrosis of the lung interstitium, which contributes to reduced lung compliance and impaired gas exchange.",

When the macula densa detects an increase in the sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration (which suggests an increased filtration rate), it triggers the release of substances that constrict the afferent arteriole, thereby decreasing the GFR. Other options: B. Plasma sodium: While tubuloglomerular feedback is influenced by the concentration of sodium in the filtrate, its primary role is in regulating GFR, not plasma sodium directly C. Plasma volume: Plasma volume regulation involves multiple mechanisms, including hormonal controls (like the renin-angiotensin system), but TGF is not directly involved in plasma volume regulation D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) and FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) are commonly used in spirometry to assess lung function. In obstructive lung diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD), the FEV1 is reduced more than the FVC, leading to a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio (typically < 70%). The patient in this scenario has an FEV1 of 1.3 L, which is low, but the FVC of 3.9 L appears within normal range. This suggests an obstructive pattern, where the ability to exhale forcefully (FEV1) is impaired, but the total lung volume (FVC) is not significantly reduced. In restrictive lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis), both FEV1 and FVC would be reduced, but the FEV1/FVC ratio would typically remain normal or even be elevated because the reduction in FVC is proportionally similar to the reduction in FEV1. Thus, the most likely clinical condition in this case is obstructive lung disease.",

The loss of the myelin sheath slows down or disrupts nerve conduction, resulting in symptoms such as muscle weakness, sensory disturbances, and coordination problems. The myelin sheath normally insulates the nerve fibers and allows for fast transmission of electrical impulses. Other options: Defect in the node of Ranvier: While the nodes of Ranvier are important for saltatory conduction, the primary problem in MS is the loss of myelin, not a defect in the nodes themselves Leaking sodium channels: In some demyelinated areas, sodium channels may become more active in an attempt to compensate for the loss of myelin, but this does not directly cause the primary conduction delay in MS Decreased neurotransmitter release: This is not the primary cause of slowed conduction in MS. The issue in MS is primarily related to the demyelination of axons rather than a problem with neurotransmitter release",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dead space Explanation: The V/Q ratio represents the balance between Ventilation (V, airflow to the alveoli) and Perfusion (Q, blood flow through the alveolar capillaries). When the V/Q ratio is infinity (?), it mathematically means that the denominator, Perfusion (Q), is zero, while Ventilation (V) is still occurring. In this scenario, air reaches the alveoli, but there is no blood flow to pick up oxygen or release carbon dioxide. This describes an area of the lung that is ventilated but not perfused, and therefore cannot participate in gas exchange. Such an area is functionally known as dead space (specifically, alveolar dead space). Incorrect Options: Option (B. PO2 of alveolar air is 159 mm Hg and PCO2 is 40 mm Hg) Explanation: When V/Q = , there is no blood flow, so no gas exchange occurs between the blood and the alveoli. Consequently, the gas composition in the alveoli will equilibrate with that of the inspired air. Inspired air (at sea level) has a PO2 of approximately 159 mm Hg. However, inspired air has a PCO2 of nearly 0 mm Hg, not 40 mm Hg. Therefore, this option is incorrect because of the PCO2 value. Option (C. Partial pressures of O2 and CO2 are equal) Explanation: The partial pressures of O2 (approximately 159 mm Hg) and CO2 (nearly 0 mm Hg) in the alveoli when V/Q = ? are clearly not equal. This option is incorrect. Option (D. No ventilation occurs in the alveoli) Explanation: If no ventilation occurs in the alveoli, it means V (Ventilation) is 0. In such a case, the V/Q ratio would be 0/Q (assuming there is still some perfusion, Q > 0), which equals 0. A V/Q ratio of 0 describes a shunt, where blood flows past unventilated alveoli, not dead space. Therefore, this option describes a different V/Q imbalance.",

Aquaporin-2 is regulated by vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH), which inserts these channels into the apical membrane of collecting duct cells to facilitate water reabsorption In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, there is a dysfunction in the response of renal tubules to ADH, often due to impaired aquaporin-2 function or its regulation, leading to excessive water loss and dilute urine Other options: Liddle syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). It leads to excessive sodium reabsorption, which is unrelated to aquaporin function Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, affecting chloride channels, not aquaporins Bartter syndrome involves defective ion transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, primarily affecting sodium, potassium, and chloride, without a direct link to aquaporins",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prolactin Postpartum (1 week after delivery): • In lactating women, prolactin can be very high — often 100–300 ng/mL or more, especially after suckling. • In non-lactating women, levels start falling but can still be elevated in the 40–100 ng/mL range during the first week. A. REM sleep: Levels rise during sleep, peaking in REM. • Typical range: < 25 ng/mL in non-pregnant women (can rise transiently to ~30–40 ng/mL during REM). • Prolactin secretion is pulsatile and follows a circadian rhythm. Levels are known to rise during sleep, reaching their peak during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. This is a well-documented phenomenon and is the most consistent setting in which high prolactin levels are observed. C. 1 hour after running: • Physical exercise can cause transient changes in many hormones. While exercise might slightly alter prolactin levels, it is not typically associated with a significant or sustained increase in prolactin comparable to the rise during REM sleep. D. Stress response: • Stress (both physical and emotional) can lead to an increase in prolactin secretion. However, the increase during a stress response is usually not as marked or consistent as the peak levels seen during REM sleep.",

It commonly presents with ptosis, diplopia, and generalized muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles. The weakness worsens with exertion and improves with rest, which is a hallmark feature of the disease. The condition is caused by the production of antibodies that block or destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, impairing neuromuscular transmission Other options: B) Lambert-Eaton syndrome: This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction but differs from myasthenia gravis in that the weakness improves with sustained muscle contraction (unlike the worsening seen in myasthenia gravis). It is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels in the presynaptic nerve terminals C) Malignant hyperthermia: This is a life-threatening condition triggered by certain anesthetics, resulting in hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and metabolic acidosis, rather than ptosis and fatigue D) Tibialis muscular dystrophy: This refers to a type of muscular dystrophy, but it typically involves progressive muscle weakness and wasting, starting in the lower legs, and is not characterized by ptosis or worsening fatigue as seen in the question",

The lower ionized calcium levels can lead to muscle spasms and tetany Other options: A) Metabolic acidosis: While metabolic acidosis can cause various symptoms, tetany is not typically one of them. It is more likely to be associated with hyperkalemia and decreased calcium levels, but tetany is not a primary symptom of acidosis C) Hyperoxemia: Hyperoxemia generally does not cause tetany. However, prolonged exposure to high levels of oxygen could lead to other complications, but tetany is not characteristic of hyperoxemia D) Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia usually does not cause tetany. Instead, it may lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness, lethargy, and depressed reflexes. Tetany is more commonly associated with hypocalcemia rather than hypercalcemia",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Large A waves on JVP, a mid-diastolic murmur (heard best at the lower left sternal border), and pedal edema are classic findings in Tricuspid Stenosis. In TS, the right atrium has to work harder to push blood into the right ventricle, causing increased pressure in the right atrium, which results in prominent A waves on JVP. The mid-diastolic murmur is due to diastolic flow restriction across the stenosed tricuspid valve. Pedal edema is indicative of right-sided heart failure or congestion Other options: A) Mitral Stenosis (MS): While MS is characterized by a diastolic murmur and enlarged left atrium leading to pulmonary congestion, it would not typically produce large A waves on the JVP or pedal edema as seen in this patient. MS primarily leads to left-sided heart failure and pulmonary symptoms, not pedal edema or large A waves B) Mitral Regurgitation (MR): MR causes a holosystolic murmur and typically presents with volume overload, causing left-sided heart failure. The findings here, especially the large A waves on JVP, suggest a right-sided issue rather than left-sided D) Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR): While TR can cause pedal edema, it usually presents with a holosystolic murmur and doesn't typically cause large A waves on JVP. The large A waves are more characteristic of tricuspid stenosis due to the increased pressure in the right atrium during diastole.",

This pressure can compress the radial nerve, leading to symptoms like paresis and numbness in the forearm or hand Type A nerve fibres (specifically A? and A?) are myelinated fibres and transmit faster signals, but they are more susceptible to mechanical compression due to their large diameter. These fibres are often the ones affected in Saturday night palsy, leading to symptoms of motor and sensory dysfunction Type C fibres, which are unmyelinated, have a slower conduction velocity, and are typically more resistant to pressure because they have a smaller diameter compared to Type A fibres Type B fibres, though also myelinated, are generally less susceptible to compression than Type A fibres",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The baroreceptor reflex is a negative feedback mechanism. It helps maintain blood pressure homeostasis by adjusting the heart rate, vascular tone, and other factors in response to changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure rises, the baroreceptors (located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) detect the increase and send signals to the brain. In response, the brain triggers mechanisms that lower blood pressure, such as decreasing heart rate and dilating blood vessels. Similarly, if blood pressure falls, the baroreceptors detect the decrease and initiate processes to increase blood pressure, such as increasing heart rate and constricting blood vessels Other options: Positive feedback (B) occurs when the output of a system amplifies the initial stimulus, which is not the case with the baroreceptor reflex Feedforward (C) involves anticipating changes and making adjustments before a stimulus occurs, which is not the primary function of the baroreceptor reflex Adaptive (D) mechanisms involve changes over time, such as long-term adjustments, but the baroreceptor reflex is an immediate, short-term response to blood pressure changes",

The key characteristic of paracrine signaling is that the signaling molecules do not travel far but rather affect cells nearby. This type of signaling is commonly seen in processes like immune responses and tissue repair, where nearby cells need to communicate with each other for coordinated action Other options: Autocrine signaling (A) occurs when the signaling molecules act on the same cell that released them Merocrine (C) refers to a type of secretion (such as in glandular cells) where the cells release their products via exocytosis without loss of cellular material, which is unrelated to the concept of signaling Endocrine (D) signaling involves hormones traveling through the bloodstream to act on distant target cells, which is not the case in paracrine signaling",

It is associated with symptoms like confusion, unconsciousness, and organ dysfunction. In heat stroke, the body’s mechanisms for cooling itself are overwhelmed, and sweating is usually absent due to the failure of the hypothalamus to regulate the temperature effectively. Sweating, which is a natural cooling mechanism, tends to stop when a person is in heat stroke, despite the high temperature Other options: A) Tachypnoea: The body tries to compensate for the elevated temperature by increasing the respiratory rate in an attempt to cool down B) Hypotension: Heat stroke can lead to dehydration and a decrease in circulating blood volume, causing hypotension D) Red hot skin: As the body tries to dissipate heat, the skin often becomes flushed, red, and hot due to vasodilation, which can also be seen in heat stroke",

At a normal potassium concentration of 3.5-5 mEq/L, the equilibrium potential for potassium is -90 mV. This is close to the resting membrane potential of neurons which is about -70mV. In hyperkalemia, the extracellular level of K+ is increased. Thus, the RMP moves closer to the threshold to elicit an action potential, leading to a more excitable nerve.

PET scans of patients with phantom limb pain often show reorganization of the sensory cortex. This reorganization involves the left somatosensory area extending into the right-hand area of the sensory cortex. This is due to the adjacent neural circuits taking over the representation of the missing limb and this neural reorganization leads to the misperception of sensations in the phantom limb Other options: A) projection of adjacent fibers overlaps to right sensory cortex: This is not typically observed in phantom limb pain as the reorganization is mainly from the contralateral side C) expansion of right sensory cortex: The right sensory cortex doesn't expand due to phantom limb pain; instead, it's the sensory cortex of the left hemisphere that may undergo changes D) Expansion of left sensory cortex: This is somewhat close but needs to be specified that the reorganization affects the adjacent regions of the sensory cortex, not just generalized expansion",

Sodium channels open in the end plate - The binding of acetylcholine to its receptors on the muscle membrane causes sodium channels in the end plate (motor end plate) to open.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Innocuous thermal receptors typically respond to non-painful stimuli like normal warmth and coolness. In this case, the lukewarm water at 40°C would normally be perceived as a mild or pleasant sensation However, allodynia refers to a condition where normally non-painful stimuli (such as lukewarm water) are perceived as painful. This can occur due to the sunburn, which sensitizes the skin and nociceptors (pain receptors), making them more responsive to stimuli that would not normally cause pain. Thus, after sunburn, the woman experiences pain from what would normally be an innocuous stimulus",

The heart must generate higher pressure to overcome the stenosis, which requires more energy and increases oxygen demand Other options: B) Aortic stenosis causes reduced pressure at aortic valve: Aortic stenosis increases the pressure at the aortic valve due to the narrowing of the valve opening, making it more difficult for blood to pass through, causing pressure to build up C) Workload has nothing to do with myocardial oxygen consumption: The workload of the heart directly impacts myocardial oxygen consumption. More work means more energy is required, which increases oxygen demand D) Increased preload more than afterload in aortic stenosis: In aortic stenosis, the primary issue is increased afterload due to the narrowing of the valve, not an increase in preload. Preload refers to the volume of blood entering the heart, while afterload is the resistance the heart has to overcome to pump blood",
