      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hcg from placenta During embryological development, the release of testosterone from the fetal testes is primarily stimulated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is secreted by the placenta. This hormone mimics the action of luteinizing hormone (LH), binding to LH receptors on the Leydig cells in the developing testes. The Leydig cells then produce testosterone, which is crucial for the development of the male internal and external genitalia. This testosterone surge is particularly important between the 8th and 12th weeks of gestation, during the critical period of sexual differentiation. Without this stimulation, male differentiation would not proceed correctly, even in an XY fetus. Since the fetal pituitary is not yet fully functional during early development, hCG serves as the key signal for Leydig cell stimulation and testosterone secretion. Incorrect Options: A. LH from mother – Incorrect: Maternal LH does not cross the placental barrier in significant amounts. Moreover, fetal Leydig cells are not dependent on maternal LH for stimulation, especially during early development. Instead, hCG from the placenta takes on this role. C. GnRH from fetal hypothalamus – Incorrect: While GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) from the fetal hypothalamus eventually stimulates the fetal anterior pituitary to secrete LH and FSH later in development, this axis is not sufficiently active during the early stages when testosterone production is first needed for male differentiation. D. Inhibin from corpus luteum – Incorrect: Inhibin is involved in feedback regulation of FSH and is produced by Sertoli cells in males and granulosa cells in females. It does not stimulate testosterone production and has no direct role in activating Leydig cells in the fetal testes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Septate A septate hymen is characterized by a thin band of extra hymenal tissue that runs vertically or horizontally across the vaginal opening, creating two distinct openings instead of one. This condition results from incomplete resorption of the central hymenal tissue during fetal development. The septum can vary in thickness and length. Although often asymptomatic, a septate hymen may cause issues with tampon insertion or intercourse and can be corrected with a minor surgical procedure. When visualized, it clearly shows a membrane dividing the vaginal orifice into two separate openings, which is diagnostic for a septate hymen and distinguishes it from other hymenal anomalies. Incorrect Options: B. Annular – Incorrect: An annular hymen has a single central opening and is the most common type of hymen. It does not have any septum or extra tissue dividing the opening, so it would not appear divided like in the image showing a septate hymen. C. Imperforate hymen – Incorrect: This is a condition where the hymenal membrane completely covers the vaginal opening, with no visible opening at all. It typically presents in adolescence with primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain due to obstructed menstrual flow. The image in question shows openings, which rules this out. D. Cribriform hymen – Incorrect: A cribriform hymen has multiple small perforations or holes throughout the hymenal membrane, giving it a sieve-like appearance. This is different from the two large distinct openings seen in a septate hymen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mala N The most appropriate contraceptive choice for an 18-month postpartum woman who is breastfeeding and experiencing heavy and irregular bleeding is Mala N, a low-dose combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone acetate. At 18 months postpartum, breastfeeding is typically less frequent, and the estrogen in COCs is less likely to affect milk production significantly. Mala N not only provides effective contraception but also helps regulate menstrual cycles and reduce menstrual blood loss, which is particularly beneficial for women experiencing heavy and irregular bleeding. Its use is safe after 6 months postpartum in breastfeeding women and is recommended in such clinical scenarios. Incorrect Options: A. Norethisterone enanthate depot injection – Incorrect: This is a progestin-only injectable contraceptive, which is suitable for breastfeeding women, but it may worsen menstrual irregularities and is often associated with unpredictable bleeding patterns, making it less ideal for a woman already struggling with heavy and irregular bleeding. B. Progestasert – Incorrect: Progestasert is a progesterone-releasing intrauterine device, but it is not commonly used anymore and requires replacement annually. Moreover, it may not sufficiently control heavy bleeding compared to other options and is generally not preferred when menstrual regulation is a key concern. D. Copper T – Incorrect: While Copper T (a non-hormonal intrauterine device) is safe in breastfeeding women, it is associated with increased menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea, which would likely worsen the current symptom of heavy bleeding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Post molar evacuation after trophoblastic disease The Copper T intrauterine device (IUD) is contraindicated post molar evacuation due to the risk of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) or choriocarcinoma. Following a molar pregnancy, close monitoring of serum beta-hCG levels is essential to ensure complete resolution and detect any malignant transformation. Inserting an IUD during this period could mask symptoms of persistent disease (such as abnormal bleeding) and increase the risk of uterine perforation or infection in an already unstable uterine environment. Therefore, Copper T is contraindicated until hCG levels have normalized and remained stable for a period, confirming complete remission. Incorrect Options: A. Ruptured condom during intercourse – Incorrect: This situation calls for emergency contraception, and Copper T can actually be used as an emergency contraceptive if inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. It is highly effective and not contraindicated here. B. Menstruation – Incorrect: Copper T can be safely inserted during menstruation. In fact, insertion during menstruation is often preferred because the cervix is naturally dilated, and it is easier to rule out pregnancy at this time. D. Immediate delivery – Incorrect: Copper T can be inserted immediately postpartum (within 10 minutes of placental delivery), known as postpartum IUD insertion. It is considered safe and effective when proper aseptic techniques are used.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Septate uterus The correct diagnosis is septate uterus, a common congenital uterine anomaly that results from incomplete resorption of the Müllerian ducts’ central septum during embryogenesis. On hysterosalpingography (HSG), a septate uterus typically appears as a single uterine cavity with a central filling defect or indentation, often creating a triangular or “V”-shaped endometrial cavity. This condition is the most common uterine anomaly associated with infertility, early miscarriage, and poor pregnancy outcomes because the fibrous septum lacks adequate blood supply for implantation. The good news is that it is correctable by hysteroscopic septum resection, which can significantly improve fertility outcomes. Incorrect Options: A. Bicornuate uterus – Incorrect: This arises from incomplete fusion of the Müllerian ducts, resulting in a uterus with two horns. On HSG, it appears as a widely spaced, heart-shaped cavity with a broader angle between the endometrial contours (>105°), unlike the narrow angle seen in a septate uterus. It is less commonly associated with infertility than a septate uterus. B. Uterus didelphys – Incorrect: This anomaly results from complete failure of Müllerian duct fusion, leading to two separate uterine cavities and often two cervices. HSG shows two completely separate endometrial cavities with no communication. It's more likely to present with reproductive loss than primary infertility. C. Unicornuate uterus – Incorrect: This results from complete failure of one Müllerian duct to develop, creating a single, small, banana-shaped uterine cavity. HSG shows a long, narrow cavity deviated to one side. While it can be associated with poor reproductive outcomes, it is not the typical appearance of a septate uterus on imaging.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Abstinence for 3 months, avoid pregnancy for 1 year Following surgical repair of a vesicovaginal fistula (VVF), the recommended advice is to maintain sexual abstinence for at least 3 months to allow proper healing of the repaired tissue and prevent breakdown of the surgical site. Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 year, as pregnancy and particularly labor and delivery can place strain on the healing tissues and potentially lead to recurrence of the fistula. This 1-year period allows sufficient time for complete tissue remodeling and strengthens the repair. Patients should also be counseled on appropriate contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy during this healing phase. Incorrect Options: A. Abstinence for 3 weeks, avoid pregnancy for 2 years – Incorrect: Three weeks is too short a duration for vaginal healing post VVF repair, and two years of avoiding pregnancy is unnecessarily long unless there are specific complications. C. Abstinence for 6 weeks, avoid pregnancy for 6 years – Incorrect: While 6 weeks may be sufficient for some postoperative recoveries, it is not adequate for VVF repair, and avoiding pregnancy for 6 years is excessive and not evidence-based. D. Abstinence for 6 months, avoid pregnancy for 1 year – Incorrect: While the 1-year pregnancy avoidance is appropriate, 6 months of abstinence is longer than necessary and can negatively impact quality of life and relationships without added benefit, unless medically indicated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Danazol Danazol is not used as an emergency contraceptive. It is a synthetic androgen derived from 17-alpha-ethinyl testosterone, primarily used in the management of endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, and hereditary angioedema. Its mechanism involves suppression of the pituitary-ovarian axis, reducing gonadotropin secretion and subsequently estrogen production. However, Danazol does not act quickly enough nor effectively inhibit ovulation or implantation in the narrow window required for emergency contraception. Additionally, its androgenic side effects (such as weight gain, acne, and hirsutism) make it unsuitable for this purpose. Incorrect Options: B. CuT 200 – Incorrect: Copper IUDs like CuT 200 are among the most effective emergency contraceptive methods. When inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse, they prevent fertilization by causing a spermicidal inflammatory reaction in the uterine environment. They can also inhibit implantation if fertilization has already occurred. C. RU486 (Mifepristone) – Incorrect: Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist and can be used in low doses (10–25 mg) as an emergency contraceptive. It works by delaying ovulation and making the endometrium unsuitable for implantation if taken in the early luteal phase. D. High dose Estrogen – Incorrect: High-dose estrogen, either alone or in combination with progestin (Yuzpe regimen), has been historically used for emergency contraception. Though less common today due to side effects like nausea and vomiting, it remains a recognized method by altering the endometrium and preventing implantation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates are the first-line treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. They work by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thereby increasing bone mineral density (BMD) and reducing the risk of fractures, particularly vertebral, non-vertebral, and hip fractures. Commonly used bisphosphonates include alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid. They are widely recommended due to their proven efficacy, good safety profile, and affordability. Oral bisphosphonates are generally taken weekly or monthly, while intravenous formulations can be given annually or quarterly, depending on the specific drug and patient needs. Incorrect Options: A. Estrogen – Incorrect: Estrogen therapy can prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women, but it is not first-line due to the associated risks, such as increased incidence of breast cancer, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular events. It is generally reserved for women who also need hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms. C. Raloxifene – Incorrect: Raloxifene is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) that mimics estrogen's effects on bone. While it helps in reducing vertebral fracture risk, it is less effective than bisphosphonates and does not reduce hip fracture risk. It is considered in women who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or are at lower fracture risk but need added breast cancer protection. D. Ulipristal – Incorrect: Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator used primarily for emergency contraception and fibroid management. It has no role in the treatment of osteoporosis, making it entirely unrelated in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hair growth Hair growth during puberty, specifically pubic and axillary hair, is not dependent on estrogen but is primarily regulated by androgens (mainly from the adrenal glands). This process is part of adrenarche, which is a separate event from gonadarche (ovarian estrogen production). Adrenal androgens like DHEA and DHEAS are responsible for stimulating the development of pubic and axillary hair, and this change can occur even in the absence of ovarian function or estrogen production. Therefore, hair growth is not an estrogen-dependent change, making option A the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B. Menstruation – Incorrect: Menstruation is a hallmark of estrogen activity and occurs only after sufficient endometrial proliferation under the influence of estrogen, followed by progesterone and subsequent withdrawal. It is a clearly estrogen-dependent pubertal milestone. C. Vaginal cornification – Incorrect: Estrogen stimulates squamous epithelial proliferation and cornification (keratinization) of the vaginal mucosa. In prepubertal girls with low estrogen, the vaginal epithelium remains thin and atrophic. Thus, this is an estrogen-mediated change. D. Cervical mucus – Incorrect: The quality and quantity of cervical mucus are highly responsive to estrogen levels. Estrogen increases watery, stretchy, and sperm-friendly mucus, especially around ovulation. This change is directly estrogen-dependent.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bilateral Hydrosalpinx The image shows bilateral hydrosalpinx, which is characterized on hysterosalpingography (HSG) by dilated, tortuous fallopian tubes filled with contrast material that demonstrate distension of the tubes with a characteristic \"sausage-shaped\" or elongated appearance. The contrast outlines the dilated tubes but fails to spill freely into the peritoneal cavity due to blockage at the fimbrial end, confirming tubal obstruction with fluid accumulation. Bilateral involvement suggests pathology affecting both fallopian tubes, which is often due to pelvic inflammatory disease, tuberculosis, or previous pelvic surgery and is a known cause of infertility. Incorrect Options: A. Normal HSG – Incorrect: A normal HSG shows smooth, slender fallopian tubes with free spillage of contrast into the peritoneal cavity, indicating patent tubes. The presence of dilated and tortuous tubes with no free spillage clearly rules out normal findings. C. Bilateral Cornual Block – Incorrect: Cornual block appears as failure of contrast to pass beyond the uterine cornu (the proximal part of the fallopian tubes) with no filling of the tubes distal to the blockage. The image shows dilated tubes rather than non-filling or abrupt blockage near the uterine end, which excludes cornual block. D. None – Incorrect: Since the features clearly demonstrate bilateral hydrosalpinx, this option is not applicable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Laparoscopic sterilization The instrument in question is typically a laparoscopic tubal ligation device, such as laparoscopic bipolar forceps or clip applicators. These instruments are used during laparoscopic sterilization to occlude or seal the fallopian tubes, thereby preventing fertilization. Laparoscopic sterilization is a minimally invasive procedure where small incisions and specialized instruments allow the surgeon to visualize and block the tubes using clips, rings, or electrocoagulation. The instruments are specifically designed for precision in manipulating and sealing the delicate tubal structures. Incorrect Options: B. Removal of ectopic pregnancy – Incorrect: Although laparoscopic instruments are used in ectopic pregnancy removal, the instrument shown is most characteristic of tubal sterilization procedures. Ectopic removal typically involves graspers, scissors, and suction devices rather than specialized tubal occlusion instruments. C. Myomectomy – Incorrect: Myomectomy involves removal of uterine fibroids and requires instruments such as laparoscopic morcellators, scissors, and electrosurgical tools, not instruments designed for tubal occlusion.

It has two flexible rings: an inner ring that is inserted into the vagina to hold the condom in place around the cervix, and an outer ring that remains outside the vaginal opening, covering the vulva. The female condom acts as a barrier method of contraception, preventing sperm from entering the uterus and also providing protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Incorrect Options: B. Male condom – Incorrect: A male condom is a thin sheath that fits snugly over the erect penis and is usually made of latex or polyurethane. It does not have two rings and is not inserted into the vagina, making this option inconsistent with the image. C. Cervical cap – Incorrect: A cervical cap is a small, cup-shaped device made of silicone or latex that fits tightly over the cervix. It does not have an external ring and is much smaller than a female condom. D. Diaphragm – Incorrect: A diaphragm is a dome-shaped, flexible latex or silicone device that covers the cervix and is used with spermicide.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hormonal therapy In a woman of reproductive age with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) but no structural abnormalities detected on ultrasound or clinical examination, the most appropriate next step is to initiate hormonal therapy. Hormonal treatment, typically with combined oral contraceptives or progestins, helps regulate the menstrual cycle, reduce bleeding, and stabilize the endometrium. This approach is effective in managing functional causes of AUB, such as anovulatory bleeding or hormonal imbalance, which are common in this age group. Incorrect Options: A. Endometrial sampling – Incorrect: Although endometrial sampling is important in cases of suspected endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, it is usually reserved for women over 40 years old or those with risk factors such as obesity, prolonged bleeding, or failed medical management. In a 35-year-old with normal imaging and no risk factors, immediate sampling is not always necessary. B. Endometrial ablation – Incorrect: Endometrial ablation is a treatment option for heavy menstrual bleeding but is generally considered only after failure of medical management and once structural causes have been ruled out thoroughly. It is also typically reserved for women who have completed childbearing. D. Hysterectomy – Incorrect: Hysterectomy is a definitive treatment but is invasive and reserved for refractory cases after medical and less invasive surgical options have failed or in cases of significant pathology such as fibroids or malignancy.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Imperforate hymen The clinical picture described is classic for imperforate hymen. This congenital anomaly results in a membranous obstruction at the vaginal opening, preventing menstrual blood from exiting the body. Consequently, the patient experiences primary amenorrhea despite having normal ovarian function, and develops cyclical abdominal pain due to accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina (hematocolpos) and sometimes uterus (hematometra), which may present as a midline lower abdominal swelling. The bulging mass seen on per rectal examination corresponds to the distended vagina filled with retained blood pushing forward, causing visible or palpable bulging at the vaginal introitus. Incorrect Options: B. Transverse vaginal septum – Incorrect: A transverse vaginal septum also causes obstruction to menstrual flow but is located higher up in the vaginal canal, not at the hymenal level. It often leads to similar symptoms but on examination, the vagina is shorter and the bulging mass is not seen at the introitus, making imperforate hymen more likely here. C. Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome – Incorrect: MRKH syndrome is characterized by vaginal agenesis or hypoplasia and uterine agenesis or hypoplasia, leading to primary amenorrhea without cyclical abdominal pain, as there is no menstruation or blood accumulation. There would be no bulging vaginal mass or abdominal swelling. D. Vaginal agenesis – Incorrect: Vaginal agenesis involves absence or severe hypoplasia of the vagina. These patients present with primary amenorrhea but typically do not have cyclical pain or hematocolpos, since menstrual blood cannot accumulate without a functioning uterus or outflow tract.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 21-hydroxylase The most likely diagnosis is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common form of CAH. This enzyme deficiency leads to impaired cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, resulting in accumulation of steroid precursors, which are diverted to androgen synthesis. The excess androgens cause virilization of external genitalia in a 46XX individual, such as clitoromegaly, while internally the female reproductive organs remain normal. Additionally, the lack of cortisol leads to increased ACTH stimulation, worsening adrenal hyperplasia and androgen excess. This hormonal imbalance can delay menarche, leading to primary amenorrhea. Incorrect Options: B. 11-hydroxylase – Incorrect: 11β-hydroxylase deficiency can also cause androgen excess and virilization, but it is less common. It is more frequently associated with hypertension due to accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone (a mineralocorticoid), which is not mentioned in this case. The most typical and likely enzyme involved remains 21-hydroxylase. C. 17-hydroxylase – Incorrect: 17-hydroxylase deficiency causes decreased androgen and estrogen production, resulting in under-virilization or female phenotype in 46XY individuals, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics in 46XX. It is associated with hypertension and hypokalemia, and clitoromegaly would not be expected. D. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase – Incorrect: This rare deficiency leads to defects in the synthesis of all three adrenal steroid classes (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens). It typically presents with ambiguous genitalia in both sexes and salt-wasting crises, but clitoromegaly with isolated amenorrhea would be uncommon as a sole finding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sheehan’s Syndrome The clinical features are classic for Sheehan’s Syndrome, a form of hypopituitarism that occurs due to ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland following severe postpartum hemorrhage. In this case, the woman had significant blood loss during childbirth, followed by failure to lactate (due to prolactin deficiency) and amenorrhea (due to gonadotropin deficiency). Other symptoms like lethargy, cold intolerance, recurrent infections, and anemia suggest deficiency of multiple anterior pituitary hormones, including TSH, ACTH, and GH. The absence of pituitary hormones leads to secondary hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypogonadism, explaining the full constellation of signs and symptoms. Incorrect Options: B. Asherman Syndrome – Incorrect: This condition is characterized by intrauterine adhesions, usually following uterine curettage or infection, leading to secondary amenorrhea. However, it does not cause systemic symptoms like cold intolerance, anemia, skin infections, or failure of lactation. C. Prolactinomas – Incorrect: These are pituitary tumors secreting prolactin, typically causing galactorrhea and amenorrhea. However, they do not cause failure of lactation or systemic hormonal deficiencies. Also, pruritus vulvae and cold intolerance are not typical features. D. None – Incorrect: The symptoms clearly point toward an endocrine disorder secondary to postpartum hemorrhage. “None” would be incorrect because Sheehan’s syndrome fully explains all the clinical features.",

It is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The profuse, frothy, greenish-yellow discharge with a foul odor and intense itching are hallmark symptoms. A distinctive clinical sign is the “strawberry cervix”, which results from punctate hemorrhages on the cervix due to the inflammatory response caused by the parasite. Diagnosis is often confirmed via wet mount microscopy, which shows motile trichomonads. Incorrect Options: B. Candidiasis – Incorrect: Vaginal candidiasis typically presents with thick, white, curd-like (“cottage cheese”) discharge and intense itching, but not frothy or foul-smelling discharge. There is no strawberry cervix, and the cervix generally appears normal. C. Bacterial vaginosis – Incorrect: BV is associated with thin, greyish-white, fishy-smelling discharge, especially after intercourse. There is no significant itching, and no inflammation or strawberry cervix. It is caused by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, not an STI. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) The clinical presentation is classic for Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious complication of fertility treatment, particularly when using gonadotropins like HMG. OHSS occurs due to exaggerated ovarian response to stimulation, resulting in enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts, increased vascular permeability, fluid shift into third spaces, and symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, ascites, and dyspnea. Severe OHSS may even lead to pleural effusion, hemoconcentration, and thromboembolic events. Ultrasound typically shows bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, consistent with what is expected in this scenario. Incorrect Options: A. Theca lutein cysts – Incorrect: While these cysts also appear as bilateral ovarian cysts, they are typically associated with high hCG states like molar pregnancy or multiple gestation, not directly with HMG use. They are less likely to cause systemic symptoms like dyspnea and ascites unless very large. C. PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) – Incorrect: PCOD is a chronic condition associated with irregular cycles, anovulation, and hyperandrogenism. The ovaries appear slightly enlarged with a “string of pearls” appearance on ultrasound, but PCOD does not present acutely with symptoms like dyspnea or abdominal pain, nor is it a complication of ovulation induction therapy. D. None – Incorrect: The symptoms and imaging findings clearly align with OHSS. “None” is an inappropriate choice as a specific and well-recognized diagnosis (OHSS) fits this clinical scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) TB pelvis with tubo-ovarian mass The most likely diagnosis is pelvic tuberculosis (TB) with a tubo-ovarian mass, which is common in young women, particularly in regions where TB is endemic. The combination of chronic amenorrhea, low-grade fever, weight loss, pelvic pain, and a mass with ascites is strongly suggestive of genital TB. Tuberculous infection of the genital tract often involves the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and endometrium, leading to the formation of tubo-ovarian masses. Ascites and constitutional symptoms like fever and weight loss are classic signs. Genital TB can also cause infertility and menstrual disturbances including amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. Incorrect Options: B. Ectopic pregnancy – Incorrect: Though ectopic pregnancy can present with amenorrhea and abdominal pain, it is more acute, and typically associated with positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, and hemodynamic instability in case of rupture. Fever, weight loss, or ascites are not features of ectopic pregnancy. C. Granulosa cell tumour – Incorrect: This is a rare ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor that may present with hyperestrogenism, leading to precocious puberty or abnormal uterine bleeding, not typically amenorrhea. While it can form a pelvic mass, constitutional symptoms like fever and weight loss are not typical. D. Fibroid with degeneration – Incorrect: Degenerating fibroids may cause pelvic pain and a mass, but are usually found in older reproductive-age women, not adolescents. They do not typically cause fever, weight loss, ascites, or amenorrhea.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dose/intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of distance of the source This is a fundamental principle in radiation physics known as the inverse square law. It states that the intensity (or dose) of radiation decreases with the square of the distance from the radiation source. In practical terms, if you double the distance from the radiation source, the dose received becomes one-fourth. This principle is crucial in radiation therapy planning, as it helps ensure the tumor receives an adequate dose while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. This law applies universally to point sources of radiation and is a key factor in delivering safe and effective chemoradiation treatment for cancers such as cervical cancer. Incorrect Options: A. Small bowel is most radioresistant The small bowel is actually one of the more radiosensitive organs in the abdomen and pelvis. It has rapidly dividing cells in the mucosal lining, which makes it vulnerable to radiation-induced damage such as enteritis. Radiosensitivity is higher in tissues with rapid cell turnover, so the small bowel’s tolerance to radiation is relatively low compared to more radioresistant tissues. B. Small blood vessels are most radioresistant Small blood vessels, especially capillaries, can be damaged by radiation because the endothelial cells lining these vessels are moderately radiosensitive. Radiation can cause inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular damage leading to ischemia in tissues. Large blood vessels tend to be more resistant, but small vessels are not the most radioresistant structures. C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant In fact, rapidly proliferating cells are generally more radiosensitive, not radioresistant. Radiation primarily damages DNA, and cells that are actively dividing (such as cancer cells or cells in the bone marrow and mucosa) are more susceptible to radiation damage because they have less time to repair DNA damage before mitosis. Slowly dividing or non-dividing cells tend to be more radioresistant.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Broad ligament Remnants of the Wolffian duct (also called mesonephric duct) in females are typically found in the broad ligament. During embryonic development, the Wolffian ducts mostly regress in females but some remnants persist and can be found as small vestigial structures in the broad ligament, such as Gartner’s ducts or cysts. These remnants can sometimes give rise to Gartner’s duct cysts in adults. The broad ligament is the peritoneal fold that supports the uterus and connects it to the lateral pelvic walls, providing a typical anatomical location for these Wolffian duct remnants. Incorrect Options: A. POD (Pouch of Douglas) The pouch of Douglas, or rectouterine pouch, is a peritoneal space between the posterior wall of the uterus and the rectum. It is not a location for Wolffian duct remnants. The pouch of Douglas is a common site for fluid collection or endometriosis, but not for mesonephric duct remnants. B. Lower part of vagina The lower part of the vagina develops from the urogenital sinus, not from the Wolffian duct. Wolffian duct remnants are not found here. Instead, the vagina forms from the fusion of the Müllerian ducts (upper part) and the urogenital sinus (lower part). D. Uterovesical pouch The uterovesical pouch is the peritoneal space between the uterus and the bladder. Like the pouch of Douglas, this space is not known to contain remnants of the Wolffian duct. It serves as a potential space for fluid accumulation but does not contain embryological remnants of the mesonephric duct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Adult ovary Meiosis in females primarily occurs in the adult ovary, beginning during fetal life but arresting at prophase I until puberty. After puberty, during each menstrual cycle, some oocytes resume meiosis and proceed to metaphase II, where they arrest again until fertilization. Thus, active meiosis occurs in the adult ovary during the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation. This meiotic division is crucial for producing haploid gametes (ova) with half the chromosome number for sexual reproduction. Incorrect Option: A. Prepubertal testes In males, meiosis does not occur in the prepubertal testes. Although testes contain spermatogonia, meiosis only begins at puberty when spermatogenesis starts. Before puberty, spermatogonia remain dormant and do not enter meiosis. Therefore, meiosis is absent in prepubertal testes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Normal Saline (NS) In hysteroscopy procedures using bipolar cautery, normal saline (NS) is the preferred distention medium. This is because bipolar electrosurgical devices require an electrically conductive fluid to allow safe and effective energy delivery. Normal saline is isotonic, non-electrolyte-disturbing, and conductive, making it suitable for bipolar energy use. Using NS reduces the risk of electrolyte imbalance or fluid overload complications that can occur with other media. Incorrect Options: A. CO2 Carbon dioxide gas can be used as a distention medium in diagnostic hysteroscopy, but it is generally not used when electrosurgery is planned because gas does not conduct electricity. This makes CO2 unsuitable for procedures involving cautery. C. Dextran 70 Dextran 70 is a viscous, non-electrolyte fluid sometimes used as a distention medium but is less commonly preferred due to risks of allergic reactions and fluid overload. Additionally, its viscosity makes it less ideal for use with bipolar cautery. D. Glycine Glycine is a non-conductive, hypotonic fluid used with monopolar electrosurgery to avoid electrical conduction through the fluid. However, it is not recommended with bipolar cautery because bipolar devices work safely with conductive fluids like saline. Glycine use also carries the risk of hyponatremia and fluid absorption complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Endometriosis In cases of partial transverse vaginal septum, menstrual blood can accumulate behind the obstruction, leading to retrograde menstruation. This backward flow of menstrual blood into the pelvic cavity is a key factor in the development of endometriosis, where endometrial tissue implants outside the uterus causing pelvic pain, adhesions, and infertility. Therefore, endometriosis is the most common complication expected in a patient with a partial transverse vaginal septum presenting with pelvic pain. Incorrect Options: A. Tuboovarian abscess A tuboovarian abscess usually results from pelvic inflammatory disease and is characterized by infection and pus formation in the fallopian tubes and ovaries. While it can cause pelvic pain, it is not directly related to the obstructive pathology seen in vaginal septum. C. Dermoid cyst Dermoid cysts (mature cystic teratomas) are benign ovarian tumors arising from germ cells. They are unrelated to vaginal septal anomalies and do not typically cause pelvic pain due to obstruction or menstrual outflow issues. D. Theca lutein cyst Theca lutein cysts are functional ovarian cysts caused by high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), often seen in molar pregnancy or multiple gestations. They are not associated with vaginal septa or menstrual obstruction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Laparoscopic myomectomy In a patient with primary infertility and bilateral cornual block caused by intramural fibroids (one measuring 5×7 cm and the other 3×5 cm), the best management is laparoscopic myomectomy. Intramural fibroids, especially of this size, can distort the uterine cavity or the fallopian tube ostia, causing tubal blockage and infertility. Surgical removal of fibroids (myomectomy) can restore normal uterine anatomy and tubal patency, improving chances of natural conception. Laparoscopic myomectomy is preferred over open surgery due to faster recovery and fewer adhesions, which is beneficial for fertility. Incorrect Options: A. ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) ART, such as IVF, may bypass tubal factors but is generally considered after surgical correction of structural abnormalities like fibroids. Using ART without correcting mechanical causes of infertility like fibroids may reduce success rates and increase complications. C. GnRH analogue GnRH analogues can reduce fibroid size temporarily but do not cure the fibroids or restore tubal patency. They are typically used preoperatively to shrink fibroids before surgery, but not as a sole treatment in infertility cases with tubal blockage. D. UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization) UAE is a nonsurgical treatment to shrink fibroids by cutting off their blood supply. However, it is generally contraindicated in women desiring fertility because it may impair uterine and ovarian function and negatively affect fertility outcomes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Multiple dose methotrexate with folinic acid A 26-year-old patient with a history of molar pregnancy evacuation presenting with cannon ball metastases (suggesting lung metastasis) and irregular vaginal bleeding indicates high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). The preferred initial management in such cases is multi-dose methotrexate with folinic acid rescue or alternatively multi-agent chemotherapy depending on the risk scoring. Multiple-dose methotrexate with folinic acid is effective in high-risk patients to control disease progression and minimize toxicity. Folinic acid (leucovorin) rescue reduces methotrexate toxicity while maintaining its efficacy. Incorrect Options: A. EMACO EMACO (Etoposide, Methotrexate, Actinomycin D, Cyclophosphamide, and Vincristine) is a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen typically reserved for very high-risk or resistant GTN cases. While effective, it is more toxic and usually not the first-line therapy unless multi-dose methotrexate fails or the patient has ultra-high-risk features. B. Single dose methotrexate Single dose methotrexate is used for low-risk GTN patients without metastases or minimal disease. In the presence of metastases such as cannon ball lesions, single dose therapy is insufficient and ineffective. C. Hysterectomy Hysterectomy is generally not the first line of treatment in metastatic GTN since chemotherapy is highly effective. Surgery may be reserved for cases with uncontrollable bleeding or localized resistant disease but is not the primary treatment in metastatic cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hysteroscopic septoplasty The management of a uterine septum, which is a congenital malformation characterized by a fibrous or muscular partition dividing the uterine cavity, is best performed by hysteroscopic septoplasty. This minimally invasive procedure involves resecting the septum via the hysteroscope, allowing restoration of a normal uterine cavity without external incisions. Hysteroscopic septoplasty is preferred because it has a high success rate in improving fertility and pregnancy outcomes, shorter recovery time, and fewer complications compared to open surgeries. Incorrect Options: B. Uterine metroplasty Uterine metroplasty generally refers to an open surgical procedure to correct uterine anomalies. While effective, it is more invasive and associated with longer recovery times and higher risk of complications compared to hysteroscopic surgery, making it less favorable for uterine septum correction today. C. Laparoscopic resection Laparoscopy may be used to assist in diagnosing uterine anomalies or to evaluate the external contour of the uterus but is not the primary approach to resect a uterine septum since the septum is inside the uterine cavity and best accessed hysteroscopically. D. Laparotomy metroplasty This is an open abdominal surgery and is largely outdated for uterine septum correction. It is associated with increased morbidity and is reserved for very rare complex cases where hysteroscopic surgery is not feasible.",

While uterine didelphys is associated with reproductive complications such as abortion and preterm labor, it is not typically associated with transverse lie. The presence of two separate uteri allows enough space for the fetus to position normally in most cases, so transverse lie is uncommon. Incorrect Options: A. Abortion Recurrent miscarriage or abortion is a common complication in uterine didelphys due to the smaller uterine cavity size and potential poor implantation environment in one or both horns. B. Preterm Preterm labor and delivery are frequently observed in uterine didelphys cases because of limited uterine capacity and cervical insufficiency, leading to early onset of labor. D. Endometriosis Endometriosis can be associated with uterine anomalies including uterine didelphys due to retrograde menstruation or altered pelvic anatomy, making this option a possible associated condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Continue same packet, use barrier and consider emergency pill if intercourse in last 72 hrs When a patient misses multiple oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) — in this case, 4 pills on different days twice within 2 weeks — the best advice is to continue the same pack without stopping, use a barrier method (like condoms) for the next 7 days as additional protection, and consider emergency contraception if unprotected intercourse has occurred within the last 72 hours. This approach maintains contraceptive coverage without unnecessary interruption, reduces risk of pregnancy, and addresses the risk from recent unprotected intercourse. Prompt use of emergency contraception (like levonorgestrel) can help prevent pregnancy if needed. Incorrect Options: A. Discontinue and take different method of contraception Stopping OCPs abruptly and switching methods is not necessary after missed pills. The priority is to maintain hormonal contraception by continuing the current pack and adding backup protection rather than abandoning the method. B. Take all 4 pills together, continue drugs and take barrier method for 7 days Taking multiple missed pills all at once is not recommended, as it can increase side effects such as nausea and does not improve contraceptive efficacy. It is better to take the most recent missed pill as soon as possible and continue daily pills regularly. C. Continue same packet Simply continuing the same packet without additional precautions is insufficient after missing multiple pills on different days, as the risk of ovulation and pregnancy increases. Backup barrier contraception and emergency contraception consideration are important.",

It involves injecting a radio-opaque contrast dye through the cervix and taking images to see if the dye passes freely through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity. HSG is the first-line investigation in infertility workup to assess tubal blockage and uterine abnormalities, making it the most appropriate and commonly performed investigation in such cases. Incorrect Options: B. Laparoscopy Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure involving insertion of a camera into the abdomen to directly visualize pelvic organs. While it can assess tubal status and pelvic pathology, it is invasive and usually reserved for cases where HSG findings are abnormal or when endometriosis or adhesions are suspected. C. Hysteroscopy Hysteroscopy involves direct visualization of the uterine cavity using a scope inserted through the cervix. It is useful to evaluate and treat intrauterine pathology but does not assess tubal patency. Hence, it is not the initial investigation for tubal evaluation. D. Normal saline hysterogram A saline infusion sonohysterogram (normal saline hysterogram) involves injecting sterile saline into the uterine cavity during transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate uterine contour and cavity. It helps detect intrauterine lesions but does not assess fallopian tubes, making it less suitable than HSG for tubal patency assessment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Laparoscopy + hysteroscopy The best way to identify Müllerian anomalies is by combining laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. This combined approach allows direct visualization of both the external uterine contour (via laparoscopy) and the uterine cavity (via hysteroscopy). Since Müllerian anomalies involve abnormalities in uterine shape, cavity, and external morphology, using both methods provides comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Laparoscopy identifies external contour differences (e.g., bicornuate vs septate uterus), while hysteroscopy examines the endometrial cavity for septa or duplications. Incorrect Options: A. HSG (Hysterosalpingography) HSG provides a 2D outline of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes but cannot reliably differentiate between external uterine contour anomalies like bicornuate and septate uterus. Thus, it is limited in accurately classifying Müllerian anomalies. B. USG (Ultrasonography) Ultrasound, especially 2D USG, can screen for uterine anomalies but lacks detail in defining the uterine shape and external contour. Even 3D ultrasound, though improving accuracy, might not replace direct visualization for definitive diagnosis. D. Laparoscopy Laparoscopy alone visualizes the external surface of the uterus but cannot evaluate the endometrial cavity, which is crucial to diagnose cavity abnormalities like septa. Hence, it is incomplete alone for full assessment of Müllerian anomalies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) The patient with a history of urination on coughing along with a cystocele is most likely experiencing Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI). SUI occurs due to weakness or damage to the pelvic floor muscles and urethral sphincter, which causes urine leakage during increased intra-abdominal pressure activities like coughing, sneezing, or lifting. The presence of a cystocele (prolapse of the bladder into the vaginal wall) further weakens bladder support, exacerbating SUI. Incorrect Options: B. Overflow incontinence Overflow incontinence is characterized by constant dribbling due to an overfilled bladder and incomplete emptying, often caused by bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder. It is not typically triggered by coughing or physical exertion. C. Urge incontinence Urge incontinence involves a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by involuntary leakage, often due to detrusor overactivity. Leakage related to coughing is not a feature of urge incontinence. D. Neurogenic bladder Neurogenic bladder refers to bladder dysfunction caused by neurological disorders affecting bladder control. Symptoms can vary widely, but leakage on coughing is more characteristic of SUI than neurogenic bladder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Totally stops ovulation Low dose progesterone, such as in some contraceptive methods, does not totally stop ovulation. While progesterone can suppress ovulation to some extent, it is not completely reliable in doing so at low doses. In fact, ovulation sometimes still occurs despite low dose progesterone. This is why other mechanisms like cervical mucus changes and endometrial alterations are important for contraception with low dose progesterone. Incorrect Options: B. Causes changes in luteal phase Low dose progesterone can cause subtle alterations in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, such as shortening or making it less optimal for implantation. This effect contributes to its contraceptive action. C. Causes change in cervical mucus One of the primary contraceptive effects of low dose progesterone is thickening of cervical mucus, which inhibits sperm penetration and fertilization, making this a true and important mechanism. D. Sometimes ovulation occurs It is correct that with low dose progesterone, ovulation sometimes still happens because suppression is not absolute, which contrasts with higher dose combined contraceptives that more reliably prevent ovulation.",

Imaging or diagnostic tests reveal a solitary, asymmetric uterine structure with one fallopian tube, consistent with this diagnosis. Incorrect Options: B.

C. Pubocervical and round ligament The pubocervical ligament supports the anterior vaginal wall and cervix but is more involved in preventing cystocele than maintaining uterine position.

These may exist as separate gonads (one ovary and one testis) or as ovotestes (a single gonad containing both tissues). Most individuals have a 46,XX karyotype, though mosaicism (e.g., 46,XX/46,XY) can also be seen. Clinically, patients may present with ambiguous genitalia, gynecomastia, and infertility. This condition reflects disorders of sexual development (DSDs) and is distinct from syndromes involving only gonadal dysgenesis or chromosomal aneuploidy. Incorrect Options: A. 45 XO with streak gonads This describes Turner syndrome, a condition characterized by gonadal dysgenesis, where the ovaries are replaced by non-functional streak tissue. These individuals do not have both testicular and ovarian tissue, and typically present with primary amenorrhea and short stature. C. 45 XXY with testes This refers to Klinefelter syndrome, where individuals have male external genitalia and testes but typically suffer from hypogonadism, infertility, and gynecomastia. They do not have ovarian tissue, making this inconsistent with Testiovo syndrome. D. 45 XX with streak ovary This is not a typical karyotype and likely reflects a variant or error. Streak ovaries are associated with Turner syndrome (usually 45,XO), not with the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue. Thus, this option does not fit the description of Testiovo syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Female Pseudohermaphroditism Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies involved in cortisol biosynthesis, most commonly 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This enzyme block leads to cortisol deficiency and excess androgen production. In a 46,XX (genetic female) fetus, the internal reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes) develop normally, but due to androgen excess, the external genitalia become virilized or ambiguous. This condition is called female pseudohermaphroditism, where the individual is genetically and gonadally female but has masculinized external genitalia. It is one of the most well-known examples of this condition and may present with clitoromegaly, fused labia, and sometimes a urogenital sinus. Incorrect Options: A. Male hermaphroditism This term is outdated and not well-defined. It may be mistakenly used to describe individuals with ambiguous genitalia, but in CAH, the affected individuals are typically genetic females (46,XX), not males. B. Female hermaphroditism This historically referred to individuals with both ovarian and testicular tissue (now called ovotesticular DSD or true hermaphroditism). CAH does not involve the presence of testicular tissue, so this term is incorrect in the context of CAH. C. Male pseudohermaphroditism This refers to individuals with a 46,XY (genetic male) karyotype who have underdeveloped or ambiguous external genitalia due to androgen insufficiency (e.g., androgen insensitivity syndrome or 5-alpha reductase deficiency). Since CAH typically affects 46,XX individuals who are virilized, this term does not apply.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pyometra uterus Pyometra, or pus collection within the uterine cavity, is not commonly associated with chronic Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). Pyometra is more typically seen in elderly, postmenopausal women, often due to cervical stenosis or malignancy that blocks the outflow tract. While acute PID may cause endometritis, chronic PID more commonly leads to tubal and peritoneal damage rather than intrauterine pus accumulation. Therefore, pyometra is not a typical finding in chronic PID, making this the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B. Ectopic pregnancy Chronic PID often results in tubal damage and adhesions, impairing the transport of the fertilized ovum. This increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy, particularly in the fallopian tube, due to distorted anatomy and impaired ciliary function. C. Infertility Infertility is a well-known long-term consequence of chronic PID. The condition causes tubal occlusion, adhesions, and peritoneal damage, all of which interfere with gamete transport and implantation. D. Tubal defect Chronic inflammation in PID leads to tubal scarring, blockage, and hydrosalpinx, which are collectively referred to as tubal defects. These are key pathological features of chronic PID and major contributors to infertility and ectopic pregnancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infertility Infertility is the most common sequela of chronic Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). Chronic PID causes persistent inflammation and scarring of the fallopian tubes, leading to tubal obstruction, hydrosalpinx, and peritubal adhesions. These structural damages impair the movement of the ovum and sperm, making natural conception difficult or impossible. Even subclinical PID can lead to significant tubal pathology over time. Therefore, infertility is the most frequent and clinically significant long-term outcome of chronic PID. Incorrect Options: A. Ectopic pregnancy While ectopic pregnancy is a known complication of chronic PID due to damaged and dysfunctional fallopian tubes, it is less common than infertility. Tubal dysfunction increases the risk of embryo implantation outside the uterus, particularly in the fallopian tube, but this occurs less frequently than infertility. C. Pyometra uterus Pyometra (accumulation of pus in the uterus) is not commonly associated with PID, especially chronic PID. It is more typically seen in postmenopausal women with cervical stenosis or uterine malignancy. It is rare in reproductive-age women with PID. D. Endometrial cancer There is no direct link between chronic PID and endometrial cancer. While PID affects the upper genital tract, endometrial cancer is primarily associated with unopposed estrogen exposure, obesity, and age, not chronic inflammation due to PID.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Two or more ova in same cycle from separate act of coitus Superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two or more ova released during the same menstrual cycle, but from separate acts of coitus, possibly involving different sperm donors. This can occur because sperm can survive up to 5 days in the female reproductive tract, and ovulation may release more than one ovum. If intercourse occurs on different days around ovulation, each ovum can be fertilized by sperm from different acts of intercourse, leading to non-identical (dizygotic) twins. When different partners are involved, it is called heteropaternal superfecundation. Incorrect Options: B. Two or more ova different cycle This describes superfetation, not superfecundation. Superfetation is an extremely rare phenomenon where a second ovulation and fertilization occur during an already ongoing pregnancy, typically from a different menstrual cycle. C. Two or more ova same act of coitus This situation still leads to dizygotic twins, but if both ova are fertilized from the same act of intercourse, it is not superfecundation. Superfecundation specifically involves separate acts of intercourse. D. Single ova splitting into two This describes monozygotic (identical) twinning, where one fertilized ovum splits into two embryos. It is not related to superfecundation, which involves multiple ova and typically leads to dizygotic (non-identical) twins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hot flushes Hot flushes (also called hot flashes) are the most common and most bothersome symptom of menopause, and therefore the most common reason for initiating Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). They are caused by fluctuating and ultimately declining estrogen levels, which affect the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. HRT, particularly estrogen therapy, is highly effective in alleviating vasomotor symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats. It provides rapid symptom relief and significantly improves the quality of life in symptomatic postmenopausal women. Incorrect Options: B. Vaginal atrophy While HRT is effective in treating urogenital atrophy (vaginal dryness, irritation, dyspareunia), this is not the most common reason for starting systemic HRT. In fact, local vaginal estrogen preparations are often preferred over systemic therapy for isolated urogenital symptoms. C. Headaches Headaches are not an indication for HRT. In fact, HRT may worsen migraines in some women due to hormonal fluctuations. Headaches are managed based on their etiology, and HRT is not typically considered a treatment option. D. Abnormal vaginal bleeding This is not an indication for HRT and must be investigated thoroughly, especially in postmenopausal women, as it could be a sign of endometrial pathology (e.g., hyperplasia or cancer). HRT may actually cause or exacerbate bleeding if not properly balanced with progestin in women with an intact uterus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chromosome 19 The Müllerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS), also known as Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), is a glycoprotein responsible for the regression of the Müllerian ducts during male embryonic development. The gene encoding MIS, known as AMH gene, is located on chromosome 19p13.3. This gene is expressed by Sertoli cells of the fetal testes and plays a crucial role in male sex differentiation by preventing the development of female internal reproductive structures such as the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper part of the vagina. Incorrect Options: B. Chromosome 21 Chromosome 21 is best known for its association with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). It does not house the AMH gene and has no direct role in sexual differentiation or Müllerian duct regression. C. X Chromosome Although several genes related to reproduction and ovarian development are located on the X chromosome, the AMH gene is not one of them. Disorders involving the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome, affect ovarian development differently and are unrelated to MIS production. D. Y Chromosome The Sex-determining Region Y (SRY) gene, which initiates male differentiation by triggering testis development, is located on the Y chromosome. However, the AMH gene itself is not located on the Y chromosome, though its expression is influenced by testis development induced by Y-linked genes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Recurrence Recurrence is not an advantage of hysteroscopic myomectomy over open myomectomy. In fact, the recurrence rate may be higher with hysteroscopic procedures, especially if the fibroids are not completely removed or if there are multiple fibroids. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is primarily used for submucosal fibroids, and if the fibroid extends deep into the myometrium, complete resection may not be feasible, leading to a greater chance of recurrence compared to open (abdominal) myomectomy, where fibroids are more thoroughly excised. Incorrect Options: A. Less pain Hysteroscopic myomectomy is a minimally invasive procedure performed through the vaginal route without abdominal incisions. As a result, it causes significantly less postoperative pain compared to open surgery. B. Early ambulation Since it is a non-invasive approach, recovery is faster, allowing earlier mobilization and discharge from the hospital. This is a clear advantage over open myomectomy, which involves a longer recovery period. D. Less bleed Hysteroscopic procedures are associated with less intraoperative blood loss compared to open surgeries.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Endometrial sampling In a 45-year-old woman presenting with menorrhagia and a uterine fibroid, it is essential to rule out endometrial pathology, especially endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, as abnormal bleeding in this age group can be a sign of underlying premalignant or malignant conditions. Even though a 2 cm fibroid may contribute to bleeding, endometrial sampling is the first step to evaluate the cause of menorrhagia before starting treatment. This ensures appropriate management based on histopathology. Incorrect Options: A. OCP for 3 months Oral contraceptive pills may be used for menstrual regulation and bleeding control in younger women or those without suspicious endometrial pathology. However, in a perimenopausal woman with new menorrhagia, starting OCPs without ruling out endometrial abnormalities is not recommended. B. Progesterone for 3 months Progesterone therapy can help in cases of anovulatory bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. But, similar to OCPs, starting treatment without confirming the endometrial status is inappropriate in this context. D. Hysterectomy Hysterectomy is a definitive treatment for fibroids causing menorrhagia, but it is too aggressive as an initial step without proper evaluation.

Low AMH indicates diminished ovarian follicle pool and predicts a poor response to ovarian stimulation in fertility treatments.

This range is typically seen in women with good fertility potential and not in those with low ovarian reserve. C. 7-10 AMH levels in this range are considered above normal and may be seen in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where ovarian follicle count is increased. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Adenomyosis Adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium (the muscular wall of the uterus). This leads to a diffusely enlarged, boggy uterus, often described as a “globular uterus.” Clinically, it commonly presents in women aged 30-50 with dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, exactly as described in this case. On gross hysterectomy specimen, adenomyosis shows a thickened uterine wall with small cystic spaces or hemorrhagic foci within the myometrium due to ectopic endometrial tissue. Incorrect Options: B. Fibroid uterus Fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus that present as well-circumscribed, firm, round masses within the myometrium. They usually cause menorrhagia and pelvic pressure, but less commonly cause dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain. On gross examination, fibroids appear as distinct nodules, unlike the diffuse changes seen in adenomyosis. C. Endometriosis Endometriosis refers to ectopic endometrial tissue located outside the uterus, commonly on the ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, or other pelvic structures. It does cause dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain but would not be diagnosed from the uterine cut section as it affects extrauterine sites. D. Ectopic pregnancy Ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity, most often in the fallopian tube. It does not cause chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhea for months and would not be identified on a hysterectomy specimen as a uterine pathology.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair In a 60-year-old woman with third-degree uterine prolapse, the best management is vaginal hysterectomy combined with pelvic floor repair. Third-degree prolapse indicates the uterus has descended beyond the vaginal introitus, often causing symptoms like discomfort, urinary issues, and infections. Vaginal hysterectomy removes the prolapsed uterus, and pelvic floor repair (anterior and posterior colporrhaphy) restores the support structures to prevent recurrence. This combined approach addresses both the cause and the structural weakness, providing definitive treatment with good functional and anatomical outcomes. Incorrect Options: B. Pelvic floor repair Pelvic floor repair alone, without removing the prolapsed uterus, may not be adequate in third-degree prolapse, especially in postmenopausal women. The bulky prolapsed uterus often needs removal to relieve symptoms fully and reduce recurrence risk. C. Sacrospinous fixation Sacrospinous fixation is a suspension procedure used to support the vaginal apex after hysterectomy or in cases of vault prolapse. It is generally performed after hysterectomy, not as the sole initial treatment for third-degree uterine prolapse with the uterus still present. D. Pessary Pessaries are useful for temporary relief or for patients who are unfit for surgery or do not desire surgery. However, in a symptomatic 60-year-old woman with advanced (third-degree) prolapse, pessaries are usually a non-definitive, conservative measure rather than the primary treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Luteal phase Day 20 of the menstrual cycle falls within the luteal phase, which typically spans from day 15 to day 28 in a standard 28-day cycle. This phase begins after ovulation (usually around day 14) and is characterized by the presence of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone to prepare the endometrium for possible implantation of a fertilized egg. Progesterone dominance in this phase supports endometrial thickening and maintenance. Incorrect Options: A. Menstrual phase The menstrual phase occurs during the first few days of the cycle, typically from day 1 to day 5, when the endometrium sheds, resulting in menstrual bleeding. Day 20 is well beyond this phase. B. Follicular phase The follicular phase corresponds to the first half of the menstrual cycle, generally from day 1 to day 14, ending with ovulation. This phase involves maturation of ovarian follicles under the influence of FSH. Day 20 is after ovulation, so it does not belong to the follicular phase. C. Ovulatory phase The ovulatory phase is brief, occurring around day 14 in a 28-day cycle, when the dominant follicle releases the egg. Day 20 is post-ovulation and thus not in the ovulatory phase",

This effectively relieves symptoms such as itching, burning, and dryness without significant systemic absorption or side effects. Incorrect Options: B. Antihistaminics Antihistaminics are primarily used for allergic reactions and itching caused by histamine release, but vaginal atrophy-related itching is due to estrogen deficiency, not an allergic response. Thus, antihistamines are not effective here. C. Tamoxifen Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) mainly used in breast cancer treatment.

The infection increases vaginal pH above the normal acidic range (which is usually 3.8 to 4.5), often making it more alkaline, which favors the growth of Trichomonas. Incorrect Options: A. Herpes simplex Herpes simplex virus causes painful vesicular lesions and ulcers on the genital mucosa, not frothy vaginal discharge. Vaginal pH remains normal in herpes infections. B. Candida albicans Candida causes thick, white, curdy (\"cottage cheese-like\") vaginal discharge but does not produce frothy discharge.

Using OCPs in a patient with a history of DVT significantly raises the risk of recurrence or development of potentially life-threatening thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism. Therefore, OCPs must be avoided in such cases. Incorrect Options: A. Chronic renal disease Chronic renal disease is generally a relative contraindication. While OCPs need to be used cautiously due to potential effects on blood pressure and fluid retention, it is not an absolute contraindication. Many women with stable renal disease can safely use OCPs under medical supervision. C. Diabetes mellitus Diabetes is usually a relative contraindication, particularly if there are vascular complications or poor glycemic control. In uncomplicated diabetes without vascular disease, OCPs can be used carefully. Thus, it is not an absolute contraindication. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Progesterone After the 14th day of the menstrual cycle, which corresponds to the post-ovulation or luteal phase, the hormone predominantly secreted is progesterone. Following ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes large amounts of progesterone. Progesterone prepares the endometrium for possible implantation of a fertilized egg by making it thick, glandular, and receptive. It also maintains the endometrial lining and inhibits further ovulation during the luteal phase. Incorrect Options: B. Estrogen Estrogen is the predominant hormone during the follicular phase (before ovulation), where it stimulates the proliferation of the endometrium and helps in follicle maturation. After ovulation, estrogen levels dip but remain moderate alongside progesterone. Estrogen is not the main hormone secreted after day 14. C. LH (Luteinizing Hormone) LH peaks around day 14 to trigger ovulation (the LH surge), but its levels decline sharply after ovulation. LH is not predominantly secreted during the luteal phase; instead, its role is to induce ovulation. D. FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) FSH stimulates follicle development in the early part of the cycle (follicular phase). Like LH, FSH levels decline after ovulation and are low during the luteal phase, so it is not the main hormone secreted after day 14.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Asherman Syndrome Hysteroscopy is the preferred procedure for diagnosing and treating Asherman syndrome, which involves intrauterine adhesions or scarring. Hysteroscopy allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity, making it possible to identify adhesions precisely and perform adhesiolysis (removal of adhesions) under direct vision. This minimally invasive approach is the gold standard for managing Asherman syndrome and restoring uterine cavity integrity to improve fertility and menstrual function. Incorrect Options: A. Tubal Ligation Tubal ligation is a sterilization procedure involving blocking or cutting the fallopian tubes. It is usually done via laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy, not hysteroscopy, because the tubes are accessed from the abdominal side, not the uterine cavity. C. Endocervical Polyp Endocervical polyps arise from the cervical canal. They are typically removed by direct visualization with a speculum and forceps or by hysteroscopy only if they extend into the uterine cavity. However, conventional polypectomy of endocervical polyps does not routinely require hysteroscopy. D. Subserosal Fibroid Subserosal fibroids are located on the outer surface of the uterus and are best managed by laparoscopic or open myomectomy. Hysteroscopy is generally not useful here because it visualizes the uterine cavity, which does not include the subserosal surface.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Chemoradiation In a 50-year-old woman presenting with a necrotizing cervical growth involving the lateral parametrium, the clinical picture is consistent with locally advanced cervical cancer (likely Stage IIB or higher). The involvement of the lateral parametrium means the tumor has spread beyond the cervix but not to distant sites. Chemoradiation (concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy) is the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer. The combination improves local control and overall survival compared to radiation alone. Chemotherapy, often with cisplatin, acts as a radiosensitizer, enhancing the effectiveness of radiation therapy. Incorrect Options: A. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy alone is generally reserved for metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer, not for initial management of locally advanced disease. It is less effective without radiation in controlling localized tumors. B. Brachytherapy Brachytherapy (internal radiation) is a component of radiation treatment for cervical cancer but is usually combined with external beam radiation and chemotherapy. It is not a standalone treatment in cases with parametrium involvement. D. Surgery Surgery (such as radical hysterectomy) is typically reserved for early-stage cervical cancer (Stage IA to IIA). Involvement of the lateral parametrium indicates advanced disease, where surgery is generally not feasible or safe due to the extent of local spread.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Not knowing the extent of thermal burns One of the disadvantages of laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to open surgery is the risk of thermal injury from energy devices (like electrocautery or ultrasonic scalpels) used during the procedure. These thermal burns can be difficult to detect immediately because the injury might be deep or delayed in presentation. Unlike open surgery, where direct visualization and palpation are possible, laparoscopy limits tactile feedback and sometimes visualization of surrounding tissues, increasing the risk that the surgeon may not fully appreciate the extent of any thermal damage. Incorrect Options: A. Prolonged recovery time This is incorrect because laparoscopic surgery typically offers a shorter recovery time and earlier return to daily activities compared to open surgery due to smaller incisions and less tissue trauma. C. Increased bleeding This is incorrect as laparoscopic hysterectomy generally results in less blood loss than open surgery. The magnified view during laparoscopy allows for precise dissection and better control of bleeding vessels. D. Increased pain This is incorrect because patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery usually experience less postoperative pain compared to open surgery, again due to smaller incisions and less tissue handling.",

It occurs due to the infection and blockage of the Bartholin gland duct, leading to fluid accumulation and abscess formation. The patient’s symptoms of pain, swelling, redness, and difficulty walking and sitting strongly point toward this diagnosis. The history of multiple sexual partners is relevant because sexually transmitted infections can cause or complicate the blockage and infection of the gland. Incorrect Options: A. Chlamydial infection Chlamydial infection usually presents with cervicitis, urethritis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It rarely causes localized swelling or abscess formation in the perineal area like a Bartholin abscess. C. Genital tuberculosis Genital tuberculosis typically involves the internal genital tract causing infertility, menstrual irregularities, or pelvic pain. It does not present as an acute painful swelling or abscess in the labial region. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reassure and review the couple after 6 months Reassure and review the couple after 6 months. According to standard guidelines, infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of regular, unprotected intercourse in women under 35 years of age. Since the patient is only 23 years old and has been trying to conceive for 6 months, she does not yet meet the criteria for a formal infertility evaluation. Most healthy couples will conceive within the first year of trying, and anxiety or early medical intervention may not be necessary at this stage. Therefore, the appropriate next step is to reassure the couple, provide general advice on optimizing fertility (such as timing intercourse during ovulation), and follow up after 12 months of trying if conception does not occur. Incorrect Options: A. Semen analysis for husband – This is a fundamental part of an infertility workup, but it is premature at this stage since the couple has not been trying for a full year. It would only be appropriate if there were known risk factors in the male partner (e.g., history of undescended testes, varicocele, or prior infertility), which are not mentioned in the scenario. C. Hysterolaparoscopy – This is an invasive diagnostic procedure typically reserved for evaluating structural or tubal causes of infertility after initial non-invasive assessments fail to identify a cause. It is not indicated in a young woman who has been trying for less than a year. D. Diagnostic hysteroscopy – Like hysterolaparoscopy, this is used to evaluate intrauterine abnormalities (e.g., fibroids, adhesions) and is not part of the initial approach in someone with less than 12 months of trying and no suggestive symptoms or history of uterine pathology.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Neisseria gonorrhoeae The most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID often presents with lower abdominal pain, intermenstrual bleeding, minimal vaginal discharge, and sometimes dyspareunia (pain during intercourse). The patient’s history of multiple sexual partners significantly increases her risk for contracting gonorrhea or chlamydia, both of which are major causes of PID. Gonococcal PID tends to be more acute and may involve subtle or minimal vaginal discharge, making diagnosis challenging unless STI testing is performed. The chronicity of her symptoms (lasting a month) and signs of endometrial involvement (intermenstrual bleeding) are consistent with ongoing inflammation and infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Incorrect Options: A. Herpes simplex – Typically presents with painful genital ulcers, burning, and dysuria. It is an unlikely cause of chronic lower abdominal pain and intermenstrual bleeding. Herpes is more associated with external genital lesions than with ascending infections like PID. B. Genital tuberculosis – Can cause chronic pelvic pain and infertility, but it usually presents more insidiously, often in women with risk factors like previous TB exposure, immunosuppression, or living in endemic areas. It’s less commonly associated with active discharge or recent sexual exposure. C. Candida – Causes vaginal itching, thick white discharge (\"cottage cheese-like\"), and local irritation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) The most likely diagnosis is Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), a known complication of fertility treatments, especially when using human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for ovulation induction. OHSS occurs due to excessive ovarian response leading to enlarged ovaries with multiple cystic follicles, increased vascular permeability, and fluid shift into the third space. This results in acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and breathlessness due to ascites or pleural effusion. The ultrasound typically shows bilaterally enlarged multicystic ovaries, which is consistent with the clinical scenario and imaging findings described. The patient’s symptoms developing shortly after starting hMG therapy are classic for moderate to severe OHSS. Incorrect Options: B. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) – While PCOS is associated with enlarged ovaries containing multiple small peripheral follicles (\"string of pearls\" appearance), it is a chronic condition and does not present with acute symptoms like sudden abdominal pain or respiratory distress. PCOS is also not triggered by gonadotropin therapy. C. Theca lutein cysts – These cysts are bilateral, multilocular ovarian cysts that occur in the setting of very high hCG levels, such as in molar pregnancy or multiple gestations. They are not typically associated with acute pain and systemic symptoms like OHSS, and the history of hMG stimulation more strongly supports OHSS. D. Granulosa cell tumor – This is a rare estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor that typically presents with menstrual irregularities, postmenopausal bleeding, or precocious puberty in young girls. It does not typically present with sudden abdominal pain or breathlessness, and its ultrasound appearance is usually that of a solid or complex mass, not multicystic ovaries.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pulmonary edema The immediate complication in this scenario is pulmonary edema, which can occur due to fluid overload during hysteroscopic procedures where distension media (such as glycine, saline, or sorbitol) are used. A fluid deficit of more than 1000 mL, especially when using hypotonic, non-electrolyte solutions, raises concern for systemic absorption of the distension fluid, leading to volume overload and possible electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hyponatremia). A deficit of 2000 mL is considered significant and is associated with a high risk of acute pulmonary edema, presenting with dyspnea, hypoxia, and crackles on lung auscultation. Therefore, it is critical to monitor fluid balance intraoperatively and take action immediately if large fluid shifts are detected. Incorrect Options: A. Acute tubercular necrosis – This is likely a typographical error and should read acute tubular necrosis, which can result from renal ischemia or toxicity but is not a typical immediate complication of fluid overload during hysteroscopy. It is more related to hypotension or nephrotoxic drugs, not to rapid fluid absorption. B. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) – DIC is a coagulation disorder seen in cases like severe obstetric hemorrhage, sepsis, or amniotic fluid embolism. It is not associated with fluid overload during hysteroscopic procedures. D. Thromboembolism – While thromboembolism is a recognized postoperative risk, it is not an immediate intraoperative complication and is unrelated to fluid deficit.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Advise HPV vaccine The correct advice for the 14-year-old daughter of a woman diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer is to advise HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccination. HPV infection, particularly with high-risk types such as HPV 16 and 18, is the primary cause of cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine is highly effective in preventing HPV infection, thereby significantly reducing the future risk of developing cervical cancer. The ideal age for HPV vaccination is 9 to 14 years, before the onset of sexual activity, which maximizes immunogenicity and preventive benefits. Since the daughter is 14, she is within the recommended age range and should be vaccinated promptly. This is a prophylactic, evidence-based intervention that can help protect her from the disease her mother is suffering from. Incorrect Options: B. Screen for BRCA mutation – BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are linked to breast and ovarian cancers, not cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is caused by HPV infection, not inherited genetic mutations like BRCA, so this test is irrelevant in this context. C. Screen for PTEN mutation – PTEN mutations are associated with Cowden syndrome, which increases the risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, but not cervical cancer. This is not applicable for the prevention or risk assessment of cervical cancer. D. Perform cervical biopsy – A cervical biopsy is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate suspected cervical lesions found on screening tests like Pap smear or colposcopy.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS), a condition in which an individual with a 46,XY karyotype is genetically male but phenotypically female due to non-functional androgen receptors. In CAIS, the testes produce androgens normally, but the body cannot respond to them, leading to absence of male external genitalia and failure of male internal genital development. Since anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by the testes, the Müllerian structures (uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina) regress, leading to their absence on imaging. The presence of bilateral inguinal masses likely represents undescended testes. The absence of pubic and axillary hair is due to androgen insensitivity, while breast development is typically present due to peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. However, in some cases, especially early in adolescence, breast development may be minimal. This constellation of primary amenorrhea, absent uterus/ovaries, inguinal gonads, and lack of body hair strongly supports CAIS. Incorrect Options: B. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism – This refers to conditions where the ovaries fail to respond to gonadotropins, leading to high FSH/LH and low estrogen levels. It is usually associated with absent or underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics and streak ovaries, but the uterus and other Müllerian structures are present, unlike in this case. C. Turner syndrome – Typically presents with short stature, webbed neck, shield chest, and primary amenorrhea due to gonadal dysgenesis (streak ovaries). However, pubic and axillary hair are present, and the uterus is normally present, making this diagnosis unlikely. D. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – PCOS can present with oligomenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea, not primary amenorrhea in a 17-year-old. Additionally, these patients typically have normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and a present uterus and ovaries, which are absent in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Imperforate hymen The most likely diagnosis is Imperforate hymen, a congenital anomaly where the hymen fails to perforate during fetal development, resulting in a membranous obstruction at the vaginal opening. This condition typically presents in adolescent girls with primary amenorrhea and cyclical lower abdominal or pelvic pain, which is due to accumulation of menstrual blood (hematocolpos) behind the obstructed hymen. As menstrual blood cannot exit the body, it leads to progressive distension of the vagina and sometimes uterus, causing a suprapubic bulge and pressure symptoms. On rectal examination, a bulging mass may be felt anteriorly due to the distended vagina. This classic triad—cyclical pain, primary amenorrhea, and a bulging mass—is strongly indicative of imperforate hymen and is easily treatable with a simple surgical incision of the hymen (hymenotomy). Incorrect Options: A. Transverse vaginal septum above the vagina – While it also causes obstructive symptoms and primary amenorrhea, the septum is typically located higher in the vagina and the clinical presentation is less straightforward. On examination, no bulging at the introitus would be seen, and diagnosis often requires imaging and more invasive evaluation. B. Vaginal atresia – This refers to complete absence or closure of the vaginal canal, which may also cause cyclical pain and amenorrhea. However, the bulging mass on per rectal exam and suprapubic swelling is more classically associated with imperforate hymen, as in vaginal atresia, the vagina is often entirely absent, and hematometra may occur without hematocolpos. D. Cervical agenesis – This rare condition leads to primary amenorrhea and cyclical pain, but no outflow tract exists between the uterus and vagina. It usually presents with hematometra rather than hematocolpos, and no bulging mass at the hymenal level is typically observed. This condition often requires complex reconstructive surgery or hysterectomy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Liquid smear, cervical biopsy, HPV testing In a 46-year-old woman presenting with cervical erosion, the most appropriate investigations are liquid-based cytology (Pap smear), cervical biopsy, and HPV testing. Cervical erosion (also known as cervical ectopy or ectropion) is often a benign condition, but in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, any abnormal cervical appearance warrants thorough evaluation to rule out cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or malignancy. Liquid-based cytology is a modern alternative to the conventional Pap smear and improves the quality and reliability of cytological evaluation. HPV testing, especially for high-risk HPV types (e.g., 16 and 18), is crucial since persistent infection with these types is strongly associated with cervical cancer. Cervical biopsy is warranted if there is any suspicion of dysplasia or malignancy on visual inspection or abnormal cytology findings. Together, these investigations form the gold standard triad for evaluating cervical abnormalities in women of this age group. Incorrect Options: A. Pap smear, HCV DNA, electrophoresis – While a Pap smear is relevant, HCV DNA and electrophoresis are not related to cervical pathology. HCV DNA is used to evaluate hepatitis C virus infection, and electrophoresis is used in the context of blood disorders (like thalassemia or multiple myeloma), neither of which is pertinent to cervical erosion. C. Cervical biopsy, HBV DNA – Although cervical biopsy is appropriate, HBV DNA testing is used to monitor hepatitis B viral load, which is unrelated to cervical disease. This option misses both cytology and HPV testing, which are essential components of cervical cancer screening. D. Pap smear, HIV DNA – Pap smear is useful, but HIV DNA testing is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of cervical erosion unless the patient is suspected to be immunocompromised. Even then, HIV serology (antibody testing) is preferred. Also, this option omits HPV testing and cervical biopsy, which are more directly relevant to the patient's condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 46XX In a teenage girl presenting with primary amenorrhea and clinical findings consistent with imperforate hymen, the most appropriate and expected karyotype is 46XX, which denotes a genetically normal female. Imperforate hymen is a congenital obstructive anomaly of the female genital tract caused by failure of the hymenal membrane to perforate during fetal development. It is a structural anomaly, not a chromosomal or genetic disorder. These patients have normal ovaries, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and a normal female karyotype (46XX). Menstrual blood accumulates behind the imperforate hymen (hematocolpos), leading to cyclical pelvic pain and amenorrhea. Since the condition arises from a local anatomical defect rather than a chromosomal abnormality, no further karyotyping is typically needed, but if done, 46XX is expected. Incorrect Options: A. 46XY – This karyotype indicates a genetic male. Conditions such as Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) present with a 46XY karyotype and may also cause primary amenorrhea, but these individuals lack a uterus and ovaries, and have inguinal gonads, which is not the case in imperforate hymen. C. 45XO – This karyotype is diagnostic of Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature, streak ovaries, webbed neck, and primary amenorrhea. However, these patients have normal vaginal outflow tracts and do not present with obstructive anomalies like imperforate hymen. D. 47XXY – This karyotype corresponds to Klinefelter syndrome, which occurs in genetic males and presents with features like gynecomastia, small testes, and infertility, not with imperforate hymen or primary amenorrhea in females.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 2º oocyte arrested in meiosis II At ovulation, a secondary (2º) oocyte arrested in metaphase of meiosis II is released from the Graafian follicle into the fallopian tube. This occurs under the influence of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which triggers the resumption of meiosis I in the primary oocyte, resulting in the formation of a secondary oocyte and a first polar body. The secondary oocyte then begins meiosis II, but it is arrested in metaphase II until fertilization occurs. Only upon sperm penetration does the secondary oocyte complete meiosis II, forming the ovum and a second polar body. This precise timing ensures that the oocyte is developmentally prepared to be fertilized. Incorrect Options: A. 2º oocyte arrested in meiosis I – This is incorrect because the oocyte completes meiosis I just before ovulation. The 2º oocyte is not arrested in meiosis I; rather, it is formed as a result of meiosis I. C. 1º oocyte arrested in meiosis I – This refers to the state of oocytes from fetal life until puberty. At ovulation, the oocyte has already completed meiosis I, so this is not the form released during ovulation. D. 1º oocyte arrested in meiosis II – This is a combination that does not occur.

They remain in this arrested state until puberty. At puberty and during each menstrual cycle: Under the influence of hormones, a few primary oocytes resume meiosis I. Meiosis I is completed just before ovulation. This division is unequal, producing a large secondary oocyte and a small first polar body. At ovulation: The secondary oocyte is released from the ovary. This secondary oocyte then immediately begins meiosis II but arrests at metaphase II.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Endometriosis The most likely cause of a new, painful 2 cm black nodular mass near an episiotomy scar that increases in size and pain during menstruation is endometriosis, specifically scar endometriosis. This form of endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue implants in a surgical scar, such as an episiotomy site during vaginal delivery. The hallmark features include cyclical pain, growth of the lesion during menstruation, and sometimes dark pigmentation due to old hemorrhage within the ectopic endometrial tissue. The ectopic tissue responds to hormonal changes in the same way as uterine endometrium, resulting in repeated bleeding, inflammation, and scarring, which cause the pain and nodular swelling. Scar endometriosis should be considered in any woman with a painful mass near a surgical or episiotomy scar that fluctuates with the menstrual cycle. Incorrect Options: B. Melanoma – While melanoma can appear as a pigmented and nodular lesion, it is typically painless and not associated with menstrual changes. The cyclical increase in size and pain is not characteristic of melanoma, making this less likely. C. Foreign body granuloma – A granuloma may develop after surgery or trauma and may present as a mass, but it usually appears soon after the inciting event, is non-cyclic, and often lacks pigmentation. It also typically does not correlate with the menstrual cycle. D. Inclusion cyst – These are generally painless, slow-growing cysts that form from trapped epithelial tissue during wound healing. They do not increase in size or pain with menstruation, nor are they typically pigmented or nodular like the lesion described.",

Its muscular wall facilitates secure and effective occlusion, which is essential to prevent the passage of ova and sperm, ensuring permanent contraception. Additionally, due to its proximity to the uterus, ligation here minimizes the chance of tubal recanalization and maintains a clear anatomical location for surgical access during procedures like minilaparotomy or laparoscopic sterilization. Incorrect Options: A. Ampulla because it's widest – While the ampulla is indeed the widest part of the fallopian tube, it is not the preferred site for tubectomy. Its tortuous and thin-walled structure makes it less suitable for secure ligation and increases the risk of complications or failure. B. Ampulla as it is site of fertilization – Although the ampulla is the common site of fertilization, this is not the reason for selecting it for tubectomy. Preventing fertilization can still be achieved by blocking the isthmus, which is proximal to the ampulla, thereby stopping sperm and ova from ever meeting. D. Isthmus because it’s narrowest – While the isthmus is indeed narrow, the primary reason it is selected is not merely its width but rather its uniform muscular structure, which allows for a secure and effective ligation. Narrowness alone does not guarantee optimal surgical outcomes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CA-125, AFP, hCG, LDH In a 20-year-old girl with a solid-cystic ovarian tumor, the most appropriate tumor markers to evaluate include CA-125, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This combination of markers is used because germ cell tumors are the most common ovarian malignancies in this age group, and they secrete various markers depending on the tumor subtype: AFP is elevated in yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors). hCG is elevated in choriocarcinomas and embryonal carcinomas. LDH is a marker for dysgerminomas, the most common malignant germ cell tumor. CA-125, although more commonly associated with epithelial ovarian cancers in older women, can still be useful for broad screening or monitoring. Incorrect Options: A. CA-125, AFP, hCG, CEA – CEA is a tumor marker primarily associated with gastrointestinal malignancies (especially colorectal cancer), not typically elevated in germ cell tumors, making it less relevant in this clinical context. B. CA-125, AFP, hCG, CA19-9 – CA19-9 is a marker usually associated with pancreatic and gastrointestinal tumors, not ovarian germ cell tumors. It does not add significant value in evaluating a solid-cystic ovarian mass in a young woman. D. CA-125, AFP, hCG, CA15-3 – CA15-3 is primarily used in breast cancer monitoring, and it has no role in the evaluation of ovarian tumors in young women.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Didelphys A didelphys uterus is a type of Müllerian duct anomaly where there is complete failure of fusion of the two Müllerian ducts, resulting in two separate uterine cavities, often with two cervices, and occasionally with a longitudinal vaginal septum. In imaging, especially on 3D ultrasound or MRI, this appears as two symmetric, widely spaced endometrial cavities, each with its own myometrium, and a deep fundal cleft. This structural anomaly is characteristic of a uterus didelphys, and is usually diagnosed when a patient presents with reproductive issues such as infertility, recurrent miscarriage, or obstructive symptoms in adolescence. Incorrect Options: A. Bicornuate – A bicornuate uterus results from partial failure of fusion of the Müllerian ducts, leading to two horns that are connected at the lower uterine segment. Unlike didelphys, bicornuate uteri typically have a single cervix and the separation is less complete, with a shallower fundal cleft. C. Arcuate – An arcuate uterus is a normal variant where there is a mild indentation of the uterine fundus but no significant separation of the endometrial cavities. It does not present as two distinct uteri and is usually of no clinical significance. D. Aseptate – A septate uterus occurs when there is failure of resorption of the central septum after fusion of the Müllerian ducts. The uterus appears normal externally, with no cleft at the fundus, but has a fibrous or muscular septum dividing the endometrial cavity internally. This is not the case in uterus didelphys, which shows complete separation and two outer uterine bodies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Intramural fibroid An intramural fibroid is the most common type of uterine fibroid (leiomyoma) and is located within the myometrium, the muscular wall of the uterus. On imaging, particularly ultrasound or MRI, it appears as a well-defined, hypoechoic (dark) mass within the muscle layer of the uterus, often causing uterine enlargement or distortion of the endometrial cavity. Patients with intramural fibroids may present with menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), pelvic pain, infertility, or pressure symptoms depending on the size and location. The diagnosis is typically made via transvaginal ultrasound, and the characteristic appearance helps differentiate it from other uterine pathologies. Its central location within the myometrium distinguishes it from submucosal or subserosal fibroids. Incorrect Options: B. Adenomyoma – Adenomyomas are focal forms of adenomyosis, where endometrial glands and stroma are embedded within the myometrium, forming a mass. They appear as ill-defined, heterogeneous lesions with tiny cystic spaces, often lacking the well-defined margins seen in fibroids. Unlike intramural fibroids, they often cause dysmenorrhea and diffuse uterine enlargement. C. Endometriosis – Endometriosis involves ectopic endometrial tissue found outside the uterus, typically on the ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, or bowel surfaces. It presents with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility, but does not form a defined intramural uterine mass. On imaging, endometriotic lesions often appear as \"chocolate cysts\" (endometriomas) on the ovaries, not within the myometrium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fothergill The Fothergill’s operation, also known as the Manchester operation, is the correct choice for a 30-year-old woman (G2L2) with cervical elongation who likely desires uterine preservation. This surgery is specifically performed in cases of uterine prolapse with cervical elongation in women of reproductive age or those who want to retain the uterus. The procedure involves amputation of the elongated cervix, along with plication of the cardinal ligaments anterior to the cervix, effectively shortening and supporting the cervix while preserving the uterus. It is ideal for young, multiparous women with good pelvic support and a desire for uterine conservation. Incorrect Options: B. McCall – The McCall culdoplasty is performed at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to prevent vaginal vault prolapse by obliterating the pouch of Douglas and attaching the uterosacral ligaments to the vaginal cuff. It is not suitable for managing cervical elongation in a woman who wishes to keep her uterus. C. Lefort – The LeFort partial colpocleisis is a uterine prolapse surgery typically done in elderly women who are not sexually active and do not desire preservation of coital function. It involves closure of the vaginal canal, making it inappropriate for a young woman with cervical elongation. D. Hysterectomy – Hysterectomy is a definitive treatment for uterine prolapse or cervical elongation but is generally reserved for women who have completed childbearing and desire uterine removal. In a 30-year-old woman, especially if she wants to preserve fertility or the uterus, this option is too radical and not first-line.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sacral promontory In sacrocolpopexy (or sacrocolposuspension), the mesh is attached to the sacral promontory, which is the most appropriate bony landmark used for suspension. This surgery is performed to correct apical vaginal prolapse (i.e., prolapse of the vaginal vault or uterus) by anchoring the vagina or cervix to the anterior longitudinal ligament overlying the sacral promontory using a synthetic mesh. This approach restores normal vaginal axis and depth and provides durable support, making it one of the most effective procedures for pelvic organ prolapse. The sacral promontory offers a strong, stable fixation point in the pelvis and is accessible via the abdominal or laparoscopic route. Incorrect Options: B. Ischial spine – The ischial spine is used as a landmark in sacrospinous ligament fixation, a different procedure for vaginal vault prolapse done via the vaginal route. It is not the site of mesh attachment in sacrocolpopexy. C. Pubic symphysis – The pubic symphysis is located anteriorly and is not used for suspension in sacrocolpopexy. While some procedures like Burch colposuspension use the retropubic area near the pubic symphysis, it is unrelated to sacrocolpopexy. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Remove gently In a pregnant woman with an intrauterine device (IUD) in situ and visible threads, the best management is to gently remove the IUD. Retaining the IUD during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, infection (chorioamnionitis), preterm labor, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. If the threads are visible and accessible, removal can often be done safely with minimal trauma to the pregnancy. Several studies have shown that removal of the IUD early in pregnancy reduces complications and improves outcomes compared to leaving it in place. Therefore, gentle removal is the preferred approach when possible. Incorrect Options: A. Leave IUD inside – Leaving the IUD inside increases the risks of infection, miscarriage, preterm labor, and other pregnancy complications. This is generally reserved for cases where removal is not possible due to non-visible threads or high risk of injury during removal. C. ??? – The option is unclear, but no other immediate intervention besides removal or observation is generally indicated. D.

It can cause symptoms like vaginal discharge or bleeding but is usually painless. Given that the patient delivered 20 years ago and now has a mass felt on the perineum with the uterus palpable and the os negotiable by finger, a cervical polyp (specifically myxomatous due to its soft, gelatinous consistency) is a likely diagnosis. These polyps are common in multiparous women and can persist or develop long after delivery. Incorrect Options: B. Uterine inversion – Uterine inversion usually occurs immediately postpartum or shortly after delivery, presenting as a sudden protruding uterine mass with symptoms like hemorrhage and shock. It is unlikely to present 20 years after delivery without acute symptoms. Also, in uterine inversion, the uterus is not palpable in its normal position. C. Placental polyp – A placental polyp is a retained piece of placental tissue causing persistent bleeding usually soon after delivery or abortion, not decades later. It is a rare cause of a perineal mass long after delivery. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stage 3 Hydronephrosis in cervical cancer indicates advanced local disease with involvement or obstruction of the ureters, which is classified as Stage III disease according to the FIGO staging system. Specifically, Stage III cervical cancer includes tumor extension to the lower third of the vagina, pelvic sidewall involvement, and/or causing hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney due to ureteral obstruction. The presence of hydronephrosis reflects significant local spread, often compromising renal function, and impacts prognosis and treatment planning. Incorrect Options: A. Stage 1 – Stage I cervical cancer is limited to the cervix only without spread beyond the uterus. Hydronephrosis is not seen at this early stage because the disease has not involved structures near the ureters. B. Stage 2 – Stage II indicates the tumor has spread beyond the uterus but not to the pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina. Hydronephrosis is generally not present at this stage as ureteral obstruction is unlikely. D. Stage 4 – Stage IV represents spread beyond the true pelvis or involvement of bladder or rectal mucosa (Stage IVA) or distant metastasis (Stage IVB). While hydronephrosis can occur in stage IV if there is bladder involvement, it is classically a marker for Stage III disease due to pelvic sidewall or ureteral involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Turner Syndrome Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder characterized by complete or partial absence of one X chromosome (45,X karyotype) in females. It commonly presents with features such as short stature, primary amenorrhea, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, and webbed neck. The condition also involves gonadal dysgenesis leading to streak ovaries and absent or underdeveloped uterus and ovaries. The diagnosis fits the clinical presentation of a female with primary amenorrhea and physical features consistent with Turner syndrome. Incorrect Options: B. Kallmann Syndrome – Kallmann syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by delayed or absent puberty along with anosmia or hyposmia (loss or reduction of the sense of smell). It usually presents with low gonadotropin levels but the karyotype is normal (46,XX or 46,XY), and it does not involve chromosomal abnormalities like Turner syndrome. C. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) – AIS occurs in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype who are phenotypically female due to androgen receptor defects. Patients present with primary amenorrhea, absent uterus and ovaries, and undescended testes. Turner syndrome differs as it is a 45,X female with gonadal dysgenesis, not androgen receptor defects. D. Klinefelter Syndrome – Klinefelter syndrome affects males with a 47,XXY karyotype, presenting with hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and infertility. It is not associated with female phenotypes or primary amenorrhea, making it irrelevant to this clinical picture.",

Third-degree prolapse is defined as the condition where the organ protrudes outside the vaginal introitus, meaning it lies outside the pelvis and is visible externally. This stage often requires intervention as it can cause discomfort, hygiene issues, and urinary or bowel symptoms. Incorrect Options: A. First Degree – First-degree prolapse is characterized by descent of the organ into the upper vagina but not reaching the hymen. The organ remains well within the pelvis and is not visible externally. B. Second Degree – Second-degree prolapse occurs when the organ descends to the level of the hymen or vaginal opening but does not protrude beyond it. The organ may be felt at the introitus but does not lie outside the pelvis. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Endometrioma An endometrioma is a type of ovarian cyst formed by ectopic endometrial tissue, often called a \"chocolate cyst\" due to the presence of old, thick, brownish blood inside. It commonly presents as a cystic adnexal mass in women of reproductive age and is associated with endometriosis. On imaging, an endometrioma typically appears as a unilocular cyst with homogenous low-level internal echoes on ultrasound. It is often linked with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Incorrect Options: B. Torsion – Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency characterized by sudden onset severe pelvic pain due to twisting of the ovary, cutting off blood supply. Although torsion can occur in an ovary with an endometrioma or cyst, torsion itself is a clinical diagnosis, not a cyst type. Imaging usually shows an enlarged ovary with absent blood flow. C. Polyp – A polyp refers to a growth usually arising from the endometrium or cervical canal, not the ovary. It appears as a solid lesion within the uterine cavity, not as a cystic ovarian mass. D. Ovarian cyst – This is a generic term that includes various cystic lesions of the ovary, including functional cysts, dermoids, and endometriomas.

It typically involves the fallopian tubes, endometrium, and ovaries, and can present with symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, menstrual irregularities (especially amenorrhea), infertility, and occasionally a pelvic mass. Imaging or laparoscopy may reveal caseating granulomas, tubo-ovarian masses, adhesions, or beaded fallopian tubes. Histopathology and microbiological testing confirm the diagnosis, often revealing granulomatous inflammation with or without acid-fast bacilli. Incorrect Options: B. Endometriosis – Endometriosis involves the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, leading to cyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Imaging may show endometriomas or adhesions, but it does not typically present with caseating granulomas or the systemic features suggestive of TB. C. Sarcoidosis – While sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease, pelvic involvement is extremely rare, and it more commonly affects the lungs, skin, and lymph nodes.

It is classified as Type I endometrial cancer and is estrogen-dependent. One of the key molecular features of endometrioid carcinoma is the mutation in the PTEN gene, a tumor suppressor involved in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. PTEN mutations are found in a significant proportion of endometrioid cancers and are associated with a relatively favorable prognosis when diagnosed early. These cancers are often preceded by endometrial hyperplasia and tend to occur in the setting of unopposed estrogen exposure (e.g., obesity, anovulation, hormone therapy). Incorrect Options: B. Serous – Serous carcinoma is a Type II endometrial cancer, typically seen in older women. It is not associated with PTEN mutations, but rather with p53 mutations, and is estrogen-independent. It is aggressive and carries a poorer prognosis. C. Papillary – Papillary histologic patterns may be seen in serous carcinoma, so this overlaps with option B. Again, this type is associated with p53 mutations, not PTEN. D. Clear cell – Clear cell carcinoma is another Type II endometrial cancer, also aggressive and unrelated to estrogen exposure or PTEN mutation.

On ultrasound (USG), classic findings include an adnexal mass with incomplete septations, a \"cogwheel appearance\", and sometimes a \"beads-on-a-string\" sign. The cogwheel sign is due to thickened longitudinal endosalpingeal folds seen in cross-section, typically representing chronic inflammation. These USG features are key diagnostic clues for hydrosalpinx. Incorrect Options: B. Follicular ovarian cyst – These are simple, thin-walled, unilocular cysts usually less than 3 cm in size and are anechoic on ultrasound. They do not have septations or cogwheel appearance, and are not associated with inflammation. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cortical Reaction The cortical reaction is a crucial post-fertilization event that prevents polyspermy, which is the entry of multiple sperms into a single ovum. Once the first sperm successfully fuses with the oocyte membrane, it triggers an immediate release of cortical granules from the oocyte into the perivitelline space. These granules contain enzymes that cause structural and biochemical modifications in the zona pellucida, a process termed zona hardening. This change blocks other sperms from binding and penetrating, ensuring that only one sperm fertilizes the oocyte, which is essential for normal diploid chromosome formation. B. Acrosomal Reaction – This occurs before fusion and involves the release of enzymes (like hyaluronidase and acrosin) from the sperm's acrosome to help penetrate the corona radiata and zona pellucida. While essential for fertilization, it does not prevent polyspermy. C. Increased membrane potential – There is a brief depolarization of the oocyte membrane immediately after sperm fusion, but this electrical block is temporary and not as reliable or permanent as the cortical reaction for preventing polyspermy. D. Decreased membrane potential – A decrease in membrane potential may occur as part of early oocyte activation, but it is not the main mechanism preventing entry of multiple sperms. Structural alteration of the zona pellucida through the cortical reaction plays the dominant role.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bacterial vaginosis The Nugent score is a standardized Gram-stain–based scoring system used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV) by quantifying the relative abundance of key vaginal flora. It assesses three morphotypes—large Gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus spp.), small Gram-variable rods (Gardnerella/Bacteroides spp.), and curved Gram-negative rods (Mobiluncus spp.)—and assigns a score from 0 to 10. A score of 7–10 is diagnostic of BV, indicating a depletion of protective lactobacilli and an overgrowth of anaerobic organisms. This objective tool improves diagnostic accuracy over Amsel’s clinical criteria alone and is widely used in research and clinical practice. B. Candida – Vulvovaginal candidiasis is diagnosed by wet-mount microscopy of vaginal discharge in 10% KOH, revealing pseudohyphae and yeast forms. There is no Gram-stain scoring system analogous to Nugent’s for Candida. C. Trichomonas – Trichomoniasis is identified via wet mount microscopy, culture, or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to detect motile trichomonads. Again, no scoring index like Nugent’s applies to Trichomonas.",
