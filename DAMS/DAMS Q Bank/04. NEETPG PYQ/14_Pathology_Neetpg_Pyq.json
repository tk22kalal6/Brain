Hyperparathyroidism is not typically associated with MEN-2B Other options: A) Marfanoid habitus: Seen in MEN-2B. It refers to a tall, thin body frame with disproportionately long limbs and fingers, resembling Marfan syndrome. This is a characteristic feature of MEN-2B B) Mucosal neuroma: Seen in MEN-2B. Mucosal neuromas are benign growths of nerve tissue, commonly found in the lips, tongue, and gastrointestinal tract. They are a hallmark of MEN-2B D) Megacolon: Seen in MEN-2B. It can occur due to Hirschsprung disease, which is occasionally associated with RET gene mutations found in MEN-2B",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The Warburg effect allows cancer cells to shunt glucose metabolites into biosynthetic pathways. These intermediates are crucial for producing nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, which are essential for rapid cell growth and survival Other options: A) Increase ATP Production from the pathway: The Warburg effect is not primarily about maximizing ATP production. Although aerobic glycolysis is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation in terms of ATP yield, cancer cells prioritize other benefits from this pathway C) To avoid aging and remain immortal: Immortality in cancer cells is more closely related to mechanisms like telomerase activation rather than the Warburg effect. The Warburg effect primarily supports anabolic growth rather than directly influencing aging D) Less glucose uptake by cancer: Cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake due to their high metabolic demand, as evidenced by overexpression of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Telomerase activity is decreased in ageing: In ageing somatic cells, telomerase activity is typically reduced or absent, resulting in telomere shortening. This contributes to cellular senescence and loss of regenerative capacity Other options: A) Telomerase activity is increased in ageing: In most somatic cells, telomerase activity decreases with age, leading to telomere shortening, which contributes to cellular senescence and ageing B) Telomeres increase in ageing: Telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division in somatic cells as organisms age. Shortened telomeres trigger replicative senescence D) Telomerase and ageing are not related: Telomerase and ageing are closely related, as telomerase helps maintain telomere length and delays cellular senescence in certain cell types, such as germ cells, stem cells, and cancer cells",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The patient likely has sickle cell disease, specifically the HbSS variant, where both alleles are mutated to produce sickle haemoglobin (HbS). This explains the recurrent chest infections (possibly due to sickle cell-related lung damage), abdominal pain (often due to splenic infarction or vaso-occlusion), splenomegaly, and icterus (due to hemolysis). The peak in the S window (indicating the presence of HbS) is characteristic of this condition Other options: A) Hb A2 is typically elevated in conditions like beta-thalassemia but not in sickle cell disease. This patient's clinical presentation does not suggest a beta-thalassemia diagnosis B) HbF (fetal haemoglobin) is elevated in conditions like sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia during certain stages, especially in newborns, but this patient's clinical features (recurrent chest infections, splenomegaly, icterus, and transfusions) are more indicative of a sickle cell crisis, not simply an elevated HbF C) Hb S variant refers to the abnormal haemoglobin seen in sickle cell disease but does not directly correlate with the patient's presentation of recurrent infections, transfusions, and splenomegaly.",

The patient's microcytic RBCs point to a different etiology, making folate testing less relevant at this stage D) Homocysteine levels: Elevated homocysteine levels can be associated with folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, which causes macrocytic anemia.

The presence of microcytic hypochromic RBCs and pencil-shaped cells is characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. The fatigue and hemorrhoids are common symptoms, and the peripheral smear findings are typical of iron deficiency anemia, where the body is unable to produce enough hemoglobin due to insufficient iron Other options: B) Vitamin B12 deficiency typically leads to macrocytic and megaloblastic RBCs, not microcytic hypochromic cells. Additionally, the presence of pencil-shaped cells is not associated with B12 deficiency C) Thalassemia can cause microcytic anemia, but the characteristic finding on a peripheral smear would be target cells or basophilic stippling, not pencil-shaped cells.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fat embolism syndrome is a common complication following fractures of long bones (e.g., femur) or pelvic trauma, often seen in young patients after road traffic accidents. It typically presents 24–72 hours after the injury with a triad of symptoms: respiratory distress (dyspnoea), neurological symptoms (unconsciousness, confusion), and a petechial rash (may not always be present). The timeline and presentation fit this diagnosis Other options: B) Thromboembolism: Thromboembolic events, such as a pulmonary embolism, are less likely in this case because the symptoms occurred 2 days post-accident and there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or hypercoagulability, which are common precursors C) Air embolism typically occurs in specific scenarios, such as during surgery, central line placement, or penetrating chest trauma. This condition presents acutely, often immediately after the event, not delayed by 2 days D) Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by widespread clotting and bleeding, often secondary to sepsis, trauma, or obstetric complications. While trauma can lead to DIC, the clinical presentation of dyspnoea and unconsciousness without bleeding or clotting symptoms makes DIC less likely",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Calorie restriction, without malnutrition, has been shown in many studies to delay aging and increase lifespan. It works by reducing metabolic rates, oxidative stress, and inflammation, and by enhancing cellular repair mechanisms. Calorie restriction leads in release of sirtuins, they do histone de acetylation, which ultimately leads in delaying ageing process Other options: A) More ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species): Increased ROS leads to oxidative damage to cellular components (DNA, proteins, lipids), which accelerates aging. ROS are often implicated in age-related diseases and cellular senescence. B) Reduced levels of antioxidants: Antioxidants neutralize ROS and protect cells from oxidative stress. Reduced levels of antioxidants can lead to an accumulation of cellular damage, promoting aging rather than delaying it D) Routine exercise has many health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases, its direct impact on delaying the intrinsic aging process is less pronounced compared to calorie restriction",

Avoiding gluten helps prevent damage to the small intestine and resolves symptoms Other options: Steroids may be used in certain conditions with inflammation (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmunity), they are not the treatment for this patient's condition associated with HLA-DQ2, which points to celiac disease B) Low lactose: Lactose intolerance can occur secondary to celiac disease due to damage to the small intestine, but the main treatment for the underlying condition is not a low-lactose diet.

It is one of the nephrotic syndromes that is highly responsive to steroid therapy, leading to rapid remission of symptoms Other options: A) Effacement of foot processes on light microscopy (flattening or fusion of podocyte foot processes) is best seen on electron microscopy, not light microscopy. This feature is characteristic of minimal change disease and helps in diagnosing it, but it is not visible on light microscopy. B) Non-selective proteinuria: In minimal change disease, the proteinuria is typically selective, meaning that the smaller proteins (like albumin) are more likely to be lost in the urine compared to larger proteins. Non-selective proteinuria, where both small and large proteins are lost, is seen in other types of nephrotic syndrome D) Common in adults: Minimal change disease is more common in children, particularly between the ages of 2 and 6 years. It is much rarer in adults, where other forms of nephrotic syndrome, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), are more common.",

The presence of RBCs in the urine and systemic involvement (e.g., joints, skin, mucosa) strongly suggests lupus nephritis, an autoimmune condition in which the kidneys are affected Other options: A) PSGN (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) typically follows a streptococcal infection (e.g., throat or skin infection) and presents with hematuria, edema, and hypertension. While it can cause hematuria, the presence of oral ulcers, arthritis, and rashes makes PSGN unlikely, as these are not common features of PSGN B) Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) typically presents with fever, rash, and eosinophilia, often due to drug reactions or infections, and might result in acute kidney injury. However, the constellation of oral ulcers, arthritis, and rashes points to an autoimmune condition, making AIN less likely D) Cystitis typically presents with dysuria, frequency, and urgency due to bladder inflammation, often from a urinary tract infection. It does not typically cause oral ulcers, arthritis, or rashes. Hematuria can occur but would be associated with other symptoms of a urinary tract infection",

It often occurs in individuals with chronic infection or immunosuppression. The clinical presentation often includes recurrent infections, which is consistent with the patient's history of recurrent cystitis Other options: A) Acute cystitis is a common bladder infection characterized by symptoms like dysuria, frequency, and urgency. It typically shows signs of inflammation on histopathology, such as neutrophil infiltration. However, it does not present with the specific histologic features seen in malakoplakia, which is a different condition. B) Interstitial cystitis is a chronic condition characterized by bladder pain, urgency, and frequency, often with a negative urine culture. Histologically, it shows chronic inflammation and submucosal fibrosis, but not the specific Michaelis-Gutmann bodies that are characteristic of malakoplakia.

This is part of the acute inflammatory response associated with viral pneumonia. The exudates often include fibrin, neutrophils, and other inflammatory cells, which contribute to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) seen in severe COVID-19 cases Other options: B) Intranuclear inclusions are typically seen in infections caused by DNA viruses (e.g., herpesviruses) rather than SARS-CoV-2, which is an RNA virus. While some viral infections may cause intranuclear inclusions, this is not characteristic of COVID-19 C) Intracytoplasmic inclusions are more commonly seen in infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV), but they are not a hallmark of COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs through direct viral replication in the epithelial cells, but intracytoplasmic inclusions are not a defining feature in this case D) Liquefactive necrosis is more commonly seen in brain tissue or in certain types of infections, like abscesses. While there may be tissue damage in the lungs in severe COVID-19 cases, the predominant finding is not liquefactive necrosis but rather fibrin-rich exudates and other features of inflammation such as hyaline membrane formation and alveolar damage",

While FNAC can sometimes be inconclusive, it is generally an effective diagnostic method for identifying PTC Other options: B) Nuclear features are diagnostic of this condition: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is diagnosed based on characteristic nuclear features that are seen on histological examination. These include nuclear clearing, inclusions, grooves, and the presence of psammoma bodies. These features are highly suggestive of PTC C) Spreads via lymphatics: Papillary thyroid carcinoma often spreads to regional lymph nodes, which is a distinguishing feature of its metastatic pattern. It tends to spread in the cervical lymph nodes rather than via blood vessels, which is typical of other thyroid cancers like follicular carcinoma D) Excellent prognosis: Papillary thyroid carcinoma generally has an excellent prognosis, especially in younger patients.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sertoli-only syndrome is a condition in which only Sertoli cells are present in the testicular biopsy, and there is a lack of germ cells (sperm-producing cells). This condition is a common cause of non-obstructive azoospermia (absence of sperm in semen), often leading to infertility. The histology typically shows only Sertoli cells with no spermatogenesis. This is a key finding in the testicular biopsy of this patient Other options: B) Atrophy of testis refers to the shrinkage of the testicle, which can be caused by various conditions like chronic infections, hormonal imbalances, or ischemia. On biopsy, you would expect to see a reduction in the size of seminiferous tubules, but you would still typically find germ cells along with Sertoli cells. Sertoli-only syndrome specifically lacks germ cells, which is the distinguishing feature C) Acute epididymoorchitis is an infection that causes inflammation of the testicle and epididymis, usually presenting with pain, swelling, and tenderness. Histology would show inflammatory infiltrates (e.g., neutrophils) and might show edema and congestion of the testes, not the lack of germ cells seen in Sertoli-only syndrome D) ITGCN (Intratubular Germ Cell Neoplasia) refers to a precursor lesion to testicular germ cell tumours. Histology would typically show germ cell neoplasia (abnormal germ cells) in the seminiferous tubules, and these abnormal cells would still be present. In Sertoli-only syndrome, germ cells are absent, making it inconsistent with ITGCN",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most likely cause of the patient's macrocytic anemia (high MCV of 120) is a folic acid deficiency. This condition often results from a diet poor in fruits and vegetables, which are the main sources of folate. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis, and its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, characterized by macrocytic red blood cells and hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral smear. The patient's lifestyle of sitting for long hours and consuming junk food fits this deficiency Other options: B) Cyanocobalamin deficiency can also cause macrocytic anemia like folic acid deficiency, but the key difference is that B12 deficiency can also lead to neurological symptoms (e.g., numbness, tingling, and difficulty walking) due to nerve damage. In this case, there is no mention of such neurological signs, making B12 deficiency less likely. Additionally, the patient's diet does not specifically suggest a B12 deficiency, as it is more common in people with poor animal product intake C) Sideroblastic anemia is a type of microcytic anemia, characterized by the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow and impaired heme synthesis. It is not typically associated with a high MCV (macrocytic anemia). The patient's macrocytic anemia is more consistent with a folate or B12 deficiency D) Acute blood loss typically results in normocytic anemia (normal MCV), not macrocytic anemia. Acute blood loss leads to a sudden reduction in circulating blood volume, and the body initially compensates with normal-sized red blood cells. Chronic blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia, but it would not cause macrocytic anemia",

Thymoma and other thymic tumors can lead to pure red cell aplasia by producing antibodies that target the red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. This condition is known as paraneoplastic pure red cell aplasia or Good's syndrome. Other options: A) Bronchogenic carcinoma is not typically associated with red cell aplasia (a form of pure red cell aplasia). While lung cancer can lead to paraneoplastic syndromes, it is more commonly associated with conditions like hypertrophic osteoarthropathy or Cushing syndrome, rather than hematologic abnormalities like red cell aplasia B) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause various paraneoplastic syndromes, including cytopenias, but it is less commonly associated with pure red cell aplasia compared to other conditions like thymic neoplasia or Hodgkin lymphoma D) Hodgkin lymphoma can cause a variety of hematologic abnormalities, including cytopenias, it is less frequently associated with pure red cell aplasia compared to thymic neoplasms or myasthenia gravis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The description of effaced architecture, indented nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and the presence of atypical cells on biopsy, along with the CD10 and BCL2 positivity, strongly suggests follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is characterized by follicular growth pattern with small cleaved cells and large non-cleaved cells. The CD10 (a marker of germinal centre B-cells) and BCL2 (a protein that inhibits apoptosis) are typically positive in follicular lymphoma Other options: B) Burkitt's lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized by high mitotic index and the presence of the \"starry sky\" pattern on histology, which is due to the presence of macrophages ingesting apoptotic tumour cells. Burkitt's lymphoma typically presents with a rapidly growing mass, often in the abdomen, and usually involves a translocation involving the MYC gene. The described histology (indented nuclei and prominent nucleolus) is not typical for Burkitt's lymphoma C) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: While follicular lymphoma is a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the description is specific enough to point toward follicular lymphoma rather than the broad category of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma includes many different subtypes, and the clues provided (architecture, nucleolus, CD10, and BCL2) are more specific to follicular lymphoma D) Mycosis fungoides is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that primarily affects the skin and presents with patches, plaques, and tumours. It is characterized by the presence of cerebriform nuclei and skin involvement. The biopsy described here does not fit with mycosis fungoides since it refers to B-cell markers (CD10, BCL2) rather than T-cell markers",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most likely diagnosis is aplastic anemia, given the findings of fatty marrow, macrocytosis, low reticulocyte count, and pancytopenia. Aplastic anemia is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells, leading to pancytopenia (low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The symptoms of gum bleeding, petechiae, easy bruising, and skin blisters are typical of thrombocytopenia, which is often seen in aplastic anemia Other options: B) Atypical mycobacteria infection infiltrating into bone marrow can cause marrow suppression and cytopenia’s, but they would be less likely to cause a fatty marrow pattern without showing evidence of infection (such as granulomas or positive cultures). Also, the clinical presentation of prolonged fever and bleeding is more indicative of aplastic anemia C) Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by hemolytic anemia, dark urine (especially in the morning), and thrombosis. It is associated with defective red blood cell membrane proteins, leading to increased destruction of red blood cells. This patient does not show signs of hemolysis or thrombosis, making PNH unlikely ) Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) involve abnormal bone marrow with dysplastic blood cells and can lead to ineffective haematopoiesis and pancytopenia. However, MDS typically presents with blasts in the bone marrow (often 5% or more) and would not show the fatty marrow pattern or the absence of megakaryocytes seen in this case. MDS is more common in older adults",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Transferrin saturation is decreased in iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is the ratio of serum iron to TIBC, and in iron deficiency anemia, the serum iron level is low while TIBC is high, leading to a low transferrin saturation Other options: A) TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity): Increased in iron deficiency anemia. When iron levels are low, the liver produces more transferrin (the protein that binds iron), leading to an increase in TIBC. This is a compensatory response to enhance iron binding and transport C) Red cell protoporphyrin: Increased in iron deficiency anemia. Protoporphyrin is a precursor in the production of heme, and in the absence of sufficient iron, red cell protoporphyrin levels increase because there is inadequate iron for heme synthesis D) Serum soluble transferrin receptors: Increased in iron deficiency anemia. Soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR) are released into the bloodstream when iron stores are low.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The most probable reason for this patient's worsening neurological symptoms after folate supplementation is that the folate therapy caused rapid depletion of B12 stores, which aggravated her B12 deficiency and worsened the neurological symptoms. Therefore, B12 supplementation is needed in this case to prevent further neurological damage Other options: A) Folate not absorbed: This is less likely because folate is typically well absorbed in the small intestine. In cases of folate deficiency, the patient would usually have other signs of malabsorption, such as diarrhoea or weight loss, which are not mentioned here B) Unmasked pyridoxine deficiency: Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, but it does not cause the type of neurological symptoms described in this patient. Moreover, pyridoxine deficiency is unlikely to be \"unmasked\" by folate therapy C) Deficiency of folate reductase in CNS: Folate reductase deficiency would primarily cause issues related to folate metabolism, but this patient's symptoms, especially the neurological ones, are more consistent with B12 deficiency, and there is no indication that she has a primary issue with folate metabolism",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The mode of inheritance likely to be transmitted in this case is autosomal dominant, consistent with Marfan syndrome (tall stature, early diastolic murmur) Autosomal dominant inheritance is typical for Marfan syndrome, as it is often transmitted from one generation to the next, and only one copy of the mutant gene is sufficient to cause the disorder Other options: B) Autosomal recessive: In autosomal recessive inheritance, the condition typically skips generations and requires both parents to be carriers. This inheritance pattern is not consistent with the pedigree for Marfan syndrome C) X-linked recessive: X-linked recessive conditions primarily affect males, as they inherit the X chromosome from their mother. This mode of inheritance does not match Marfan syndrome or the pedigree provided D) X-linked dominant: X-linked dominant conditions are rare and often show a pattern where both males and females are affected, but fathers cannot pass the condition to their sons.

Since the donor and recipient are genetically identical, the immune system does not recognize the graft as foreign, and there is no risk of rejection Other options: Xenograft: A graft from a different species, e.g., pig heart valves used in humans. These grafts are prone to immune rejection. Allograft: A graft transplanted between individuals of the same species but who are not genetically identical. This is the most common type of graft in organ transplantation. It requires immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune thyroid disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland, which is seen in histopathology. Hurthle cells (also known as oncocytic cells) are a distinctive feature in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These cells are eosinophilic and have an abundance of mitochondria, which gives them a granular appearance. The elevated TSH level indicates hypothyroidism, which is commonly seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to the destruction of thyroid tissue. Other options: A) Graves disease: This is an autoimmune hyperthyroid condition characterized by low TSH and elevated thyroid hormones (T3/T4). It would not show lymphocytic infiltration and Hurthle cells. Instead, it typically has diffuse goiter and may show signs of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) B) Follicular lymphoma: While lymphoma can involve the thyroid and cause swelling, it typically presents with different histological features, such as abnormal lymphoid cell proliferation. Lymphocytic infiltration may be seen, but Hurthle cells would not be characteristic D) Medullary carcinoma thyroid: This type of thyroid cancer arises from the parafollicular C-cells and presents with elevated calcitonin levels.

These vegetations consist of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms, and are typically found on heart valves, particularly in areas where the valves are damaged or predisposed to infection. Other options: A) Libman-Sachs endocarditis: This is a form of non-infective endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The vegetations seen in Libman-Sachs endocarditis are typically smaller, non-bulky, and sterile, unlike the large, friable vegetations seen in infective endocarditis C) Rheumatic carditis: This occurs as a complication of rheumatic fever and involves smaller, firm vegetations on the heart valves, which are often referred to as Aschoff bodies. These vegetations are not bulky or friable and are instead firm and composed of inflammatory cells D) Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE): NBTE is a condition where fibrin and platelet thrombi form on the heart valves in patients with a hypercoagulable state, like cancer or sepsis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most characteristic finding on a cardiac biopsy in a patient who experienced post-MI reperfusion injury is eosinophilic contraction bands. Eosinophilic contraction bands are seen on histological examination after reperfusion injury and are indicative of myocyte injury and necrosis. They result from the sarcomeric contraction of myocytes in response to calcium influx and oxidative stress during reperfusion. Other options: A) Waviness of fibers: This is a finding commonly associated with early myocardial ischemia, but it is not specific to reperfusion injury. It reflects the loss of normal myocyte alignment in the early stages of ischemia before irreversible damage occurs C) Neutrophils in cardiac muscle: Neutrophils infiltrate the myocardium after 24 to 48 hours post-MI, during the inflammatory phase of healing, not during reperfusion injury itself. Their presence is a sign of ongoing inflammation rather than reperfusion damage D) Swelling of cells: Swelling (or cellular edema) can be seen during ischemic injury, but it is not a hallmark of reperfusion injury. Swelling is more associated with the early stages of cell injury before the mitochondria and cellular structures are irreversibly damaged",

Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves. These tumors are mostly found in the soft tissues, including the wrist. Other options: A) Neurofibroma: Neurofibromas can also be made of spindle-shaped cells but typically do not have the distinct Verocay bodies seen in schwannomas. Additionally, neurofibromas may show a more haphazard arrangement of cells, unlike the more organized pattern of a schwannoma C) Lipoma: Lipomas are benign tumors made of fat cells and would not show spindle-shaped cells or Verocay bodies on histology. They would typically show mature adipocytes instead D) Dermoid cyst: Dermoid cysts are typically cystic structures that may contain a variety of tissues like skin, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. They would not exhibit the histological findings seen in schwannomas",

These polyps are hamartomatous in nature, meaning they are composed of normal tissue but arranged abnormally. The cystically dilated glands seen on biopsy are characteristic of juvenile polyps, which are often found in the rectum. Other options: A) Villous adenoma: Villous adenomas are typically benign neoplasms found in the colon, and while they can cause rectal bleeding, they are usually seen in adults rather than children. Histologically, villous adenomas have villous projections covered by dysplastic epithelium, not cystically dilated glands C) Vascular malformation: Vascular malformations are congenital anomalies of blood vessels and are often present at birth. They typically present as painless masses and do not typically have cystically dilated glands in their histology. They are more likely to present as bluish, soft masses rather than polyps in the rectum D) Serrated adenoma: Serrated adenomas are a form of neoplastic polyps that are typically present in adults and are more often found in the colon.

Histopathologically, Giant cell tumors are characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like giant cells) interspersed with mononuclear stromal cells Other options: A) Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically presents with a painful, enlarging mass, often with associated bone destruction. On histology, osteosarcoma is characterized by the production of osteoid (immature bone) by malignant cells. While osteosarcoma can involve the knee joint, it does not typically show the multinucleated giant cells seen in GCT B) Chondrosarcoma: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor arising from cartilage and often presents in older adults. Histologically, it is characterized by cartilaginous matrix and malignant chondrocytes. It does not typically exhibit multinucleated giant cells, which are more characteristic of GCT C) Ewing sarcoma: Ewing sarcoma is a malignant tumor commonly affecting children and adolescents, usually involving the diaphysis of long bones.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) About 30% of patients with PAN test positive for HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen), indicating an association with chronic hepatitis B infection. This subset of PAN is known as HBV-associated PAN Other options: A) Microscopy shows fibrinoid necrosis in large arteries: While fibrinoid necrosis is a hallmark of PAN, it typically affects medium-sized arteries, not large arteries. The statement is not entirely correct because PAN primarily involves medium-sized arteries, and fibrinoid necrosis can be seen in these vessels B) ANCA is positive: This is incorrect. PAN is typically negative for ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), which is more commonly associated with other vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and microscopic polyangiitis D) Patient has hypogammaglobulinemia: This is incorrect. Hypogammaglobulinemia is not a characteristic feature of PAN. In fact, patients with PAN typically have normal or elevated levels of immunoglobulins.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Myxoid liposarcoma is a subtype of liposarcoma that commonly affects the retroperitoneum (as in this case), as well as other soft tissues. It is characterized by the presence of myxoid (gelatinous or mucinous) tissue and adipocytes (fat cells). The t (12;16) translocation is a characteristic genetic mutation in myxoid liposarcoma, which results in the fusion of the FUS gene on chromosome 16 and the DDIT3 gene on chromosome 12. This translocation is commonly used in molecular analysis to confirm the diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma Other options: Lipoma is a benign tumour composed of mature adipocytes, but it does not show the genetic mutations associated with liposarcomas like the t (12;16) translocation. Lipomas do not typically present with swelling in the retroperitoneum, and their biopsies do not reveal myxoid tissue Synovial sarcoma typically involves the extremities (especially around the joints) and is associated with a t(X;18) translocation, not a t(12;16). Synovial sarcoma often shows a biphasic pattern with both epithelial and spindle cell components, which would be absent in myxoid liposarcoma Pleomorphic sarcoma is a term used for a heterogeneous group of malignant soft tissue tumours, often characterized by a variety of cell types and pleomorphism, but it does not have the specific molecular genetic abnormality seen in myxoid liposarcoma",

These findings are consistent with megaloblastic anemia, commonly caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. In this case, chronic alcoholism is the most likely etiology. Other options: A) Lead poisoning: Associated with microcytic anemia and basophilic stippling, not macrocytosis B) Iron deficiency anemia: Results in microcytic hypochromic anemia, not macrocytosis or hypersegmented neutrophils D) Hemolytic anemia: Causes normocytic or macrocytic anemia but lacks hypersegmented neutrophils. Hemolysis would also show increased reticulocyte count, which is not mentioned here",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) PNH The cause of an intra-corpuscular defect in hemolysis is PNH (Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria), where the defect in the red blood cell membrane leads to increased vulnerability to complement-mediated destruction. Other options: A) Uremic syndrome is a result of kidney failure, leading to a buildup of waste products in the blood. While it can cause anemia due to renal failure, it is not an intra-corpuscular defect. The anemia seen in uremia is typically normocytic and often due to decreased erythropoietin production B) PCH (Paroxysmal Cold Haemoglobinuria) is a type of hemolysis caused by cold-reacting antibodies, which is extravascular hemolysis rather than an intra-corpuscular defect. In PCH, hemolysis occurs due to the binding of cold antibodies to the RBCs at lower temperatures, leading to complement activation and RBC destruction D) Portal hypertension is primarily a vascular condition and typically does not cause intra-corpuscular defects in RBCs. It may lead to splenomegaly and hypersplenism, which can contribute to extravascular hemolysis (destruction of RBCs in the spleen), but it is not an intra-corpuscular defect",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IV Ig) is the treatment of choice for acute Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) when treatment is indicated. It rapidly increases platelet counts by blocking the Fc receptors in the spleen, thereby reducing the destruction of platelets. IV Ig is especially preferred in cases where there is active bleeding or a very low platelet count, as it acts faster than steroids and has a good safety profile in children. A. Blood transfusion Incorrect. Blood transfusion is not the treatment of choice for ITP, since the problem lies in platelet destruction, not red blood cells. Transfusion is only considered in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage, and even then, platelet transfusions may be needed — not whole blood. B. Spontaneous recovery Incorrect. While many cases of acute ITP in children do resolve on their own, this is not considered a treatment. Observation is appropriate in mild cases, but the question asks for the treatment of choice, which refers to what should be done when intervention is necessary. D. Splenectomy Incorrect. Splenectomy is generally reserved for chronic ITP or refractory cases that do not respond to first-line treatments like IV Ig or steroids. It is not used in the acute phase, especially not in children.",

This form of TB results from the hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causing tiny, uniform nodules (granulomas) to form in various organs, most notably in the lungs On gross examination, the lungs in miliary TB typically show numerous small, white or yellowish nodules scattered throughout the lung parenchyma, resembling millet seeds Other options: B) Bronchiectasis: This is characterized by dilated and thickened airways. It often presents with recurrent infections and copious sputum production. Grossly, the lungs may show dilated bronchi but not the miliary nodules C) Emphysema: In emphysema, the lungs show enlarged airspaces due to destruction of the alveolar walls, which leads to a loss of lung elasticity. It does not present with miliary nodules D) COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may show changes like emphysema and chronic bronchitis but does not present with the characteristic miliary nodules seen in miliary tuberculosis",

This is an epithelial tumor that can arise in the stomach, often as gastric cancer Other options: A) GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor): GIST is a mesenchymal tumor that originates from interstitial cells of Cajal, and is not an epithelial tumor. It is more related to smooth muscle cells and is classified as a sarcoma B) Carcinoid: Carcinoid tumors arise from neuroendocrine cells and are classified as neuroendocrine tumors rather than epithelial tumors. While they can occur in the stomach, they are not of epithelial origin C) Sarcoma: Sarcomas are mesenchymal tumors (from connective tissue, muscle, or bone), not epithelial in origin",

T cells are involved in the initiation of inflammation by recognizing self-antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These T cells activate other immune cells, including B cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts, contributing to the inflammatory response and tissue damage seen in RA. Other options: B cells are also involved by producing antibodies (e.g., rheumatoid factor), it is T cells that are crucial in the early stages of the disease, triggering the autoimmune response and activating the subsequent inflammatory cascade NK cells (Natural Killer cells) are generally not the main players in RA, although they can contribute to immune regulation Macrophages are also involved in RA as they release inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-?) that perpetuate the disease, but they are not the primary cells responsible for initiating the disease",

It is most commonly associated with Sickle cell anemia: Dactylitis is a frequent early symptom of sickle cell disease in young children, occurring due to the blockage of blood flow in small bones caused by sickled red blood cells. Other options: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gouty arthritis can cause joint inflammation, but dactylitis is not a typical feature of these conditions.

Other options: Type 3 collagen replacement (A) is an early step in wound healing, typically replaced by Type 1 collagen over time, which contributes to strength. However, the final tensile strength is more dependent on the crosslinking of collagen fibers Macrophage activity (C) is important for inflammation and the cleanup of debris in the initial phases of healing but does not directly contribute to tensile strength Granulation tissue (D) is the tissue that forms during the healing process, providing a scaffold for collagen deposition, but it is the maturation of collagen fibers (through crosslinking) that provides the actual tensile strength to the wound",

It can also cause hypercalcemia due to paraneoplastic syndromes, particularly the release of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which raises serum calcium levels. The presence of large atypical cells with hyperchromasia on lung biopsy fits with squamous cell carcinoma Other options: Small cell carcinoma (B) typically presents with more rapid progression, often associated with symptoms like cough, hemoptysis, and paraneoplastic syndromes such as SIADH (not hypercalcemia). The cells are usually smaller and have less hyperchromasia compared to what is described in this case Adenocarcinoma (C) is also linked to smoking but is generally more common in non-smokers as well.

The intermittent swelling of the knees could be indicative of repeated joint bleeds (hemarthrosis), a classic feature of hemophilia. Other options: A) Lupus anticoagulant is associated with antiphospholipid syndrome and causes thrombosis, not bleeding.

While AIHA can also cause jaundice and splenomegaly, it typically presents with normocytic or macrocytic cells, not spherocytes. The peripheral smear in AIHA often shows polychromasia, reticulocytosis, and spherocytes, but the clinical presentation with a family history is more suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis C) G6PD deficiency - genetic testing: G6PD deficiency leads to hemolysis under oxidative stress (e.g., after taking certain drugs, infections, or eating fava beans), but it does not typically present with spherocytes. G6PD deficiency usually causes bite cells and blister cells on the peripheral blood smear, not spherocytes D) PNH - Flow cytometry: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disorder of red blood cells characterized by hemolysis and thrombosis, but it typically presents with hemoglobinuria (dark urine, especially after waking up) and does not feature spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Flow cytometry is used to detect deficiencies of GPI-anchored proteins in PNH, but this is not the case here",

This condition typically follows an infection with group A Streptococcus and is more common in children. PSGN is characterized by immune complex deposition in the glomeruli, which leads to inflammation and damage to the glomerular filtration barrier.

Other options: A) Subendothelial deposits: These are typically seen in conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis but are not characteristic of PSGN C) Crescent formation: Crescentic glomerulonephritis (also known as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, RPGN) can be seen in various forms of glomerulonephritis, including Goodpasture syndrome or ANCA-associated vasculitis, but crescent formation is not typical of PSGN D) Mesangial deposits: Mesangial deposits can be seen in conditions such as IgA nephropathy or membranous nephropathy, but they are not characteristic of PSGN, which is more classically associated with subepithelial deposits",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Fluid overload Chest discomfort after a blood transfusion, along with bilateral fissural thickening on X-ray, is highly suggestive of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). This condition occurs when the volume of transfused blood exceeds the circulatory capacity of the patient, leading to pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. TACO is more likely when multiple units of blood are transfused within a short period, as in this case (4 units of blood in 2 hours). Other options: A) ABO Incompatibility: This can cause an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, leading to symptoms such as fever, chills, back pain, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria, but chest discomfort and bilateral fissural thickening on X-ray are not typical of ABO incompatibility B) GVHD (Graft-versus-host disease): GVHD occurs when the donor's T lymphocytes attack the recipient's tissues. It can manifest with fever, rash, liver dysfunction, and diarrhea, but pulmonary findings like bilateral fissural thickening are uncommon early in GVHD. It typically presents later, often after a few days C) Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia due to citrate toxicity (from blood transfusions) can cause symptoms such as muscle cramps, tetany, and arrhythmias, but chest discomfort and bilateral fissural thickening on X-ray are not typical features of hypocalcemia",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is not mediated by type 1 hypersensitivity but rather by the inhibition of COX and the subsequent increased leukotriene production The condition described in the patient, who develops wheezing and respiratory distress after taking aspirin, is most likely Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as Aspirin-induced asthma or Samter's triad. It is characterized by Asthma, nasal polyps and Aspirin intolerance or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sensitivity Other options: B) Montelukast can help: Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, is often used in treating AERD as it helps block the effects of leukotrienes, which are increased when COX-1 is inhibited by aspirin C) COX inhibition: AERD is primarily triggered by the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin, leading to increased leukotriene production (since COX-1 is involved in the production of prostaglandins, and without it, the arachidonic acid pathway shunts towards leukotriene production) D) Leukotrienes induced: Increased production of leukotrienes is a key feature of AERD, and these molecules contribute to the bronchoconstriction and inflammation seen in the disease",

Characteristic features include ballooning of cells, multinucleation, and the presence of intranuclear inclusions. These inclusions are often described as \"Cowdry type A inclusions\", which are typical in herpesvirus infections Other options: A) Trichomonas: This infection is associated with the presence of trichomonads (single-celled organisms) on the Pap smear, but not multinucleation or intranuclear inclusions. It may show pear-shaped organisms with a flagellum C) Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of vaginal flora, leading to an increase in gram-variable rods and clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IL-8 is a chemokine that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by promoting neutrophil chemotaxis. This means that IL-8 attracts neutrophils to the site of infection or injury, where they release enzymes and pro-inflammatory mediators, which can exacerbate tissue damage and inflammation Other options: B) Endothelial injury: While IL-8 contributes to inflammation, it does not directly cause endothelial injury. However, neutrophil infiltration (induced by IL-8) can lead to endothelial damage C) Lymphocyte chemotaxis: IL-8 primarily targets neutrophils rather than lymphocytes. Lymphocyte chemotaxis is more typically associated with other chemokines such as IL-2 or RANTES D) Edema: IL-8 contributes to inflammation and neutrophil accumulation, which can exacerbate edema indirectly, but it is not a direct mediator of edema.

The presence of hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions points more towards active multiple myeloma rather than MGUS D) Smouldering myeloma: Smouldering multiple myeloma involves elevated M-protein levels without the organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions) typically seen in active multiple myeloma. The clinical symptoms here suggest active myeloma rather than smouldering",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The image displays two critical histological features that are highly indicative of the early stages of a myocardial infarction: Coagulative Necrosis: This is the characteristic type of cell death in myocardial infarction, where the basic cell outlines are preserved but the nuclei are lost. This morphological change becomes discernible under a light microscope typically within 4-12 hours of irreversible ischemic injury and is well-established by 18-24 hours. The image clearly labels areas showing this feature. Dense Neutrophilic Infiltrate: Neutrophils are the first and most numerous inflammatory cells to migrate into the infarcted area. They begin to appear in significant numbers around 12-24 hours after the onset of ischemia, and by 24 hours (1 day), they form a dense infiltrate throughout the necrotic tissue. The image explicitly labels a \"Dense neutrophilic infiltrate,\" which precisely matches the findings expected at this time point. The simultaneous presence of well-developed coagulative necrosis and a dense neutrophilic infiltrate strongly points to an infarct age of approximately 1 day. Incorrect Options: Option (B. 3-4 days) Explanation: While a dense neutrophilic infiltrate would still be present at 3-4 days, this period also marks the beginning of macrophage infiltration (to clear debris) and the start of granulation tissue formation (fibroblasts and new blood vessels). The image, with its overwhelming neutrophil presence and lack of clear signs of macrophage dominance or early granulation tissue, is less characteristic of 3-4 days compared to 1 day. Option (C. 7 days) Explanation: By 7 days, the histological picture changes significantly. Macrophages would be the predominant inflammatory cell type, actively clearing necrotic debris. More importantly, well-formed granulation tissue (composed of fibroblasts, new capillaries, and chronic inflammatory cells) would be clearly evident, indicating the repair phase. Neutrophils would have largely diminished. The image does not show these features. Option (D. 14 days) Explanation: At 14 days, the healing process is well advanced. The infarct area would largely consist of robust granulation tissue with significant collagen deposition, leading towards scar formation. Acute inflammatory cells like neutrophils would be almost entirely absent, and macrophages would also be less prominent as the debris clearance nears completion. The image clearly shows an acute inflammatory response, not a healing scar.",

Symptoms of celiac disease include diarrhea, weight loss, bloating, and itchy skin lesions (called dermatitis herpetiformis). Dermatitis herpetiformis is strongly associated with celiac disease and presents as a blistering, itchy rash. The gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease, which helps control symptoms and prevent damage to the intestines Other options: B) Whipple disease: This is a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei and typically presents with symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, and joint pain, but does not specifically cause itchy skin lesions C) Abetalipoproteinemia: This is a rare genetic disorder causing malabsorption, lipid deficiencies, and neurologic symptoms, but it does not commonly present with itching or skin lesions D) Tropical sprue: This is a condition caused by an unknown infectious agent, leading to malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss, but it does not typically present with itchy skin lesions",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The patient presents with easy fatigue, and blood tests show decreased hemoglobin, low serum iron, high TIBC (total iron-binding capacity), and low ferritin. These findings are classic for iron deficiency anemia. In iron deficiency anemia, there is a lack of iron available for hemoglobin production, resulting in a low serum iron and low ferritin (which stores iron in the body). The body compensates by increasing the production of transferrin, which results in a high TIBC Other options: B) Sideroblastic anemia: This type of anemia involves impaired incorporation of iron into hemoglobin, but ferritin levels are usually normal or elevated, not low, and TIBC would be normal, not high C) Anemia of chronic disease: In anemia of chronic disease, ferritin is usually normal or elevated, and TIBC is low, opposite to what is seen in this patient D) Thalassemia minor: Thalassemia is typically characterized by microcytic anemia with normal or elevated ferritin levels, and TIBC is usually normal",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that originates from the adrenal medulla and secretes catecholamines, which causes symptoms like hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and sweating. Elevated urinary VMA (vanillylmandelic acid) is a common diagnostic marker for pheochromocytomas. In MEN-2A, pheochromocytomas are often bilateral, and the syndrome is associated with other endocrine abnormalities, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma. This association makes MEN-2A a plausible diagnosis in this case Other options: A) Mostly malignant: Pheochromocytomas are typically benign (85-90% of cases), although a small proportion can be malignant. The histological features and the clinical presentation would help in differentiating malignant from benign cases. Therefore, \"Mostly malignant\" is not true for pheochromocytomas B) Children: Pheochromocytomas are rare in children but can occur, especially in the context of genetic syndromes. However, they are more common in adults, particularly those in their 40s to 50s. So, \"children\" is not the most appropriate answer here C) Bilateral: Bilateral pheochromocytomas are more likely in genetic syndromes such as MEN-2, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, most pheochromocytomas are unilateral, especially in sporadic cases. Bilateral pheochromocytomas would suggest a genetic cause like MEN-2A or VHL",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Serum iron is typically bound to transferrin, a transport protein, and not to apoferritin. Apoferritin is the iron-free form of ferritin, which stores iron inside cells Other options: A) Free iron is toxic: Free iron can catalyze the formation of free radicals, which can cause cellular damage, contributing to oxidative stress. This is why iron in the body is tightly regulated and typically bound to proteins like transferrin or ferritin C) Iron is stored in tissue in the form of ferritin and hemosiderin: Ferritin is the main storage form of iron in tissues, and hemosiderin is a less readily accessible form of iron that forms when ferritin is overloaded. Both are found primarily in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow D) Serum ferritin is the most convenient test for iron stores: Serum ferritin levels are an indicator of the body's iron stores. Low ferritin levels often suggest iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin can indicate iron overload or inflammation",

The negative TdT makes B-lymphoblastic lymphoma less likely C) Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): DLBCL typically presents with large, atypical cells, and positivity for CD19 and CD20, but it also tends to be positive for CD5 in some cases. The histology and immunophenotype in this case do not match DLBCL, which is more heterogeneous in cell size and appearance D) Small lymphoblastic lymphoma: Small lymphoblastic lymphoma typically involves small, mature lymphocytes, with a CD5, CD23, and TdT positivity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) This statement is false, which makes it the correct answer to the question \"Which of the following is false about von Willebrand disease?\" • Type I von Willebrand disease is the most common and usually the mildest form. • It is characterized by a partial quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF). • Most patients have mild to moderate bleeding symptoms, not severe disease. • Therefore, calling Type I \"severe\" is inaccurate, making this the correct choice for a false statement. Incorrect Options: B. Type II is qualitative disorder This statement is true. • Type II vWD is due to a qualitative defect in the structure or function of VWF. • The amount of VWF may be normal or slightly decreased, but it doesn't work properly. • So, this is a correct statement and not the correct answer to the question. C. Type II has severe deficiency of VWF • This statement is somewhat misleading but still generally considered false, because: • Type II is defined by qualitative defects, not a severe quantitative deficiency. • The amount of VWF may be mildly decreased, but not severely deficient like in Type III. However, since this isn't as clearly false as option A, A is still the best choice for the \"false\" statement. D. Type III is severe • This statement is true. • Type III vWD is the rarest and most severe form of the disease. • It involves a near-complete or total deficiency of VWF. • Patients with Type III typically have severe bleeding symptoms, similar to hemophilia. So this is a correct statement, and not the correct answer to the question.",
