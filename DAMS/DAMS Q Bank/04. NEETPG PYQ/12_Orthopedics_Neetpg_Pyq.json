      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Paralysis is typically a late sign of compartment syndrome, indicating severe nerve damage due to prolonged elevated pressure in the affected compartment. By the time paralysis occurs, irreversible ischemia and nerve injury have often taken place, making this a sign of a more advanced stage of compartment syndrome. Option A. Pallor: Pallor can appear early in compartment syndrome, as decreased blood flow causes the affected area to lose its normal color. It may happen before pulselessness or paralysis and is an important early indicator. Option B. Pulselessness: While pulselessness may occur in severe cases of compartment syndrome, it is not a reliable sign. In fact, pulse may still be palpable in early stages of compartment syndrome, and it is possible to have a pulse even with elevated compartment pressures. Thus, pulselessness should not be used alone for diagnosis. Option D. Pain on passive stretch: This is one of the earliest and most specific signs of compartment syndrome. The pain arises because of muscle ischemia when the muscles are stretched due to increased pressure in the compartment. It’s a critical finding for early detection and intervention.",
