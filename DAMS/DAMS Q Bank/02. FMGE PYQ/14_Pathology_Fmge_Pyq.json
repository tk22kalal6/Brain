      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The histopathology (HPE) image shows thyroid cells with abundant pink (eosinophilic) cytoplasm, which are characteristic of Hurthle cells, also known as oncocytic cells. These cells are seen in follicular thyroid carcinoma, particularly in its Hurthle cell variant. Hurthle cells are large epithelial cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm due to numerous mitochondria. This variant tends to be more aggressive and may show vascular or capsular invasion. The presence of a solitary thyroid nodule in an elderly female and these HPE findings strongly point toward follicular carcinoma. Incorrect Option: A. Medullary Thyroid Cancer Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid arises from parafollicular C cells and often shows amyloid deposits in the stroma on histology. The tumor cells are typically spindle-shaped or polygonal and do not have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Medullary carcinoma is also associated with elevated calcitonin levels, which is not discussed here. Incorrect Option: C. Anaplastic Cancer Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a highly aggressive tumor that typically shows pleomorphic, undifferentiated giant cells or spindle cells with marked nuclear atypia. It lacks the eosinophilic Hurthle cells shown in this image and usually presents in elderly individuals with a rapidly enlarging neck mass. Incorrect Option: D. Papillary Cancer Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common thyroid cancer and typically shows Orphan Annie eye nuclei, nuclear grooves, and psammoma bodies on histology. It is not characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm as seen in Hurthle cells and usually presents with multifocal disease and lymphatic spread.",

The provided microscopic image displays a benign biphasic tumor characterized by the proliferation of both glandular epithelial and stromal components. A classic feature visible is the intracanalicular pattern, where the proliferating stroma compresses and distorts the ducts into slit-like or elongated structures, as clearly outlined in the image. This distinct histological arrangement is highly characteristic of a fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast lesion. Malignant conditions like Invasive Ductal Carcinoma or Lobular Breast Cancer would show clear signs of cellular atypia, invasion, and different architectural patterns not present here.",
