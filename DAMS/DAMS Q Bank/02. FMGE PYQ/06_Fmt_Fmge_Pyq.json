      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)Cocaine bugs This term describes the tactile hallucination or false sensation of insects crawling on or under the skin. It is a classic sign of cocaine-induced psychosis, but it occurs later in the course of cocaine toxicity or with chronic use — not during the stage of excitement. The stage of excitement refers to the early phase of acute poisoning, which is primarily dominated by stimulant effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic overdrive. Therefore, formication is not a feature of the excitement stage, making it the correct exception.Incorrect Options: Option A: Feeling of wellbeingThis is a typical and early symptom of cocaine use due to the drug's action on the dopaminergic pathways in the brain. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, leading to a sense of euphoria, confidence, and general wellbeing. Hence, this is a correct feature of the stage of excitement and not the correct answer to the question.Option B: Tingling or numbness in hands and feetParesthesia is a recognized effect of cocaine, especially in the acute setting. It may result from local vasoconstriction or direct neurotoxic effects. Users may report numbness or tingling in their extremities during the early excitement phase, especially if they have taken large doses. Therefore, this symptom does occur in the stage of excitement and is not the correct exception.Option C: Pupils dilated and rapid pulse and sweatingThese are classic signs of sympathetic nervous system activation, which is characteristic of the excitement phase of acute cocaine toxicity. Cocaine stimulates alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to mydriasis (dilated pupils), tachycardia, and excessive sweating. Thus, this option is a correct manifestation of the excitement phase.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)BurkingBurking, which is a specific form of homicidal smothering combined with traumatic asphyxia. It involves two simultaneous mechanisms: smothering the victim by blocking the nose and mouth, and compression of the chest or abdomen, preventing respiratory movements. This method was named after the infamous criminal Burke, who used this technique to kill victims quietly without leaving obvious external injuries. Because both smothering (airway obstruction) and traumatic asphyxia (chest compression) are used, death results from asphyxia due to a dual mechanism, making Burking the correct answer.Incorrect Options:Option B: BansdolaThis is a traditional method of torture or punishment in some cultures, involving forcible stretching of the limbs. It does not cause death due to smothering or traumatic asphyxia, but rather due to pain, shock, or other traumatic complications. Hence, this is incorrect.Option C: MuggingMugging refers to a violent street robbery, which may involve assault, strangulation, or blunt trauma. While it can involve asphyxia if strangulation is used, it does not specifically involve the combined mechanism of smothering and chest compression, so it is not the correct answer.Option D: GarrottingGarrotting involves ligature strangulation, where a cord or similar object is used to constrict the neck. This leads to asphyxia by strangulation, but not smothering or traumatic asphyxia due to chest compression, which is specific to Burking. Hence, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC)Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC). TTC is a vital stain commonly used during autopsy to detect myocardial infarction (MI). This stain helps in differentiating viable from non-viable myocardial tissue. Living myocardial cells with intact dehydrogenase enzymes reduce TTC to a red formazan pigment, turning the viable tissue brick-red. Infarcted or necrotic areas, where enzyme activity is lost, do not stain and appear pale or whitish. Thus, TTC stain is extremely useful in identifying recent myocardial infarctions, especially within the first few hours post-mortem when gross changes are not yet visible.Incorrect options:Option B: Congo RedCongo red is used to stain amyloid deposits, which appear apple-green birefringent under polarized light. It is not used for detecting myocardial infarction, hence this is incorrect.Option C: Oil Red OOil Red O is a fat stain used for detecting neutral lipids in frozen sections, commonly in conditions like fat embolism. It does not highlight infarcted myocardium, so this option is incorrect.Option D: Barberio’s testBarberio’s test is a chemical test used in forensic medicine to detect semen by identifying spermine.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Deferoxamine mesylateThe child presents with classic signs of acute iron poisoning, a potentially life-threatening condition commonly seen in pediatric accidental ingestions. Iron is directly corrosive to the gastrointestinal mucosa and can lead to hemorrhagic gastritis, shock, metabolic acidosis, and multi-organ dysfunction. In such cases, the preferred treatment is Deferoxamine mesylate, a chelating agent that binds to free iron (Fe³?) in the bloodstream forming ferrioxamine, which is water-soluble and renally excreted. This not only helps eliminate toxic levels of iron but also reduces further tissue damage. Deferoxamine is indicated when serum iron levels exceed 500 µg/dL or when clinical signs of systemic toxicity (shock, acidosis, lethargy) are present, as in this case.Incorrect Options:B. PenicillaminePenicillamine is a chelating agent, but it is primarily used for copper toxicity (as in Wilson’s disease) and has no role in acute iron poisoning. It does not effectively bind to iron and therefore provides no therapeutic benefit in this case.C. BAL (British Anti-Lewisite or Dimercaprol)BAL is another chelating agent, but it is mainly used in arsenic, mercury, and lead poisoning. It does not effectively chelate iron and is contraindicated in iron poisoning because it can actually increase toxicity by mobilizing intracellular iron.D. Activated charcoalWhile activated charcoal is used in many toxic ingestions, it is ineffective for iron poisoning because iron does not bind well to charcoal. Hence, it does not reduce iron absorption and has no role in its management.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Oral evidenceWhen a public witness is ordered by the court to appear and give testimony in person, the type of evidence he provides is known as oral evidence. As per Section 59 and 60 of the Indian Evidence Act, all facts, except contents of documents or electronic records, may be proved by oral evidence. Oral evidence refers to the direct testimony of a witness in court about what they have personally seen, heard, or perceived.Such evidence is direct and based on the personal knowledge or observation of the witness, making it primary evidence, especially in criminal cases where eyewitness testimony plays a major role.Incorrect Options:B. Hearsay evidenceHearsay refers to secondhand information: something a witness has not personally seen or heard but learned from someone else. Courts generally do not admit hearsay evidence, as it's unreliable unless it falls under exceptions provided in the law (e.g., dying declaration).C. SubpoenaA subpoena is a legal order issued by the court compelling someone to attend and testify.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)Cadaveric spaszThe description in the question refers to cadaveric spasm, also known as instantaneous rigor or instantaneous stiffening. It is a rare phenomenon in which certain muscles go into immediate stiffening at the moment of death, without any initial period of relaxation.It typically occurs in cases of sudden, violent death, especially when there is intense emotion or physical struggle before death — such as someone trying to save themselves. It usually involves voluntary muscles that were in active use at the time of death (commonly muscles of the hand, such as gripping a weapon or an object).This phenomenon helps forensic experts infer the manner of death, e.g., suicide vs. homicide, or whether the deceased was holding something at the moment of death.Incorrect Options:A. Rigor mortisRigor mortis is the postmortem stiffening of muscles due to ATP depletion and formation of actin-myosin cross-bridges. It occurs after a primary relaxation phase, typically starting 1–2 hours after death, and peaks at around 12 hours. Unlike cadaveric spasm, it does not appear immediately and affects all muscles progressively, not selectively.C. Algor mortisThis refers to the cooling of the body after death due to cessation of metabolic activity. It has no relation to muscle contraction or stiffness.D. Livor mortisAlso called postmortem hypostasis, this is the settling of blood in dependent parts of the body after circulation ceases, causing purplish discoloration.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Mc Naughten ruleThe statement in the question is a direct reflection of the Mc Naughten Rule, which is the most widely recognized legal test for criminal responsibility due to insanity.According to the Mc Naughten Rule (1843, UK):\"To establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act, the accused was suffering from such a defect of reason, due to disease of the mind, that he either did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.\"This rule focuses entirely on the cognitive ability of the accused — whether they understood:What they were doing, andThat it was wrong (legally or morally)In India, this rule forms the basis of Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which provides immunity from criminal liability to a person of unsound mind under these conditions.Incorrect Options:B. Durham RuleAlso known as the \"Product Rule\", it states that a person is not criminally responsible if their unlawful act was the product of a mental disease or defect. It was used in the U.S. for a short time but is considered too broad and has been largely abandoned.C. Curren's RuleThis rule combines elements of the Mc Naughten Rule and the Irresistible Impulse Test. It adds the requirement that the person lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality or conform conduct to the law. However, this is not the principle behind the given statement.D. Irresistible Impulse TestThis test focuses on the volitional component — the inability to control one’s actions due to mental illness, even if the person understands that the act is wrong. The question emphasizes lack of understanding, not lack of control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)SuperimpositionSuperimposition is a forensic technique used to establish the identity of skeletal remains—particularly the skull—by overlaying antemortem photographs (photos taken when the person was alive) onto the recovered skull image. In the given scenario, police recovered a beheaded skull and relatives provided a photograph of the missing person. Superimposition allows forensic experts to match anatomical landmarks of the skull (such as the orbits, nasal aperture, and jawline) with those seen in the photograph to determine if the skull likely belonged to the missing individual. This method is especially useful when only skeletal remains are available and soft tissue features are missing. While it is not as definitive as DNA analysis, it can provide strong presumptive evidence of identity, particularly when other methods are not possible or are unavailable.Incorrect OptionsOption A: Fingerprint Fingerprint analysis is used to identify individuals based on unique ridge patterns on their fingers. In this case, only a beheaded skull bone is available, which does not contain any fingerprints. Hence, this method is not applicable.Option B: DNA fingerprintDNA fingerprinting is indeed a powerful tool for identification, particularly when biological tissues like hair, bone marrow, or teeth are available. However, the question focuses on matching a skull to a photograph, which is best suited for superimposition. While DNA could be an alternative, it requires comparison with a biological sample from relatives, not just a photograph.Option D: Cheiloscopy Cheiloscopy is the study of lip prints, used for identification when clear lip impressions are available. Since a skull bone does not preserve soft tissues like lips, cheiloscopy cannot be used in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)Executive MagistrateIn cases of death occurring in police custody, the inquest must be conducted by an Executive Magistrate under Section 176(1A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973. This special provision was added to ensure an independent and impartial inquiry in such sensitive cases, where there could be potential conflict of interest if the investigation were conducted by the police themselves. The Executive Magistrate, being a government-appointed authority independent of the police force, ensures transparency and accountability in investigating custodial deaths. This step is crucial in upholding human rights and maintaining public trust in the justice system. Incorrect OptionsOption A: Jail Superintendent The jail superintendent is responsible for the internal management of prison affairs but is not authorized to conduct inquests into deaths, especially those that occur in police custody (outside jail premises). Even for deaths in judicial custody (i.e., within prison), the inquest is still conducted by a magistrate.Option C: Police Inspector While police officers can conduct inquests under Section 174 of CrPC for general unnatural deaths, in cases involving death in police custody, they are disqualified due to the potential for bias. Hence, the responsibility shifts to the Executive Magistrate under Section 176(1A) CrPC.Option D: Superintendent of Police Though a senior police officer, the Superintendent of Police (SP) does not have the statutory authority to conduct an inquest. The SP may supervise investigations or administrative proceedings but is not legally empowered to carry out an inquest into custodial deaths.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)LacerationLacerations are blunt force injuries that occur when the skin, underlying tissues, or organs are torn due to trauma. One of the key forensic features of lacerations is the crushing and stretching of tissues surrounding the wound, including hair bulbs if present in the injured area. In scalp injuries, for example, lacerations may cause damage to hair follicles, resulting in crushed or avulsed hair bulbs. The edges of lacerations are typically irregular, bruised, and abraded, which helps distinguish them from sharp force injuries. This type of wound reflects the involvement of blunt trauma rather than a sharp cutting instrument.Incorrect Options: A: Abrasion Abrasions involve only the superficial layers of the skin and are caused by friction against a rough surface. They do not penetrate deep enough to damage hair bulbs or deeper structures. Crushed hair bulbs would not be a feature of abrasion.C: Stab Injury Stab wounds are caused by a pointed object penetrating the body deeper than it is wide. These are sharp force injuries, usually with clean-cut margins and no crushing of tissues or hair bulbs. The damage is precise and localized, not blunt or crushing.D: IncisionIncised wounds are made by sharp-edged instruments like knives or razors and are characterized by clean-cut edges without tissue bridging or crushing. Hair bulbs in the path of an incised wound are cleanly cut, not crushed or damaged, making this inconsistent with the finding in the question.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Atropine with NeostigmineThe clinical features described — ptosis (drooping of eyelids), respiratory difficulty, and dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) — are signs of neurotoxic envenomation, commonly seen with cobra bites. Despite administration of Anti-venom (AV), neurotoxic symptoms may persist or worsen, as the AV neutralizes only circulating venom but does not reverse the action of venom already bound to neuromuscular junctions.In such situations, Atropine with Neostigmine is used as a form of anticholinesterase therapy, especially when ventilator support is unavailable. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, increasing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, potentially improving muscle strength including those of respiration. Atropine is co-administered to counteract muscarinic side effects of neostigmine (like bradycardia, excessive secretions). This combination serves as a symptomatic and supportive measure in neurotoxic snakebite envenomation when ICU and ventilator facilities are not accessible.Incorrect Options A: Nebulizer with Salbutamol Salbutamol is a bronchodilator used in obstructive airway diseases like asthma or COPD. It has no role in treating neuromuscular paralysis caused by neurotoxic venom. The respiratory difficulty here is not due to bronchospasm but due to diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle paralysis.C: Antihistamines Antihistamines may be used to treat allergic reactions to anti-venom but do not address neurotoxicity or improve respiratory muscle weakness. They have no curative or supportive role in neurotoxic snake envenomation symptoms.D: IV Hydrocortisone Steroids like hydrocortisone are used for inflammatory or allergic reactions, including serum sickness or AV reactions. However, they do not reverse neurotoxic effects of cobra venom or improve neuromuscular transmission.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)MorphineThe clinical signs described — respiratory depression (R 8/min), bradycardia (pulse 52/min), hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg), and pinpoint pupils (miosis) — are classic features of opioid poisoning, with morphine being a prototypical opioid. Opioids act on µ-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, leading to CNS depression, respiratory center suppression, and parasympathetic overactivity, which collectively cause the observed signs. Pinpoint pupils (miosis) are particularly characteristic and often considered a hallmark of opioid toxicity unless hypoxia progresses to a point where pupils become dilated. Therefore, based on the overall toxidrome, morphine or opioid overdose is the most likely cause.Incorrect Options:B: Cocaine Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant, not a depressant. It causes tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils (mydriasis), agitation, and hyperthermia, which are opposite to the symptoms described in this case.C: Alcohol Alcohol is a CNS depressant and can cause bradycardia and hypotension. However, it does not cause pinpoint pupils. Additionally, severe respiratory depression is less likely unless blood alcohol levels are extremely high.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) EDTAIn lead poisoning, the choice of chelating agent depends on the blood lead level and clinical severity. A lead level of 60 mcg/100 ml (or 60 µg/dL) is considered moderate to severe toxicity, and the preferred treatment in such cases is Calcium Disodium EDTA (CaNa?EDTA). EDTA is administered intravenously and binds to lead in the blood and tissues, forming a water-soluble complex that is excreted via urine. It is especially used when blood lead levels exceed 50–70 µg/dL, or in symptomatic patients. Prompt chelation with EDTA helps prevent long-term complications like nephropathy, encephalopathy, and developmental delays in children.Incorrect Options: B: DMSA DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid), also known as succimer, is an oral chelator preferred for mild to moderate lead poisoning (generally C: EDTA + DMSA This combination may be considered in some complicated or refractory cases but is not standard first-line treatment for a lead level of 60 µg/dL. Monotherapy with EDTA is generally sufficient and preferred.D: Penicillamine Penicillamine is used in the chelation of copper (as in Wilson’s disease) and has some use in heavy metal poisoning, but it is not the drug of choice for lead poisoning, particularly at this blood level. It has more side effects and is less effective compared to EDTA.",

A leading question is one that suggests the answer within the question itself — for example, “You saw him leave the room at 10 p.m., didn’t you?” In cross-examination, the goal is to test the accuracy, credibility, and consistency of the witness’s testimony, often from the opposing side. Because the witness is presumed to be hostile or at least not favorable to the cross-examiner, courts allow leading questions to extract precise answers, highlight contradictions, or challenge their statements effectively.Incorrect Options A: Chief Examination In chief (or direct) examination, leading questions are not allowed, except in very limited circumstances (like introductory matters or undisputed facts), because the witness is expected to give testimony in their own words, and the lawyer calling the witness should not suggest answers.C: Re-examination Re-examination is conducted to clarify points raised during cross-examination, and leading questions are not allowed during re-examination, as it is also conducted by the party that originally called the witness.D: Re and Cross Examination both Leading questions are only allowed in cross-examination, not in re-examination.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)VesiclesArtificial bruises are not true bruises (contusions) but are deliberately produced skin lesions, often for malingering or deceptive purposes. They are commonly created by applying irritants like chili paste, garlic, or blistering agents to the skin. These substances cause local inflammation and vesicle (blister) formation, which mimic the appearance of real bruises to the untrained eye. The presence of vesicles, especially without the typical features of natural bruising (like color changes due to hemoglobin breakdown), points toward an artificial origin. Artificial bruises often appear superficial and sharply demarcated due to topical application.Incorrect Options A: Extravasation Extravasation of blood into the tissues is a hallmark of true bruises (contusions), caused by blunt trauma. It does not occur in artificial bruises, as no blood vessels are ruptured.C: Colour change Natural bruises change color over time (red ? blue/purple ? green ? yellow) due to hemoglobin breakdown. Artificial bruises do not show this typical color progression, which helps in differentiating them from real ones.D: Erythema at the site While erythema (redness) may be present in both natural and artificial injuries due to irritation, it is a nonspecific finding and not a defining feature of artificial bruises.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Carbon MonoxideCarbon monoxide (CO) has the highest affinity for hemoglobin, approximately 210 to 250 times greater than that of oxygen. This strong affinity allows CO to bind tightly and preferentially to the heme sites in hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). Once bound, it prevents oxygen from binding and also interferes with the release of any oxygen already bound, leading to tissue hypoxia. Even small concentrations of CO can significantly reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, making it highly toxic and potentially fatal. Incorrect Options B: OxygenOxygen is the natural ligand for hemoglobin and binds reversibly to form oxyhemoglobin, allowing for oxygen transport. However, its affinity is much lower than carbon monoxide’s.C: Nitrogen Nitrogen is an inert gas and does not bind appreciably to hemoglobin under normal physiological conditions. It is the major component of air but plays no direct role in gas transport by hemoglobin.D: Carbon Dioxide Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin at a different site than oxygen — the amino terminal of globin chains, forming carbaminohemoglobin. Its affinity is much lower than that of carbon monoxide and oxygen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)24 weeks of pregnancyAs per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, the legal upper limit for abortion in India was extended from 20 weeks to 24 weeks for certain categories of women. These include rape survivors, incest victims, minors, women with physical or mental disabilities, and cases involving fetal anomalies. For abortions between 20 to 24 weeks, the law requires the opinion of two registered medical practitioners who must certify that the continuation of pregnancy would pose a risk to the woman’s physical or mental health or that there is a substantial fetal abnormality. This change aimed to make abortion services more accessible and equitable, especially for vulnerable groups.Incorrect Options A: 10 weeks of pregnancy While abortion is allowed up to 10 weeks, this is not the upper legal limit. Abortions are legally permitted much beyond this duration under the amended Act, so selecting 10 weeks underestimates the permissible limit.B: 12 weeks of pregnancy This was part of the earlier framework under the MTP Act, 1971, but it has been revised. Currently, abortions are permitted up to 20 weeks with one doctor’s opinion and 24 weeks for specific cases with two doctors' opinions.C: 20 weeks of pregnancy Although 20 weeks was the previous upper limit, the 2021 amendment extended this to 24 weeks for eligible categories.

In this case, although the money was not handed directly by the radiologist, it was sent via someone known to the radiologist, indicating a gratification in return for patient referral, which constitutes medical dichotomy. This is considered unethical and is prohibited by the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, as it compromises the integrity of clinical decision-making. Incorrect OptionsA: Drs should be punished under law While the act is unethical and punishable under medical ethics regulations, the term describing the situation is not \"punishment under law\" — the correct terminology is medical dichotomy. Also, legal action may vary based on jurisdiction and severity.C: Association of a Dr This option is vague and does not describe any unethical or professional misconduct.

It occurs immediately at the moment of death, bypassing the usual primary muscle relaxation. Cadaveric spasm typically involves voluntary muscles that were in intense use or contraction just before death (e.g., during struggle or trauma), and it preserves the exact position of those muscles at the moment of death.This phenomenon is commonly associated with violent or sudden deaths, especially those involving strong emotions or physical struggle, such as homicides or combat-related deaths. The presence of foreign material like grass or soil in a clenched hand may be crucial forensic evidence pointing to the scene of death or the victim's final actions.Incorrect Options:A: Suicide While cadaveric spasm can occur in suicides, it is more frequently observed in homicides or violent deaths due to the suddenness and muscular activity involved.B: Homicide Although cadaveric spasm is frequently seen in homicide, the question is asking for the name of the condition, not the manner of death.

It refers to a temporary improvement in a patient's condition after an initial loss of consciousness, followed by a subsequent deterioration. Typically, after trauma (often involving fracture of the temporal bone and tearing of the middle meningeal artery), the patient may lose consciousness briefly, regain it (the lucid interval), and then deteriorate as the hematoma expands and raises intracranial pressure.This interval can be misleading and dangerous if early signs are not recognized and treated surgically. Lucid interval is considered pathognomonic of EDH.Incorrect OptionsB. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH) In SDH, bleeding is usually due to rupture of bridging veins, and symptoms tend to develop gradually. A lucid interval can occur but is less common and less well-defined than in EDH. The clinical picture is often one of progressive neurological decline rather than a clear lucid interval.C. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) SAH typically presents with a sudden, severe headache (\"thunderclap headache\") and rapid loss of consciousness in severe cases. Lucid intervals are not characteristic.D. Intracerebral Hemorrhage This involves bleeding within the brain parenchyma, usually due to hypertension or trauma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The patient's presentation with lacrimation (tearing), diarrhea, congested eyes, tachycardia (fast heart rate), and hypertension (high blood pressure) is a classic constellation of symptoms seen in opioid withdrawal, which includes opium withdrawal. Opioids (like opium) are central nervous system depressants. When an individual dependent on opioids ceases or significantly reduces their intake, the body experiences a rebound hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system. This sympathetic overactivity manifests as: • Lacrimation, rhinorrhea (runny nose), sweating: These are 'wet' symptoms, indicative of parasympathetic activation or sympathetic overactivity causing increased secretions. • Diarrhea, abdominal cramps: Due to increased gastrointestinal motility. • Congested eyes: Vascular congestion from autonomic dysregulation. • Tachycardia and Hypertension: Direct signs of sympathetic nervous system activation. Other common opioid withdrawal symptoms include myalgia (muscle aches), arthralgia (joint pain), piloerection (\"goosebumps\"), yawning, nausea, vomiting, and severe dysphoria. The combination of these specific symptoms strongly points towards opioid withdrawal. Incorrect Options: A. Cocaine withdrawal: Cocaine is a stimulant. Withdrawal from cocaine typically presents with symptoms opposite to the acute effects of the drug, primarily characterized by a \"crash\" which includes fatigue, increased appetite, hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), severe depression, psychomotor retardation, and vivid unpleasant dreams. It does not typically cause lacrimation, diarrhea, tachycardia, or hypertension as primary withdrawal symptoms; rather, the cardiovascular parameters might normalize or even decrease slightly from the chronic stimulant effects. B. Cannabis withdrawal: Withdrawal from cannabis, while increasingly recognized, is generally less severe and life-threatening than opioid or alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms typically include irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances (insomnia, vivid dreams), decreased appetite, depression, and some physical symptoms like abdominal pain, tremors, and sweating. It generally does not cause pronounced lacrimation, severe diarrhea, or significant hypertension and tachycardia as core features. D. Datura poisoning: Datura (Jimsonweed) contains anticholinergic alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, hyoscyamine). Poisoning with Datura would present with an anticholinergic toxidrome, which is characterized by symptoms opposite to those seen in this patient: dry mouth, dry skin, dilated pupils (mydriasis), blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, hyperthermia, confusion, delirium, and tachycardia. The patient's symptoms of lacrimation and diarrhea are directly opposite to the effects of Datura poisoning, making this option incorrect.",

It works by:Inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, thereby preventing the formation of toxic metabolites.It is safe, effective, and preferred over ethanol (an older alternative antidote)Incorrect Options:B. FlumazenilIt is a benzodiazepine antagonist, used to reverse the effects of drugs like diazepam or lorazepam.It has no role in methanol poisoning.C. N-acetyl cysteine This is the antidote for paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning.It restores glutathione and prevents liver damage, but is irrelevant in methanol toxicity.D. Naloxone Naloxone is an opioid antagonist, used in morphine, heroin, or other opioid overdoses.Methanol is not an opioid, so naloxone has no therapeutic use here.",

Blood in this space becomes diffusely distributed over the brain's surface and mixes with CSF. During autopsy, this hemorrhage is not easily washed away with a stream of water due to its infiltration into the sulci, cisterns, and CSF pathways.This feature helps differentiate SAH from other types of hemorrhage. It is often associated with rupture of a berry aneurysm or trauma. The persistent staining of the brain surface is a hallmark of SAH.Incorrect Options:A. Extradural (epidural) hemorrhage Occurs between the skull and dura mater, usually from trauma to the middle meningeal artery.Blood is localized and can easily be removed during autopsy as it doesn't infiltrate brain tissues.B. Subdural hemorrhage Located between the dura and arachnoid mater.Blood is typically clotted and confined, and can be easily washed or peeled off the brain surface during autopsy.D. Intraventricular hemorrhage Occurs inside the ventricular system.The blood may mix with CSF and may be partially washed away, though not as easily visible as SAH staining.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)Bumper fractureA bumper fracture is a classic injury seen in pedestrian accidents, especially when a person (often a child or adult) is hit by a moving car while crossing the road.The bumper of the car strikes the lower limb, most commonly the tibia, leading to a fracture of the tibial condyle or shaft.It is called a “bumper fracture” because the injury occurs at the level where the car bumper typically strikes the leg.In children, the height of the bumper often aligns with the lower extremities, increasing the likelihood of this type of injury during a car accident. Incorrect Options:A. Dashboard fracture This occurs when the knee strikes the dashboard in a vehicle collision.It usually leads to a posterior dislocation of the hip or fracture of the posterior acetabulum.Common in car occupants, not pedestrians.C. Undertaker's fracture It refers to postmortem fracture of the cervical spine due to handling of the body after death.It is not related to road traffic accidents or living injuries.D. Jefferson’s fracture This is a burst fracture of the atlas (C1 vertebra), typically caused by axial loading (e.g., diving into shallow water).Not related to being hit by a car.",

Doctor treating the patient A doctor cannot give consent on behalf of the patient. They can only provide medical advice and opinion, not act as a substitute for legal consent.C. Husband/Partner As per the MTP Act, spousal or partner consent is not required for abortion decisions. The woman’s consent (or her legal guardian’s, if mentally challenged) is paramount.D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)Use sling or splint for right lower limb immobilizationIn a suspected snake bite, the first and most crucial step in management is immobilization of the affected limb to slow the spread of venom through the lymphatic system. This is particularly important in cases where the bite appears mild and systemic signs have not yet developed.Immobilization is achieved using a sling or splint, keeping the limb below the level of the heart.The patient should be kept calm and still to minimize systemic absorption.This approach buys time before the administration of antivenom or further assessment.This is the cornerstone of pre-antivenom first aid recommended by WHO and national snakebite protocols. Incorrect Options:A. Give antivenom Antivenom is not the first immediate step; it is indicated only when systemic envenomation signs appear (e.g., ptosis, neurotoxicity, coagulopathy, shock). In this case, there are local symptoms only (pain, swelling, fang marks).Also, antivenom administration requires close monitoring for allergic reactions, so it's done after proper evaluation in a hospital setup.B. Look for dead snake brought by relatives Identification of the snake can help, but should not delay management.Often, the snake isn’t available or the species is misidentified, and management is based on clinical signs of envenomation, not identification alone.D. Suctioning of venom This is an outdated and harmful practice.Suctioning (either by mouth or mechanical devices) is ineffective and can cause local tissue damage or increase infection risk.",

For this purpose, the blood sample must be preserved properly to prevent post-collection fermentation or degradation of alcohol, which may lead to false readings.Sodium fluoride is the preservative of choice for blood in suspected alcohol cases because:It inhibits glycolysis, the process by which glucose is broken down by red blood cells and microorganisms, which can produce ethanol postmortem, leading to false-positive alcohol levels.It acts as an antimicrobial agent, preventing bacterial growth that might alter alcohol concentration.The usual concentration used is 1-2% sodium fluorid Incorrect Options:A. Sodium chloride It is not a preservative, only used in some cases for maintaining osmolarity or as a diluent.It does not prevent alcohol degradation or microbial action.C. Formalin Formalin is a tissue fixative (formaldehyde solution) used for histopathology, not for preserving blood.It would destroy alcohol content and interfere with toxicological testing.D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Precipitin testThe Precipitin test is a serological test used in forensic science to determine the species origin of a blood or tissue sample, including bone fragments. It is especially useful when only skeletal remains are available, and the question arises whether the bones are human or animal.This test is based on the principle of antigen-antibody reaction.Antisera specific to human proteins (usually from animals like rabbits sensitized with human serum) will form a visible precipitate when mixed with human proteins.If the bone extract causes a precipitin line with anti-human serum, it confirms that the sample is human.It is highly specific and sensitive, making it a valuable tool in forensic anthropology and medicolegal investigations. Incorrect Options:B. Acid phosphatase test Used to detect semen, particularly in sexual assault cases.It is not species-specific and does not differentiate human from animal bones.C. Phenolphthalein test Also called the Kastle-Meyer test, it is a presumptive test for blood, detecting the presence of peroxidase activity.It does not differentiate species, and cannot be used for bones specifically.D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Legal guardianIn cases where a pregnant woman is mentally challenged, she may not possess the legal capacity to provide informed consent for medical procedures, including Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP). As per the MTP Act 1971, and its latest amendment in 2021, Section 3(4) clearly outlines that if the pregnant woman is either below 18 years of age or is mentally ill or mentally incapacitated, the written consent of her legal guardian is mandatory for termination of pregnancy. This is in accordance with the principle of substituted decision-making, where a legally authorized person makes decisions in the best interest of the person lacking mental capacity. Hence, in the scenario of a 22-year-old mentally challenged female, option A (Legal guardian) is the correct answer.Incorrect OptionsB: Doctor treating the patientIncorrect. While a doctor assesses the medical eligibility for MTP and provides certification, the treating doctor cannot act as a legal proxy for consent. The doctor requires valid, legal consent from either the woman herself (if mentally sound) or her guardian.C: Husband/partnerIncorrect. As per the MTP Act, consent from the husband or partner is not legally required or sufficient for MTP. The decision-making authority lies entirely with the woman, or in cases where she is mentally incapacitated, with her legal guardian — not the partner or spouse.D: Patient’s own consentIncorrect in this context. Although normally a 22-year-old woman would be legally eligible to give consent, this individual is mentally challenged, indicating a lack of capacity to give valid informed consent. Therefore, her consent is not considered legally adequate, and guardian consent is necessary.",

As per Rule 9 of the MTP Rules, every approved abortion center is legally required to submit monthly reports of MTP procedures carried out to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the district. Failure to send these reports constitutes a breach of legal obligation, and is considered a punishable offence under the Act. The objective is to maintain proper monitoring, prevent misuse, and uphold records for legal and public health surveillance. Therefore, not sending monthly statements to the CMO is a direct violation of the Act, making Option D the correct and punishable offence.Incorrect Options A: MTP done at a government authorized centerIncorrect. Performing MTP at an approved center is legally permitted and encouraged for safety and standardization. There is no offence if MTP is done at a government-authorized center.B: Done by experienced RMPIncorrect. The Act mandates that MTP should be performed only by a Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) with requisite experience and qualifications. An experienced RMP performing MTP is compliant with the law, not punishable.C: MTP done upto 24 weeks of pregnancyIncorrect. The 2021 amendment expanded the upper gestation limit to 24 weeks for certain categories of women (e.g., survivors of rape, incest, minors, differently-abled women, etc.), based on the opinion of two RMPs. Hence, MTP up to 24 weeks under legal indication is permissible and not an offence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)Opinion of two doctors has to be takenAs per the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, the permissible gestational age for medical termination has been increased to 24 weeks for certain special categories of women — including survivors of rape, minors, differently-abled women, and women whose marital status changes during pregnancy (widow/divorcee).While failure of contraceptive is a valid ground for MTP under the Act, it only applies up to 20 weeks of gestation and typically requires the opinion of one RMP. However, since the pregnancy in this case is 22 weeks, two RMPs must examine and give a concurrent opinion that continuing the pregnancy would pose a risk to the woman’s physical or mental health, even if the ground is contraceptive failure.Therefore, Option C is correct — for MTP between 20–24 weeks, the law mandates the opinion of two Registered Medical Practitioners, even in cases of contraceptive failure, if the woman fits the eligible category.Incorrect Options A: One doctor's opinion is sufficientIncorrect. One doctor’s opinion is allowed only up to 20 weeks of gestation. Since the pregnancy here is beyond 20 weeks (22 weeks), this rule does not apply.B: Termination can be done on court orderIncorrect. Court permission is generally required only beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy, especially in cases of fetal anomalies or other extraordinary circumstances. For 22 weeks, statutory provisions apply, not court intervention.D: MTP cannot be doneIncorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Use sling or splint for right lower limb immobilizationThe first and immediate step in managing a snakebite victim is to immobilize the affected limb. This helps reduce the systemic spread of venom by slowing lymphatic and venous return from the site of the bite. Immobilization is done using a splint or sling, similar to how a fracture is managed. This is part of first-aid and pre-hospital care, which is crucial before administering specific treatment like antivenom.In this case, since the patient presents with mild symptoms (pain, swelling, bleeding), and no systemic signs of envenomation (like neurotoxicity or coagulopathy), the priority is to immobilize the limb and monitor closely.Incorrect OptionsA: Give antivenomIncorrect as the immediate step. Antivenom is given only if systemic signs of envenomation are present, such as bleeding, neuroparalysis, hypotension, etc. Mild local symptoms alone do not justify immediate antivenom administration without proper evaluation.B: Look for dead snake brought by relativesIncorrect. While identification of the snake can be helpful for species-specific management, it is not the immediate clinical priority. Moreover, treatment is largely symptom-based, especially in settings where the species is uncertain.D: Suctioning of venomIncorrect. Suctioning is not recommended and is considered harmful.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (BSodium fluorideSodium fluoride is the preservative of choice when collecting blood samples for toxicological analysis, especially in suspected cases of alcohol abuse or poisoning.The main reason is that sodium fluoride inhibits the enzyme enolase, which is critical in the glycolytic pathway. After blood is drawn, if glycolysis continues, it consumes glucose and produces ethanol as a byproduct. This falsely elevates the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Sodium fluoride prevents this post-collection synthesis of alcohol, ensuring the accuracy of forensic toxicological results.Typically, preservation for alcohol analysis is done using 100 mg of sodium fluoride and 20 mg of potassium oxalate per 10 mL of blood (as anticoagulant).Incorrect Options A: Sodium chlorideIncorrect. Sodium chloride is used as an isotonic solution, not as a preservative. It has no role in preventing glycolysis or preserving alcohol levels in the sample. C: FormalinIncorrect. Formalin (formaldehyde solution) is used as a fixative for tissue preservation, especially for histopathological examination, not for blood. It can destroy cellular and chemical constituents of blood, making it unsuitable for toxicology. D: Sodium nitriteIncorrect. Sodium nitrite is used in the treatment of cyanide poisoning (as part of the cyanide antidote kit), not for preserving blood for alcohol analysis.

A classical feature of LSD intoxication is synesthesia — a condition in which stimulation of one sensory modality leads to experiences in another (e.g., seeing sounds or hearing colors), as described in this case (\"seeing red colors while listening to the radio\").In addition to synesthesia, LSD can cause tachycardia, mydriasis (dilated pupils), elevated blood pressure, sweating, and anxiety or panic reactions. The vivid perceptual changes make LSD the most likely agent in this scenario.Incorrect Options A: CocaineCocaine is a stimulant, known for causing tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, and euphoria, but not classically associated with hallucinations involving synesthesia. It may cause paranoia or visual hallucinations in chronic use, but the classic cross-sensory experience described here is not typical of cocaine.B: CannabisCannabis can cause euphoria, altered perception, and occasionally visual hallucinations, especially at high doses. However, synesthesia is not a characteristic feature, and the hallucinations are generally less intense and more passive compared to LSD.D: HeroinHeroin is a central nervous system depressant (opioid), causing miosis (pinpoint pupils), sedation, respiratory depression, and euphoria.

It does not require direct contact with fragments or heat, just the wave of pressure itself.Incorrect Options:A. Heart:While blast effects can indirectly affect the heart (e.g., via shock or secondary injuries), the heart is not directly vulnerable to shock waves like air-filled organs. It's dense and protected within the thoracic cavity.B. Kidney:The kidneys are retroperitoneal and solid, and while they can be injured in trauma, they are not primary targets of blast waves, especially in the absence of penetrating or blunt trauma.C. Liver:Like the kidney, the liver is a solid organ and more prone to injury from secondary (fragment) or tertiary (body being thrown) blast effects rather than from the shock wave itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)Hollow viscusThe most common seat belt–related injuries in RTAs involve the hollow viscera, such as the small intestine and large intestine. During high-speed deceleration, the seat belt applies localized pressure across the abdomen, especially if worn improperly (e.g., across the abdomen rather than the pelvis). This compression leads to crushing and shearing forces that can cause:Mesenteric tearsBowel perforationContusions of the intestinal wallThe \"seat belt syndrome\" often refers to this pattern of injury, which includes abdominal wall bruising (seat belt sign) along with internal hollow organ injury, sometimes with associated spine fractures (Chance fracture).Incorrect Options:A. SpleenThe spleen is a solid organ and while it can be injured in blunt abdominal trauma, it is not the most common organ injured specifically due to seat belt compression.B. LiverLiver injuries also occur in blunt trauma, but like the spleen, it is a solid organ and less commonly injured due to the focused, compressive force of seat belts compared to hollow viscera.D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)Distance between two opposite landsIn a rifled firearm, the calibre is defined as the internal diameter of the barrel, measured between the tops of the opposing lands (the raised areas between the grooves of rifling). Rifling consists of lands and grooves cut into the barrel to impart a spin to the bullet, improving stability and accuracy.Calibre is expressed in millimeters or inches, depending on the system used (e.g., 7.62 mm or .303 inch).Measuring between the lands provides a standardized reference, as groove depth can vary slightly between manufacturers.This measurement is crucial in ballistics and forensic identification, as it helps determine the type of firearm used.Incorrect Options:B. Distance between two opposite groovesMeasuring between grooves gives the groove diameter, which is larger than the true calibre. Though used in some contexts, it's not the standard for defining calibre in rifled firearms.C. Number of lead balls prepared from one pound of leadThis is the basis for measuring gauge in shotguns, not calibre. For example, a 12-gauge shotgun means 12 lead balls of the barrel's diameter can be made from 1 pound of lead.D.

This distinctive crystalline appearance under the microscope confirms the presence of seminal fluid, making it useful in cases like rape investigation.The yellow needle-shaped crystals mentioned in the question are classic for Barberio’s test.It is considered a confirmatory microscopic test.While not specific to human semen (i.e., it does not distinguish species), it is still widely referenced in forensic literature for identifying semen.Incorrect Options:A. Florence testThis test detects choline, another constituent of semen, and forms brown rhomboid crystals with iodine-potassium iodide—not yellow needle-like crystals. So, not the best match to the question.C. Acid phosphatase testA presumptive test for semen. It detects the enzyme acid phosphatase, abundant in seminal fluid.

In the case of an abrasion, the scab (or crust) formed over the wound changes color as it heals:Fresh abrasion (Day 1): Bright red, raw surface due to capillary oozing.2–3 days: Scab starts forming and turns reddish-brown.4–7 days: The scab becomes dark brown—as seen in the question.

Day 1Injury would appear red and moist, without scab formation or just the beginning of crusting.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)Can be recorded without oath / Oath not to be takenA dying declaration (DD) is a statement made by a person who believes they are about to die, regarding the cause or circumstances of their impending death. Under Section 32(1) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, such a statement is admissible in court even though it is hearsay, because it is presumed that a person on the verge of death would not lie.Importantly, no oath is required or administered while recording a dying declaration. The logic is that the declaration is being made in extremis, often when the declarant is physically weak or unconscious of legal formalities, and the focus is on authenticity, not formality. The priority is to record the victim’s account truthfully and promptly, rather than adhering to procedural technicalities like taking an oath.Incorrect Options:A. Only police can record the DDIncorrect. A dying declaration can be recorded by anyone—a magistrate, doctor, police officer, or even a private individual, as long as the person recording it ensures the declarant is in a fit mental state. However, preferably a magistrate should record it, but it's not mandatory.C. Leading questions can be askedIncorrect. While recording a dying declaration, leading questions must be strictly avoided. The statement should be in narrative form, without influencing the person or putting words in their mouth. The idea is to capture the declarant’s own words as truthfully as possible.D. Oath is compulsory before recording the statementIncorrect. Oath is not compulsory, and in fact, should not be taken.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)Puncture woundA puncture wound is caused by a long, narrow, pointed object such as a knife, nail, or needle, which pierces deep into the body tissues through a small external wound. In this case, since the person was stabbed, likely with a pointed weapon like a knife, the resulting injury is deep and narrow—classic characteristics of a puncture wound.These wounds typically have small openings but can reach deep anatomical structures, including blood vessels and internal organs.In forensic practice, stab wounds are classified under puncture wounds when the depth > length and width of the external wound.Incorrect Options:A. Incised woundIncised wounds are caused by sharp-edged objects like razors or glass. They are longer than they are deep and have clean, regular margins. A stab is deeper than it is long, so this doesn't apply.B. Penetrating woundPenetrating wounds usually refer to firearm injuries or wounds that enter a body cavity (e.g., thorax, abdomen) and may have an entry without an exit. Since the thigh is involved and not a body cavity, it doesn't qualify as a classic penetrating wound.D. Blunt force injuryThese result from non-sharp objects like sticks, stones, or fists. They cause abrasions, lacerations, or contusions, not deep, sharp injuries like stab wounds.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)12–24 hoursThe estimation of time since death (TSD) in forensic medicine relies on postmortem changes such as body temperature, rigor mortis, and livor mortis (hypostasis/lividity).Rigor mortis begins 1–2 hours after death, becomes fully established by 12 hours, and then gradually disappears by 24–36 hours.Body temperature drops steadily after death, usually becoming cold within 12–18 hours, depending on environmental conditions.Lividity (postmortem hypostasis) typically begins within 30 minutes to 2 hours and becomes fixed by 6–12 hours.In this case:Rigor mortis is present all over, indicating that it has fully developed ? typically seen at 12 hours postmortem.Body is cold ? usually seen after 12 hours.Lividity present (not specified if fixed) ? would be consistent with 6+ hours after deathIncorrect Options:A. 4–6 hoursAt this stage, rigor mortis is just beginning in small muscle groups (e.g., jaw, eyelids), and the body would still be warm to cool, not fully cold.B. 6–8 hoursRigor may have progressed but not yet generalized to the whole body. Body temperature is not fully cold yet.C. 8–12 hoursRigor mortis would be in progress, but not fully established in all muscle groups. Cooling is also not complete in most cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)Depressed fractureA depressed fracture occurs when a blunt object with a small striking surface (like a hammer) hits the skull with sufficient force, causing inward displacement of bone fragments. These fractures are typically seen in the parietal bone and are common in direct trauma cases, such as falls or assault with a heavy object.The inward depression of bone visible on CT is the hallmark of this injury.Such injuries may compress or damage the brain, often requiring surgical intervention depending on severity.Incorrect Options:A. Linear fractureThis is a straight crack in the skull without displacement of bone. It is the most common skull fracture seen with low-impact trauma but does not cause depression of the bone.C. Gutter fractureCaused by grazing bullet injuries, producing a groove-like depression along the surface of the skull. This type of fracture is not due to blunt trauma like a hammer.D. Ping pong fractureThis is a type of depressed fracture seen in infants, where the soft skull bones buckle inward without breaking (like a ping pong ball). Not applicable in adults.",
