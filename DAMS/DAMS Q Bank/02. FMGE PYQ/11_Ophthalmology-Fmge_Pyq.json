      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Amblyopia, often referred to as \"lazy eye,\" is a condition where one eye has poor vision that is not corrected by glasses or contact lenses, and it is typically the result of poor visual development during childhood. The condition often affects only one eye. The best treatment for amblyopia in a 10-year-old child is occlusion therapy: Occlusion involves patching the stronger eye (the one with normal vision) to force the weaker eye to work harder, stimulating visual development in that eye. This therapy is the most common and effective method for treating amblyopia, especially in children under 8 to 10 years old. While treatment outcomes are best if started at an earlier age, there is still a possibility of improvement at 10 years old with appropriate intervention. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A. Observation: Observation alone is not sufficient in treating amblyopia. Without treatment, the weaker eye may not improve, and the child could be left with permanent visual impairment in that eye. C. Penalization: Penalization involves the use of atropine drops in the stronger eye to blur its vision, which encourages the child to use the weaker eye. While penalization can be an alternative to occlusion, occlusion therapy is generally preferred, especially in cases of significant amblyopia. However, penalization might be considered if the child refuses to wear the patch. D. None of the above: Since occlusion is the standard treatment for amblyopia in children, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) innervates most of the extraocular muscles: superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique, along with levator palpebrae superioris (eyelid elevation) and the parasympathetic fibers to the pupil. In the image, the right eye is deviated “down and out”—this is the hallmark of oculomotor nerve palsy, where only the lateral rectus (abducens) and superior oblique (trochlear) muscles are functioning, pulling the eye laterally and slightly downward. This presentation may also include ptosis and pupil dilation, both due to oculomotor nerve involvement. Incorrect Options: B. Trochlear nerve The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) innervates only the superior oblique muscle, which assists in downward and inward movement of the eye. Damage leads to vertical diplopia (double vision when looking down), and patients may tilt their head away from the affected side. Why incorrect: In trochlear nerve palsy, the eye does not rest in the “down and out” position like in the image, and the dysfunction is more subtle. C. Optic nerve The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. Damage to this nerve causes vision loss or blindness, but does not affect eye movement. Why incorrect: The patient shows no signs of vision loss but rather has abnormal eye position and movement, indicating a motor nerve issue. D. Abducent nerve The abducent nerve (cranial nerve VI) supplies the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye. Damage causes the affected eye to be pulled medially (inward) at rest and the inability to look laterally. Why incorrect: In the image, the affected eye is not deviated medially; instead, it is down and out, which is not consistent with abducent nerve palsy.",

There is cherry red spot. Due to embolus the blood column within the retina is segmented and is known as cattle tracking. • Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO): Its incidence is more common than CRAO. Causes are: • Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis. • Upon examination: Tortuous and engorged veins, disc edema, soft exudate and evidence of rubeosis iridis (new vessel on iris) • Central serous retinopathy (CSR): It is due to accumulation of transparent fluid at the posterior pole specially macula causing a circumscribed area of retinal detachment in the macular region. Causes are: • Raised aldosterone level usually among type A personalities • Cushing syndrome, idiopathic. Fluorescein angiography shows ink blot pattern and smoke stack pattern. Diabetic retinopathy: It is of 2 types: • Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR): Findings/changes in NPDR are: • Microaneurysm: Earliest change • Retinal hemorrhage • Hard and soft exudates. • Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR): Findings/ changes in PDR are: • Neovascularization: Hallmark • Vitreous hemorrhage, and • Retinal detachment.",

The crowding phenomenon relates to the fact that patients with amblyopia have better visual acuity reading single optotype than reading multiple optotypes in a row (linear optotypes). Often, patients with amblyopia will perform 1 or 2 Snellen lines better when presented with single optotypes versus linear optotypes. This crowding Phenomenon may have something to do with the relatively large receptive field associated with amblyopia. Crowding bars are often used around a single optotype to provide a more sensitive test for amblyopia.",
