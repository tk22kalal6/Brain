      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A-This is a case of Telogen effluvium,which is a common type of hair loss that affects people after they experience severe stress or a change to their body. Symptoms include thinning hair, usually around the top of your head. Treatment exists to reverse hair loss, but hair will typically grow back in three to six months without treatment. Option B-Female pattern hair loss leads to central balding,but there will be no history of stressor like fever. Option C-Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that attacks your body’s hair follicles, causing patchy hair loss.It will be a well circumscribed patch with no erythema or inflammation.Again,there will be no history of stressor like fever. Option D-Trichotillomania is when someone cannot resist the urge to pull out their hair. They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes.It can present with tonsure sign.",

At first it may look like small pimples around hair follicles.The condition can be itchy and sore. Option B-A skin abscess is a bump within or below the skin’s surface.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A-The Koebner phenomenon is the appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary to trauma.This phenomenon is also termed the isomorphic response, given that the new lesions appear clinically and histologically identical to the patient’s underlying cutaneous disease.In other words, a patient with psoriasis who exhibits koebnerization (and is said to be “Koebner-positive”) develops new psoriasiform lesions along sites of skin injury, even if trivial. Option B-The reverse Koebner phenomenon is the disappearance of a skin lesion after trauma to the area. Option C-Gottron papules are symmetric changes over the extensor surfaces of joints, being characterised with erythematous and scaly plaques,seen in dermatomyositis. Option D-Nikolsky sign is demonstrated when lateral pressure is applied on the border of an intact blister, which results in the dislodgment of the normal epidermis and extension of the blister.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/21(235).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Option B-In this case,we can see an annual plaque is present wioth central clearing.If Annular plaque is present and : - Central atrophy - Lupus Vulgaris Central clearing - Tinea /dermatophtic infections Central crusting - Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Option C-Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare condition that causes large, painful sores on the skin,which can later ulcerate. The sores can develop quickly. Most often they appear on the legs. The exact causes of pyoderma gangrenosum are unknown, but it appears to be a disorder of the immune system. Option D-Ichthyosis vulgaris is an inherited or acquired skin condition that occurs when the skin doesn’t shed its dead skin cells.This causes dry, dead skin cells to accumulate in patches on the surface of the skin. It’s also known as “fish scale disease” because the dead skin accumulates in a similar pattern to a fish’s scales.",

Option B-Piebaldism refers to the absence of mature melanin-forming cells (melanocytes) in certain areas of the skin and hair.Common characteristics include a congenital white forelock, scattered normal pigmented and hypopigmented macules and a triangular shaped depigmented patch on the forehead.

Melanin controls the pigmentation (color) of your skin, eyes and hair. People with albinism have extremely pale skin, eyes and hair.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color, is primarily formed from the amino acid tyrosine. This complex biochemical process, known as melanogenesis, occurs within specialized cells called melanocytes. The initial and rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis is the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), and then the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone. Both these steps are catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. Subsequent reactions, involving various intermediates, lead to the formation of different types of melanin, primarily eumelanin (black/brown pigment) and pheomelanin (red/yellow pigment). Therefore, tyrosine is the fundamental precursor for all melanin production. Why other options are incorrect: B. Tryptophan: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor for several important biomolecules, including serotonin, melatonin, and niacin (Vitamin B3). However, it is not involved in the synthesis of melanin. C. Leucine: Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) crucial for protein synthesis, muscle repair, and energy production. It plays no role in melanin formation. D. Valine: Valine is also an essential branched-chain amino acid involved in muscle metabolism and tissue repair. Like leucine, it is not a precursor for melanin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer : A A. Chancroid: Caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, chancroid is classically associated with painful, ragged-edged genital ulcers and often leads to tender, often unilateral but can be bilateral, inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes), which may suppurate. This fits the description very well. B. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV): Caused by specific serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis (L1, L2, L3). The primary genital lesion in LGV is typically a small, painless papule, pustule, or shallow ulcer that often goes unnoticed. The hallmark of LGV is the painful, often unilateral (but can be bilateral) inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes), which develop weeks after the primary lesion. While the lymphadenopathy is painful and bilateral can occur, the primary ulcer is typically painless. The patient presenting with a painful ulcer makes LGV less likely as the primary cause of the pain from the ulcer itself. C. Granuloma inguinale (Donovanosis): Caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. This condition presents with painless, progressive, beefy-red, often ulcerated lesions that bleed easily. Crucially, regional lymphadenopathy is typically absent (though subcutaneous granulomas, or \"pseudobuboes,\" can occur). The presence of painful ulcers and lymphadenopathy makes this less likely. D. Gonorrhea: Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea typically presents with urethritis (in men), cervicitis (in women, often asymptomatic), or proctitis. While it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and disseminated infection, it does not typically cause genital ulcers.",
