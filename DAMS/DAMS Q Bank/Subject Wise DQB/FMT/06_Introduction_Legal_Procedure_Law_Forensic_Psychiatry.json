      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Explanation: McNaughton's rule: To establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly shown that, at the time of committing the act, the accused was labouring under such defect of reason, from disease of mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. Durham’s rule: An accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act is the product of mental Disease or mental Defect. Currens rule: An accused is not criminally responsible, if at the time of committing the act, the defendant, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacks substantial Capacity to Conform his Conduct to the requirements of law. American law institute (ALI) test: A person is not criminally responsible, if at the time of committing the act, as a result of mental disease or defect lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Irrestible impulse test (new Hampshire doctrine): An accused is not criminally responsible, even if knows the nature and quality of his act and knows that it is wrong, if he is incapable of restraining himself from committing the act, because the free agency of his will has been destroyed by mental disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Explanation: As per Section 190(1)(a) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, when a woman dies under circumstances raising a reasonable suspicion that some other person has committed an offence, or within seven years of her marriage, or if her relatives make a request for an inquiry, the Executive Magistrate is empowered to hold an inquiry into the cause of death. A Sub-divisional Magistrate falls under the category of an Executive Magistrate. This provision ensures a mandatory magisterial inquiry in such sensitive cases to ascertain the circumstances of death, often aimed at addressing dowry-related violence or other forms of domestic abuse. Incorrect Options: Option (A. Deputy Superintendent of Police) Explanation: While police officers, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police, are involved in conducting an inquest under Section 188 of the BNSS (which is equivalent to Section 174 of the Cr.P.C.), their role is to investigate and prepare a report. The specific magisterial inquiry mandated for suspicious deaths of women within seven years of marriage is conducted by an Executive Magistrate, not a police officer, even if the police officer is of a senior rank. Option (B. Forensic medical expert) Explanation: A forensic medical expert (or forensic pathologist) is responsible for conducting the post-mortem examination to medically determine the cause and manner of death. Their role is to provide crucial scientific and medical evidence to the investigating authorities and the court. They do not conduct the legal inquest or inquiry into the circumstances of death. Option (C. Coroner) Explanation: The system of Coroners, prevalent in some other common law jurisdictions, is not the general legal framework for conducting inquests in India. In India, the powers and duties related to inquests are primarily vested in the police and various classes of Magistrates (Executive and Judicial), as outlined in the BNSS. While historical instances or specific exceptions might exist, the primary authority for such inquiries nationwide, especially concerning suspicious deaths of married women, rests with the Executive Magistrate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The authority who has conducted inquest in that particular case. After a post-mortem examination, the body is typically handed over to the authority who has conducted the inquest in that particular case. This could be a police officer or magistrate who is responsible for investigating the cause of death. Once the post-mortem is completed and the cause of death has been established, the body is usually returned to the legal authority handling the case for further action, such as notification to the family or further legal procedures. Incorrect Options: Option A (Coroner) is incorrect because while a coroner may oversee investigations into unnatural deaths, the actual handling of the body after the post-mortem is typically under the jurisdiction of the authority responsible for the inquest, not the coroner directly. Option B (Chief magistrate) is incorrect because the chief magistrate may be involved in overseeing legal procedures, but it is the authority conducting the inquest who is responsible for receiving the body after the post-mortem. Option D (Nearby Police station) is incorrect because the police station is not automatically the authority that receives the body after the post-mortem unless the police were the ones conducting the inquest. The body is handed over to the specific authority that has been investigating the case.",

This system is primarily used in some Western countries, such as the United States, where a Medical Examiner (a physician with specialized training in forensic pathology) conducts investigations into deaths, particularly those that are sudden, unexplained, or suspicious. The Medical Examiner’s system involves the direct involvement of a medical professional in both the investigation and determination of cause of death. However, in India, the inquest system is used to investigate deaths, and there are two primary types of inquests: Police inquest (Option A): In this case, the police are responsible for conducting an initial investigation into deaths, especially in cases of accidents, suicides, or unnatural deaths. Magistrate’s inquest (Option B): This is typically used for deaths that require judicial investigation, and a magistrate is involved in overseeing the investigation and conducting the inquest procedure. Coroner’s inquest (Option C): While the term is often used in other countries, the coroner’s inquest is not commonly practiced in India. However, the inquest process performed by the police or magistrate often serves a similar function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Murder. Explanation: In India, magistrate inquest is conducted in cases where there is a need for a judicial investigation, typically for deaths that are unnatural, suspicious, or require more formal inquiry. A magistrate oversees the inquest process to ensure fairness and objectivity. Here’s how each option applies: Option A (Exhumation): A magistrate inquest is conducted in cases where a body needs to be exhumed for further examination, usually when the cause of death is unclear or suspicious. This is an example of a case requiring a magistrate's involvement. Option B (Dowry deaths): A magistrate inquest is required in dowry death cases under Section 174 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). This is because dowry deaths often involve suspicious circumstances that require a thorough investigation under judicial supervision. Option D (Death of a person in police custody): The death of a person in police custody also necessitates a magistrate inquest. This is to ensure transparency and prevent any misuse of power, as deaths in custody are often considered highly suspicious. Option C (Murder): In the case of murder, while the police conduct the primary investigation, the magistrate’s role comes later in the judicial process. A magistrate does not directly conduct an inquest for murder, as the police are typically responsible for investigating the crime scene, gathering evidence, and arresting suspects. The magistrate becomes involved during the trial phase.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Juvenile court. In India, juvenile courts are specifically designated to handle cases involving offenses committed by children. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 governs the proceedings for children in conflict with the law, ensuring that they are treated according to their age and potential for rehabilitation. The juvenile court is specialized to focus on the welfare and rehabilitation of children rather than just punishment, and it follows a different set of procedures compared to regular courts. Incorrect Options: Option A (High court) is incorrect because the High Court deals with appeals, writ petitions, and cases of significant importance but does not function as the trial court for children's offenses. Option B (Sessions court) is incorrect because the Sessions Court primarily handles serious criminal cases like murder and rape. While it may handle cases involving adults, it is not the appropriate court for children who commit offenses. Option C (Magistrate court) is incorrect because Magistrate courts handle less severe criminal offenses. However, in the case of children, a Juvenile Court is the proper forum for addressing cases involving minors.",

It may only impose sentences within its jurisdiction or refer cases to higher courts for a more serious review. Option B (High court) is partially correct, as the High Court has the power to enhance sentences in certain cases, but it is a higher court in general, meaning that the sentence can be enhanced by any superior court. Option D (All of the above) is incorrect because not all courts, particularly the Magistrate court, have the power to enhance sentences.

This means that any sexual activity with a person below the age of 18 is legally considered an offense (specifically, classified as rape or aggravated sexual assault under relevant sections of BNS and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012), regardless of whether the minor appears to have given \"consent.\" The law considers minors below 18 incapable of giving valid consent for sexual acts. Incorrect Options: Option (A. 16 years) Explanation: Before the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (which preceded the BNS but set this precedent), the age of consent for sexual intercourse in India was 16 years. However, this was amended to 18 years, and the BNS continues to uphold 18 years as the minimum age for valid consent. Option (C. 20 years) Explanation: The legal age of consent for sexual intercourse in India, under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and related laws, is 18 years, not 20 years.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) This scenario describes a medical emergency where a patient's life is in immediate danger, and it's impossible to obtain consent from the patient or a guardian. In such situations, the law allows for actions taken in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent. Section 81 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) is the relevant provision. This section deals with \"Act likely to cause harm but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.\" It essentially covers acts done in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding harm to person or property, even if that act might otherwise appear to be an offense. In a medical emergency, a surgeon performing a life-saving procedure without consent from a guardian, when such consent cannot be obtained, falls under this principle, as the harm prevented (death or severe neurological damage) outweighs the harm caused (performing surgery without formal consent). Let's look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Section 79 BNS: This section deals with \"Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law.\" This is more about acting under a misconception of fact or under legal justification, rather than a choice of lesser harm in an emergency. B. Section 80 BNS: This section pertains to \"Accident in doing a lawful act.\" It covers acts done by accident or misfortune, without any criminal intention or knowledge, in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner. This doesn't apply to a deliberate surgical intervention, even if life-saving. D. Section 82 BNS: This section relates to \"Act of a child under seven years of age.\" It states that nothing is an offense which is done by a child under seven years of age. This is clearly irrelevant to an adult patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 2 Years. Explanation: As per the Consumer Protection Act (COPRA) 1986, the maximum period to file a case after the knowledge of damage is 2 years. This means that a consumer has up to 2 years from the date they become aware of the harm or damage caused by a product or service to file a complaint. The law provides this timeframe to ensure that claims are made while the evidence is still fresh and to avoid unnecessary delays in resolving consumer disputes. Incorrect Options: Option A (90 Days) is incorrect because the 90-day period is typically applicable in certain other legal contexts, but not in the Consumer Protection Act 1986, where the time limit is 2 years. Option B (150 Days) is incorrect because 150 days is not a prescribed period under the Consumer Protection Act. The law specifically allows a period of 2 years to file a case. Option C (1 Year) is also incorrect because although 1 year may be a relevant period in some legal contexts, the Consumer Protection Act clearly stipulates a period of 2 years for filing complaints regarding damages.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bernard Spilsbury. Bernard Spilsbury is often referred to as the father of modern forensic medicine. He was a prominent British forensic pathologist in the early 20th century and played a significant role in developing and advancing forensic science, particularly in the use of autopsy and pathological investigation in criminal cases. His contributions to forensic medicine helped establish it as a recognized science and laid the foundation for modern forensic pathology. Incorrect Options: Option B (Mathieu Orfila) is incorrect because Mathieu Orfila is considered the father of toxicology, not forensic medicine. He made significant contributions to the study of poisons and their effects on the human body, but he is not primarily known for work in forensic pathology. Option C (Paracelsus) is incorrect because Paracelsus was a pioneering physician and chemist from the Renaissance period, but he is not considered the father of forensic medicine. His work was influential in medicine, chemistry, and toxicology but not in the specific development of forensic medicine. Option D (Paolo Zacchia) is incorrect because Paolo Zacchia was an Italian physician and one of the early figures in the development of forensic medicine. He made significant contributions to legal medicine and is known for his work in \"The Forensic Medicine\", but he is not the father of modern forensic medicine in the same way as Bernard Spilsbury.",

The purpose of re-examination is to help the prosecution restore or strengthen the testimony of the witness and ensure that the facts are presented clearly.

Cross-examination is meant to challenge the credibility of the witness, while re-examination is the responsibility of the prosecutor. Option C (Presiding Judge) is incorrect because the presiding judge oversees the trial but does not conduct re-examination of witnesses. The judge ensures that the trial proceeds according to the law and maintains order in the court.

It aims to protect the dignity and privacy of the victim. The punishment can be imprisonment for up to two years and also a fine. Incorrect Options: A. Section 64 – Incorrect. This section deals with the definition and punishment for rape, not the disclosure of identity. B. Section 70 – Incorrect. This section addresses sexual offences against minors and related issues, but not the disclosure of identity. D. Section 73 – Incorrect. Section 73 pertains to restrictions on publishing court proceedings related to sexual offences without permission, not directly about identity disclosure.",

The post-mortem was performed in the year 1873, and this event is significant in the history of forensic medicine in India. It marked the beginning of the practice of forensic autopsies in the country, which are crucial in criminal investigations and determining causes of death. Incorrect Options: Option A (Kolkata) is incorrect because while Kolkata (Calcutta) is historically significant in many fields, the first post-mortem in India was conducted in Chennai, not Kolkata. Option B (Mumbai) is incorrect because Mumbai (formerly Bombay) has its own significant history in medicine and law, but it was not the location of the first post-mortem in India. Option D (Delhi) is incorrect because Delhi, as the capital city, became more prominent in later stages of forensic development in India. However, it was Chennai that saw the first post-mortem.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mentally ill Insanity (lunacy or mental unsoundness or mental derangement or mental disorder) is defined as a disease of mind or the personality in which there is derangement or impairment of mental or emotional processes. The Indian Lunacy Act 1912 defined lunatic as an idiot or a person of unsound mind. However, The Mental Health Act 1987 has replaced the Indian Lunacy Act 1912. The Mental Health Act 1987 uses the term “mentally ill person” instead of lunatic. The Mental Health Act defines mentally ill person as “a person who is in need of treatment by reason of any mental disorder other than mental retardation”. Insanity is an old term used loosely to denote any mental disorder or mental illness. The Indian Penal Code employs the term unsoundness of mind while referring to insanity. It is better to use term mentally ill person (as defined under Mental Health Act 1987) rather than using term such as insane or lunatic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) As of 2025, the maximum compensation that the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (formerly known as the District Consumer Forum) can award is ?1 crore. This limit was revised under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and the Consumer Protection (Jurisdiction of the District Commission, the State Commission, and the National Commission) Rules, 2021. Although the initial limit was reduced to ?50 lakh, there was a subsequent amendment (likely after 2022) that restored the jurisdiction of the District Commission to ?1 crore. The jurisdiction is now as follows: District Commission: Up to ?1 crore State Commission: Between ?1 crore and ?10 crore National Commission: Above ?10 crore Incorrect Options: A. ?5 Lakhs Explanation: This option is incorrect because the District Commission has a jurisdiction limit of up to ?1 crore, not just ?5 lakh. The compensation limit for District Consumer Courts is far higher than ?5 lakh, which is typically within the range of lower-tier consumer courts. B. ?20 Lakhs Explanation: This option is also incorrect because the jurisdiction of the District Commission is far higher than ?20 lakh. As per the latest updates, the maximum compensation limit the District Commission can award is ?1 crore, making ?20 lakh well below the actual limit. C. ?50 Lakhs Explanation: While this was previously the correct limit before the amendments, the jurisdiction was revised to ?1 crore after 2021. Therefore, ?50 lakh is no longer the current maximum compensation for the District Consumer Court, making this option incorrect.",

It is also referred to as imputed negligence. • Testamentary capacity (Testament = will) is the mental ability of a person to make a valid will. • To make a valid Will, it should have following components: o He should be major. o The person should be of sound mind. o The person making Will should understand the nature of Will. o The person should have knowledge of his property that has to be disposed of. o The person should recognize the individuals who have moral claims to heir his property. • McNaughten's rule: An accused person is not criminally responsible, if it is proved that, at the time of committing the crime that he was suffering from such a defect of reason from disease of mind that he did not know the nature and quality of act he was doing or if he did know this that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 317 IPC • Sec. 315 IPC - Act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth.—Whoever before the birth of any child does any act with the intention of thereby preventing that child from being born alive or causing it to die after its birth, and does by such act prevent that child from being born alive, or causes it to die after its birth, shall, if such act be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both. • Sec. 316 IPC - Causing death of quick unborn child by act amounting to culpable homicide.—Whoever does any act under such circum­stances, that if he thereby caused death he would be guilty of culpable homicide, and does by such act cause the death of a quick unborn child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. Illustration A, knowing that he is likely to cause the death of a pregnant woman, does an act which, if it caused the death of the woman, would amount to culpable homicide. The woman is injured, but does not die; but the death of an unborn quick child with which she is pregnant is thereby caused. A is guilty of the offence defined in this section. • Sec. 317 IPC - Exposure and abandonment of child under twelve years, by parent or person having care of it.—Whoever being the father or mother of a child under the age of twelve years, or having the care of such child, shall expose or leave such child in any place with the intention of wholly abandoning such child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both. Explanation.—This section is not intended to prevent the trial of the offender for murder or culpable homicide, as the case may be, if the child dies in consequence of the exposure. • Sec. 318 IPC - Concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body.—Whoever, by secretly burying or otherwise disposing of the death body of a child whether such child die before or after or during its birth, intentionally conceals or endeavours to conceal the birth of such child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 70 Mental retardation (now more commonly referred to as intellectual disability) is typically defined when an individual's IQ (intelligence quotient) is below 70. An IQ score of 70 or lower generally indicates limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. This threshold is used as a diagnostic criterion to identify individuals who may require additional support or services in various aspects of life, such as education, employment, and social integration. Incorrect Options: Option A (90) is incorrect because an IQ of 90 is within the average range of intellectual functioning, which typically spans from about 85 to 115. It does not meet the criteria for intellectual disability. Option B (80) is incorrect because an IQ of 80 is also within the low average range of intelligence, but it is not low enough to be classified as mental retardation/intellectual disability according to the standard criteria. Option D (65) is incorrect because while IQ below 70 is the general diagnostic criterion for intellectual disability, an IQ of 65 might be used in some specific contexts for further classification, but the key threshold is 70, not 65.",
