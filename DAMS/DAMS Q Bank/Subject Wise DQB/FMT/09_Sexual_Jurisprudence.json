      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Grandfather Atavism refers to the reappearance of ancestral traits in an individual that were absent in recent generations but present in distant ancestors. As atavism involves traits inherited from distant ancestors, such as a grandparent or even further back in the lineage. These traits could include physical characteristics, genetic features, or behavioral patterns that seem to \"skip\" generations. For instance, a person might exhibit features like a recessive genetic trait, a physical anomaly, or a behavioral pattern that was present in an ancestor but not in the immediate parents. A. Mother This option is incorrect because the term \"atavism\" does not refer to traits inherited directly from a parent, such as the mother. Traits inherited from the mother are considered a part of normal genetic inheritance and do not qualify as atavistic features. B. Father This option is also incorrect because, like the mother, traits inherited directly from the father are not considered atavistic. Such traits are part of standard Mendelian inheritance and do not involve the reappearance of ancestral features. C. Neighbour This option is incorrect and irrelevant because genetic inheritance cannot occur from a neighbor. Atavism strictly pertains to ancestral traits within one's genetic lineage and not external influences or unrelated individuals.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sexual arousal from enemas is known as Klismaphilia Klismaphilia is a specific paraphilia where individuals derive sexual pleasure or excitement from the administration of enemas. This may be due to the physical sensations involved, psychological associations, or a combination of both. The condition is often categorized under paraphilic interests and can range in intensity among individuals. It is distinct in its focus on the use of enemas, making this the correct answer. A. Agalmatophilia This option is incorrect because Agalmatophilia refers to sexual arousal from statues, dolls, or mannequins. It is unrelated to the use of enemas or any activity involving them. B. Coprolagnia This option is incorrect as Coprolagnia is the sexual arousal derived from feces or defecation. While enemas involve the rectum, Coprolagnia is centered on feces itself, making this unrelated to Klismaphilia. C. Mysophilia This option is incorrect because Mysophilia involves sexual arousal from filth, dirt, or uncleanliness. Although enemas are associated with cleaning the body, Mysophilia pertains to a fascination with unclean conditions, which is the opposite of what an enema typically achieves.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 12 hours The presence of motile spermatozoa in a wet mount of vaginal secretions is indicative of intercourse within the past 12 hours. Sperm motility is a sign of viability and activity, which is influenced by factors like temperature, pH, and the environment of the vaginal canal. After ejaculation, motile spermatozoa remain active for a limited time, usually up to 12 hours, in the vaginal secretions before they lose motility due to the body's natural processes. Detecting motile spermatozoa on a wet mount is a useful indicator for estimating the time frame of recent intercourse. A. 6 hours This option is incorrect because motile spermatozoa can remain active for up to 12 hours in the vaginal environment. While they can certainly be observed within 6 hours, this timeframe does not encompass the full duration of their motility, making this option too restrictive. C. 24 hours This option is incorrect because motile spermatozoa typically lose their movement within 12 hours due to the vaginal environment's conditions, such as changes in pH and temperature. While sperm may still be present in a non-motile state after 12 hours, they are no longer motile at 24 hours. D. 48 hours This option is incorrect as motile spermatozoa are unlikely to survive and remain active for 48 hours in vaginal secretions. While non-motile sperm may persist for a longer duration (up to 72 hours or more), motility is usually lost within 12 hours, making this time frame too long to be accurate for motile sperm.",

Clinical cytogeneticists analyze human karyotypes to detect gross genetic changes—anomalies involving several megabases or more of DNA. • Karyotypes can reveal changes in chromosome number associated with aneuploid conditions, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). • Careful analysis of karyotypes can also reveal more subtle structural changes, such as chromosomal deletions, duplications, translocations, or inversions. In fact, as medical genetics becomes increasingly integrated with clinical medicine, karyotypes are becoming a source of diagnostic information for specific birth defects, genetic disorders, and even cancers. For karyotyping, the cells need to be arrested in the metaphase stage for separating the chromosomes. As the monocytes do not divide, they cannot be used for karyotyping.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atelectasis The hydrostatic test, also known as the lung floatation test, is a forensic procedure used to determine whether a newborn has taken a breath. In this test, the lungs are placed in water; if they float, it suggests the presence of air, indicating respiration. Conversely, if the lungs sink, it implies the absence of respiration. However, certain conditions can lead to false-negative results, where the test indicates no respiration despite the infant having breathed. Atelectasis refers to the incomplete expansion or collapse of the lungs. In newborns, this condition can occur due to various factors, such as prematurity or respiratory distress, leading to insufficient aeration of the lung tissues. As a result, even if the infant has taken breaths, the lungs may not retain enough air to float during the hydrostatic test, causing a false-negative outcome. Incorrect Responses: A. Emphysema: Emphysema is a chronic lung condition characterized by the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to enlarged air spaces. This condition is typically associated with adults and is not relevant to newborns. Therefore, it does not affect the hydrostatic test results in infants. B. Putrefaction: Putrefaction refers to the decomposition of body tissues after death, leading to gas formation. These gases can cause the lungs to float during the hydrostatic test, potentially resulting in a false-positive result, not a false-negative. D. Artificial Respiration: Artificial respiration involves manually providing breaths to an infant. This process can introduce air into the lungs, causing them to float during the hydrostatic test. However, this would lead to a false-positive result rather than a false-negative.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Child fictitiously claimed by a woman A supposititious child refers to an infant fraudulently presented as the biological offspring of someone, typically to claim inheritance or social status. Historically, this practice involved procuring a baby and passing them off as one's own, especially when an heir was needed. This option accurately defines a supposititious child. In historical contexts, such as Ancient Rome, there were instances where individuals would introduce a non-biological child into their family to secure an heir or claim certain privileges. To prevent such fraudulent claims, laws were enacted, and measures like employing multiple midwives during childbirth were taken to ensure the legitimacy of the offspring. Incorrect Responses: B. Child born out of wedlock: A child born out of wedlock is termed an illegitimate child, not a supposititious child. Illegitimacy pertains to the circumstances of the child's birth rather than any fraudulent claim about their parentage. C. Child born after artificial insemination homologous: Artificial insemination homologous involves using the husband's or male partner's sperm to achieve pregnancy. The resulting child is biologically related to the parents and does not involve any fraudulent claims, thus not fitting the definition of a supposititious child. D. Second born of a twin pregnancy: In a twin pregnancy, the second-born child is simply the younger twin. There is no implication of fraudulent parentage, so this option is unrelated to the concept of a supposititious child.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Positive HCG test • Positive HCG test is only probable sign of pregnancy because this test can be positive even in cases of diseases like chorionic carcinoma & hydatidiform mole and up to two weeks after pregnancy. • The definite/positive signs of pregnancy are 1. Foetal parts and movements: Active foetal movements are felt by placing the hands on the abdomen from 16-18 weeks and may be seen by 5th month. Foetal parts such as head and limbs can be distinctly felt after 24 weeks of gestation. 2. Fetal heart sounds: FHS are heard between 18 and 20 weeks by stethoscope/foetoscope. The fetal heart rate is 160/minute at 5th month and 120/minute at 9th month. Fetal heart sounds are not felt: • When the fetus is dead • When there is excessive quantity of liquor amnii • When abdominal wall is very fat • When examination is made before 18 weeks of pregnancy 3. X-Ray: At 15-16 weeks, fetal parts can be detected with certainty, but occasionally parts are detected as early as 10 weeks. The shadows on X-ray are: • Crescentic or annular shadow of the skull • Beaded appearance of vertebrae • Step ladder pattern of ribs and • Irregular linear shadows of limbs 4. Ultrasonography: Gestational sac is seen as white ring by 6th week. Distinct echos from the embryo within the gestational ring by 7th week. Foetal heart beat can be made out by 10th week.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 80% Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the primary form of hemoglobin present during fetal development, facilitating efficient oxygen transport in the womb. At birth, the percentage of HbF in a newborn's blood typically ranges from 50% to 95%, with an average around 80%. This high concentration of HbF is essential for meeting the oxygen demands of the developing fetus. Option B accurately reflects the average percentage of fetal hemoglobin present at birth. This value is consistent with observed physiological data, where HbF levels are high immediately after birth and gradually decrease over the first few months of life as adult hemoglobin (HbA) production increases. Incorrect Responses: A. 94%: While 94% is within the possible range of HbF percentages at birth, it represents the higher end of the spectrum. Since 80% is a more commonly observed average value, option A is less accurate compared to option B. C. 7-8%: This percentage is significantly lower than the typical HbF levels observed at birth. Such low levels are more characteristic of infants several months after birth, as HbF gradually decreases and is replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA). D. 0%: At birth, it is highly unlikely for a newborn to have 0% HbF, as HbF is the primary hemoglobin during fetal development and persists in significant amounts immediately after birth.",

This encompasses both mothers and fathers who commit such acts, regardless of the child's age. Filicide is a tragic and complex phenomenon influenced by various psychological, social, and economic factors. Option C accurately defines the act of a parent killing their own child, encompassing both mothers and fathers. This term is used in legal and psychological contexts to describe such tragic events. Incorrect Responses: A. Feticide: Feticide refers to the intentional killing of a fetus, typically before birth. It does not involve the death of a child after birth and is not committed by parents in the same context as filicide. B. Neonaticide: Neonaticide is the act of killing a newborn within the first 24 hours of life. While it is a form of filicide, it specifically pertains to the immediate post-birth period. Therefore, it is a subset of filicide, not a separate term for the general act. D. Infanticide: Infanticide refers to the killing of an infant, typically defined as a child under one year of age. While it is a form of filicide, it is more specific in terms of the child's age. Therefore, it is a subset of filicide, not a separate term for the general act.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Age of accused is less than 7 years In Indian law, the best defense against a charge of rape is that the accused is under seven years of age. According to Section 82 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a child under seven years old is considered incapable of committing an offense. This provision reflects the principle that children below this age lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their actions and, therefore, cannot be held criminally responsible. Option D is correct because Section 82 of the IPC explicitly states that nothing is an offense if done by a child under seven years of age. This legal provision provides a complete defense against criminal liability for individuals in this age group. Incorrect Responses: A. Accused is intoxicated: Voluntary intoxication is not a defense under Indian law. The law holds individuals accountable for their actions, even if they were intoxicated at the time of committing the offense. B. Accused is impotent: Impotence is not a recognized defense against a charge of rape. The offense of rape is defined by the act of non-consensual penetration, and impotence does not negate the occurrence of this act. C. Accused is in lucid interval: A person in a lucid interval, meaning a temporary period of sanity, is still held responsible for their actions during that time. The defense of insanity requires that the individual was incapable of understanding the nature of their act due to unsoundness of mind at the time the offense was committed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 4 days The ductus venosus is a vital fetal blood vessel that allows oxygenated blood from the placenta to bypass the liver and flow directly into the inferior vena cava, facilitating efficient circulation during fetal development. After birth, as the newborn's liver becomes functional and the placenta is no longer in use, the ductus venosus undergoes closure. This closure is typically completed within 3 to 7 days post-birth, with structural closure usually occurring within the first week. Incorrect Responses: A. 2 days: While functional closure of the ductus venosus occurs shortly after birth, structural closure typically takes longer, usually within the first week. Therefore, 2 days is too early for complete closure. B. 3 days: Although the ductus venosus begins to close functionally shortly after birth, structural closure usually occurs within the first week. Therefore, 3 days is too early for complete closure. D. 10 days: By 10 days post-birth, the ductus venosus should have closed structurally. Therefore, 10 days is too late for closure.",
