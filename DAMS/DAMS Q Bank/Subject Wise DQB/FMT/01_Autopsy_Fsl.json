      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A, AB, B, or O The blood group of the child depends on the ABO inheritance, which follows Mendelian genetics. The ABO blood group system has three alleles: IA, IB, and i. IA and IB are co-dominant, meaning both can be expressed when present together (resulting in blood group AB). i is recessive, meaning it is only expressed if inherited from both parents (resulting in blood group O). If the father's blood group is A (genotype IAIA or IAi) and the mother's blood group is B (genotype IBIB or IBi), the possible combinations of alleles in the child are: IAIB: Blood group AB IAi: Blood group A IBi: Blood group B ii: Blood group O Thus, the child could have blood group A, B, AB, or O, depending on the alleles inherited from each parent. Incorrect Options: A. A only: This is incorrect because the child could inherit IA from the father and IB from the mother, resulting in blood group AB. Similarly, the child could inherit IB from the mother and i from the father, resulting in blood group B. Blood group O is also possible if the child inherits i from both parents. B. B only: This is incorrect for the same reason. Blood group B is possible, but the child could also have A, AB, or O depending on the genetic combinations inherited. C. AB only: This is incorrect because AB is only one of the possibilities when IA is inherited from the father and IB from the mother. Other combinations (e.g., IAi, IBi, or ii) would result in blood groups A, B, or O.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 10 ml For chemical analysis, particularly in forensic and toxicological investigations, 10 ml of blood is typically the minimum required quantity to ensure that sufficient sample is available for all necessary tests. This amount allows for multiple analyses, including detection of toxins, alcohol, drugs, or other substances. The preserved blood sample can also be subjected to reanalysis if needed, which makes 10 ml the preferred minimum volume. Incorrect Options: B. 2 ml: While 2 ml might be adequate for basic tests or specific analyses (e.g., a single drug or alcohol level), it is insufficient for comprehensive chemical analysis, which often requires larger quantities for multiple tests or repeat testing. C. 100 ml: 100 ml is far more than what is required for chemical analysis. Collecting such a large volume is unnecessary and impractical, especially in cases involving deceased individuals or those with limited blood availability. D. 50 ml: Similar to 100 ml, 50 ml is excessive and unnecessary for routine chemical analysis. While a larger quantity might be collected for research purposes or advanced testing, it is not a standard requirement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ethanol Ethanol is generally not a constituent of embalming fluid. Embalming fluid is a chemical solution used to preserve human remains by delaying decomposition and disinfecting the body. It is typically composed of chemicals that have preservative, fixative, and germicidal properties, such as formalin, methanol, and phenol. Ethanol, although a preservative in certain contexts, is not commonly used in standard embalming fluids. Constituents of Embalming Fluid: Formalin (Formaldehyde): Formalin is a key component of embalming fluid. It serves as a preservative and fixative, preventing the decomposition of tissues by cross-linking proteins. Methanol: Methanol is added to embalming fluid to stabilize formaldehyde and prevent polymerization. It also acts as a disinfectant and preservative. Phenol: Phenol is included for its antiseptic and preservative properties. It aids in the disinfection process and prevents microbial growth. Why Ethanol is Incorrect: Ethanol, while it has disinfectant properties, is not typically used in embalming fluid because it is not as effective as the other compounds in preserving tissues or disinfecting remains. Additionally, ethanol is volatile and could evaporate easily, making it unsuitable for long-term preservation. Incorrect Options: B. Methanol: Methanol is an essential component of embalming fluid and is used to stabilize formaldehyde, making this option incorrect. C. Formalin: Formalin is the main preservative in embalming fluid, making this option incorrect. D. Phenol: Phenol is included for its antiseptic and disinfectant properties, making this option incorrect.",

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) does not contain ABO antigens because the secretor status (expression of ABO antigens in body fluids) does not extend to the CSF. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus and has a composition distinct from other body fluids. Incorrect Options: A. Saliva: ABO antigens are commonly found in saliva, provided the person is a secretor. Secretors express soluble forms of ABO antigens in their body fluids. B. Sweat: Sweat contains ABO antigens in secretors because these antigens are expressed on epithelial cells and secreted into body fluids. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acid dilution test The acid dilution test is the investigation of choice for determining the ABO blood group from an old bloodstain on cloth. This test is effective for identifying blood group antigens in dried blood because the antigens on red blood cells are relatively stable even in old stains. In this test: The dried blood is diluted in a weak acid solution. The antigens are extracted from the stain. Blood grouping is performed using specific antibodies to detect the ABO group. The acid dilution test is highly reliable for blood group determination in forensic cases involving old bloodstains. Incorrect Options: A. Benzidine test: The benzidine test is a presumptive test for the presence of blood. It relies on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin to produce a color change. However, it does not provide any information about the ABO blood group and is not specific to blood group determination. Additionally, it is no longer commonly used due to its carcinogenic nature. C. Haemin crystal test: The haemin crystal test (Teichmann test) is used to confirm the presence of blood in dried stains by detecting hemoglobin. The test involves creating distinctive hemin crystals (by adding a chemical reagent to a blood sample). However, like the benzidine test, it does not identify blood groups. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Carotid artery For embalming, chemicals such as formalin, phenol, and other preservatives are injected into the carotid artery. This is because the carotid artery: Is a large, easily accessible artery. Supplies blood to the head and brain, ensuring effective distribution of embalming fluid to the upper body. Allows for uniform perfusion of the preservative chemicals throughout the body. The carotid artery is often preferred in embalming procedures to ensure effective preservation, particularly of the head and brain, which are critical areas in forensic and mortuary work. Incorrect Options: B. Jugular vein: The jugular vein is not used for injecting embalming fluid. Instead, it is commonly used to drain blood from the body during the embalming process. C. Femoral artery: While the femoral artery can be used for embalming in some cases, it is generally not the primary choice. It is often used for lower-body embalming when access to the carotid artery is not possible. D. Femoral vein: The femoral vein is not used for injecting embalming fluid.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phenol Common salt (sodium chloride) is used as a preservative in cases of phenol poisoning. Phenol is a volatile and degradable compound, and using a saturated salt solution helps to stabilize the phenol in biological specimens (such as stomach contents, vomitus, or tissues). The high salt concentration prevents the breakdown of phenol, ensuring it remains detectable during forensic analysis. This makes common salt a critical preservative for phenol poisoning cases in medico-legal investigations. Incorrect Options: A. Mineral acids: Mineral acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid) are stable substances and do not require common salt for preservation. Instead, specimens in such cases are usually refrigerated or preserved with sodium fluoride to prevent putrefaction. Common salt does not play any role in stabilizing mineral acids. B. Alkalis: Alkalis (e.g., caustic soda, potassium hydroxide) are also chemically stable and do not require any specific preservative like common salt. Specimens in alkali poisoning cases are generally preserved by routine refrigeration to avoid degradation of biological material. C. Aconite: Aconite poisoning involves alkaloids, which require preservation with rectified spirit to prevent their degradation. Common salt does not preserve alkaloids and hence is not used in cases of aconite poisoning.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Method of injection for Embalming are: • Continuous Injection and drainage: The arterial injection is given continuously, against vein tube that is kept open throughout injection. The embalming time is much shortened. Venous drainage and tissue saturation is poor. This method is least satisfactory. • Continuous injection with disrupted drainage: The injection is made continuously with vein tube closed. The blood in the veins build up a resistance for the arterial flow which helps in the better diffusion of the fluid. Thick blood is discharged when the drain tube is opened. This method is better that continuous discharge and drainage. • Alternate injection and drainage: The arterial fluid is injected for sometimes with the drain tube closed. The injection is stopped when the superficial veins swell, and the drain tube is opened. When the flow of blood from the drain tube stops, it is closed and the injection started. This process is repeated several times till the embalming is complete. • Discontinuous injection and drainage: This consists of repeated arterial injection of small quantities at two hour intervals. The total quantity of injection fluid is in excess of ordinary injection done at a tie. The injection is continued for three ir four times. The venous drain tube which is kept closed is opened a little before and kept open a little after starting another dose of injection. This is the best method. • The main composition of embalming fluid is Formalin, which is a 37% (by weight) or 40% (by volume) aqueous (water) solution of formaldehyde, with the chemical formula HCHO, used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and especially today as a fixative for histology (the study of tissues under the microscope). The embalming fluid may be injected by Hand/Foot pump, Stirrup pump, Bulb Syringe, Gravity Injector or Motorised Injection (best). • There are different methods of injection namely, Continuous Injection and Drainage Continuous Injection with disrupted Drainage Alternate Injection and Drainage • Discontinuous Injection and Drainage (Best Method) • There are several embalming fluids, but typical embalming fluid is the best.",
