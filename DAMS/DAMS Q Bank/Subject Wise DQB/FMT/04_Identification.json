      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sir William J. Herschel Sir William J. Herschel, a British civil servant in colonial India, was instrumental in recognizing the uniqueness and permanence of fingerprints. In 1859, he began requiring Indian civil servants to sign contracts with their fingerprints, acknowledging their individuality and permanence. This practice laid the groundwork for the use of fingerprints in personal identification. Incorrect Responses: B. Sir Francis Galton: While Sir Francis Galton, a British anthropologist and cousin of Charles Darwin, made significant contributions to the study of fingerprints, including publishing a comprehensive book on the subject in 1892, he did not discover fingerprints. His work built upon the foundational observations made by Herschel. C. Sir Edward Henry: Sir Edward Henry, a British police official, developed the Henry Classification System for fingerprints, which became widely adopted for criminal identification. However, he did not discover fingerprints; his work was based on the earlier findings of Herschel and Galton. D. Sir Edmund Locard: Sir Edmund Locard was a French criminologist known for formulating Locard's Exchange Principle, which states that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as forensic evidence. He did not discover fingerprints.",

Quinacrine dihydrochloride is a fluorescent dye that binds to DNA and exhibits strong fluorescence when bound to the Y chromosome, making it effective for identifying male cells. Incorrect Responses: A. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH): While FISH is a powerful technique for detecting specific DNA sequences, it requires the use of labeled probes complementary to the target DNA. It is not a staining method but a hybridization technique. C. Feulgen reaction: The Feulgen reaction is a histochemical method for detecting DNA by hydrolyzing DNA to produce a red color.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Parietal In human skull anatomy, certain features exhibit sexual dimorphism, meaning they differ between males and females. Among the options provided, the parietal region is generally more prominent in females. In females, the parietal bones often have a more rounded and less pronounced contour compared to males. This results in a smoother and more rounded appearance of the skull's sides and top. The parietal eminences, which are the bulging areas on the sides of the skull, are typically less pronounced in females, contributing to a more rounded cranial vault. Incorrect Responses: B. Occipital: The occipital region, located at the back of the skull, is generally more pronounced in males. Features such as the external occipital protuberance (the bump at the back of the head) are more prominent in males, contributing to a more angular appearance. C. Temporal: The temporal bones, located on the sides of the skull, do not exhibit significant sexual dimorphism in terms of prominence. Both males and females have similar temporal bone structures, though overall skull robustness may differ. D. Supraorbital ridge: The supraorbital ridge, or brow ridge, is typically more pronounced in males. In females, this ridge is less prominent, contributing to a smoother forehead appearance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The coronal sutures are the joints between the frontal bone and the two parietal bones of the skull. These sutures do not close at birth—in fact, they remain open well into adulthood and begin to close (fuse) gradually with age. The closure of coronal sutures typically begins around the age of 30 to 35 years. The process is slow and variable and may not be complete until later in life (sometimes even 50+ years). Therefore, the age range 30–35 years marks the beginning of closure, making Option C the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fingerprint pattern Identical twins, or monozygotic twins, originate from a single fertilized egg that splits into two embryos, resulting in individuals with nearly identical genetic material. Despite this genetic similarity, certain physical characteristics can differ due to environmental factors during fetal development. Fingerprints are formed during fetal development and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While identical twins share the same genetic makeup, their fingerprints are not identical. Each twin's unique intrauterine environment leads to subtle differences in the formation of their fingerprints, making them distinct from one another. Incorrect Responses: B. DNA fingerprint pattern: Identical twins have the same DNA fingerprint pattern because they share identical genetic material. DNA fingerprinting analyzes unique DNA sequences, and since identical twins have the same DNA, their DNA fingerprints are indistinguishable. C. HLA system: The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system is a part of the immune system, and identical twins have the same HLA markers due to their identical genetic makeup. This similarity is crucial for organ transplantation compatibility between identical twins. D. Blood group: Blood groups are determined by specific genes, and since identical twins share the same genetic material, they have the same blood type. This genetic similarity extends to other inherited traits as well.",

Studied by histological sections. The age of an individual can be calculated by counting the number of lines from neonatal line onwards. Neonatal line is considered as an indicator of birth. This method is applicable mainly to infants. The age so calculated is accurate with an error of around 20 days. • Stack’s method: Estimation of the age of infants from the weight and height of the erupting teeth of child.

This extended detection period is due to the robust nature of teeth, which can preserve DNA for extended periods, allowing for gender determination in severely decomposed bodies. Studies have demonstrated that Y-chromosome detection in dental pulp remains feasible up to 12 months post-mortem, even in badly decomposed bodies. This is attributed to the protective environment of the dental pulp, which can preserve DNA integrity longer than other tissues.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 27 The femur, also known as the thigh bone, is the longest and strongest bone in the human body. Studies in anatomy and anthropometry have shown that the length of the femur typically constitutes about 27% of an individual's total height. This proportion is consistent across most individuals and is a reliable measure used in forensic science and anthropological studies to estimate height from skeletal remains. The reason for this relationship is that the femur plays a significant role in supporting the body’s structure and determining overall height due to its length and position in the lower limb. Incorrect Options: A. 20% This value underestimates the proportion of the femur to the total height. While some bones in the body, such as the humerus or radius, might make up a smaller percentage of height, the femur’s length is greater due to its crucial role in weight-bearing and mobility. Therefore, this percentage is too low to accurately represent the femur’s contribution to height. B. 22% Although closer to the correct value than 20%, this option is still an underestimate. The femur consistently accounts for a slightly larger proportion (around 27%) of an individual’s height, as determined through anthropometric studies and anatomical standards. D. 35% This value overestimates the femur’s proportion relative to total height. While the femur is the longest bone, 35% is unrealistically high and would imply a body structure where the legs are disproportionately long compared to the rest of the body. This value exceeds the observed anatomical norms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The subpubic angle is the angle formed by the pubic bones at the pubic symphysis. In females, this angle is typically 90º to 100º. This wider angle is an important anatomical adaptation for childbirth, providing a broader pelvic outlet to accommodate the passage of the baby during delivery. The female pelvis, compared to the male pelvis, is generally broader and has a more open shape, with a wider subpubic angle being one of its defining characteristics. This range of 90º to 100º ensures optimal functionality for reproductive purposes without compromising structural support. Incorrect Options: A. 110º An angle greater than 110º would significantly exceed the normal anatomical range for the female subpubic angle. This would indicate an unusually wide pelvis, which is atypical and not supported by standard anthropometric measurements.",

Osmium compounds are primarily used in scientific applications, such as staining biological tissues for electron microscopy, and are not designed for use in tattooing. These dyes lack the properties needed for long-lasting, safe, and stable pigmentation in the skin. Additionally, osmium compounds can be toxic, making them inappropriate for body art. Incorrect Options: A. Indian ink Indian ink, also known as India ink, is commonly used in tattooing. It contains carbon black particles that are finely dispersed in a liquid, making it suitable for creating clear and lasting designs on the skin. Its safety and stability make it a popular choice for tattoos, especially in traditional practices. B. Vermillion Vermillion is a red pigment derived from mercury sulfide. While its use is less common today due to concerns about mercury toxicity, it has historically been used in tattooing for its vibrant red color. Despite its potential health risks, it was once a standard pigment in tattooing. D. Prussian blue Prussian blue, a deep blue pigment made from iron compounds, has been used in tattooing to create blue designs. It is a stable pigment that provides a vibrant blue color, making it suitable for tattoos. Its durability and rich hue make it a popular choice for blue ink.",
