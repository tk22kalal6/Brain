      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The image shows a horizontal, well-defined, circumferential mark around the neck, which is characteristic of a ligature mark. Ligature marks are typically seen in cases of ligature strangulation or hanging and result from sustained pressure applied by a rope, wire, or similar material. The mark in the image is dry, brownish, and parchment-like in appearance, which is classic for a ligature mark after some time has passed. It is positioned above the level of the thyroid cartilage, a common location for such injuries. The pattern and depth of the mark can vary depending on the material used, duration of pressure, and force applied. Unlike graze, imprint, or pressure abrasions, ligature marks are circumferential and often associated with underlying soft tissue damage, helping to distinguish them in forensic examinations. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for the injury in the image is a ligature mark.",
