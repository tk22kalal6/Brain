      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (Sample size is less in Study A) The studies assess the association between oral contraceptive pills (OCP) use and stroke incidence in Delhi (Study A) and Mumbai (Study B), reporting the Relative Risk (RR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Step 1: Understanding Confidence Intervals (CI) and Sample Size The width of the confidence interval (CI) depends on the sample size: Larger sample size ? Narrower CI (more precise estimate) Smaller sample size ? Wider CI (less precise estimate) Study A (Delhi) reports RR = 1.4 (95% CI: 0.9–2.1) The wide CI suggests more variability and lower precision, meaning the sample size was smaller. The CI includes 1, so the association is not statistically significant. Study B (Mumbai) reports RR = 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2–1.5) The narrow CI suggests higher precision, meaning the sample size was larger. The CI does not include 1, so the association is statistically significant. Thus, Study A likely had a smaller sample size, making option B correct. Incorrect Options: A. Sample size is more in Study A A larger sample size would produce a narrower CI, but Study A has a wider CI, indicating a smaller sample size. C. P-value for Study B is >0.05 In Study B, the 95% CI (1.2–1.5) does not include 1, meaning the association is statistically significant (p 0.05, the CI would have included 1, which is not the case here. D. Results in Study B are not accurate A narrow CI means Study B has a more precise estimate with a larger sample size. The results are statistically significant and reliable.",

Step 1: Understanding Confidence Intervals (CI) and Statistical Significance A study is considered statistically significant if the 95% CI does not include 1. In this case, the CI (0.2–8.1) includes 1, meaning that smoking may not be significantly associated with oral cancer. If a confidence interval includes 1, the p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that the association is not statistically significant. Thus, p > 0.05, making option B correct. Incorrect Options: A. Study is significant – Incorrect The CI (0.2–8.1) includes 1, meaning the results are not statistically significant. If the CI did not include 1, we could conclude a significant association. C. Sample size of study is large – Incorrect A wide confidence interval (0.2–8.1) suggests high variability in estimates, likely due to a small sample size.

The null hypothesis (H?) is a statement that assumes no relationship or no effect between variables. Researchers test this assumption to either reject or fail to reject it based on study findings. In this case: Researchers want to study the association between hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. The null hypothesis must state that there is NO association between these two variables. Thus, the correct null hypothesis is: \"Hyperkalemia is not associated with cardiac arrhythmias.\" So, the correct answer is B. Incorrect Options: A. Hyperkalemia is associated with cardiac arrhythmias – Incorrect This represents the alternative hypothesis (H?), which states that an association does exist. The null hypothesis always assumes no association, making this choice incorrect. C. Hypokalemia is associated with cardiac arrhythmias – Incorrect The study is about hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), not hypokalemia (low potassium levels). This hypothesis is unrelated to the study objective. D. Hypokalemia is not associated with cardiac arrhythmias – Incorrect Again, this statement refers to hypokalemia (low potassium), but the researchers are studying hyperkalemia. The null hypothesis should be specific to the actual research question, making this choice irrelevant.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Mean) Effect of Skewed Data on Measures of Central Tendency When data is skewed (i.e., not symmetrically distributed), the mean is the most affected measure of central tendency. The mean is sensitive to extreme values because it is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total count. In a positively skewed distribution (right-skewed), where there are extreme high values, the mean shifts right (higher than the median and mode). In a negatively skewed distribution (left-skewed), where there are extreme low values, the mean shifts left (lower than the median and mode). Thus, the mean is most affected by skewed data, making A the correct answer. Incorrect Options: B. Median The median is resistant to outliers and skewed data because it represents the middle value when data is arranged in order. While skewed data can slightly shift the median, it is less affected than the mean. C. Mode The mode is the most frequently occurring value and is least affected by skewness. Even in highly skewed distributions, the mode remains unchanged unless the frequency distribution changes significantly. D. Standard Deviation Standard deviation measures the spread of data but does not define central tendency. While extreme values increase standard deviation, it is not a measure of central tendency and is not the most affected by skewness.",

The Student's t-test (also called the independent t-test) is used to compare the means of two independent groups to determine whether the difference between them is statistically significant.

Paired \"t\" test – Incorrect A paired t-test is used when the same subjects are measured before and after an intervention (e.g., pre-treatment vs. post-treatment in the same individuals). In this case, we are comparing two different groups (treatment vs. placebo), not the same individuals before and after treatment. Therefore, a paired t-test is not appropriate. C. Chi-Square Test – Incorrect The Chi-Square test is used for categorical data, not continuous variables like blood pressure.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (Stratified Random Sampling) In stratified random sampling, the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups (strata) based on a specific characteristic (e.g., religion in this case), and then a random sample is taken from each stratum proportionally to its representation in the total population. Here, the population consists of different religious groups, with varying proportions (80% Hindus, 10% Muslims, etc.). To ensure that the sample of 300 people accurately represents the community, we must sample each group proportionally to its population size. This method ensures that minority groups are not underrepresented and improves the validity of the study on food habits and non-communicable diseases. Thus, Stratified Random Sampling is the ideal method. Incorrect Options: Option A (Simple Random Sampling) – Incorrect In simple random sampling, each individual has an equal chance of being selected. However, this method may lead to overrepresentation of majority groups (e.g., Hindus) and underrepresentation of minorities (e.g., Jains, Christians), making it less suitable for this study. Option C (Systematic Random Sampling) – Incorrect In systematic random sampling, individuals are selected at regular intervals from a list (e.g., every 10th person). This method does not ensure proportional representation of different religious groups, making it unsuitable for this study. Option D (Inverse Sampling) – Incorrect Inverse sampling is used when a specific number of positive cases (e.g., cases of a disease) need to be found, and sampling continues until the required number is reached. Since we are selecting a fixed sample size (300 people) rather than looking for specific cases, inverse sampling is not applicable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (A 90% confidence interval would result in a narrower confidence interval) A confidence interval (CI) represents the range within which the true odds ratio (OR) is expected to fall, given a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). If we decrease the confidence level from 95% to 90%, the interval will become narrower because we are allowing for more uncertainty in our estimation. A wider CI (e.g., 95%) indicates more variability in the data, while a narrower CI (e.g., 90%) reduces the range but may increase the risk of missing the true population value. Since the width of a confidence interval decreases as the confidence level decreases, option C is correct. Incorrect Options: A. There is a significant association between passive smoking and cervical cancer The odds ratio (OR) = 1.3 suggests a possible association, but the 95% confidence interval (0.8–5.6) includes 1, meaning the association is not statistically significant. Since the CI includes 1, we cannot conclude a significant association between passive smoking and cervical cancer. B. The null hypothesis is rejected The null hypothesis (H?) states that there is no association between passive smoking and cervical cancer (OR = 1). Since the confidence interval (0.8–5.6) includes 1, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. To reject H?, the entire CI must be above 1 (for a positive association) or below 1 (for a protective effect). D. The ? was set at 0.10 The alpha (?) level represents the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis (Type I error). The confidence level and alpha are related: 95% confidence interval ? ? = 0.05 90% confidence interval ? ? = 0.10 However, this study used a 95% confidence interval, meaning ? was 0.05, not 0.10. Since the question does not specify using a 90% confidence level, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Paired t-test) A paired t-test is used when comparing the means of two related (paired) groups—in this case, the same individuals before and after ingestion of fries and burgers. Each participant acts as their own control, meaning the test evaluates the difference in serum cholesterol levels within the same subjects before and after eating fast food. The paired t-test accounts for the fact that observations are not independent but rather linked (i.e., pre-test and post-test measurements from the same individuals). Thus, a paired t-test is the most appropriate statistical test for this scenario. Incorrect Options: A. Chi-square analysis The Chi-square test is used for categorical data (e.g., presence vs. absence of disease, male vs. female) rather than continuous data like serum cholesterol levels. Since cholesterol levels are numerical (continuous) variables, Chi-square is not suitable for this analysis. B. Student t-test A Student’s t-test (independent t-test) compares the means between two independent groups (e.g., cholesterol levels in two different groups of people, such as fast-food eaters vs. non-fast-food eaters). However, in this study, the same individuals are measured before and after eating—making it a paired analysis rather than an independent comparison. D. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used when comparing more than two groups (e.g., cholesterol levels in people consuming different types of diets). Since this study only has two measurements per subject (before and after eating fast food), ANOVA is not needed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Systematic Sampling) Systematic sampling is a method where individuals are selected from an ordered population at regular intervals determined by a fixed constant (sampling interval). In this study, individuals are first arranged in a specific order, and then every fourth subject is selected. This follows the principle of systematic sampling, where the researcher picks a random starting point and then selects every nth individual according to a pre-determined interval (in this case, every 4th person). This method is easier and more structured than simple random sampling while maintaining randomness and representation of the population. Incorrect Options: B. Paired Sampling Paired sampling is used when two related observations (e.g., before-and-after measurements in the same individuals or matched pairs in case-control studies) are compared. The given scenario does not involve pairing subjects for direct comparison, so paired sampling is not applicable. C. Simple Random Sampling In simple random sampling (SRS), every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, often using methods like lottery or computer-generated randomization. This study does not use pure random selection but follows a systematic pattern (every 4th person), so it is not SRS. D. Stratified Sampling Stratified sampling involves dividing a population into subgroups (strata) based on characteristics like age, gender, or income, and then randomly selecting individuals within each stratum. This study does not divide participants into different strata before selecting them, so stratified sampling is not the correct choice.",
