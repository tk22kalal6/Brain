      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Pasteurization of dairy products derived from goats, sheep, or cows) Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by the Brucella species. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (milk, cheese, butter) from infected animals such as goats, sheep, and cows. Pasteurization of dairy products involves heating milk to a specific temperature to kill Brucella bacteria, effectively preventing transmission to humans. Since contaminated dairy is the most common source of infection, pasteurization is the most effective preventive measure at the population level. Other preventive measures include vaccination of livestock (not humans), proper handling of animal tissues, and protective equipment for at-risk workers. Thus, Option A is the correct answer because pasteurization directly prevents the primary mode of transmission of brucellosis. Incorrect Options: B. \"Treatment of human cases\" Treating human cases with antibiotics (doxycycline + rifampin) is essential but does not prevent new infections. Prevention focuses on reducing transmission from animals to humans, making pasteurization a better primary preventive measure. C. \"Control of the insect vector\" Brucellosis is not transmitted by insects. It spreads through direct contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated dairy, or inhalation of aerosols in slaughterhouses and farms. Vector control is not relevant to brucellosis prevention. D. \"Immunization of farmers and slaughterhouse workers\" There is no human vaccine for brucellosis; only livestock (cattle, sheep, goats) can be vaccinated. While protective measures (gloves, masks, hygiene) are important for at-risk workers, they do not eliminate the primary risk for the general population, which is contaminated dairy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (Antiretroviral therapy can be offered to reduce the chance of transmission of HIV to the newborn) The most important reason to identify HIV in a pregnant woman early is to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Without intervention, the risk of transmission is 15-45%, but with ART, safe delivery practices, and neonatal prophylaxis, it can be reduced to less than 2%. Early identification and initiation of ART significantly lower viral load, reducing the chance of vertical transmission. NACO (National AIDS Control Organization) recommends routine HIV counseling and testing for all pregnant women, followed by immediate initiation of ART if positive (as per the WHO-recommended \"Option B+\" strategy, which involves lifelong ART for all HIV-positive pregnant women). ART also improves maternal health and reduces postpartum transmission through breastfeeding. Thus, Option B is correct, as ART is the most effective way to prevent transmission to the newborn. Incorrect Options: A. \"A cesarean section can be planned to reduce HIV transmission to the newborn\" – Incorrect Cesarean section is not the first-line intervention; it is recommended only if the viral load is high (>1000 copies/mL) despite ART. ART is the primary method of prevention, and a vaginal delivery can still be safe if viral load is well-controlled. C. \"Early identification of a newborn at risk of HIV infection will improve survival\" – Incorrect While identifying an at-risk newborn helps in early intervention, the best approach is to prevent transmission in the first place by initiating ART in the mother. Neonatal ART prophylaxis is given if the mother is HIV-positive, but preventing transmission is always the priority. D. \"Counseling on pregnancy options, such as termination, can be offered\" – Incorrect HIV-positive women can have healthy pregnancies with appropriate ART and care. Termination of pregnancy is not routinely advised for HIV-positive women, as HIV is not a contraindication to pregnancy. The focus is on reducing transmission and ensuring maternal and newborn health, not pregnancy termination.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rabies, psittacosis, and salmonellosis are zoonoses, that is, infections transmitted from animals to humans. The reservoirs of rabies include domestic and wild canines, cats, skunks, raccoons, bats, and other biting mammals. Psittacosis is a zoonosis involving birds such as parakeets, parrots, pigeons, turkeys, and other domestic fowl. Salmonella species infect poultry, rodents, dogs, cats, and birds. (S. typhi is an exception in that no animal hosts are known.) Tuberculosis, influenza, and measles are transmitted through airborne droplet spread. Only measles could also be spread by direct person-to person contact. Cyclospora, Campylobacter, and Yersinia have been implicated in waterborne outbreaks.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Immunogenicity is a term that describes the ability of a microbe or purified antigen to induce specific antibody production in a host as a result of infection or immunization. For example, measles virus is very immunogenic because most persons develop neutralizing antibody, which persists for life following a single infection. Pathogenicity is the capacity of a microbe to cause symptomatic illness in an infected host. The enormous numbers of nonpathogenic bacteria (up to 1010 per gram of colonic contents present in the human body) and the normal flora on the human body’s external surface do not cause disease. Virulence refers to the severity of illness produced by a microbe and is measured by the percentage of severe or fatal cases. Virulence may vary depending on the defenses of the host; for example, malnutrition impairs defenses against infection. In malnourished children, measles has a casefatality rate of up to 10% compared with less than 0.1% in well-nourished children. Infectivity (or contagiousness) of a microbe refers to the ability of a microbe to spread in a population of exposed susceptible persons. The secondary attack rate, that is, the incidence of a disease in contacts of a case, often is used to assess contagiousness.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) recommends chemoprophylaxis for selective groups in high P. falciparum endemic areas. Use of personal protection measures including Insecticide Treated bed Nets (ITN) / Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN) is encouraged for pregnant women and other vulnerable population including travellers for longer stay. However, for longer stay of Military and Para-military forces in high P. falciparum endemic areas, the practice of chemoprophylaxis should be followed wherever appropriate, e.g. troops on night patrol duty, and decisions of their Medical Administrative Authority should be followed. For Short Term Prophylaxis (less than 6 weeks): Doxycycline, 100 mg daily in adults and 1.5 mg/kg for children more than 8 years old; it should be started 2 days before travel and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnant women and children less than 8 years. For long-term chemoprophylaxis (more than 6 weeks): Mefloquine 5 mg/kg bw (up to 250 mg) weekly; it should be administered two weeks before, during and four weeks after leaving the area. Mefloquine is contraindicated in cases with history of convulsions, neuropsychiatric problems and cardiac conditions.",

Prevents direct contamination of food with S. aureus from infected cuts, skin lesions, or nasal carriers. Incorrect Options: A. Freezing the food – Incorrect Freezing stops bacterial growth but does not kill the preformed enterotoxins of S. aureus. Enterotoxins are heat-stable and resistant to freezing. B.
