      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bagassosis. Under the Indian Factory Act, certain occupational diseases are required to be notified to ensure proper medical monitoring and compensation for workers affected by them. Bagassosis, which is a lung disease caused by inhaling dust from sugarcane bagasse (a fibrous byproduct of sugarcane), is not specifically listed as a notifiable disease under the Act. The Act typically focuses on diseases related to dust inhalation in industries like mining and textiles, but bagassosis is not included. Bagassosis is a disease linked to the agricultural and sugar industries but is not included in the list of notifiable diseases under the Indian Factory Act. The disease, while harmful, is not as widely recognized in the regulatory framework compared to diseases like silicosis, asbestosis, or byssinosis. Incorrect Options: A (Silicosis): Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust, often in mining, stone cutting, or construction industries. It is notifiable under the Indian Factory Act because of its serious health impacts. B (Asbestosis): Asbestosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers, and it is notifiable under the Indian Factory Act. It affects workers in industries that involve asbestos exposure, such as construction, shipbuilding, and manufacturing. C (Byssinosis): Byssinosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling cotton dust in textile mills and is notifiable under the Indian Factory Act. It is known as \"brown lung disease\" and is monitored for workers in the cotton industry.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Depends on type of exposure. The ideal periodical examination of workers in an industry is determined by the type of exposure they face in the workplace. Workers exposed to hazardous substances, physical strain, or toxic conditions (e.g., chemicals, noise, dust, etc.) need more frequent health assessments than those in less risky environments. The frequency of medical examinations is tailored based on the risks associated with the particular work environment to ensure worker safety and prevent occupational diseases. Medical examinations are not standardized for all industries. High-risk workers (such as those in mining, construction, and chemical industries) might require more frequent examinations, while others in low-risk environments may require only annual check-ups. The frequency is adjusted based on factors such as the toxicity of materials, duration of exposure, physical demands, and the potential for long-term health effects. Incorrect Options: A (Day): Daily examinations are unnecessary and impractical for most industries unless the workers are exposed to extremely hazardous conditions or substances (e.g., immediate risks). Regular checks, not daily, are sufficient for most workplaces. B (Month): Monthly examinations are also excessive for most industries. They might be appropriate in industries with a very high risk of exposure to toxins or hazardous conditions but are not the standard for all industries. C (Year): While annual check-ups are the general recommendation for many industries, this is not sufficient for workers with significant or continuous exposure to dangerous substances or working conditions. More frequent exams may be necessary based on the risks they face.",

It leads to chest tightness, coughing, and other respiratory symptoms, but it is unrelated to sugarcane exposure. C (Tobacosis): Tobacosis is not a recognized medical term for an occupational disease. However, exposure to tobacco dust can cause respiratory issues, but this is not the term used for diseases related to tobacco dust exposure. The disease more commonly associated with tobacco dust exposure would be farmer's lung (if related to hay and mold).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 500 cu ft. Under the Indian Factory Act, 1948, the minimum air space per worker in a factory is prescribed as 500 cubic feet. This requirement ensures that there is adequate ventilation and airflow in the workplace to maintain a healthy environment and reduce the risk of respiratory problems and heat stress. Providing enough air space per worker is important for worker comfort and safety, especially in large, enclosed areas such as factories. The Indian Factory Act, 1948 specifies that each worker should have a minimum of 500 cubic feet of air space in the workplace to ensure proper ventilation and to prevent overcrowding. Incorrect Options: A (200 cu ft): 200 cubic feet per worker is far too small and does not meet the safety and health standards required for adequate ventilation in factory settings. B (300 cu ft): 300 cubic feet per worker also does not meet the standard prescribed by the Indian Factory Act. It is still insufficient for providing adequate ventilation. D (700 cu ft): While 700 cubic feet per worker might be preferable for optimal comfort and ventilation, the minimum requirement under the Indian Factory Act is 500 cubic feet per worker. 700 cubic feet is not the prescribed minimum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Vibration. “White fingers” is a condition that refers to vibration-induced white finger (VWF), which is a form of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) caused by prolonged exposure to hand-arm vibration from tools like pneumatic drills, chainsaws, or other vibrating machinery. The condition results in the narrowing of blood vessels, leading to restricted blood flow and causing fingers to appear white due to lack of circulation, especially in cold environments. It can result in permanent damage to the blood vessels, nerves, and tissues if exposure continues. Vibration causes white fingers due to repetitive and prolonged exposure to hand-arm vibration, which leads to reduced blood flow and oxygen to the fingers, especially during cold weather. Over time, this can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and whitening of the fingers. It's a recognized occupational hazard in certain industries. Incorrect Options: A (Heat): While heat can cause various conditions like heat exhaustion or burns, it does not lead to white fingers. Heat exposure typically causes blood vessels to dilate, improving blood flow, and would not cause the constriction of blood vessels seen in white fingers. B (Cold): Cold exposure can lead to conditions such as frostbite or Raynaud’s disease, where blood vessels constrict in response to cold, but it does not directly cause white fingers from vibration-induced damage. Cold-induced conditions are related to environmental temperature, not vibration. C (UV radiation): UV radiation is associated with skin damage, including sunburn, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer. It does not cause the blood vessel constriction seen in white fingers, which is specifically a result of vibration exposure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lung cancer. Nearly three-fourths of occupational cancers are related to lung cancer. This is primarily due to exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, such as asbestos, benzene, coal tar, and radon, all of which are linked to the development of lung cancer. Occupational environments like mining, construction, and manufacturing have high levels of such carcinogenic exposures, making lung cancer the most common type of occupational cancer. Lung cancer accounts for the largest proportion of occupational cancers due to exposure to harmful substances like asbestos and radon in industries such as construction, mining, and manufacturing. These exposures lead to significant risks for developing lung cancer in workers over time. Incorrect Options: A (Skin cancer): Skin cancer is an important occupational cancer, particularly in workers exposed to UV radiation (e.g., in outdoor construction, agriculture, and other outdoor occupations). However, it does not account for the majority of occupational cancers, with lung cancer being the more common one. C (Cancer of the bladder): Bladder cancer is also a significant occupational cancer, particularly in workers exposed to chemicals like aromatic amines in the rubber, dye, and chemical industries. However, it makes up a smaller proportion of occupational cancers compared to lung cancer. D (Leukaemia): Leukemia can be caused by exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene, especially in workers in the chemical industry or those exposed to radiation. However, leukemia is much less common as an occupational cancer compared to lung cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Occupational health. Pre-placement examinations are conducted before an employee is assigned to a job, and they play a crucial role in occupational health. These exams help assess the worker's physical fitness and determine whether they are suited for the specific demands of the job. The goal is to identify any potential health risks, existing medical conditions, or disabilities that may affect job performance or pose a risk in the workplace. By screening for conditions that might affect the employee's ability to perform tasks safely, pre-placement exams help prevent workplace injuries and promote a safer working environment. Pre-placement health assessments are a key part of occupational health programs, ensuring that workers are physically and mentally fit for the roles they will perform. These exams are particularly important in industries with high risks of injury or exposure to hazardous materials (e.g., construction, manufacturing, healthcare), helping to identify health risks early and ensure safety for both the employee and the organization. Incorrect Options: A (Energy conservation): While energy conservation is an important aspect of workplace sustainability, it is not directly related to pre-placement examinations. These exams focus more on assessing health and fitness rather than energy-related factors. C (Genetic counselling): Genetic counseling involves the assessment of genetic risks and is typically done in the context of personal health, not occupational suitability. Pre-placement exams are not typically associated with genetic counseling, although some workplaces might require genetic testing for specific health conditions (e.g., workers exposed to certain chemicals). D (Mental health): While mental health is an important aspect of overall health and may be assessed during pre-placement exams, the primary focus of these exams is on physical health and occupational suitability. Mental health evaluations are often separate and part of broader health assessments or employee support programs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 91 days. Under the Employees' State Insurance (ESI) Act, sickness benefits are provided to insured employees who are temporarily unable to work due to sickness. The Act specifies that sickness benefits are payable for a period of 91 days during a benefit period (which is typically a six-month period) provided that the employee has been contributing to the scheme for a certain number of days prior to the sickness. Under the ESI Act, an employee can receive sickness benefits for up to 91 days in a year if they are unable to work due to illness and have fulfilled the necessary eligibility criteria. Incorrect Options: A (17 days): 17 days is not the duration specified under the ESI Act for sickness benefits. This may be confused with the waiting period or eligibility period, but sickness benefits are provided for 91 days, not 17 days. B (39 days): 39 days is not the correct duration for sickness benefits under the ESI Act. The correct duration is 91 days as per the Act.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Mesothelioma of Pleura) Mesothelioma of the pleura is a rare, aggressive malignancy that occurs almost exclusively in individuals with a history of asbestos exposure. Key Points About Asbestos Exposure and Mesothelioma: Asbestos fibers, when inhaled, become embedded in the pleura (lining of the lungs), leading to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately malignant transformation. Latency period is long—mesothelioma often develops 20-50 years after initial exposure. Unlike bronchogenic carcinoma, which can have multiple causes (e.g., smoking), mesothelioma is strongly linked to occupational asbestos exposure. Common occupations at risk: Construction workers, shipyard workers, miners, factory workers, and those in insulation industries. Key clinical symptoms: Progressive dyspnea, chest pain, and pleural effusion. Incorrect Options: A. Bronchogenic carcinoma Asbestos exposure increases the risk of bronchogenic carcinoma, but this cancer can also be caused by smoking, air pollution, and other occupational exposures. Smoking and asbestos exposure together have a synergistic effect, further increasing lung cancer risk. B. Byssinosis Byssinosis (\"brown lung disease\") is caused by exposure to cotton, flax, or hemp dust (not asbestos). Typically seen in textile industry workers, it presents with chronic cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. D. Laryngeal carcinoma Laryngeal cancer is associated with smoking, alcohol use, and HPV infection. Asbestos exposure can increase the risk, but it is not exclusive to asbestos-exposed individuals",

The most likely outcome for the nearby workers would be temporary conductive hearing loss due to damage to the middle ear structures from the sudden acoustic trauma. Effects of High-Intensity Noise (Acoustic Trauma): Sound levels above 85 dB can cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure. Sound levels above 120 dB (like a jet engine at close range) can cause immediate pain and damage. Sound levels above 150 dB-190 dB (like explosions) can cause severe mechanical damage to the ear. At 190 dB, the following effects are likely: Middle Ear Barotrauma (Conductive Hearing Loss) Damage to the tympanic membrane (eardrum rupture) Dislocation of the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) Hemotympanum (blood in the middle ear) Temporary Conductive Hearing Loss Due to middle ear trauma and eustachian tube dysfunction Reversible in most cases unless the damage is severe Incorrect Options: A. Temporary Tinnitus While temporary tinnitus (ringing in ears) is common after loud noise exposure, the primary issue here is conductive hearing loss due to middle ear damage. C. Permanent Conductive Hearing Loss Conductive hearing loss from barotrauma is usually temporary and improves with time, unless there is severe structural damage (e.g., ossicle fracture). D. Temporary Sensorineural Hearing Loss Sensorineural hearing loss is due to cochlear hair cell damage, which occurs from prolonged exposure to loud noise (e.g., factory work, concerts). In sudden high-intensity sound like an explosion, the primary damage is conductive (middle ear).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) In case of radiation exposure disturbances begin to occur at exposures above 100 rem. Following an acute exposure to 100 to 200 rem of ionizing radiation, mild hematopoietic disturbances may occur after a few weeks, which only warrant surveillance. Some patients may have vomiting three hours after the exposure. Between 200 and 600 rem, more severe hematopoietic disturbances will occur, with a peak at 4 to 6 weeks, requiring transfusions, antibiotics, and hematopoietic growth factors. Patients will vomit within two hours. Extreme disturbances will occur after an acute exposure of 600 to 1000 rem, with a high case fatality rate. Vomiting will occur within one hour.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Atropine) The farm laborer’s symptoms (blurred vision, excessive salivation, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, sweating, and miosis) strongly suggest acute organophosphate poisoning due to pesticide exposure from spraying in the field. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to an excessive accumulation of acetylcholine at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, resulting in cholinergic toxicity. Key Signs of Organophosphate Poisoning: Muscarinic Effects (\"SLUDGE\" or DUMBBELLS Mnemonic): Salivation Lacrimation Urination Diarrhea Gastrointestinal cramps Emesis (vomiting) Nicotinic Effects: Muscle weakness Fasciculations Respiratory distress (due to diaphragm paralysis) CNS Symptoms: Confusion Seizures Coma Most Effective Initial Treatment: Atropine – Correct Answer Atropine is the first-line antidote because it competitively blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, reversing the life-threatening cholinergic effects (bradycardia, hypotension, salivation, bronchospasm). Dosage: 1–2 mg IV every 5–15 minutes until secretions are controlled. Additional Management: Pralidoxime (2-PAM) should be given after atropine to reactivate acetylcholinesterase and reverse nicotinic effects (muscle weakness, paralysis). Incorrect Options: A. Rapid Administration of IV Fluids IV fluids may be needed if the patient is hypotensive, but they do not reverse cholinergic toxicity. B. Evaporative Cooling Cooling measures are used for heat stroke, but this patient has cholinergic toxicity, not heat illness. D. Observation Only Delayed treatment can be fatal due to respiratory failure from excessive secretions and diaphragm paralysis. Immediate atropine administration is required.",
