      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) There is complete interruption of disease transmission in the entire area of the community. Eradication of a disease means that the disease has been permanently eliminated worldwide, and there is no further risk of it reappearing. This requires stopping the disease in every part of the world and is different from control or elimination, which may apply to certain regions. The statement in A is incorrect because complete interruption of disease transmission in the entire area of the community is not required for eradication. Eradication focuses on complete elimination of the disease and its transmission on a global scale, not just in specific areas or communities. Incorrect Options: B. Eradication programme is over once the disease has been certified as having been eradicated: This is correct. Once a disease has been confirmed as eradicated through global surveillance, verification, and monitoring, the eradication program is considered complete. The certification process ensures that no further cases are found, and no risk remains. C. Case finding is of secondary importance: This is correct. In an eradication program, case finding is important but may not be the primary focus once the disease is nearly eradicated. The emphasis is more on surveillance, prevention, and ensuring no new cases occur. The primary goal is to eliminate the disease globally, which involves interventions such as vaccination and public health measures rather than ongoing active case finding. D. The objective is to eliminate the disease to the extent that no new case occurs in the future: This is correct. The ultimate goal of an eradication program is to eliminate the disease completely, ensuring that no new cases will occur in the future, even without ongoing vaccination or intervention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Measles. Despite significant progress, measles has not been fully eliminated from India. Although the country has made substantial efforts through vaccination campaigns and improved healthcare, outbreaks of measles still occur in some areas, especially where vaccination coverage is inadequate. Measles is still a major public health concern in India. Despite efforts to increase vaccination coverage, there are still outbreaks of the disease, especially in areas with lower immunization rates. India aims to eliminate measles through the Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccination campaign, but as of now, it has not been fully eradicated. Incorrect Options: A. Smallpox: Smallpox was officially declared eradicated globally in 1980, and India was one of the countries that contributed significantly to the success of the eradication campaign. The last case of smallpox in India was reported in 1975, and India is now considered smallpox-free. B. Guinea worm disease: Guinea worm disease has been successfully eliminated in India. The country reported its last indigenous case in 2000, and it is considered Guinea worm-free now. C. Yaws: Yaws, a chronic bacterial infection, was successfully eliminated in India by 2016 through mass treatment campaigns and other public health measures. The disease no longer poses a public health threat in the country.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared smallpox eradicated in 1980 after a successful global vaccination campaign, making it the first disease to be completely eradicated. Incorrect Options: B. Guinea worm: While significant progress has been made in the fight against Guinea worm disease, it has not been fully eradicated yet. Cases have decreased dramatically, but the disease has not been completely wiped out worldwide. The eradication effort is ongoing, and there have been zero cases reported in India and most other countries. C. Polio: Polio is another disease that is close to being eradicated, but it has not yet been completely wiped out globally. The disease is still present in a few countries, and eradication efforts are ongoing. The WHO has set a goal to eliminate polio completely, but as of now, it has not been fully eradicated. D. Diphtheria: Diphtheria has not been eradicated worldwide. While it is well-controlled in many parts of the world due to vaccination, it still exists in some countries, and outbreaks can occur in regions with low vaccination rates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) is not currently considered an eradicable disease because the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is widespread and can persist in human populations despite efforts to control it. TB is a complex disease that involves long-term treatment regimens and faces challenges such as drug resistance, making complete eradication difficult at this time. Incorrect Options: B. Guinea worm disease: Guinea worm disease has been targeted for eradication, and significant progress has been made. The number of cases has decreased drastically, with only a few reported cases in recent years, indicating that eradication is feasible. C. Poliomyelitis: Polio is another disease that is a candidate for eradication. Through global vaccination campaigns, polio cases have dramatically decreased, and the disease is almost eradicated worldwide, with only a few cases remaining. D. Measles: Measles has been identified as a target for eradication. Although it has not yet been eradicated globally, vaccination efforts have significantly reduced its incidence, and there is hope for eventual eradication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 6 days after onset of rash. Chickenpox (varicella) is highly contagious, and its infectivity lasts from about 1-2 days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. However, the contagious period officially ends around 6 days after the onset of the rash, once the last of the blisters have scabbed over. This is the period during which a person with chickenpox can spread the infection to others. Incorrect Options: A. Till the last scab falls off: This is incorrect because while the last scab falling off marks the end of visible lesions, it is the 6-day period after rash onset that defines when the infectivity ends, not the physical appearance of the scabs. C. 3 days after onset of rash: This is incorrect. Chickenpox remains infectious for 6 days after the rash starts, not 3 days. D. Till the fever subsides: The fever subsiding does not necessarily coincide with the end of the contagious period. A person may still be infectious after the fever has gone down.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cross resistance existed with animal pox. Smallpox eradication was successful due to several key factors, but cross-resistance with animal pox did not significantly contribute to its eradication. While some similarities exist between smallpox and other poxviruses (such as cowpox and monkeypox), these viruses did not provide widespread cross-immunity sufficient to eliminate smallpox from human populations. The eradication relied primarily on effective vaccination, surveillance, and containment strategies rather than cross-resistance from animal pox. Incorrect Options: A. Subclinical cases did not transmit the disease – Correct Contribution to Eradication One of the most critical factors in smallpox eradication was the absence of subclinical (asymptomatic) infections. Every infected person exhibited clear symptoms (such as fever and rash), making it easier to identify and isolate cases, stopping further transmission. B. A highly effective vaccine was available – Correct Contribution to Eradication The smallpox vaccine, derived from vaccinia virus, was highly effective in providing immunity. It induced a strong immune response and provided long-term protection, making mass vaccination campaigns highly successful. C. Infection provided lifelong immunity – Correct Contribution to Eradication Unlike some infections that allow reinfection or require booster doses for continued immunity, smallpox infection provided lifelong immunity. This meant that once a person recovered, they could no longer spread or contract the disease, helping to reduce the susceptible population over time.",

Smallpox remains the only human disease to have been completely eradicated through vaccination. Incorrect Options: A. 26th October 1977 – Incorrect This date is significant because the last naturally occurring case of smallpox (Variola major) was reported in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital worker in Somalia. However, smallpox was not officially declared eradicated until 1980. B. 5th July 1975 – Incorrect This was the date of the last known case of Variola minor (a less severe form of smallpox) in Rahima Banu, a child from Bangladesh.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Catch-up because a \"Catch-up\" campaign is a mass immunization strategy aimed at vaccinating children who may have missed their routine measles vaccination, helping to close immunity gaps. In the measles elimination strategy, Catch-up campaigns are conducted in children aged 9 months to 15 years to rapidly increase population immunity and interrupt measles transmission. These campaigns are one-time, large-scale efforts to vaccinate all susceptible individuals in the target age group, ensuring measles elimination. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Keep-up – Incorrect \"Keep-up\" vaccination refers to routine immunization provided through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to ensure all newborns receive their measles vaccine at the recommended age. It is an ongoing process, not a mass campaign for elimination. B. Follow-up – Incorrect \"Follow-up\" campaigns are periodic mass vaccination efforts, usually conducted every 3-5 years, to prevent the accumulation of susceptible children and maintain high immunity levels. These campaigns target children aged 9 months to 5 years, not the broader 9 months to 15 years group. C. Mop-up – Incorrect \"Mop-up\" campaigns are small-scale, localized vaccination efforts targeting specific areas where measles cases continue to occur. They are used in outbreak response or to reach missed populations but are not the main strategy for elimination.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 95. To achieve measles eradication, at least 95% of the infant population must be vaccinated. This is a critical threshold to ensure herd immunity, which helps protect those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised individuals). A 95% vaccination coverage rate is essential for preventing measles outbreaks and ensuring that the virus is no longer circulating in the community. Achieving this level of vaccination ensures that even if a few individuals are susceptible, the disease will not spread widely, as most individuals will be immune. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. 70% – Incorrect A vaccination rate of 70% is insufficient to prevent widespread transmission of measles. At this level, outbreaks are still likely to occur, as herd immunity is not adequately achieved. B. 80% – Incorrect An 80% vaccination rate is still too low to achieve eradication. It would not provide the strong immunity threshold necessary to stop the spread of the virus. C. 85% – Incorrect While 85% vaccination coverage is better than lower percentages, it still falls short of the 95% target needed for measles eradication.",
