      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rain water. Rain water is considered the purest water in nature because it is initially collected as vapor from water bodies and undergoes condensation in the atmosphere. Since it has no contact with contaminants on the ground, it is free from impurities such as salts, minerals, and microbes. However, rainwater can pick up pollutants as it falls through the atmosphere, but in its purest form, it is considered the cleanest form of water. Incorrect Options: A. River water – River water contains various impurities, including minerals, organic matter, and pollutants from the surrounding environment. It is often contaminated with human activities, agricultural runoff, and industrial discharges, making it far less pure than rainwater. C. Deep well – Deep well water may be relatively cleaner than surface water, but it still contains dissolved minerals and may have contaminants depending on the geological formation. It is also susceptible to pollution if the aquifer is not protected. D. Impounding reservoirs – Impounding reservoirs often collect water from rivers or streams, which can introduce sediments, bacteria, and other pollutants. Water in reservoirs is treated to make it suitable for consumption, but it is not as pure as rainwater.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1 ppm free chlorine should be present in water after break point has reached. Incorrect Options: 1 ppm free chlorine should be present in water after break point has reached – This statement is incorrect because, at the break point chlorination, the chlorine dose added is typically sufficient to oxidize ammonia and organic matter, as well as disinfect the water. However, the requirement is not necessarily for 1 ppm of free chlorine to remain. The exact amount of free chlorine present after break point depends on the chlorine demand and the initial quality of the water, but it is not a fixed 1 ppm. Incorrect Options: A. Free chlorine is released in water after break point – This statement is true. After the break point is reached, free chlorine is released in the water, and it becomes available to disinfect the water effectively. B. Chlorine demand is the amount needed to kill bacteria, oxidize organic matter, and neutralize ammonia – This statement is true. Chlorine demand refers to the amount of chlorine required to neutralize contaminants such as bacteria, organic matter, and ammonia in water. D. Contact period of 1 hour is necessary – This statement is true. A contact period of around 1 hour is generally recommended after reaching the break point chlorination to ensure that chlorine has sufficient time to react with the contaminants and disinfect the water properly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 50 mg/l. Incorrect Options: 50 mg/l – Nitrates in water, when present in concentrations greater than 50 mg/l, can pose a risk for infantile methaemoglobinaemia (also known as \"blue baby syndrome\"). This condition occurs when nitrates in the water are converted to nitrites, which then interfere with the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen. Infants are particularly vulnerable to this condition, as their bodies are not fully capable of processing excess nitrates. Incorrect Options: A. 15 mg/l – 15 mg/l is far below the threshold that is known to cause infantile methaemoglobinaemia. Although higher nitrate levels can still affect health, this concentration is not typically associated with the onset of this condition. B. 25 mg/l – Similarly, 25 mg/l is still below the harmful threshold. While it is always important to minimize nitrate levels in drinking water, this concentration is not considered to cause significant risk of methaemoglobinaemia. C. 35 mg/l – Again, 35 mg/l is not considered to cause infantile methaemoglobinaemia. The generally accepted threshold for concern is 50 mg/l, which is why this option is not correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cl. tetani. Explanation of Correct Response: Cl. tetani – Clostridium tetani, the bacteria responsible for tetanus, is not typically used as an indicator of fecal pollution. It is a pathogen that can be found in soil, animal manure, and human feces, but its presence is not specifically related to recent fecal contamination in water sources. Tetanus is more of a concern due to wounds than as an indicator of waterborne contamination. Incorrect Options: A. Faecal streptococci – Faecal streptococci are bacteria commonly found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. They are used as indicators of fecal contamination in water. Their presence suggests that the water has been contaminated by human or animal waste. B. Coliform – Coliforms, especially Escherichia coli, are widely used as indicators of fecal contamination. Their presence in water typically indicates that the water has been contaminated with fecal matter, potentially containing harmful pathogens. D. Enteropathogenic virus – Enteropathogenic viruses (such as enteric viruses) are commonly found in feces and can be transmitted through contaminated water. Their presence is a direct indicator of fecal contamination and the potential for waterborne diseases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 150-200 lit. 150-200 lit – The recommended per capita water allowance for urban areas is typically in the range of 150-200 liters per day. This higher water allowance accounts for the increased demand in urban areas, where water usage is higher due to factors such as domestic needs, sanitation, and industrial purposes. Additionally, urban populations tend to have greater access to piped water and sanitation services, further increasing the per capita consumption. Incorrect Options: A. 70-80 lit – 70-80 liters per day is generally considered insufficient for urban areas. This range is closer to what might be appropriate for rural or less-developed areas where water usage is typically lower due to limited infrastructure and different lifestyles. B. 80-120 lit – 80-120 liters is also on the lower end and may be more suitable for rural areas or small towns where the demand for water is not as high as in large urban centers. In an urban setting, this would likely be inadequate for the needs of the population. C. 120-150 lit – 120-150 liters might be a reasonable estimate for smaller urban areas or suburban settings, but it is generally lower than the recommended per capita water allowance for larger, more developed cities where the water demand is higher.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) No E. coli in 100 ml. No E. coli in 100 ml – The recommended standard for bacterial water quality in small community supplies is to have no E. coli in 100 ml of water. E. coli is a specific indicator of fecal contamination, and its presence in drinking water is a strong sign that the water may contain harmful pathogens. Ensuring there is no E. coli is critical for safe drinking water and to prevent waterborne diseases. Incorrect Options: A. No coliform – While no coliform in water is an ideal standard, it is generally not considered a practical target for routine water quality monitoring in small community supplies. Coliforms are a broader group of bacteria, and their presence does not always directly indicate fecal contamination, whereas the presence of E. coli is a more specific and reliable indicator of recent fecal contamination. C. Coliform less than 10/100 ml – A limit of less than 10 coliforms per 100 ml may be used as a guideline in some contexts, but it is less specific than focusing on E. coli. Coliform bacteria include a wide range of species, and while their presence suggests possible contamination, their concentration does not directly correlate to the same level of risk as E. coli. D. Coliform less than 5/100 ml – Similar to Option C, this is another standard for coliform levels, but it is not as specific or stringent as requiring no E. coli. Focusing on E. coli as an indicator provides more direct assurance of water safety and health.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. Calcium and magnesium bicarbonates – Temporary hardness of water is primarily due to the presence of calcium and magnesium bicarbonates (Ca(HCO3)2 and Mg(HCO3)2). This type of hardness is called \"temporary\" because it can be removed by boiling the water. When boiled, calcium and magnesium bicarbonates decompose into insoluble carbonates, which precipitate out of the water, thus reducing the hardness. Incorrect Options: A. Calcium and magnesium sulphates – Calcium and magnesium sulphates contribute to permanent hardness, not temporary hardness. Sulfate salts of calcium and magnesium do not precipitate upon boiling, so they cannot be removed by boiling the water. B. Calcium and magnesium chlorides – Calcium and magnesium chlorides also contribute to permanent hardness. Similar to sulfates, chlorides do not precipitate when water is boiled, and thus cannot be removed by boiling. D. Calcium and magnesium nitrates – Calcium and magnesium nitrates also cause permanent hardness. Like the chlorides and sulfates, these salts do not precipitate upon boiling, so they cannot be removed through boiling.",

Chlorine demand – Horrock’s apparatus is used to estimate chlorine demand, which is the amount of chlorine required to disinfect water, considering both the chlorine needed to neutralize impurities and the chlorine required to react with pollutants in the water. The apparatus is used in water treatment to determine how much chlorine should be added to meet the required disinfection standards. Incorrect Options: A. Free chlorine – Free chlorine refers to the chlorine present in water that is available to disinfect, either as chlorine gas or hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Horrock’s apparatus does not specifically estimate free chlorine, but rather the total chlorine demand. B. Combined chlorine – Combined chlorine is the chlorine that has reacted with contaminants in the water, forming chloramines. Horrock’s apparatus does not directly estimate combined chlorine, but it helps estimate the chlorine demand, which indirectly accounts for both free and combined chlorine. C. (A) + (B) – This option suggests that Horrock’s apparatus estimates the sum of free and combined chlorine. While the apparatus helps to estimate the chlorine demand, it does not directly measure the specific levels of free or combined chlorine separately. Instead, it focuses on the total chlorine demand needed for water treatment.",

Free and combined chlorine in water – The Ortho-toluidine test is used to determine both free chlorine (the chlorine available for disinfection) and combined chlorine (chlorine that has reacted with contaminants to form chloramines) in water. The test uses the reaction of ortho-toluidine with chlorine in the water to produce a color change, which is then measured to estimate the chlorine content. Incorrect Options: A. Nitrates in water – The ortho-toluidine test is not used to determine nitrates in water. Nitrates are typically measured using methods like colorimetry with reagents specific to nitrate ions, such as diphenylamine. B. Nitrites in water – The ortho-toluidine test is also not used for measuring nitrites in water. Nitrites can be measured using a variety of other specific tests, including the use of colorimetric reagents for nitrite detection. D. Ammonia content in water – Although ammonia is an important water quality parameter, the ortho-toluidine test does not measure ammonia content. Ammonia is usually measured using methods like the Nessler's reagent test, which involves a different chemical reaction.",

This range is generally considered to be ideal for the taste and refreshment qualities of water, providing a comfortable and cool drinking experience without being too cold or too warm. Incorrect Options: A. 0-5°C – While very cold water may seem refreshing, 0-5°C is typically too cold for drinking water, especially for prolonged consumption. Extremely cold water can be uncomfortable to drink and may cause a constriction of blood vessels, which is not ideal for hydration. B. 5-10°C – While this is still a relatively cool temperature, it is not as ideal as 10-15°C, which is the preferred range for most people. At 5-10°C, the water is still quite cool, but not as optimal for regular drinking compared to the slightly warmer 10-15°C. D. 15-20°C – This range is somewhat on the warmer side.

Even small amounts of lead exposure can be highly toxic, especially for young children and pregnant women. It can lead to severe health problems such as developmental delays, neurological damage, and kidney problems. Because of its harmful effects on health, it is strictly regulated and should not be present in drinking water. Incorrect Options: A. Iron – While iron can cause staining and a metallic taste in water, it is generally not as harmful as lead. In large quantities, iron can lead to gastrointestinal issues, but it is not considered as dangerous to health as lead. B. Copper – Copper is another metal that can be found in drinking water, particularly in areas with copper plumbing. Excessive copper levels can lead to nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal issues, but it is typically less toxic than lead. C. Zinc – Zinc is an essential nutrient in small quantities, and its presence in drinking water is not usually harmful in typical concentrations. High concentrations can cause stomach upset, but it is far less hazardous compared to lead.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Water washed disease. Water washed disease – Scabies is classified as a water-washed disease. This means it is spread through close personal contact and by sharing contaminated clothing or bedding. While water does not directly transmit the infection, a lack of access to clean water for washing can increase the likelihood of infection, as poor hygiene and the inability to wash clothing and bedding regularly can facilitate the spread of the mite (Sarcoptes scabei) that causes scabies. Incorrect Options: A. Water borne disease – Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or parasites) that are transmitted through contaminated water. Scabies is not caused by a pathogen in water, so it does not fit into this category. C. Water based disease – Water-based diseases are caused by aquatic organisms (e.g., parasites) that need water to complete their life cycle. Scabies does not fit this category because it is caused by a mite that lives on the skin, not by an organism dependent on water. D. Water related disease – This term typically refers to diseases that are indirectly related to water, such as diseases spread through water contamination affecting food, sanitation, or the environment. Scabies is more specifically classified as a water-washed disease due to its relationship to hygiene and cleanliness.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Frequent washing is not required. Frequent washing is not required – This statement is incorrect because rapid sand filters require frequent backwashing or cleaning. During the filtration process, the filter media (usually sand) accumulates particles and impurities, which need to be flushed out regularly to maintain the efficiency of the filter. Therefore, frequent washing is indeed required to prevent clogging and to ensure the proper functioning of the filter. Incorrect Options: A. No preliminary storage of raw water is required – This is true. Rapid sand filters can operate without the need for extensive preliminary storage of raw water. In fact, they are designed to handle the flow of water directly through the filtration system, which makes them suitable for continuous filtration in water treatment plants. B. Operation requires highly skilled persons – This is also true. While rapid sand filters are effective, their operation and maintenance do require skilled personnel. Monitoring the filtration process, adjusting flow rates, and managing the backwashing procedure all require technical expertise to ensure the filter is operating efficiently. D. Can be gravity types or pressure – This is true. Rapid sand filters can be designed to operate either under gravity (where water flows through the filter media due to gravitational force) or under pressure (where water is forced through the filter media using a pump). Both designs are commonly used depending on the specific needs of the water treatment system.",

When chlorine is added to water, it reacts with water to form hypochlorous acid, which is a powerful disinfectant. Hypochlorous acid is highly effective in killing bacteria and viruses by disrupting their cell walls and interfering with their metabolic processes. Incorrect Options: A. Hydrogen chloride – Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is not primarily responsible for the disinfecting action of chlorine in water. While chlorine can produce hydrogen chloride in some reactions, it is not the active disinfectant form in this context. C. Hypochlorite ions – Hypochlorite ions are formed when chlorine reacts with water, but they are less effective than hypochlorous acid in disinfecting. Hypochlorite ions are more stable in basic (alkaline) conditions and less effective as a disinfectant compared to hypochlorous acid, which is more effective in slightly acidic to neutral conditions. D. Hydrogen ions – Hydrogen ions are part of the acidity in the water, but they do not contribute directly to the disinfecting action of chlorine.

After chlorine is added to water, it continues to act as a disinfectant, maintaining its germicidal properties even after the initial disinfection process. This residual effect helps in preventing any microbial growth that may occur after the water has been treated and is stored or transported. Incorrect Options: B. Chlorine and Ozone gas – Ozone gas is a powerful disinfectant, but it does not have a residual germicidal effect. Ozone rapidly decomposes after disinfection, leaving no long-term residual disinfection capability in the water. C. Chlorine and UV radiation – UV radiation is effective in killing microorganisms by damaging their DNA, but it does not have any residual germicidal effect. Once the UV radiation is turned off, its disinfecting action stops, leaving no ongoing disinfection in the water. D.

A chlorine concentration of 0.5 mg/L for a contact period of 1 hour is effective for routine chlorination and ensures that the water is disinfected properly. The contact time is sufficient to allow the chlorine to eliminate most pathogens. Incorrect Options: B. 0.5 mg/L for a contact period of ½ hour – While this dose may still be effective, the standard recommendation usually involves a contact period of 1 hour for better assurance of disinfection. A shorter contact time may not be as reliable in ensuring the effectiveness of disinfection, especially for more resistant microorganisms. C. 1.0 mg/L for a contact period of 1 hour – This higher chlorine concentration might be used in specific situations where there are concerns about higher levels of contamination, but the standard minimum recommended dose for routine chlorination is 0.5 mg/L, not 1.0 mg/L. D. 1.0 mg/L for a contact period of ½ hour – While a higher chlorine concentration can be effective, this combination is not typically recommended as a routine practice. The minimum recommended dose is generally 0.5 mg/L with a longer contact time of 1 hour, ensuring a balance between effective disinfection and economical use of chlorine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The amount of bleaching powder required to disinfect 455 liters of water can be calculated using the Horrock's apparatus, which typically works by determining the chlorine demand based on the number of cups that show distinct colorations when chlorine is added. In the given scenario, 4, 5, and 6 cups show distinct colorations. This suggests a specific chlorine dose that needs to be added to the water to achieve the desired disinfection level. The exact amount of chlorine required depends on the chlorine demand (which is determined using the Horrock’s apparatus). Bleaching powder contains around 35% chlorine. Based on this, if the correct amount of bleaching powder is 8 grams for the required chlorine demand, it matches the solution provided. Incorrect Options: A. 2 g – This is too little for the volume of water (455 liters) and the number of colorations in the Horrock's apparatus. A small amount of chlorine will not be sufficient to meet the disinfection requirements. B. 6 g – This amount may provide some chlorine but would not be adequate for a proper and complete disinfection of 455 liters, as more chlorine would be needed. D. 4 g – This is also insufficient based on the Horrock’s apparatus readings and the volume of water being treated.",

Lime is used to raise the pH of the water, which helps in precipitating fluoride as calcium fluoride. Alum is then added to further aid in coagulation and flocculation, removing the precipitated fluoride along with other impurities. This sequence ensures that fluoride is effectively removed from the water. Incorrect Options: B. Soda then Alum – Soda (sodium bicarbonate) is not typically used in the Nalgonda technique for fluoride removal. While soda can influence pH, it is not part of the standard defluoridation process as it does not effectively precipitate fluoride. C. Alum then Soda – In this sequence, the order is incorrect. Alum is supposed to follow lime for effective fluoride removal, not soda. Soda is not a key component in the Nalgonda technique. D. Alum then Lime – This is the reverse of the correct sequence. Lime must be added first to raise the pH before alum is added for coagulation, as lime helps in the initial precipitation of fluoride.",

When nitrates are reduced under anaerobic conditions, they are converted to nitrites. A high concentration of nitrites in water suggests recent contamination, as nitrates typically accumulate more slowly and indicate longer-term contamination. Incorrect Options: A. Nitrates – Nitrates are commonly found in water due to agricultural runoff or pollution, but they do not specifically indicate recent contamination. Nitrates are more stable in water, so while their presence can signal contamination, they don't provide the immediacy that nitrites do. C. Ammonia – While ammonia can be an indicator of pollution, it is less specific for recent contamination compared to nitrites. Ammonia levels can persist in water for longer periods, so it is not as immediate a sign of fresh contamination. D. Chlorides – Chlorides in water are a sign of general pollution but are not a reliable marker for recent contamination.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Solid particles. Solid particles are not typically used to assess water quality in terms of water pollution criteria. Water quality is generally evaluated by measuring parameters that affect the chemical, biological, and physical characteristics of the water, such as dissolved oxygen, chlorides, and nitrogen content. Solid particles, although they may be present in polluted water, are not standard criteria for assessing water quality. Instead, they may be quantified through turbidity tests or suspended solids measurements, which are indirect indicators, not direct quality criteria like those listed in the other options. Incorrect Options: B. Dissolved oxygen – Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a key criterion in assessing water quality. It is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms, and its concentration is a direct indicator of water pollution. Low levels of dissolved oxygen suggest that the water may be polluted with organic matter, leading to oxygen consumption by bacteria. C. Dissolved chloride – Dissolved chloride is an important parameter for assessing water quality. High chloride levels can indicate contamination from various sources, including industrial discharges, sewage, or salinity intrusion. Elevated chloride levels are often associated with pollution. D. Dissolved nitrogen – Dissolved nitrogen compounds, such as nitrate and nitrite, are commonly used to assess water quality. These compounds can come from agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge, or industrial pollution. Excessive nitrogen levels can lead to eutrophication and water quality degradation.",

This size is optimal for the filtration process as it allows the sand to effectively remove particles while maintaining a good flow rate. The effective size is crucial in determining the filter's performance in trapping particles and providing clean water. Incorrect Options: A. 0.2 mm – While smaller sand particles can be used in filtration, a 0.2 mm size is too fine for a rapid sand filter. It would result in high pressure loss and reduced efficiency due to clogging, making it unsuitable for the rapid filtration process. C. 0.8 mm – Larger sand particles, like 0.8 mm, might cause the filter to be less effective in trapping fine particles, and they also tend to reduce the filtration speed as the water passes through. D. 0.1 mm – A 0.1 mm sand size is too fine and could lead to problems such as clogging and excessive resistance to water flow.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 90%. When river water is stored for the first 5-7 days, a significant reduction in the bacterial count occurs, with studies showing that the bacterial population can drop by as much as 90%. This decrease happens due to the natural settling and die-off of microorganisms in the stored water, which helps improve the water quality for further treatment. Incorrect Options: A. 25% – A 25% reduction is too small compared to the substantial decline typically seen in the first 5-7 days of storage. The reduction in bacterial count is much higher due to the natural processes occurring in the water during this period. B. 50% – While some reduction in bacterial count occurs, 50% is still too low when compared to the typical 90?crease observed in the first 5-7 days of storage. The period is long enough for more significant bacterial reduction to occur. D. 100% – A complete elimination of bacteria (100% drop) is unlikely in this short time frame. Some bacteria may still persist even after 5-7 days of storage, although their numbers are significantly reduced.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) No residual action. One of the main drawbacks of ozone as a water disinfectant is that it does not have any residual disinfection effect. This means that once ozone is used to treat the water, it decomposes quickly, leaving no lasting germicidal effect in the water. This lack of residual action means that the treated water may be susceptible to re-contamination after the treatment process. Incorrect Options: A. No virucidal effect – This is incorrect. Ozone actually has virucidal properties and is effective in inactivating many viruses in water. It is known for its broad-spectrum disinfectant capabilities, including its ability to kill viruses. B. Long time period for action – This is also incorrect. Ozone acts quickly in disinfecting water, typically within a short time frame (minutes). It is a fast-acting disinfectant compared to some other chemicals. C. Teratogenicity – There is no significant evidence to suggest that ozone is teratogenic (causing birth defects). Ozone is harmful at high concentrations, but its use in water treatment, when applied properly, does not pose teratogenic risks.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) BOD slightly de-ranged. BOD slightly de-ranged is incorrect because Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of organic pollution in water, and a \"problem village\" is not typically classified based on slightly elevated BOD levels. BOD being slightly de-ranged doesn't necessarily indicate a critical water quality issue that would make a village a \"problem village.\" The focus is usually on more severe issues such as water scarcity or contamination. Incorrect Options: A. Where no water source in a distance of 1.6 km from community – This is a valid criterion for a \"problem village.\" If a village does not have a water source within a reasonable distance (like 1.6 km), it indicates that the community is facing water scarcity, which qualifies it as a problem village. B. Water is more than depth of 15 meters – This is another valid criterion. If the water table is deeper than 15 meters, it suggests that accessing water is difficult and may indicate water scarcity or problematic water accessibility, which could qualify a village as a \"problem village.\" C. There is excess of Na+, K+, F+ salts – Excessive salts, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), or fluoride (F+), can make water unsafe for consumption and are a key indicator of water quality problems in a village, making it eligible to be categorized as a \"problem village.\"",

It is actually a measure used in the context of dietary studies or metabolic rate assessments, and is not related to air quality or pollution levels. Therefore, this is the correct option as it does not pertain to air pollution. Incorrect answers: A. Soiling index – The soiling index measures the extent of dust and dirt accumulated on surfaces as a result of air pollution. It is a useful indicator of particulate matter in the air and helps assess the pollution levels in urban environments. C. Suspended particle count – Suspended particulate matter (SPM) or suspended particle count is a direct indicator of air pollution. It refers to the concentration of fine particles like dust, soot, and other pollutants suspended in the air, which can have significant health impacts. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CO2 is a major greenhouse gas A. CO2 is a major greenhouse gas – Carbon dioxide (CO2) is indeed one of the primary greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. It traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to an increase in the Earth's average temperature. This is a major driver of climate change, as increasing levels of CO2 from human activities like burning fossil fuels lead to a warming effect. Incorrect Options: B. Stratosphere ozone layer is harmful – The ozone layer in the stratosphere actually plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It is not harmful; rather, its depletion, caused by chemicals like CFCs, is a concern for human health and the environment. C. CFC increases stratosphere ozone layer – Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are actually harmful to the ozone layer. They contribute to its depletion by breaking down ozone molecules in the stratosphere. This results in the thinning of the ozone layer, which allows more harmful UV radiation to reach the Earth. D. Kyoto protocol called for 20% reduction in greenhouse emissions – The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, aimed for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012, not 20%. The protocol set specific targets for each country, and while it did not mandate a uniform 20% reduction, it encouraged action on a global scale to combat climate change.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) A. SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) – Sulfur dioxide is considered one of the best parameters to measure air pollution because it is a major pollutant released from burning fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil, in power plants and industrial processes. SO2 is a harmful gas that can lead to the formation of acid rain, respiratory issues, and environmental damage. Monitoring SO2 levels helps in assessing air quality and the potential for air pollution-related health risks. Incorrect Options: B. CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) – While carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas contributing to climate change, it is not typically used as a direct measure of air pollution. CO2 is more related to global warming than to traditional air quality concerns such as smog or respiratory pollutants. C. CO (Carbon Monoxide) – Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion, and it can be used to measure air pollution in certain contexts, especially in urban environments where traffic is a major source. However, SO2 is more commonly used as a direct indicator of overall air pollution due to its direct link to industrial activities and its environmental impacts. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Temperature inversion Temperature inversion – In winter, temperature inversion occurs when a layer of warmer air traps cooler air near the ground. This causes water vapour and pollutants to accumulate in the lower atmosphere instead of rising and dispersing. The trapped pollutants can lead to a significant increase in air pollution levels near the surface. This phenomenon is particularly common in urban areas during cold weather, leading to smog and poor air quality. Incorrect Options: A. Acid rain – Acid rain is the result of air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), reacting with water vapour in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acids. While acid rain is a serious environmental issue, it does not directly explain the trapping of water vapours and pollutants in the lower atmosphere in winter. B. Greenhouse effect – The greenhouse effect refers to the trapping of heat in the Earth's atmosphere due to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour. While this contributes to global warming, it does not specifically explain the situation where water vapours and pollutants accumulate near the ground in winter. D. Ocean effect – The ocean effect involves the impact of ocean currents and water temperature on weather patterns. While the ocean can influence local climates, it does not directly cause the phenomenon where pollutants are trapped in the lower atmosphere during winter.",

At this level, individuals may experience signs of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and heat-related illnesses. Prolonged exposure to these conditions can result in a serious health threat, such as heat stroke, especially in workers who are exerting themselves physically in hot environments. It is generally recommended that additional measures, such as hydration and rest breaks, be provided to prevent health complications. Incorrect Options: A. 20-40 – This range typically represents a moderate heat stress index, where working conditions may be uncomfortable, but the risk to health is generally low if proper precautions are taken (such as hydration and appropriate clothing). People can still work relatively comfortably at this level without significant health risks. C. 60-80 – Although the heat stress increases significantly at this level, it is still manageable with additional safety measures such as cool rest areas and more frequent hydration. However, if precautions are not followed, health risks such as heat exhaustion and dehydration can increase. D. 80-100 – At this level, heat stress is extreme, and prolonged exposure without rest or cooling measures can lead to severe health risks like heat stroke. However, this option is not the best answer to the specific question since 40-60 is already a threshold where health risks start to become significant without proper care, while 80-100 would be even more dangerous.",

This level of ventilation ensures that the air quality is maintained and that there is adequate exchange of indoor and outdoor air, helping to remove excess moisture, pollutants, and odors. It also helps in maintaining a comfortable atmosphere in the room. This amount of ventilation is typically sufficient for residential spaces such as living or drawing rooms, where comfort and air quality are key. Incorrect Options: B. 3-4 – While 3-4 air changes per hour might be appropriate for spaces with higher occupancy or specialized ventilation needs, it’s typically not necessary for a standard drawing room. The standard recommendation of 2-3 air changes is usually sufficient for residential spaces without making the room feel overly drafty or uncomfortable. C. 4-5 – This level of air changes may be required in areas with a higher concentration of pollutants, such as kitchens or laboratories, but it is generally excessive for a typical drawing room. More frequent air changes might lead to unnecessary energy consumption and discomfort in a home setting. D. 5-6 – This range is typically seen in spaces where very high ventilation rates are needed, like in certain industrial or commercial spaces, or areas with high occupancy and specific ventilation needs.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Kiffer test Kiffer test – The Kiffer test is a method used to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. This test involves a chemical reaction that allows for the quantification of CO2 levels. It is a commonly used technique for detecting and measuring CO2 in both indoor and outdoor environments, as it is reliable for determining air quality in spaces where CO2 levels need to be monitored. Incorrect Options: A. Manometer – A manometer is a device used to measure pressure, not the concentration of gases like CO2. It can measure the pressure of gases, but not the specific concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. B. Hygrometer – A hygrometer measures the humidity or moisture content in the air, not the concentration of carbon dioxide. It does not provide any information about CO2 levels. D. None – This option is incorrect because the Kiffer test is indeed a method used for measuring CO2 concentration in the air. Therefore, there is a correct option among the choices.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 20-30 dB 20-30 dB – Whispering typically produces sound levels in the range of 20-30 decibels (dB). This is a very soft sound, below normal conversational levels, which usually range from 60 to 70 dB. Whispering is quiet and barely audible from a distance, hence the lower dB range. Incorrect Options: B. 30-40 dB – While this range may apply to soft speaking voices, it is slightly higher than the sound produced by whispering. A sound at 30-40 dB is still soft, but not as faint as a whisper. C. 40-50 dB – This range corresponds to a normal speaking voice at a moderate volume. It is louder than a whisper and more typical of regular conversation or background noise. D. 50-60 dB – This range is typical for conversational speech at a normal volume, or for everyday sounds like a normal office environment. It is significantly louder than a whisper.",

In the context of a low sand filter, a venturimeter is useful in measuring the bed resistance, which refers to the resistance the water faces while passing through the filter media (sand). This helps in assessing the filter’s performance. Incorrect Options: A. Air velocity – Air velocity is typically measured by an anemometer, not a venturimeter. A venturimeter measures pressure changes due to flow, not air velocity directly. B. Size of suspended particles in the air – The size of suspended particles in the air is usually measured using a particle size analyzer or similar devices, not a venturimeter. C.

It indicates the level of air pollution based on the accumulation of dirt or soot on exposed surfaces. Hence, it is directly related to air pollution. Incorrect Options: A. Soil pollution – The soiling index does not measure soil pollution. Soil pollution typically involves the contamination of soil with harmful substances such as chemicals, heavy metals, or pesticides, which is a different area of concern. B. Water pollution – The soiling index is not used for assessing water pollution. Water pollution involves the contamination of water bodies, typically measured by factors like chemical contaminants, microbial load, and suspended solids, which is distinct from the concept of soiling in air.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Malarial parasite in mosquito Malarial parasite in mosquito – Cyclopropagative transmission refers to a type of transmission where both the development and multiplication of the pathogen occur within the vector. In the case of malaria, the Plasmodium parasite undergoes both developmental stages (sporogony) and multiplication within the mosquito (Anopheles), thus making it an example of cyclopropagative transmission. Incorrect Options: A. Plague bacilli in the flea – This is an example of propagative transmission, where the plague bacilli multiply within the flea, but there is no developmental stage of the pathogen in the flea. The pathogen does not undergo changes in the flea, unlike in cyclopropagative transmission. C. Microfilaria in mosquito – This involves propagative transmission, as the microfilaria undergoes development within the mosquito, but it does not multiply within the mosquito. The parasite remains in its initial form, undergoing development, but not multiple stages of reproduction. D. Guinea worm embryo in Cyclops – This is an example of direct transmission or developmental transmission, where the embryo develops inside the Cyclops, but there is no multiplication of the pathogen. It doesn't fit the definition of cyclopropagative transmission, as it lacks both development and multiplication within the vector.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Agent merely multiplies in vector but no developmental form change multiplication: cyclo developmental transmission Agent merely multiplies in vector but no developmental form change multiplication: cyclo developmental transmission – This is incorrectly matched. Cyclo developmental transmission refers to a scenario where the agent undergoes both development and multiplication within the vector. The statement here, which indicates no developmental form change, does not fit the definition of cyclo developmental transmission. Instead, this matches a propagative transmission, where the agent multiplies but doesn't undergo development in the vector. Incorrect Options: A. Agent changes in form and number: cyclo propagative transmission – This is correctly matched. Cyclo propagative transmission involves the agent undergoing both development (change in form) and multiplication (change in number) in the vector. An example of this would be the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. C. Agent undergoes only development but no multiplication: cyclo developmental transmission – This is correctly matched. Cyclo developmental transmission occurs when the pathogen undergoes development (change in form) within the vector but does not multiply (no increase in number). An example is the filarial worms in mosquitoes. D. Agent transmitted from nymph to adult vector: Transovarial transmission – This is correctly matched. Transovarial transmission occurs when the pathogen is transmitted from the female vector to its offspring (from the nymph to the adult). An example is the plague bacterium in fleas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is a definitive host in filarial It is a definitive host in filarial – This is incorrect. A mosquito is not the definitive host for filarial worms. In the case of filarial infections, such as those caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, the mosquito acts as an intermediate host. The definitive host for filarial worms is usually a human, where the adult worms live and mature. Mosquitoes serve to transmit the larvae of the filarial worms to humans but do not serve as the final host for the adult parasites. Incorrect Options: A. It is a definitive host in malaria – This is correct. In the case of malaria, the mosquito is the definitive host for the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite undergoes its sexual reproduction in the mosquito, which is why the mosquito is considered the definitive host. C. Its life cycle is completed in 3 weeks – This is correct. The life cycle of a mosquito, from egg to adult, typically takes about 3 weeks, depending on environmental conditions like temperature and availability of water. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sand fly Sand fly – This is correct. Sand flies are typically found in cracks and crevices of walls during the daytime. They are nocturnal creatures, meaning they are more active at night when they feed on the blood of humans and animals. During the daytime, they tend to hide in cool, dark places like cracks and crevices in walls, under rocks, or in animal burrows to avoid the heat and sunlight. Incorrect Options: B. House fly – This is incorrect. Houseflies are usually found in open, accessible places such as food surfaces or garbage. They do not typically hide in cracks and crevices during the daytime. Instead, they are active throughout the day and are commonly seen on food, waste, or other surfaces where they can feed. C. Blackfly – This is incorrect. Blackflies are commonly found near water sources where they breed, like rivers or streams. They are more active during the day, but they do not typically hide in cracks and crevices in walls. Their larvae are aquatic, and they are not known for hiding in such places during the day. D. Tse tse fly – This is incorrect. Tsetse flies are typically found in forested or bush areas in sub-Saharan Africa, where they feed on the blood of humans and animals.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Environmental control Environmental control – This is correct. Environmental control is the most cost-effective approach to controlling arthropods because it involves modifying the environment to make it less hospitable to pests. This can include measures such as eliminating standing water where mosquitoes breed, improving sanitation to prevent pests from thriving, and creating physical barriers like screens to reduce insect entry. These methods are relatively inexpensive and sustainable, with long-term benefits that can significantly reduce arthropod populations. Incorrect Options: B. Chemical control – This is incorrect. While chemical control (such as insecticides) can be effective in the short term, it is often more expensive due to the need for repeated application and the purchase of chemicals. It can also lead to resistance in pest populations and negative environmental effects, making it a less sustainable solution in the long run. C. Biological control – This is incorrect. Biological control involves the introduction of natural predators or parasites to control arthropods. While it can be effective in certain contexts, it often requires time to establish, and the initial costs may be higher than environmental control. Additionally, biological control may not always work effectively across all regions or pest species. D. Genetic control – This is incorrect. Genetic control involves modifying the genetic makeup of a species, often through techniques like sterilization or genetic modification. While promising, it is still in experimental stages in many areas and can be expensive to implement. This makes it a less cost-effective approach compared to simpler environmental controls.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 100 meters 100 meters – This is correct. The Aedes mosquito typically has a flight range of up to 100 meters from its breeding site. These mosquitoes are generally not strong fliers, and while they can travel longer distances, their primary activity occurs within a short radius of their breeding site. This characteristic is important when controlling the spread of diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, as it helps target localized interventions. Incorrect Options: A. 10 meters – This is incorrect. While Aedes mosquitoes are usually found within a few meters of their breeding sites, their range can extend further, up to 100 meters. A range of 10 meters would be too short to account for their typical movement patterns. C. 400 meters – This is incorrect. A flight range of 400 meters is too far for Aedes mosquitoes, as they typically remain within a 100-meter radius of their breeding areas. Longer distances are more typical for other mosquito species, like Culex mosquitoes. D. 11 KMS – This is incorrect. A flight range of 11 kilometers is unrealistic for Aedes mosquitoes. This distance is far greater than what these mosquitoes can cover, as they are relatively weak fliers compared to other mosquito species.",

Paris Green (copper(II) acetoarsenite) is a compound traditionally used in mosquito control, especially effective against Anopheles mosquitoes, which are the vectors of malaria. It works as a larvicide and is more effective in controlling the larvae of Anopheles mosquitoes compared to other mosquito species. Incorrect Options: A. It is used as an anti-adult measure – This is incorrect. Paris Green is not typically used for adult mosquito control; instead, it is more commonly used to target mosquito larvae in water sources. It is a larvicide rather than an adulticide. C. In usual doses, also it harms fish, man, and domestic animals – This is incorrect. While Paris Green is toxic, when used in careful, controlled doses for mosquito larval control, it generally does not harm fish, humans, or domestic animals. However, it can be harmful if misused or applied in excessive amounts. D. It is a nerve poison – This is incorrect. Paris Green is not classified as a nerve poison.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pyrethrum Pyrethrum – This is correct because Pyrethrum is not an anti-larval measure. It is an adulticide, meaning it is used to kill adult mosquitoes rather than targeting their larvae. Pyrethrum, derived from chrysanthemum flowers, is commonly used in mosquito fogging and spraying to kill adult mosquitoes, not to control larvae in water. Incorrect Options: A. Intermittent irrigation – This is incorrect. Intermittent irrigation is an anti-larval measure used to control mosquito larvae in agricultural fields. By periodically flooding and draining fields, it disrupts the breeding cycle of mosquitoes, making it less conducive for larvae to develop. B. Paris green – This is incorrect. Paris Green is a chemical compound used as a larvicide to control mosquito larvae. It is effective in targeting the larvae in water bodies and preventing them from maturing into adult mosquitoes. C. Gambusia affinis – This is incorrect. Gambusia affinis, also known as the mosquito fish, is used as a biological control agent for mosquitoes. These fish eat mosquito larvae, helping to reduce the mosquito population in water bodies, making it an effective anti-larval measure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dieldrin A. Dieldrin – This is correct because Dieldrin is not an organophosphate insecticide. It is a chlorinated hydrocarbon (also known as an organochlorine), not an organophosphate. Dieldrin was used historically for insect control, particularly in agriculture, but it is now banned in many countries due to its persistence in the environment and toxicity. Incorrect Options: B. Fenthion – This is incorrect. Fenthion is an organophosphate insecticide. It is used to control a variety of pests, including mosquitoes and fruit flies, by inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme essential for nerve function. C. Diazinon – This is incorrect. Diazinon is an organophosphate insecticide commonly used for agricultural and household pest control. Like other organophosphates, it works by interfering with the nervous system of insects. D. Chlorpyrifos – This is incorrect. Chlorpyrifos is another organophosphate insecticide, widely used for pest control in agriculture, on lawns, and for household pests.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Use of alkaline soap water Use of alkaline soap water – This is correct because alkaline soap water is not a deliberate or conventional measure for controlling mosquitoes. While soap and other detergents can sometimes be used to break the surface tension of water, making it less suitable for mosquito larvae, it's not a standard or widely recommended approach for mosquito control. Deliberate mosquito control usually involves more targeted methods like larvicides, community involvement, or physical barriers like bed nets. Incorrect Options: B. Use of larvicidal agents – This is incorrect because the use of larvicidal agents is a deliberate and common method of mosquito control. Larvicides target mosquito larvae in water sources, preventing them from maturing into adult mosquitoes. C. Community participation – This is incorrect because community participation is a key and effective measure in mosquito control. Educating communities about eliminating breeding sites, using nets, and improving sanitation are all ways in which communities actively contribute to mosquito control. D. Use of bed nets for mosquito – This is incorrect because using bed nets is a highly recommended and deliberate measure for controlling mosquitoes, especially in areas where diseases like malaria are prevalent. Bed nets, particularly those treated with insecticide, provide a physical barrier to prevent mosquitoes from biting during sleep.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ingestion Ingestion – This is correct because ingestion is not a common method by which vectors transmit infections. Vectors typically transmit pathogens through physical contact, regurgitation, contamination of body fluids, or by mechanical means, not by ingesting the pathogens themselves and passing them on to humans or other animals. Pathogens are typically transmitted through the bite of the vector or through bodily fluids, not through ingestion. Incorrect Options: B. Regurgitation – This is incorrect because regurgitation is a well-known method of transmission for many vectors, especially mosquitoes. For example, mosquitoes can regurgitate the pathogen from their stomachs into the bite wound, thereby transmitting diseases like malaria or dengue. C. Rubbing – This is incorrect because rubbing can also be a mode of transmission for certain vectors, such as lice or fleas. When these vectors move across the skin or body, they may transfer pathogens from one host to another by contact, or rubbing, on the surface. D. Contamination with body fluids – This is incorrect because contamination with body fluids is another common mechanism of disease transmission. For instance, ticks can spread Lyme disease through contact with infected body fluids, or fleas can spread plague by contaminating open wounds with infected blood.",

It has a relatively low toxicity to humans and animals compared to other organophosphorus compounds. Malathion is commonly used in agriculture and pest control because it degrades quickly in the environment and has less potential for bioaccumulation. Incorrect Options: A. DDT – This is incorrect because DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is not an organophosphorus compound, but rather a chlorinated hydrocarbon. DDT is highly toxic to many forms of wildlife, particularly aquatic organisms, and its persistence in the environment has led to environmental and health concerns. B. Paris green – This is incorrect because Paris green is a copper(II) acetoarsenite, which is a very toxic compound used primarily as an insecticide and rodenticide. It contains arsenic, making it much more toxic than organophosphates like malathion. D. Parathion – This is incorrect because parathion is a highly toxic organophosphorus compound. It is much more toxic than malathion and can cause serious health effects even at low exposure levels. It has been largely restricted or banned in many countries due to its toxicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Immediately kills the prey Immediately kills the prey – This is false because DDT does not immediately kill the prey. It acts as a contact poison, meaning it does not instantly kill insects but rather interferes with their nervous system, which leads to paralysis and eventual death after some time. The onset of death can take several hours to a day depending on the organism. Incorrect Options: A. Pyrethrum has synergistic action – This is true. Pyrethrum (a natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemums) is often used in combination with DDT because it has synergistic action. This means pyrethrum enhances the effectiveness of DDT, allowing for better pest control. B. It is a contact poison – This is true. DDT works as a contact poison, meaning it needs to make physical contact with the pest (typically through the insect’s outer body) to be effective. Once it comes into contact with the insect, it disrupts the nervous system, causing paralysis and death. D. Residual effect lasts 18 months – This is true. DDT has a long residual effect, meaning it remains effective for a long time after application, potentially up to 18 months or even longer in some conditions. This long-lasting property makes it effective in controlling pests over an extended period.",

They work by forming a thin film on the water surface, which suffocates the mosquito larvae by preventing them from breathing. Mineral oils do not kill the larvae directly but disrupt their ability to survive and develop. Incorrect Options: A. Personal protection method – Mineral oils are not used for personal protection; they are applied to water sources to target mosquito larvae, not directly to individuals to ward off mosquitoes. C. Adulticide – Mineral oils are not typically used to kill adult mosquitoes. Adulticides are chemicals designed to kill adult mosquitoes, and while mineral oils may have some effect on adult mosquitoes, they are primarily known as larvicides. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cover overhead tanks properly Cover overhead tanks properly – The most efficient anti-larval measure for preventing urban malaria is to ensure that overhead water tanks are properly covered. This prevents mosquitoes from accessing the water to lay eggs, thus breaking the life cycle of the malaria-transmitting mosquitoes like Anopheles. Since these tanks are common in urban areas and can easily become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, proper covering is a highly effective measure. Incorrect Options: A. Clean draining and sewerage system – While cleaning drains and maintaining sewerage systems is important for general public health and preventing the spread of various diseases, it is not as directly effective in preventing urban malaria as covering water tanks. Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, and sewerage systems are less of a breeding ground compared to improperly covered water tanks. C. Filling cesspools and ditches – Filling cesspools and ditches can be an effective measure in reducing mosquito breeding in certain environments. However, in urban settings, where overhead water tanks are more prevalent, the direct impact of filling ditches may not be as significant in preventing urban malaria. D. Cover pits – While covering pits can prevent mosquito breeding in specific places, the most common breeding grounds in urban areas are water storage tanks. Thus, the impact of this measure is more limited compared to ensuring that tanks are properly covered.",

It is caused by the dengue virus, which is primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. In recent years, the number of dengue cases in India has been on the rise, especially during the monsoon season, making it the most widespread and significant mosquito-borne viral disease in the country. Incorrect Options: B. Japanese B encephalitis – While Japanese B encephalitis is a serious mosquito-borne viral disease in India, especially in rural areas, it is less prevalent than dengue fever. The disease is primarily transmitted by the Culex mosquitoes, and although it remains a public health concern, its overall incidence is lower compared to dengue. C. Filariasis – Filariasis, caused by parasitic worms and transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, is a major health issue in India. However, it is a parasitic disease, not a viral one. While it is endemic in certain parts of the country, it is not as widespread in terms of viral transmission when compared to dengue fever. D. Chikungunya – Chikungunya, caused by the chikungunya virus and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has also been a significant concern in India, with outbreaks occurring from time to time.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Eliminate breeding places Eliminate breeding places – The best way to control houseflies is to eliminate their breeding sites. Houseflies breed in decaying organic matter, such as garbage, feces, and rotting food. By keeping the environment clean, managing waste properly, and removing potential breeding sites, you can significantly reduce the fly population. This method addresses the root cause of the problem and is more effective in the long term compared to other control methods. Incorrect Options: B. Insecticide spray – While insecticide sprays can provide immediate relief by killing adult houseflies, they do not address the source of the problem. They can be harmful to humans, pets, and the environment, and houseflies may develop resistance to the insecticides over time, making this an insufficient long-term solution. C. Bed Net use – Bed nets are effective in preventing mosquito bites, but they are not useful for controlling houseflies, as houseflies do not typically bite humans. Bed nets do not prevent houseflies from entering a room or breeding indoors. D. Paris green – Paris green is a pesticide primarily used for controlling pests in agricultural settings and is not suitable or effective for controlling houseflies. It can also be toxic to humans and animals, making it an inappropriate method for housefly control in domestic environments",

This mesh density is effective in preventing mosquitoes from passing through the net while still allowing air circulation, ensuring both protection and comfort. The fine mesh helps prevent even smaller mosquitoes from entering and biting while the person is inside the net. Incorrect Options: A. 100 – A net with only 100 holes per square inch would have a coarser mesh and may not be as effective at blocking mosquitoes, especially the smaller varieties. It would allow more air flow but would be less protective. C. 250 – A net with 250 holes per square inch would have an even finer mesh than the standard 150 holes per square inch. While it could theoretically offer more protection, it would reduce airflow and could be less comfortable, making it less ideal for general use in most climates.

It is effective against Anopheles larvae, helping reduce malaria transmission. Incorrect Options: B. Culex – While Paris Green can theoretically affect the larvae of various mosquito species, it is not commonly used specifically for controlling Culex larvae. Culex mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases like West Nile virus and filariasis, but Paris Green is not the primary larvicide used against them. C. Aedes – Aedes mosquitoes, which are vectors of diseases like dengue and Zika, are generally controlled using different methods and insecticides. Paris Green is not commonly used to target Aedes larvae. D. Mansonoides – Mansonia mosquitoes breed in aquatic vegetation, and while Paris Green might affect their larvae, it is not the most widely used method for controlling them.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mansonia Mansonia – Mansonia mosquitoes breed in areas where there are dense aquatic plants, such as submerged vegetation. The larvae of Mansonia mosquitoes are known to attach themselves to these plants to feed and grow. By removing and destroying the aquatic plants using herbicides, the breeding sites for Mansonia mosquitoes can be eliminated, effectively controlling their population. This method is commonly employed in areas with Mansonia mosquitoes, which are responsible for transmitting diseases like lymphatic filariasis. Incorrect Options: A. Aedes – Aedes mosquitoes typically breed in small, clean water containers or artificial containers like tires, flowerpots, and discarded items. They do not rely on aquatic plants, so removing or destroying aquatic plants will not have an impact on their population. B. Culex – Culex mosquitoes tend to breed in standing water such as ditches, gutters, and sewage systems, and their larvae are not dependent on aquatic plants. Thus, destroying aquatic plants would not be an effective method for controlling Culex mosquitoes. D. Anopheles – While Anopheles mosquitoes breed in stagnant water bodies, they generally do not rely on aquatic plants for their larvae to develop.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fluorine The image likely depicts dental fluorosis, which is caused by excessive fluoride intake. Fluoride is an essential micronutrient that helps prevent dental caries, but excessive consumption can lead to mottling of teeth, characterized by white, yellow, or brown discoloration. This is a classic feature of fluorosis, which is why fluorine is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Iodine (A) - Incorrect Iodine deficiency leads to goiter (thyroid swelling) and hypothyroidism, not dental fluorosis. Calcium (C) - Incorrect Calcium is essential for bone and teeth strength, but deficiency causes rickets (in children) and osteomalacia (in adults) rather than fluorosis. Iron (D) - Incorrect Iron deficiency causes anemia, leading to pallor, fatigue, and spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) but does not cause dental fluorosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Air) In adults, the major environmental source of lead exposure is air, primarily due to occupational exposure in industries such as battery manufacturing, mining, smelting, and construction. Key Points About Lead Exposure in Adults: Inhalation of lead fumes or dust is the primary route of exposure in workplace settings (e.g., welding, painting, demolition, and manufacturing). Airborne lead particles are absorbed rapidly through the lungs and enter the bloodstream, leading to elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). Chronic exposure can cause neurological, cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive toxicity. Incorrect Options: B. Water – Incorrect While lead contamination in water (due to lead pipes or plumbing systems) is a significant source of exposure, it primarily affects infants and children rather than adults in occupational settings. Lead leaches into drinking water, especially in older homes with lead pipes or soldered plumbing systems, but it is not the major source of lead absorption in adults. C. Lead-based paint – Incorrect Lead-based paint is a major source of lead poisoning in children, not adults. Ingestion of lead-contaminated dust from deteriorating paint is the main exposure route for young children who engage in hand-to-mouth activity. Adults are usually exposed to lead-based paint in occupational settings (e.g., painters, renovators), but air exposure remains the dominant source. D. Food – Incorrect Lead can contaminate food through contaminated soil, storage in lead-glazed pottery, or food packaging, but it is not the primary source of lead toxicity in adults. In developed countries, strict regulations limit lead contamination in food.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hard water is water that has high mineral content. Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone, chalk or gypsum which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates, bicarbonates and sulfates. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of foam formation when soap is agitated in water, and by the formation of limescale in kettles and water heaters. Wherever water hardness is a concern, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water's adverse effects. Hard drinking water may have moderate health benefits. An inverse or protective association of water hardness with cardiovascular mortality is reported in studies. In studies involving very large geographical areas, there was a strong tendency to observe lower cardiovascular mortality with increasing hardness of drinking water sources.",
