      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (Suitable for radioactive wastes). Screwfeed technology is a non-burn, dry thermal disinfection process used for the treatment of infectious medical waste. It uses heat and mechanical agitation to disinfect waste without combustion. However, it is not suitable for radioactive waste, as radioactive materials require specialized containment, shielding, and disposal methods that this technology does not provide. Thus, Option D is incorrect, making it the correct answer to the question. Incorrect Options: A. It is Non-burn, dry thermal disinfection process – Correct Screwfeed technology works by applying dry heat at high temperatures (usually around 100–150°C) to disinfect medical waste without burning it. Unlike incineration, this process does not produce toxic emissions. B. Waste is reduced by 80% in volume & 20-30% in weight – Correct The mechanical shredding and drying process significantly reduces the volume of waste by up to 80%. Since the waste loses moisture, its weight is reduced by 20-30%. C. Suitable for infection waste & sharps – Correct Screwfeed technology is effective for infectious waste and sharps (e.g., needles, syringes, scalpels) because it sterilizes and breaks down the waste into a non-hazardous form. It is not suitable for chemical, pharmaceutical, or radioactive waste.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (It is very expensive). Inertization is a low-cost technique used to reduce the hazardous potential of waste by mixing it with lime, cement, and water to form a stable, solid mass. This method is commonly used for pharmaceutical and chemical waste to prevent the leaching of toxic substances into the environment. Since inertization is a cost-effective method compared to incineration or high-tech disposal methods, the statement \"It is very expensive\" is incorrect, making Option C the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A. It is a technique of Mixing waste in order to minimize the risk Inertization involves mixing hazardous waste (especially heavy metals and pharmaceuticals) with binding materials like cement and lime to neutralize the risk of leaching into the environment. This method reduces the potential harm of toxic waste by stabilizing it in a solid form. B. Lime, cement, and water are used The process of inertization typically involves mixing waste with lime, cement, and water to form a solidified mass that is chemically stable and less likely to release toxins. D. It is not suitable for infectious waste – Infectious waste (such as contaminated medical waste) should not be treated with inertization, as it does not eliminate pathogens. Instead, infectious waste should be treated with autoclaving, microwaving, or incineration. Inertization is mainly used for chemical and pharmaceutical waste, not biological waste.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Needles). The box shown is most likely a sharp waste container (commonly called a \"sharp box\" or \"puncture-proof container\"). Needles and other sharp objects pose a high risk of injury and infection (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B & C) and must be disposed of safely. Sharps waste, including needles, scalpels, and broken glass contaminated with blood, is categorized under the White category in biomedical waste disposal. Thus, Option C (Needles) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A. Placenta – Incorrect Placenta and other human anatomical waste should be disposed of in the Yellow category, which is meant for infectious and pathological waste. These wastes are usually incinerated or deep-buried. B. Empty Glass Vials – Incorrect Empty glass vials should go in the Blue category, which is designated for glass waste (e.g., vials, ampoules, and slides). D. Gloves – Incorrect Used gloves should go in the Red category, as they are recyclable plastic waste. The red category is used for contaminated plastic waste like IV tubes, urine bags, and blood bags.",

The yellow bag is used for highly infectious waste, including: Microbiological waste (culture plates, bacterial cultures) Human anatomical waste (tissues, placenta) Contaminated laboratory waste Since the petri dish was used for culturing microorganisms, it is highly infectious and should be disposed of in the Yellow bag (Option C). Incorrect Options: A. Blue box – Incorrect The blue category is for glassware that is not infectious, such as discarded vials, ampoules, and slides. Since petri dishes are microbiological waste, they do not go in the blue box. B. White box – Incorrect The white category is for sharps waste, including needles, scalpels, and blades.
