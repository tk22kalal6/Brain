      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 30,000 In India, a Primary Health Centre (PHC) in rural areas is generally designed to serve a population of about 30,000. PHCs are an essential part of the healthcare delivery system in rural areas, providing basic medical services and preventive care to the population. They act as the first point of contact for healthcare in rural regions and are equipped to handle common health issues, immunization programs, maternal and child healthcare, and basic emergency services. Incorrect Options: A. 5000 This is incorrect. A rural PHC typically serves a larger population. 5,000 would be too small for the population coverage of a PHC. Smaller units, like sub-centres, serve such populations. C. 100,000 This is incorrect. A PHC typically serves 30,000 people in rural areas, not 100,000. A population of 100,000 is usually served by a Community Health Centre (CHC), which is a higher-level facility in the rural healthcare system. D. 500 This is incorrect. A 500-person population would be too small to be served by a PHC. A sub-centre would serve such a small population.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sub-centre. In India's healthcare system, the Eligible Couple Register is maintained at the sub-centre level. The eligible couple refers to married couples who are of reproductive age and are eligible to receive family planning services. The sub-centre is the most peripheral healthcare unit in rural areas and plays a crucial role in maternal and child health, immunization, and family planning services. It is here that data about eligible couples, their contraceptive choices, and their reproductive health needs are registered and monitored. Incorrect Options: B. PHC (Primary Health Centre) This is incorrect. While a PHC may provide services to eligible couples, the Eligible Couple Register is specifically maintained at the sub-centre, which works directly at the grassroots level in the community. C. CHC (Community Health Centre) This is incorrect. A CHC is a higher-level facility that provides more specialized care, such as surgery and advanced healthcare services. The Eligible Couple Register is not typically maintained at the CHC level. D. District headquarter This is incorrect. The district headquarter serves as the administrative center for health services at the district level but does not directly manage the Eligible Couple Register. This register is maintained at the sub-centre, which operates directly within the community.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Srivastava committee. The three-tier system of healthcare delivery in rural India, consisting of Sub-centre, Primary Health Centre (PHC), and Community Health Centre (CHC), was recommended by the Srivastava Committee in 1975. The committee recommended this structure to improve healthcare delivery in rural areas, making healthcare services more accessible and efficient. This system allows healthcare services to be provided at progressively higher levels, from basic services at the sub-centre level to more specialized services at the CHC. Incorrect Options: A. Bhore committee This is incorrect. The Bhore Committee (constituted in 1943) laid the foundation for India's health policy but it focused on setting up a national health system and was not specifically responsible for the three-tier system in rural areas. It focused more on a broader approach to the national healthcare framework. B. Chadah committee This is incorrect. The Chadah Committee (1963) was concerned with medical education and not directly involved in the establishment of the rural health delivery system. D. Mudaliar committee This is incorrect. The Mudaliar Committee (1961) also focused on health reforms but was more concerned with medical education and the structure of health institutions rather than the rural healthcare delivery system.",

They aim to ensure that essential health services are accessible, affordable, and effective. The elements of primary health care do not include the provision of employment as a direct healthcare intervention. Incorrect Options: A. Adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation This is correct. Safe water and sanitation are essential components of primary health care, as they play a key role in preventing waterborne diseases and improving public health. B. Prevention & control of local endemic disease This is correct. Prevention and control of local endemic diseases is a crucial element of primary health care, which aims to reduce the burden of diseases through preventive measures, early diagnosis, and treatment. D. Immunization against major infectious diseases This is correct. Immunization is a key aspect of primary health care, aiming to protect the population, particularly children, from preventable infectious diseases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) PHC In most healthcare systems, a psychiatrist is typically not posted at the Primary Health Centre (PHC). PHCs primarily provide basic healthcare services, including maternal and child health, immunization, and treatment for common illnesses. While they may offer basic mental health care and counseling, they generally do not have specialized psychiatric services. Psychiatrists are more likely to be found in district hospitals, military hospitals, or hospitals with medical colleges, where specialized care is more commonly available. Incorrect Options: B. Military hospitals This is incorrect. Military hospitals typically have a range of medical specialists, including psychiatrists, due to the unique mental health needs of military personnel. They provide specialized care for mental health issues such as stress, trauma, and PTSD. C. District hospitals This is incorrect. District hospitals often have psychiatrists as part of their multidisciplinary team. These hospitals provide more specialized services compared to PHCs and are equipped to handle a broader range of health issues, including mental health. D. Hospital with medical colleges This is incorrect. Hospitals with medical colleges typically have psychiatrists as part of the medical team.

It serves as the administrative and governance unit between the state and the village level, providing a more localized approach to public services and governance. Districts play a crucial role in implementing government policies, maintaining law and order, and managing public resources. Incorrect Options: A. Centre This is incorrect. The Centre (or Union Government) is the highest level of government in India, but it is not the principal unit of administration. The Centre has a more overarching role in national-level policies and governance, while administration at the grassroots level is carried out through districts. B. State This is incorrect. The state is an important administrative unit, but it is not the principal unit in the sense of direct administration to the public. The state government provides the overall framework for governance, while districts handle local administration. D. Village This is incorrect. While villages are vital units in rural India, they do not have the comprehensive administrative authority or role of a district.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Multipurpose worker. A sub-centre is the most basic healthcare unit in rural India, typically catering to a population of around 5,000 people. It is generally manned by a Multipurpose Worker (MPW), who is trained to handle a wide range of tasks, including maternal and child health, family planning services, immunization, basic healthcare, and health education. The MPW is a key figure in rural healthcare and is responsible for providing essential health services at the grassroots level. Incorrect Options: A. Medical officer This is incorrect. While a Medical Officer may be posted at a higher-level facility like a Primary Health Centre (PHC) or Community Health Centre (CHC), a sub-centre is typically not manned by a Medical Officer. The role of the medical officer is more prominent at higher levels of the healthcare system. C. Health assistant This is incorrect. A Health Assistant plays an important role in higher health facilities like PHCs and CHCs, but not at the sub-centre level. The Multipurpose Worker (MPW) is the key staff member at the sub-centre. D. Aanganwadi worker This is incorrect. An Aanganwadi Worker is responsible for services related to child care and nutrition under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program. While they work closely with health services, they are not the primary staff at a sub-centre, which is manned by an MPW.",

The primary functions of a female health worker (also known as ANM or Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) in India are related to maternal and child health, family planning, immunization, and health education. Chlorination of water is typically a function related to public health officers or other water sanitation professionals, not specifically female health workers. Incorrect Options: A. HBPNC (Home-Based Neonatal Care) This is correct. Female health workers play an important role in providing home-based neonatal care (HBPNC), focusing on the care of newborns and ensuring that the mother and child receive essential healthcare services during the early postnatal period. B. Train ASHAs of the sub-centre This is correct. Female health workers often train ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers at the sub-centre level. They support ASHAs in their role of delivering community health services, especially for maternal and child health. C. Conducts deliveries This is correct. Female health workers (ANMs) are often trained to conduct deliveries in rural areas, especially in the absence of doctors, and provide antenatal and postnatal care to mothers.",

The pillars of primary health care are focused on ensuring that healthcare is accessible, affordable, and effective at the community level, with an emphasis on prevention and community involvement. Incorrect Options: A. Equitable distribution This is correct. Equitable distribution is a core pillar of primary health care. It ensures that healthcare services are fairly distributed across populations, especially targeting vulnerable groups, and addressing disparities in healthcare access. B. Community participation This is correct. Community participation is a fundamental principle of primary health care. It emphasizes involving communities in health decision-making, ensuring that healthcare services are responsive to their needs and culturally appropriate. D. Inter-sectoral coordination This is correct. Inter-sectoral coordination is crucial for primary health care, as it requires collaboration between various sectors like health, education, water, sanitation, and agriculture.

Instead, it is usually carried out by national and international organizations, universities, research institutes, and specialized bodies. The state government may play a role in facilitating research, but it is not a core responsibility for health at the state level. Incorrect Options: A. Vital statistics This is incorrect. The collection of vital statistics, including birth rates, death rates, and other health-related data, is a core state responsibility. This information is vital for planning and implementing health programs. C. Prevention of adulteration This is incorrect. The prevention of adulteration, particularly in food and drugs, is the responsibility of the state government to protect public health. It includes the regulation and monitoring of food safety and standards. D. Prevention of communicable disease This is incorrect. The prevention of communicable diseases is one of the primary responsibilities of the state government. It involves initiatives like vaccination programs, surveillance, and public health campaigns.",

ASHAs are selected from the local community and serve as a bridge between the community and the healthcare system. They are trained to provide essential health services, including maternal and child health education, immunization, family planning, and preventive care. Their role is crucial in promoting community-based health and facilitating access to healthcare services. Incorrect Options: B. Community Health Centre This is incorrect. Community Health Centres (CHCs) are larger healthcare facilities that provide more advanced care and are typically staffed with doctors and specialists. ASHAs are not posted at CHCs, as they work at the grassroots level, within the community. C. Primary Health Centre This is incorrect. Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are healthcare facilities that serve as the first point of contact for a community. While ASHAs work closely with PHCs, they are not directly posted at the PHC. They are based at the village level and refer patients to PHCs when needed. D. Sub-centre This is incorrect.

A PHC generally focuses on providing basic health services and doesn't usually have a full-time paediatrician unless the PHC is in a large, urban area or is a more advanced facility. Incorrect Options: A. Pharmacist This is correct. A pharmacist is usually posted at a Primary Health Centre (PHC) to provide essential medicines to the community.

District hospitals provide comprehensive services and act as the referral point for primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs). They are equipped to handle more complex cases and can manage the overall health service delivery at the district level. Incorrect Options: A. PHC (Primary Health Centre) This is incorrect. PHCs are designed to provide basic healthcare services to a rural or semi-urban population. They typically handle primary healthcare needs such as immunization, family planning, and maternal care, but they do not have the same level of integration or specialized services as a district hospital. B. Sub centre This is incorrect. A sub-centre is the lowest level of healthcare delivery and provides basic services like maternal and child health, immunization, and health education. It is not highly integrated and serves as the first point of contact in rural areas. C. CHC (Community Health Centre) This is incorrect.

She provides maternal and child health services, including immunization, antenatal care, family planning, and basic healthcare. Her responsibilities also include health education and monitoring health conditions within the community. Incorrect Options: A. Acts at PHC level This is incorrect. Female health workers (ANMs) generally work at the sub-centre level, which is lower than the Primary Health Centre (PHC). PHC-level staff generally includes medical officers and more specialized healthcare providers. The female health worker typically serves the community directly and refers patients to the PHC for further care. C. Chlorinates well at regular intervals This is incorrect. Chlorination of water is generally handled by public health authorities or health assistants, not female health workers. ANMs focus on maternal and child health rather than water sanitation. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Equitable distribution. The shift in emphasis from urban to rural services in healthcare was driven by the principle of equitable distribution. This means ensuring that health services are available to all sections of society, particularly focusing on rural areas where healthcare infrastructure and access have traditionally been underdeveloped. The goal is to provide equal opportunities for healthcare, addressing disparities between urban and rural populations. Incorrect Options: B. Community participation This is incorrect. Community participation is an important aspect of primary healthcare, but it is not the primary reason for shifting focus from urban to rural services. While rural areas do benefit from increased community involvement in healthcare, the driving factor is the need for equitable distribution of health services. C. Inter-sectoral coordination This is incorrect. Inter-sectoral coordination refers to the collaboration between different sectors (e.g., health, education, agriculture) to address health issues. While it's crucial in health development, the shift from urban to rural services is more focused on equity in healthcare access. D. Community non-participation This is incorrect. The aim is not to promote non-participation in the community. On the contrary, community participation is key to the success of rural health programs, as local communities are involved in decision-making and service delivery. However, the central reason for focusing on rural areas is equitable distribution of resources.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sanitation. Aanganwadi centers primarily focus on child welfare and maternal health. The key services provided include: Immunization of children: Aanganwadi workers help in vaccination and immunization of children to protect them from common childhood diseases. Non-formal preschool education: Aanganwadis provide early childhood education through play and learning activities for young children. Health education: Aanganwadi workers educate the community, particularly mothers, about basic health practices, nutrition, and hygiene. However, sanitation is typically managed by local public health authorities or municipal bodies, not specifically by Aanganwadis. While they may promote basic hygiene education, they do not directly manage sanitation services like waste disposal or water purification. Incorrect Options: A. Immunization of children This is correct. Immunization is one of the primary responsibilities of Aanganwadi centers, which help in vaccinating children against common infectious diseases. B. Non-formal preschool education This is correct. Aanganwadis are known for providing preschool education in a non-formal setting to children aged 3-6 years, helping them develop basic learning skills. D. Health education This is correct. Aanganwadi centers focus on health education for mothers and children, emphasizing topics such as nutrition, childcare, and family planning.",

This ensures that the CHC can provide secondary-level care to the community, including specialist services, basic surgeries, obstetric care, and emergency services. The 30 beds cater to a larger rural population and serve as a referral center for Primary Health Centres (PHCs). Incorrect Options: A. 4-6 This is incorrect. The 4-6 beds range would be too small for a Community Health Centre. A Primary Health Centre (PHC) may have this capacity, but CHCs require more beds to provide more extensive care. B. 15 This is incorrect. While 15 beds may be present at a smaller health center, a Community Health Centre (CHC) is required to have at least 30 beds to fulfill its role in providing secondary-level care. D. 100 This is incorrect. 100 beds would typically be seen in larger district hospitals, not in Community Health Centres (CHCs).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) SICS (Small Incision Cataract Surgery). The most common operation performed by an ophthalmologist in a district hospital is typically SICS, which is a type of cataract surgery. Cataracts, which are a leading cause of blindness, are particularly common in older adults. SICS is a preferred technique in settings with limited resources because it is cost-effective, can be performed with basic surgical instruments, and provides excellent outcomes. The small incision used in the procedure reduces recovery time and complications. Incorrect Options: B. Trabeculectomy This is incorrect. Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat glaucoma by creating a drainage hole to reduce intraocular pressure. While important, it is not as commonly performed in district hospitals as cataract surgery, which has a much higher incidence in the population. C. Bilateral lamellar tarsal rotation This is incorrect. Bilateral lamellar tarsal rotation is a procedure done for conditions like ectropion (outward turning of the eyelid). While important, it is not as commonly performed as SICS in district hospitals, which focus on more prevalent issues like cataracts. D. Dacryocystorhinostomy This is incorrect. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction (blocked tear duct). While DCR is important, it is less commonly done compared to cataract surgery in district hospitals.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Provision of accident and emergency care. The Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for Primary Health Centres (PHCs) focus on providing comprehensive primary healthcare services. The objectives include improving access to health services, ensuring good quality of care, and making services more responsive to the community's needs. However, accident and emergency care is not specifically one of the core objectives of PHCs, as they are designed primarily for primary care and not emergency or trauma care. Emergency care is typically provided at higher-level healthcare facilities such as Community Health Centres (CHCs) and district hospitals. Incorrect Options: A. Provision of comprehensive PHC This is correct. One of the main objectives of IPHS for PHCs is to ensure comprehensive primary healthcare, which includes preventive, curative, and promotive services, covering a wide range of health issues. B. Achievement of acceptable quality of health care This is correct. IPHS emphasizes that PHCs should provide high-quality healthcare that meets acceptable standards, ensuring that the services provided are effective and safe for the community. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Comprehensiveness. Comprehensiveness refers to the optimal provision of preventive, curative, and promotive services in healthcare. It ensures that healthcare services address all aspects of an individual's health, from prevention (e.g., vaccination, health education) to curative (treatment of diseases) to promotive (encouraging healthy behaviors and lifestyles). A comprehensive health system provides a broad range of services designed to meet the total health needs of the population. Incorrect Options: A. Appropriateness This is incorrect. Appropriateness refers to the suitability of the healthcare services provided for a specific condition or context. While important, it does not encompass the total scope of services in the way that comprehensiveness does. B. Availability This is incorrect. Availability refers to the presence of healthcare services in a given area. While crucial for access to care, availability alone does not ensure the optimal balance of preventive, curative, and promotive services. C. Adequacy This is incorrect. Adequacy refers to whether the amount of healthcare services is sufficient to meet the needs of the population. It focuses more on quantity rather than ensuring that all necessary types of services (preventive, curative, and promotive) are included. [3:03 pm, 28/1/2025] Rakesh Sir (DAMS) -Office:",

Mobile medical care services are designed to provide primary and secondary health care services to communities, especially in rural or remote areas. These services are typically offered through mobile clinics that travel to underserved populations, providing basic healthcare like immunizations, maternal and child care, health education, minor treatment, and diagnostic services. However, tertiary health care is generally provided by specialized hospitals and medical centers that offer advanced treatment and surgeries, which cannot be effectively delivered through mobile units. Tertiary care usually involves highly specialized care requiring advanced infrastructure, which is not feasible for mobile units. Incorrect Options: A. Primary health care This is incorrect. Mobile medical care is frequently used to provide primary health care services, such as vaccinations, routine checkups, maternal and child health services, and health education to underserved communities. B. Secondary health care This is incorrect. Mobile medical care can also provide secondary health care services, such as diagnostic tests and treatment for common ailments, that can be managed in a mobile setting or with minor interventions before referring to a higher-level hospital if necessary.

Secondary health care refers to specialized medical care provided by healthcare professionals who do not have the primary responsibility for the patient’s general health. Community Health Centers (CHCs) are typically the secondary level of care in the health system. They provide more specialized services than Primary Health Centers (PHCs), including specialist consultations, diagnostic services, and treatment for common health problems that cannot be handled at the primary level. CHCs may also offer limited surgical services. Incorrect Options: A. Primary Health Center (PHC) This is incorrect. PHCs provide primary health care, which includes basic health services such as preventive care, maternal and child health, immunizations, and treatment for common illnesses. PHCs are the first point of contact for individuals and families with the healthcare system. B. Sub Center This is incorrect. A sub-center is the lowest-level health facility in rural areas, primarily tasked with preventive and basic primary healthcare services. It does not provide specialized care or services typically seen in secondary or tertiary care. D. Apex Health Institutions This is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife). Explanation of the Correct Answer: The Eligible Couple Register is an important record maintained at the sub-center level under the family planning and maternal health program in India. It is primarily maintained by the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM). • The ANM is responsible for identifying, registering, and providing counseling to eligible couples (married couples in the reproductive age group, typically 15–49 years). • This register helps in monitoring family planning services, contraceptive usage, and maternal health services. • ANMs also provide follow-ups, track pregnancies, and ensure maternal and child healthcare services are delivered effectively. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) ASHA Worker While Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) assist in motivating couples for family planning and reproductive health services, they do not maintain the Eligible Couple Register directly. Instead, they help ANMs by collecting data and ensuring community-level awareness. (C) MPHW (M) – Male Multi-Purpose Health Worker. The Male MPHW primarily focuses on disease prevention, vector control, immunization, and sanitation, rather than directly maintaining family planning records. (D) Anganwadi Worker Anganwadi workers are involved in child nutrition, early childhood education, and maternal health services, but they do not maintain the Eligible Couple Register. Their primary role is under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) rather than direct family planning program implementation.",
