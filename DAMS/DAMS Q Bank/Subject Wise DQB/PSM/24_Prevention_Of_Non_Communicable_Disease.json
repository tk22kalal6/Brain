      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Filters in cigarettes provide a protective effect for CHD. This statement is incorrect because while filters in cigarettes may slightly reduce the intake of certain harmful substances, they do not eliminate the overall risk posed by smoking. Smoking, regardless of filters, remains a significant and independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Filters do not provide a protective effect sufficient to negate the damage caused by the thousands of toxic chemicals and nicotine present in cigarette smoke. Smoking leads to endothelial dysfunction, promotes atherosclerosis, and increases blood clot formation, all of which significantly raise the risk of CHD. Incorrect Options: A. Risk of death from CHD decreases from cessation of smoking This statement is correct. Studies show that quitting smoking substantially reduces the risk of CHD, even in individuals who have smoked for many years. Within one year of smoking cessation, the risk of CHD decreases significantly, and after 10–15 years of abstinence, the risk is nearly equivalent to that of non-smokers. This highlights the importance of cessation programs in reducing mortality from CHD. C. Influence of smoking is synergistic to other risk factors for CHD This statement is correct. Smoking amplifies the harmful effects of other CHD risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. For example, in individuals with high LDL cholesterol, smoking accelerates the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, significantly increasing the risk of heart attacks. The combined impact of multiple risk factors is often greater than the sum of their individual effects, demonstrating the synergistic nature of smoking. D. Influence of smoking is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked per day This statement is correct. There is a dose-response relationship between smoking and CHD risk, meaning that the more cigarettes an individual smokes per day, the higher their risk of developing CHD. Heavy smokers are particularly vulnerable due to greater exposure to toxic substances like carbon monoxide and nicotine, which damage blood vessels and increase oxidative stress.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Less than 3.5. The cholesterol-to-HDL ratio is a critical marker for assessing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This ratio is calculated by dividing total cholesterol by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is known as the \"good cholesterol.\" A ratio of less than 3.5 is widely recommended for CHD prevention because it reflects a healthier balance of lipids. HDL cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, reducing the risk of plaque buildup in arteries. When the ratio is below 3.5, the risk of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular complications is significantly reduced, aligning with clinical guidelines for optimal heart health. Incorrect Options: B. Less than 2.5 This is incorrect. While a ratio of less than 2.5 indicates an even better lipid profile and an exceptionally low risk of CHD, it is not the standard clinical goal. Such a low ratio may not be realistic for the general population and is not routinely recommended as a primary target for CHD prevention. C. Less than 10.5 This is incorrect. A ratio of less than 10.5 is far above the recommended range for CHD prevention and indicates a high level of total cholesterol relative to HDL cholesterol. Such a ratio would suggest significant cardiovascular risk, making it an unacceptable target for heart health. D. Less than 1.5 This is incorrect. While a ratio of less than 1.5 would reflect an extremely healthy lipid profile, it is not a practical or standard target for most individuals. Achieving such a low ratio is uncommon and not necessary for effective CHD prevention. A ratio below 3.5 is sufficient to significantly lower CHD risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Indian CHD occurs 1 decade later than western CHD. This statement is false because coronary heart disease (CHD) tends to occur approximately 1 decade earlier in Indian populations compared to Western populations. This is due to a combination of genetic predisposition, higher rates of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, lifestyle factors, and lower levels of physical activity among Indians. Studies have shown that Indians are at a higher risk for CHD at younger ages compared to Western populations, making early screening and prevention especially crucial. Incorrect Options: B. Heavy cigarette smoking is a risk factor This statement is true. Heavy cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for CHD. Smoking contributes to atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and increased blood clot formation, all of which raise the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and other cardiovascular events. The harmful effects are amplified in individuals with other risk factors like diabetes or hypertension. C. Males are affected more than females This statement is true. Males are more commonly affected by CHD than females, particularly in younger age groups. Premenopausal women have a degree of protection due to higher levels of estrogen, but after menopause, the risk in women increases and begins to approach that of men. D. DM predisposition to MI is seen This statement is true. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI) due to its association with chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Diabetics often develop CHD at younger ages and have worse outcomes compared to non-diabetics, making tight glycemic control essential for reducing cardiovascular risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Obesity. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension, meaning it can be influenced or controlled through lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and weight management. Excess body weight increases blood pressure by promoting insulin resistance, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and increasing sympathetic nervous system activity. Weight loss has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure and improve overall cardiovascular health, making it a key target for hypertension prevention and management. Incorrect Options: A. Ethnicity This is incorrect. While ethnicity is a known risk factor for hypertension (e.g., African-Americans are at higher risk), it is non-modifiable because it is determined by genetic and hereditary factors. B. Age This is incorrect. Age is another non-modifiable risk factor. Blood pressure typically increases with age due to the stiffening of arterial walls and other age-related physiological changes. While hypertension prevalence rises with age, it cannot be altered directly, though its impact can be managed through lifestyle changes and medication. C. Sex This is incorrect. Sex is also a non-modifiable risk factor. Men are generally at higher risk for hypertension in younger and middle-aged groups, while postmenopausal women experience a higher risk later in life due to hormonal changes. However, one's sex cannot be modified to reduce the risk of hypertension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) BP of hypotensive remain hypotensive. \"Tracking of BP\" refers to the tendency of an individual's blood pressure (BP) to follow a consistent pattern over time. For example, individuals with low blood pressure (hypotensive) during childhood or early life are likely to remain hypotensive as they age, and those with high blood pressure (hypertensive) are more likely to maintain elevated BP levels unless interventions are made. This concept highlights the stability of BP trends over time and the importance of early detection and intervention to prevent hypertension and its complications. Incorrect Options: A. BP increases with age This is incorrect. While it is true that average BP levels tend to rise with age due to vascular changes and lifestyle factors, this statement does not define \"tracking of BP.\" Tracking refers to the persistence of individual BP trends rather than population-wide trends related to aging. B. BP decreases with age This is incorrect. BP typically increases, not decreases, with age for most individuals due to arterial stiffening and other age-related factors. Additionally, this statement is unrelated to the concept of BP tracking. C. BP of hypotensive become hypertensive This is incorrect. The concept of BP tracking indicates that hypotensive individuals are more likely to remain hypotensive rather than becoming hypertensive over time. While some individuals may develop hypertension due to external factors or health conditions, this is not the norm for BP tracking.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The DASH diet is a well-researched and evidence-based dietary plan designed to lower blood pressure and promote cardiovascular health. It emphasizes the consumption of nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy while limiting sodium, saturated fats, added sugars, and processed foods. The diet is rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which are essential for blood pressure regulation. The DASH diet has been proven effective in reducing hypertension and lowering the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions. Incorrect Options: B. Domestic Approach to Safeguard Hepatitis This is incorrect. The DASH diet has no direct connection to hepatitis prevention or management. It is specifically targeted at reducing hypertension and improving cardiovascular health. C. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyperlipidemia This is incorrect. Although the DASH diet may help improve lipid profiles (e.g., lowering LDL cholesterol), its primary purpose is to lower blood pressure, not to treat hyperlipidemia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of these. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a serious complication of rheumatic fever, which arises from untreated or inadequately treated Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infections, primarily pharyngitis. Preventing RHD involves a comprehensive strategy addressing early detection, prevention, and management of streptococcal infections and their complications. All the options listed play a role in the prevention of RHD, making D the most accurate answer. Incorrect Options: A. Screening of school-going children This is correct. Screening school children for symptoms of streptococcal throat infections or early signs of rheumatic fever allows for timely treatment, which can prevent progression to RHD. School-based programs are particularly effective in areas where RHD prevalence is high. B. Vaccination against Streptococcus This is correct. While there is no widely available vaccine for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) as of now, efforts are ongoing to develop one. If such a vaccine becomes widely used, it would significantly reduce the incidence of streptococcal infections and, consequently, rheumatic fever and RHD. C. Treatment of respiratory infections This is correct. Prompt and adequate treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) is the cornerstone of preventing acute rheumatic fever. Early treatment halts the immune response that can lead to heart damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Penile cancer and cervical cancer following circumcision. This statement is false because circumcision is not associated with an increased risk of penile or cervical cancer. On the contrary, circumcision is believed to reduce the risk of penile cancer in men and cervical cancer in their partners by lowering the chances of persistent infections, particularly with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which are known to cause these cancers. Hence, circumcision is considered protective rather than causative. Incorrect Options: A. Kangri cancer in Kashmir due to hot pot in winter This is correct. Kangri cancer refers to skin cancer seen in the Kashmir region due to the prolonged use of \"kangri,\" an earthen pot containing burning coal, placed close to the skin during winter for warmth. Chronic exposure to heat and burns from the kangri leads to repeated skin damage, predisposing individuals to skin cancer. B. Oral cancer due to pan chewing in India This is correct. Pan chewing, which often includes areca nut, tobacco, and slaked lime, is a well-established risk factor for oral cancer in India and other South Asian countries. The carcinogenic substances in these ingredients cause chronic irritation and inflammation of the oral mucosa, eventually leading to malignancy. D. Lung cancer due to smoking This is correct. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer worldwide. Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco contain carcinogens like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines, which damage lung tissue, leading to the development of cancer over time.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ca Lung. Lung cancer is not a good candidate for community-level screening due to several factors, including the absence of an effective, widely applicable, and low-cost screening method that provides significant benefits in reducing mortality. While low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has shown promise in detecting early-stage lung cancer in high-risk individuals (e.g., heavy smokers), it is resource-intensive, costly, and not practical for large-scale implementation in the general population. Additionally, lung cancer often presents at an advanced stage, limiting the impact of early detection in improving survival rates at the community level. Incorrect Options: B. Ca Breast This is incorrect. Breast cancer is an excellent candidate for community-level screening. Mammography is a well-established, cost-effective, and reliable screening method that detects breast cancer at an early and treatable stage, significantly improving outcomes. Regular breast cancer screening is a cornerstone of public health programs in many countries. C. Ca Prostate This is incorrect. Prostate cancer is a reasonable candidate for screening, especially in older men or those at higher risk (e.g., a family history of prostate cancer). While the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has its limitations, including false positives and overdiagnosis, it is still considered for targeted screening in specific populations. D. Colonic Cancer This is incorrect. Colonic (colorectal) cancer is a good candidate for community screening. Methods like fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), stool DNA tests, and colonoscopy are effective in detecting precancerous polyps or early-stage colorectal cancer, reducing mortality. Community-level screening programs for colorectal cancer are widely implemented in many countries.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Carcinoma colon. Colorectal cancer (Ca colon) has shown the highest increase in survival rates after screening. The primary reason for this is that colorectal cancer typically progresses through identifiable precancerous stages (such as adenomas), which can be detected early through screening methods like fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), colonoscopy, or stool DNA tests. Early detection of these precancerous lesions allows for removal before they progress to invasive cancer, thus significantly improving survival rates. When colorectal cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is much higher compared to when it's diagnosed at a later stage. Incorrect Options: A. Carcinoma cervix This is incorrect. While cervical cancer screening (via Pap smears or HPV testing) has indeed led to improved survival rates, it does not result in as high an increase in survival as colorectal cancer screening. Cervical cancer often develops slowly and is highly preventable through screening, but the survival rate improvements are generally not as dramatic as those seen with early detection of colorectal cancer. B. Carcinoma lungs This is incorrect. Lung cancer screening (typically with low-dose CT scans) is only recommended for high-risk individuals, such as heavy smokers, and has shown some improvement in survival, particularly in early-stage lung cancer detection. However, overall, lung cancer still has a much lower survival rate compared to cancers like colon and breast cancer, especially because it is often diagnosed at a later, less treatable stage. D. Carcinoma breast This is incorrect. While breast cancer screening (through mammography) has led to significant improvements in survival rates, the survival improvement from early detection through screening is not as high as that observed in colorectal cancer. Early detection of breast cancer does increase survival rates, but the impact is somewhat less pronounced than in colorectal cancer, which can be prevented by removing precancerous lesions before they develop into cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Breast. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women in India. Over the years, there has been an increasing incidence of breast cancer due to various factors such as changing lifestyles, delayed childbearing, hormonal influences, and increased life expectancy. While the survival rate for breast cancer has improved with early detection and advancements in treatment, it still remains the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among Indian women. Public health initiatives are focusing on increasing awareness, early screening (such as mammography), and access to effective treatment to address this growing health challenge. Incorrect Options: A. Lungs This is incorrect. While lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women, it is not the primary cause of mortality among women in India. Smoking and air pollution are significant risk factors, but the incidence of lung cancer in women is still lower compared to breast cancer, although the gap is narrowing. B. Cervix- uteri This is incorrect. Cervical cancer has historically been the most common cancer in women in India, but with the advent of screening programs like Pap smears and HPV vaccinations, the incidence and mortality rates have been decreasing. However, it is still a leading cause of cancer deaths in rural and underserved areas. C. Ovary This is incorrect. Ovarian cancer is a serious health issue, but it does not account for the maximum mortality among women in India. It is less common compared to breast and cervical cancer, and often presents at a later stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, awareness and early detection efforts are crucial for improving survival rates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Unexplained weight gain. Unexplained weight gain is not typically considered an early warning sign of cancer. Weight loss (rather than gain) is more commonly associated with cancers, especially in the later stages, due to factors such as the body's increased energy expenditure and metabolic changes. Although some cancers (e.g., ovarian cancer) can cause bloating or abdominal distension leading to weight gain, unexplained weight gain itself is not a direct or common early sign of cancer. Incorrect Options: A. Persistent cough This is correct. A persistent cough, especially one that lasts for several weeks or worsens over time, could be a sign of lung cancer or other respiratory cancers. It should not be ignored if it persists without a clear cause like a cold or flu. B. Lump or hard area in breast This is correct. A lump or hard area in the breast is one of the most common early warning signs of breast cancer. Women should be aware of any changes in the breast tissue and report them to their healthcare provider for evaluation. D. Change in wart/mole This is correct. Changes in the appearance, size, shape, or color of a wart or mole can be an early sign of skin cancer, including melanoma. Any new growths or changes in existing skin lesions should be promptly examined by a healthcare provider.",

While the abdominal area is important for assessing fat distribution (such as visceral fat), skinfold measurements generally focus on more accessible and standardized sites. The anterior abdominal wall is not part of the common skinfold measurement sites used in body fat assessment. Incorrect Options: A. Mid triceps This is correct. The mid triceps is a commonly used site for measuring skinfold thickness, particularly in assessing upper body fat. It is located on the back of the upper arm, and measurements taken here help estimate subcutaneous fat. B. Biceps This is correct. The biceps area is also a commonly used site for skinfold measurements. The skinfold is typically measured on the front of the upper arm, and it helps assess fat stores in the upper extremities. C.

This threshold is used globally, including in India, to identify individuals at higher risk of developing obesity-related health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Incorrect Options: A. 20-30 This is incorrect. A BMI of 20-30 is considered within the normal to overweight range, not obesity. The lower end (20-24.9) is considered normal, and the higher end (25-29.9) is considered overweight. B. > 25 This is incorrect. A BMI greater than 25 indicates overweight, not obesity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Regular exercise with the same amount of food. To reduce obesity, regular exercise is essential for increasing energy expenditure. Even if a person maintains the same amount of food intake, physical activity helps burn additional calories, improve metabolism, and support weight loss. Exercise also helps in building lean muscle mass, which can further increase resting metabolic rate, making it easier to manage weight. Therefore, regular exercise combined with balanced nutrition can effectively reduce obesity. Incorrect Options: B. Decrease fat intake but have stomach full This is incorrect. While reducing fat intake can help reduce calorie consumption, simply decreasing fat without considering overall caloric intake or nutrient balance may not lead to long-term weight loss. If a person eats a large volume of low-fat food, they may still consume excess calories, which can prevent weight loss. C. Reduce intake of fats, carbohydrates, and protein This is incorrect. While it is important to balance macronutrients, excessive restriction of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins could lead to nutrient deficiencies and impact overall health. The goal is not to drastically cut all nutrients but to maintain a balanced and healthy diet while controlling calorie intake. D. All the above This is incorrect. Not all of the approaches listed are ideal. The best approach is regular exercise combined with balanced food intake. Reducing the intake of fats and other macronutrients needs to be done thoughtfully, without extreme restrictions, to avoid malnutrition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 0.85. A waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) greater than 0.85 in women is considered to indicate abdominal fat accumulation and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. The WHR is a simple measure of fat distribution, with the waist circumference divided by the hip circumference. Higher values suggest a higher proportion of visceral fat (fat stored around the abdomen), which is associated with higher health risks compared to fat stored in other areas of the body. Incorrect Options: A. 0.75 This is incorrect. A WHR of 0.75 is considered normal and is generally seen as a lower risk for abdominal fat accumulation and associated health problems. A WHR of 0.75 or lower in women typically suggests a healthier distribution of fat. C. 0.95 This is incorrect. A WHR of 0.95 is generally used as the cut-off for men, not women. For women, a value greater than 0.85 is considered a red flag for abdominal fat accumulation. D. 1.05 This is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Weight (KG) / (Height in meters)². BMI (Body Mass Index) is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. This formula is used to assess whether an individual has a healthy weight for a given height and is commonly used to classify individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The formula is: BMI = Weight (kg) Height (m)² This index helps in determining the risk of certain health conditions related to body weight. Incorrect Options: B. Weight (KG) / (Height)² (cm) This is incorrect. The correct formula requires the height to be in meters, not centimeters. If height were in centimeters, it would need to be converted into meters first before squaring. C. Mid arm circumference (CM) / Head circumference (CM) This is incorrect. This formula is not related to BMI. Mid-arm and head circumference measurements are sometimes used in different types of assessments (e.g., nutritional status in children) but not for calculating BMI. D. Mid arm circumference (cm) between ages of 1-5 years This is incorrect. This refers to measurements used for growth assessments in young children, not for calculating BMI.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cohort studies. The Stanford Three-Community Study, North Karelia Project, and Lipid Research Clinics Study are all examples of cohort studies. In cohort studies, researchers follow a group of people (a cohort) over time to observe how exposure to certain risk factors affects the development of health outcomes. These studies are longitudinal in nature and are used to understand relationships between lifestyle factors (like diet or smoking) and disease outcomes. Stanford Three-Community Study focused on the effects of behavior and lifestyle on health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular diseases. North Karelia Project was a community-based intervention program that aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease by changing lifestyle factors like smoking and diet. Lipid Research Clinics Study examined the relationship between lipid levels (cholesterol) and cardiovascular disease. All of these are classic examples of cohort studies because they follow specific populations over time to study disease outcomes related to various risk factors. Incorrect Options: B. Nested case-control studies This is incorrect. While nested case-control studies are derived from cohort studies, they specifically involve selecting a subset of individuals from a cohort who have developed a disease (cases) and comparing them with those who have not (controls). The studies mentioned here were not designed as nested case-control studies. C. Case series report studies This is incorrect. Case series report studies involve detailed reports of a single patient's medical case or a series of similar cases. These studies do not involve large populations or long-term follow-ups like cohort studies. D. Risk factor intervention trials This is incorrect. Risk factor intervention trials involve actively intervening with treatments or lifestyle changes to study their effects on health outcomes. While the mentioned studies did involve public health interventions, they were primarily observational cohort studies, not experimental trials.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Well-defined etiological agent. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers, do not have a single, well-defined etiological agent like communicable diseases (e.g., infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites). NCDs are typically caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, rather than a specific infectious agent. Incorrect Options: B. Multifactorial causation This is correct. Non-communicable diseases have multifactorial causation, meaning they arise due to a combination of several factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices (like diet and exercise), environmental exposures, and sometimes, age or gender. C. Long latent period This is correct. Non-communicable diseases often have a long latent period, meaning the disease develops over an extended period of time before symptoms appear. For example, the risk factors for cardiovascular disease may accumulate over decades before a person experiences a heart attack. D. Variable onset This is correct. Non-communicable diseases can have a variable onset—they may develop slowly over many years or even decades, or in some cases, may present more suddenly (as in some types of cancer).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypertension. The \"Rule of Halves\" refers to the concept that in the context of hypertension, approximately: Half of people with high blood pressure (hypertension) are undiagnosed. Half of the people diagnosed with hypertension do not receive treatment. Half of the people who are treated for hypertension do not have their condition controlled effectively. This rule highlights the underdiagnosis, undertreatment, and insufficient control of hypertension, which is a major public health concern. The rule is often used to emphasize the importance of improving the detection and management of hypertension to prevent its complications, such as heart disease and stroke. Incorrect Options: A. CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) This is incorrect. While the \"Rule of Halves\" is widely associated with hypertension, it is not typically applied to coronary heart disease. However, a similar concept may apply to other diseases where detection and treatment rates are suboptimal. C. Blindness This is incorrect. The \"Rule of Halves\" is not commonly associated with blindness. Although there are many barriers to preventing and treating blindness, the concept of the \"Rule of Halves\" specifically refers to hypertension. D. Accidents & Injuries This is incorrect. While accidents and injuries are significant public health issues, they do not follow the \"Rule of Halves.\" The rule is more relevant to chronic conditions like hypertension where there is often a gap in diagnosis, treatment, and control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Injury prevention. The Haddon Matrix is a framework developed by Dr. William Haddon to analyze and prevent injuries. It is widely used in injury prevention programs to understand the factors involved in the occurrence of injuries and to develop strategies for reducing or preventing them. The matrix takes into account three key factors: Host: The individual who may suffer the injury (e.g., their behavior, age, health). Agent: The cause of the injury (e.g., a vehicle in a car crash, a sharp object causing a cut). Environment: The surroundings or conditions that contribute to the injury (e.g., road conditions, lighting, weather). By analyzing these factors, the Haddon Matrix helps in designing preventive measures at various points of the injury process, including during the pre-event, event, and post-event stages. Incorrect Options: A. Hypertensive disorders This is incorrect. The Haddon Matrix is not related to hypertensive disorders. Hypertension is primarily managed through medical treatment and lifestyle changes, but the Haddon Matrix focuses on injury prevention rather than chronic diseases. B. Communicable diseases This is incorrect. The Haddon Matrix is not specifically related to communicable diseases, which are caused by pathogens and are typically addressed through measures like vaccination, sanitation, and public health interventions. C. Maternal & child mortality This is incorrect. While maternal and child mortality is a critical area of public health, the Haddon Matrix is not directly related to this topic. Strategies to reduce maternal and child mortality focus on healthcare access, nutrition, and disease prevention, not injury prevention.",

At such a low BMI, the body is not receiving adequate nutrition and essential nutrients to function, which can lead to organ failure, weakened immune function, and other life-threatening conditions. A BMI below 13 is generally considered critical, and medical intervention is required immediately. Incorrect Options: B. 12 This is incorrect.
