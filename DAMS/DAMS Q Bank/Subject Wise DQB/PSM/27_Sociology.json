      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Culture. Culture refers to the learned behaviors, beliefs, customs, values, and norms that are passed down from one generation to another in a society. It is socially acquired, meaning that it is not biologically inherited but learned through interaction with others in a community. Culture includes practices, languages, rituals, and other aspects that define a particular group of people. It shapes how individuals behave and interact within society, and it is learned over time through socialization. Culture is the most accurate term for \"learned behavior which is socially acquired,\" as it encompasses the entire spectrum of behaviors and practices that individuals in a society adopt and share. It reflects the way people live, interact, and pass knowledge down through generations. Incorrect Options: A (Customs): Customs are specific, traditional practices or behaviors that are commonly accepted within a society or culture. While customs are part of culture, they are not the same as culture itself. Customs are a subset of culture, often referring to particular practices, such as holiday traditions or social greetings, but not the broad scope of learned behavior. B (Acculturation): Acculturation refers to the process of cultural exchange and adaptation that occurs when individuals or groups from different cultural backgrounds come into contact. It involves the adoption of certain cultural traits from another culture, but it is not the overall \"learned behavior\" in a society. It is more about the changes or modifications that occur in one culture due to exposure to another. C (Standard of living): Standard of living refers to the material well-being or economic condition of individuals or groups, measured by factors like income, employment, and access to goods and services. It is not related to the learned, socially acquired behaviors that are inherent in culture.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Social Pathology. Social Pathology refers to the study and understanding of the relationship between diseases (particularly those related to health issues) and social conditions. It looks at how societal factors like poverty, inequality, living conditions, and lifestyle choices contribute to the development, spread, and management of diseases. Social pathologists examine how social problems, such as lack of education, access to healthcare, and unemployment, affect public health outcomes. Social Pathology focuses on how social structures, conditions, and factors influence the prevalence of diseases and health problems in society. It emphasizes the role of society in shaping health outcomes, often pointing out how systemic issues contribute to the spread of diseases and how social reforms can improve public health. Incorrect Options: A (Socialism): Socialism is a political and economic theory advocating for social ownership and the redistribution of wealth. While socialism can influence social conditions, it does not specifically describe the relationship between disease and social conditions. Socialism is a broader ideology, not a field of study regarding diseases. B (Acculturation): Acculturation refers to the process by which individuals or groups from different cultural backgrounds adapt to or adopt elements of another culture. While it can influence behavior and social practices, it is not concerned with the relationship between disease and social conditions. D (Social Defence): Social Defence refers to the strategies and policies used to protect society from various threats, including social, political, and economic challenges. While it can involve public health measures, it is more focused on societal stability and security rather than the study of diseases and social conditions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Acculturation refers to the process in which individuals or groups from one culture come into contact with and adopt elements of another culture, such as customs, beliefs, practices, and technologies. This process can occur through various means, and education, industrialization, and trade and commerce are all significant factors that contribute to acculturation. Education: Education systems can introduce individuals to new cultural norms, values, and knowledge, which may influence their attitudes and behaviors, leading to acculturation. Industrialization: Industrialization often brings about significant social and cultural changes, as new technologies, work practices, and ways of life are introduced. It can result in the blending of cultural elements as people from different backgrounds work together in industrial environments. Trade and Commerce: Trade and commerce facilitate the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices between different societies, promoting acculturation by exposing people to new customs, foods, technologies, and even languages. Acculturation can occur through multiple channels, and each of the options—education, industrialization, and trade and commerce—are important pathways through which cultural exchanges and assimilation can happen. Incorrect Options: A (Education): Education is an important factor in acculturation, but it is not the only way that cultural exchange can happen. As such, it is incomplete by itself. B (Industrialization): Industrialization plays a significant role in cultural changes, but it is just one of several ways acculturation can occur, not the only factor. C (Trade and Commerce): While trade and commerce can lead to cultural exchange and acculturation, it is also just one of the many factors, making it insufficient on its own to account for the entire process of acculturation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Society. A society refers to an organized group of people who share a common culture, territory, and social relationships. It is a broad term that encompasses a network of people interacting in various ways to form social structures, institutions, and norms. Members of a society typically work together to maintain and evolve cultural, economic, and political systems. Society is defined as an organized group of people with established social relationships, shared norms, values, and institutions. It represents a larger social structure where people interact, create rules, and build communities. Incorrect Options: A (Community): A community refers to a smaller group within a society, often based on shared interests, geography, or values. While communities have social relationships, they are not as broad or organized as society. Society includes multiple communities that interact with one another. B (Association): An association refers to a group of people who come together for a specific purpose or common interest, such as professional organizations, clubs, or trade unions. It is typically more focused and smaller in scope than society, which is much more extensive. D (Family): A family is a social unit made up of individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption. While families form the foundation of society, they are smaller in scale and have a more specific social relationship than the larger concept of society.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Attitude. In the context of communication and health education, a change in the affective level refers to a shift in attitudes—how individuals feel, perceive, or value certain behaviors or health-related issues. The affective domain focuses on feelings, emotions, and attitudes, as opposed to cognitive (knowledge) or psychomotor (skills) domains. Effective health education aims to change people's attitudes toward health practices, motivating them to adopt healthier behaviors. Attitude change is a key goal of health communication and education. For example, teaching individuals the importance of hygiene or vaccination often aims to shift their attitudes about these practices, influencing their decisions and behavior in the long run. Incorrect Options: A (Knowledge): While knowledge is a critical component of health education, it primarily pertains to the cognitive domain, not the affective domain. Health education also aims to increase knowledge, but a change in the affective level specifically refers to changes in attitude, not knowledge. C (Skills): Skills are part of the psychomotor domain and involve learning how to perform certain tasks (e.g., how to properly administer a first aid treatment or use a health device). Changing the affective level does not directly refer to skill acquisition but to emotional and attitudinal changes. D (All): While communication and health education may aim to improve knowledge, attitudes, and skills, the affective level specifically pertains to changes in attitude, not all three domains. Therefore, D (All) is not the correct choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Opinion. Opinion refers to a person's inner subjective thought or judgment about an individual, situation, or issue. It represents a personal view or belief that may not necessarily be based on evidence or facts but reflects an individual’s perception or feeling about something. Opinions are subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. Opinion is a personal and subjective evaluation or belief about someone or something. It reflects an individual's thoughts or feelings but is not necessarily rooted in deep conviction or universally accepted facts. Incorrect Options: A (Attitude): Attitude refers to a person's settled way of thinking or feeling about something or someone, typically influencing their behavior. While opinion is a component of attitude, it is more specifically about a person's thought or view on a particular issue, whereas attitude is a broader, more enduring disposition toward something. B (Value): Value refers to deep-seated beliefs or principles about what is important or desirable. It is more foundational and enduring than an opinion, representing a person's moral or ethical stance, whereas an opinion is more immediate and subject to change. C (Belief): A belief is a conviction or acceptance that something is true or real, often without needing empirical evidence. While beliefs shape opinions, beliefs are deeper and often more ingrained, whereas opinions are specific, less permanent judgments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Self-actualization. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self-actualization is at the top of the pyramid. Maslow proposed a theory of human motivation in which basic needs must be fulfilled before higher-level needs can be pursued. Self-actualization refers to the realization of an individual's full potential, personal growth, creativity, and self-fulfillment. It is the highest level of need, where an individual reaches their fullest potential and strives to be the best version of themselves. Self-actualization represents the ultimate level of psychological development, where an individual is fully functioning and at peace with themselves, achieving personal goals and desires that are aligned with their potential and life purpose. Incorrect Options: A (Physical needs): Physical needs are at the bottom of Maslow’s pyramid. These include basic survival needs like food, water, and shelter. These needs must be met first before higher needs can be addressed. C (Safety): Safety is the second level in the hierarchy, just above physical needs. It includes the need for security, stability, and protection from harm, such as personal security and financial security. D (Esteem recognition): Esteem recognition falls under the fourth level in Maslow’s pyramid, above social needs but below self-actualization. It involves the need for respect, status, recognition, and feelings of accomplishment, but it is not the highest level of need.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 50-69. In historical terms, a moron was used to describe an individual with an IQ ranging from 50 to 69. This classification came from the early 20th century when intelligence testing became more widespread. According to old classifications, individuals with IQ scores in this range were considered to have a mild intellectual disability. Modern terminology has since moved away from these outdated and stigmatizing labels, replacing them with terms like \"mild intellectual disability.\" Individuals with an IQ score between 50 and 69 were traditionally classified as morons in the early IQ classification systems. However, such terms are no longer commonly used in modern psychological practice due to their negative connotations. Incorrect Options: A (0-24): An IQ in the range of 0-24 would indicate profound intellectual disability. These individuals typically need extensive support for everyday functioning. B (25-49): An IQ score in the range of 25-49 falls into the category of severe intellectual disability. Individuals in this category also require significant assistance with daily activities. D (70-79): An IQ score between 70-79 falls under the category of borderline intellectual functioning. People in this range may have some learning difficulties, but they do not typically have an intellectual disability.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is applied to all nuclear families of less than 10 years duration. The term \"new families\" typically refers to nuclear families that have been established relatively recently. These are families where the parents and children live together, but the family unit has been formed within the last 10 years. It is a term used to describe families that are in the early stages of formation, distinguishing them from older nuclear families or extended families. New families are specifically those nuclear families that have been formed recently, usually within a span of less than 10 years. This differentiates them from other established family structures. Incorrect Options: A (It is a variant of three generation family): A three-generation family typically consists of grandparents, parents, and children living together. This is an extended family structure, not a new family. \"New families\" refers to the more modern nuclear family model, not the multi-generational structure. C (It is a variant of joint family): A joint family is an extended family structure where multiple generations live together, sharing common resources. \"New families\" are distinct from joint families, as they consist of a nuclear family living independently, usually formed in recent years. D (It is applied to all nuclear families less than 2 years duration): The term \"new families\" is generally applied to nuclear families that have been established within the last 10 years, not just within a 2-year duration. This makes option D too narrow compared to the broader definition. Conclusion:",
