      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Late Stage II. The demographic gap refers to the difference between the birth rate and the death rate in a population. It is an indicator of population growth. In Stage I (High Stationary) of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), both birth and death rates are high, so population growth is slow, and the demographic gap is small. In Stage II (Early Expanding), the death rate declines significantly due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition, while the birth rate remains high, leading to a widening demographic gap and rapid population growth. In Late Stage II, the gap attains its maximum limit, as birth rates are still high, but death rates have already fallen drastically. In Stage III (Late Expanding), birth rates begin to decline, reducing the demographic gap. By Stage IV (Low Stationary), birth and death rates are both low, and the demographic gap shrinks further. Incorrect Options: A. Early Stage I – Incorrect. In this stage, both birth and death rates are high, so the demographic gap is small. C. Late Stage III – Incorrect. By this stage, birth rates begin to decline, so the demographic gap narrows. D. Early Stage IV – Incorrect. In this stage, both birth and death rates are low, leading to a minimal demographic gap.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Death rate declines still further, & birth rate tends to fall also. True about the Late Expanding Phase of the Demographic Cycle Understanding the Late Expanding Phase (Stage III) The Demographic Transition Model (DTM) describes how population growth changes over time based on birth and death rates. In Stage II (Early Expanding): The death rate declines significantly due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition, but the birth rate remains high, leading to rapid population growth. In Stage III (Late Expanding): The death rate continues to decline, but at a slower rate. The birth rate also starts to decline due to increased urbanization, family planning, education, and economic changes. Population growth slows down as the gap between birth and death rates narrows. Incorrect Options: A. Birth rate is lower than death rate In the Late Expanding Phase, the birth rate is still higher than the death rate, leading to continued (but slower) population growth. B. Death rate declines still further & birth rate tends to increase The death rate does decline, but birth rates do not increase. Instead, they start to decline due to social and economic changes. D. High birth rate & high death rate This describes Stage I (High Stationary Phase), where both birth and death rates are high, keeping the population stable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Late Expanding Phase. Explanation: India's Current Stage in the Demographic Cycle India is currently in the third stage (Late Expanding Stage) of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM). This phase is characterized by: Declining death rates due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition. Gradual decline in birth rates due to increased urbanization, education, and family planning initiatives. Continued population growth, though at a slower rate compared to earlier stages. Large young population, leading to demographic momentum even as fertility rates decrease. India’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has been declining steadily and is approaching replacement level (around 2.0). However, the population is still growing due to a large base of young individuals entering reproductive age. Incorrect Options: A. High Stationary Phase (Stage I) This stage is marked by high birth and high death rates, leading to a stable but low population. India was in this phase before industrialization and healthcare improvements in the early 20th century. With modern medical advancements and better living conditions, India moved past this stage decades ago. C. Early Stationary Phase (Stage IV) Incorrect This phase is characterized by low birth and death rates, leading to a stable population. Countries like Japan, Germany, and the USA are in this stage. India is not yet in this phase because birth rates are still above replacement levels and population growth continues. D. Low Stationary Phase (Stage V) This stage is marked by birth rates falling below death rates, leading to negative population growth. Countries like Japan and some European nations are experiencing this phase. India still has a growing population, so it has not yet entered this stage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Morbidity \"Demographic processes\" refer to the key factors that influence population size and structure over time. These include fertility, mortality, migration, and social mobility, as they directly impact the growth, composition, and distribution of populations. However, morbidity (illness or disease prevalence) is not considered a demographic process because: It affects health status rather than directly altering population size. While morbidity may contribute to mortality, it does not itself determine population growth, decline, or movement. Demography focuses on births, deaths, and population movements, whereas morbidity is more relevant to epidemiology and public health. Incorrect Options: (A) Fertility Fertility refers to the number of births in a population, which is a core component of demographic processes because it directly influences population growth. (C) Mortality Mortality refers to death rates, which is another crucial demographic factor affecting population decline and life expectancy trends. (D) Social Mobility Social mobility refers to changes in socioeconomic status, often linked to migration and demographic shifts.

While social mobility can help achieve social equality, they are not the same. (C) Socioeconomic Upliftment Socioeconomic upliftment refers to general improvement in the economic and social conditions of a community or group. It is a broader concept that may include government policies, education reforms, and social programs, rather than just individual movement within the social hierarchy.

Incorrect Options: (A) 23-38 years A population doubling in 23-38 years would require a growth rate of 1.8%–3%, which was seen in past decades but is no longer valid today. (B) 28-35 years A growth rate of around 2% per year would lead to doubling in this range, but India's growth rate has declined below 1.2%. (C) 35-47 years This range would imply a higher growth rate than India's current one. Since India's fertility rates are declining, doubling time has increased beyond this estimate",

Incorrect Options: (A) Crude Birth Rate (CBR) - Crude Death Rate (CDR) While CBR minus CDR gives the natural growth rate, it does not account for migration effects, making it different from the actual annual growth rate. (B) Crude Death Rate (CDR) - Crude Birth Rate (CBR) This would give a negative value, which is incorrect because birth rates are usually higher than death rates in growing populations. (D) CBR + CDR This is mathematically incorrect since adding birth and death rates does not represent population growth. Instead, net growth is derived from births minus deaths.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mid year population Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is the simplest measure of fertility because it expresses the number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year. The formula for CBR is: CBR=(Total Live Births in a Year/ Mid-Year Population) X 1000 Mid-Year Population is used as the denominator because: It provides a better estimate of the population at risk of giving birth compared to the total population at the beginning or end of the year. It accounts for fluctuations due to deaths, migration, and other demographic changes during the year. It is a standardized denominator used in global fertility and demographic studies. Thus, option (B) is the correct answer as mid-year population is the basis for calculating CBR. Incorrect Options: (A) Total Population While CBR is calculated per 1,000 people, it specifically uses the mid-year population, not the total population at any arbitrary point. The total population fluctuates, and using it can lead to inconsistencies in fertility measurement. (C) Live Births Only The numerator of CBR is live births, but fertility rates require a denominator to make meaningful comparisons across populations. Without considering the population size, the number of live births alone cannot measure fertility levels accurately. (D) Pre-term Births CBR includes all live births, whether pre-term, full-term, or post-term. The classification of pre-term births does not affect CBR calculations. A measure focusing on pre-term births would be a different statistic, such as the pre-term birth rate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The first population census in India was conducted in 1871 during British rule. This was initiated under the leadership of Lord Mayo, the then Viceroy of India. The census was not synchronous (not conducted on the same day across all regions) and was not uniform due to challenges in data collection across the country. Though incomplete, it was the first attempt at systematically collecting population data in India. It laid the groundwork for future censuses, leading to the first synchronous and complete census in 1881. Thus, option (B) is correct as the first census in India was conducted in 1871. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: (A) 1861 There was no official census in 1861. Some fragmentary population data were collected in certain regions, but it was not a structured census. (C) 1881 The first complete and synchronous census of India was conducted in 1881 under Lord Ripon. However, since the question asks for the first-ever census, 1871 is the correct answer. (D) 1891 The 1891 census was the second synchronous census, following the 1881 census. By this time, census methods had improved, but the first attempt was still in 1871.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is actually a ratio not a rate) Explanation: While often referred to as a \"rate,\" the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is technically a ratio. It is calculated as the number of live births in a year divided by the mid-year population in that year, and the result is usually multiplied by 1,000 to express it as births per 1,000 population. A true \"rate\" would involve a measure of the population at risk in the denominator, specifically the number of women of childbearing age. Since the CBR uses the total population, it is a simpler ratio. Incorrect Options: A. It is a measure of fertility Explanation: This statement is true. The Crude Birth Rate is a basic demographic measure of the fertility of a population, indicating the number of live births per 1,000 people. C. It is independent of age of population Explanation: This statement is false. The CBR is heavily influenced by the age structure of the population. A population with a larger proportion of women in their reproductive years will likely have a higher CBR compared to a population with fewer women in that age group, even if the actual fertility behavior of women in both populations is the same. D. Numerator does not include still births Explanation: This statement is true. The numerator in the CBR calculation includes only live births. Stillbirths, which are the births of a fetus that has died in utero after a certain gestational age, are not included in the calculation of the Crude Birth Rate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rapid growth in population that leads to misbalance in birth and death • Exponential growth refers to a rapid and continuous increase in population size over time when there are unlimited resources and no significant constraints (such as food shortages, disease, or space limitations). P(t)=P0ert where: • P(t) = Population at time t • P0 = Initial population • r = Growth rate • e = Euler's number (approx. 2.718) • In exponential growth, the birth rate remains significantly higher than the death rate, creating a population explosion. • This misbalance leads to overpopulation, resource depletion, and environmental stress, making option (A) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: • (B) \"Slow growth rate\" → Incorrect - Exponential growth is the opposite of slow growth. - It starts slow but accelerates rapidly as population size increases because new individuals keep reproducing at the same rate. • (C) \"Growth limited by limiting factors\" → Incorrect - Growth that is limited by factors like food, space, or disease follows a logistic growth model, not an exponential one. - Logistic growth has an S-shaped curve (sigmoid curve) due to carrying capacity constraints, while exponential growth has a J-shaped curve. • (D) \"None of the above\" → Incorrect - Since option (A) correctly defines exponential growth, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The age pyramid of India typically has a broad base and a narrow apex. This shape indicates that India's population is youthful, with a large proportion of people in the younger age groups, while the older age groups (the apex) make up a smaller proportion. A broad base reflects high birth rates, and the narrowing at the top reflects lower survival rates among the elderly, which is characteristic of a developing country like India. The shape of the pyramid suggests a high dependency ratio, with more younger individuals relying on the working-age population. Incorrect Options: (B) \"Broad from base to apex\" A pyramid that is broad from the base to the apex would suggest a population with almost equal distribution across age groups, which is not true for India. India has a larger younger population, not an evenly distributed one across all age groups. (C) \"Broad at apex & narrow at base\" This would suggest a declining population with more elderly individuals than younger individuals, which is characteristic of developed countries with low birth rates and high life expectancy, not India. India has a large young population, so this description doesn't fit. (D) \"All\" Since options (B) and (C) are incorrect, this option is not valid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The carrying capacity of a population refers to the maximum number of individuals that an environment can support sustainably over time without degrading the resources. This capacity is determined by the availability and sustainability of limiting resources, such as food, water, space, and shelter. When the availability of these resources is exhausted or limited, the population can no longer grow, and it may stabilize or decline. In essence, limiting resources (such as food or water) restrict the growth of the population, setting the carrying capacity. Incorrect Options: (A) \"Population growth rate\" The population growth rate reflects how fast the population is increasing or decreasing. While it influences population dynamics, it does not directly determine the carrying capacity. The growth rate may be impacted by the available resources, but it doesn't establish the upper limit of the population that can be sustained. (B) \"Birth rate\" The birth rate affects how fast the population is increasing, but it does not determine the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is more about the environment's resources, not just how many individuals are being born. (C) \"Death rate\" The death rate influences the overall size of the population, but again, it doesn't determine the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is more about the availability of resources to support the population, not the death rate alone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The sex ratio is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in a population. If the sex ratio is more than 1000, it indicates that there are more females than males in the population. In a population of 10,000 people, if the sex ratio is more than 1000, the number of females would be greater than the number of males. Therefore, males would be less than 5000 (since if the number of males were 5000, the sex ratio would be exactly 1000, not more than 1000). Incorrect Options: (A) \"Males are less than 500\" This would imply that there are very few males compared to females, which would result in a sex ratio much higher than 1000. This scenario would make the number of females significantly larger than the number of males. The sex ratio would be greater than 1000 with such a small number of males. (B) \"Females are less than 500\" If the number of females were less than 500, it would result in a sex ratio much less than 1000, which contradicts the given condition of having a sex ratio of more than 1000. (D) \"Females are less than 5000\" If the number of females were less than 5000, the sex ratio would likely still be less than or around 1000, depending on the exact number of males.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) \"Population under 15 years and 65 and above\" is Correct The dependency ratio measures the proportion of the population that is dependent on the working-age group (typically considered as individuals aged 15-64 years). The numerator of the dependency ratio is typically composed of the dependent population, which includes those under the age of 15 (the young dependents) and those over the age of 65 (the elderly dependents). Therefore, the correct formula for the numerator in calculating the dependency ratio is Population under 15 years and 65 years and above. Incorrect Options: (A) \"Population under 10 years and 60 and above\" This option is not correct because the standard age groups for the dependent population are usually under 15 years (for young dependents) and over 65 years (for elderly dependents), not under 10 years or 60 years. This classification would underestimate the dependency ratio, as more people fall into the dependent age groups above 10 years and 60 years. (B) \"Population under 15 years and 60 and above\" This option also uses an incorrect age group for the elderly. The elderly are generally classified as 65 years and older for the dependency ratio, not 60 years. Therefore, this option doesn't match the standard definition. (C) \"Population under 10 years and 65 and above\" Similar to option A, this classification of young dependents as under 10 years does not align with the usual age range of under 15 years for young dependents in the dependency ratio formula.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Potential Support Ratio (PSR) is the number of persons aged 15 to 65 per one older person aged 65 years or older. PSR is an important demographic measure that indicates the number of working-age individuals (15-64 years) available to support one elderly person (≥65 years). It is calculated as: PSR= Population aged 15-64 years/Population age 65+ years This ratio is crucial for assessing the economic burden on the workforce due to an aging population. A lower PSR indicates fewer working-age individuals available to support elderly dependents, which may strain social security systems and healthcare services. Incorrect Options: Option (A) This option defines a ratio that compares the working-age population to children below 15 years. However, PSR specifically measures support for the elderly, not children. The correct ratio for children would be part of the overall dependency ratio, not PSR. Option (C) This option includes both younger persons (<15 years) and older persons (≥65 years) as dependents. However, PSR only considers the elderly (≥65 years) as dependents, making this definition incorrect. Option (D) This definition includes persons older than 60 years rather than 65 years. However, PSR is specifically calculated for those aged 65 and above, making this definition inaccurate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 18.6 per 1000 population. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is the average number of children a woman is expected to have during her reproductive years (15-49 years). The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is the number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year. In India, demographic studies and past census data indicate a strong correlation between TFR and CBR. A TFR of around 2.1 to 2.2 typically corresponds to a Crude Birth Rate (CBR) of approximately 18-19 per 1000 population. Given that India’s TFR is 2.2, the estimated CBR would be around 18.6 per 1000 population, making Option (A) the correct choice. Incorrect Options: Option (B) – 19.2 per 1000 population A CBR of 19.2 per 1000 is slightly higher than expected for a TFR of 2.2. While there is a correlation between TFR and CBR, a TFR of 2.2 aligns more closely with a CBR of around 18.6 rather than 19.2. Option (C) – 22.4 per 1000 population A higher CBR of 22.4 per 1000 typically corresponds to a TFR closer to 2.5-2.6. Since India’s TFR is 2.2, the birth rate is expected to be lower than 22.4. Option (D) – 26.2 per 1000 population A CBR of 26.2 per 1000 population is observed in countries with a TFR above 3.5-4.0. India’s TFR has been declining, and at 2.2, the birth rate is much lower than 26.2.",

Incorrect Options: Option (B) – 4 A GRR of 4 would mean that all children born per woman are female, which is unrealistic since typically only 50% of births are female. Option (C) – 8 A GRR of 8 would require a TFR of 8 and all births being female, which is not the case here.

To achieve NRR = 1, the Couple Protection Rate (CPR)—which refers to the percentage of couples effectively using contraception—must be above 60%. This is because: NRR depends on fertility and female survival rates. If fertility rates are high and contraception use is low, more children are born, increasing NRR. A CPR of at least 60% is required to bring down the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to replacement level (~2.1 children per woman), ensuring that each generation replaces itself without population growth. Thus, demographers agree that for NRR to reach 1, the Couple Protection Rate must exceed 60%. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – 40% A CPR of 40% is too low to achieve NRR = 1. At this level, many couples are still having more children, leading to continued population growth. Option (B) – 50% While a CPR of 50% reduces fertility rates, it is usually not sufficient to bring TFR down to replacement level (~2.1), meaning NRR may still be above 1. Option (D) – 70% A CPR above 70% would likely push NRR below 1, leading to population decline rather than just stabilization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Net Reproduction Rate (NRR). Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) takes into account mortality rates, as it measures the number of daughters a woman is expected to have during her lifetime, adjusted for the survival of female children to the reproductive age. This means that female mortality before reaching reproductive age is considered, making NRR a mortality-adjusted measure. For example, if there are higher mortality rates among female children, the NRR will be lower because fewer daughters survive to replace their mothers. Explanation for Incorrect Options: Option (A) – Total Fertility Rate (TFR) TFR is the average number of children a woman is expected to have during her reproductive years, assuming no mortality. It does not include mortality rates, as it only reflects fertility. Option (B) – General Fertility Rate (GFR) GFR measures the number of live births per 1,000 women of reproductive age in a given year. It is a fertility measure and does not adjust for mortality. Option (D) – Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) GRR is the number of female children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, but it assumes no mortality (like TFR). Therefore, it does not include mortality rates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Net Reproduction Rate (NRR). The Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) is considered the best indicator of fertility because it accounts for both fertility and mortality rates. It specifically measures the number of daughters a woman is expected to have during her lifetime, considering that some children may not survive to the reproductive age. An NRR of 1 indicates that the population is replacing itself, while a rate above or below 1 shows whether the population is growing or shrinking, respectively. This makes the NRR a more accurate indicator of the long-term sustainability of fertility within a population, as it integrates both survival and reproduction. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – Crude Birth Rate (CBR) The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) measures the total number of births per 1,000 people in a population in a given year. It provides a general indication of fertility but is not specific to age or gender, and does not reflect the fertility behavior of women in childbearing age. Therefore, it is a less precise indicator of fertility compared to the NRR. Option (B) – Total Fertility Rate (TFR) The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) measures the total number of children a woman would have during her lifetime, assuming she experiences the current age-specific fertility rates. While it provides a direct measure of fertility, it does not account for mortality. It is a useful indicator but is not as comprehensive as the Net Reproduction Rate (NRR), which adjusts for both fertility and mortality. Option (D) – Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) The Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) measures the number of daughters a woman is expected to have during her lifetime, assuming no mortality. While it provides an understanding of fertility, it does not account for survival rates, making it less reliable than the Net Reproduction Rate (NRR), which adjusts for mortality.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 60 days of arrival in India. According to Indian law, a child born to an Indian couple outside India must have their birth registered within 60 days of arrival in India. This is in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Registrar General of India for the registration of births and deaths. The purpose of this registration is to ensure that the child's birth is officially recorded by the Indian authorities, which is necessary for obtaining an Indian birth certificate, passport, and other legal documentation. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – 21 days There is no requirement for registering the birth within 21 days of birth outside India. The period for registration is 60 days upon arrival in India. Option (B) – 21 days of arrival in India The registration requirement is 60 days upon arrival in India, not 21 days. Hence, this option is incorrect. Option (C) – 60 days While the 60-day period is correct, it is crucial that it applies specifically to the arrival in India. Therefore, the context is important in this case. Conclusion: The birth registration must be done within 60 days of arrival in India to ensure that the birth is officially recorded. Thus, the correct answer is (D) 60 days of arrival in India.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 6 months. The Sample Registration System (SRS) in India is designed for continuous monitoring of birth and death rates across the country. It is a large-scale survey system that provides reliable data on vital statistics, including birth and death enumeration. The system operates on a 6-monthly basis, meaning that data is collected and updated every six months to provide accurate and timely estimates of vital events. The SRS is important for monitoring population growth, fertility, mortality, and other demographic trends. Incorrect Options: Option (B) – 1 year The SRS does not operate annually but rather on a 6-monthly basis. A yearly enumeration would delay the data collection and reduce its effectiveness for timely policy planning and intervention. Option (C) – 5 years A 5-year interval is too long to provide up-to-date demographic data on births and deaths. The 6-month interval ensures that the data reflects more immediate trends.

Good healthcare infrastructure with widespread access to healthcare services. Successful public health programs, including efforts to control communicable diseases and improve maternal and child health. These achievements make Kerala a model for health in India and an example of how good governance, public health initiatives, and education can lead to better health outcomes. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – Tamil Nadu While Tamil Nadu has made considerable progress in health and development, Kerala is generally considered the standard-bearer for health in India due to its superior health indicators. Option (C) – Andhra Pradesh Although Andhra Pradesh has made progress in health, it does not have the same consistently high health outcomes as Kerala.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infant Mortality Rate (IMR). The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is considered one of the best determinants of a country's health status because it reflects the number of infants dying before reaching the age of one, per 1,000 live births in a given year. IMR is a sensitive indicator because it is directly linked to several factors: Healthcare quality, including prenatal and postnatal care. Nutrition of mothers and infants. Access to healthcare and sanitation. Maternal health and socio-economic conditions. A low IMR indicates a higher standard of healthcare and a healthier population, while a high IMR typically signals inadequate healthcare infrastructure and living conditions. Thus, it provides a comprehensive view of a nation's health and welfare. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – Couple Protection Rate (CPR) The Couple Protection Rate (CPR) measures the percentage of couples using some form of contraception. While it is important for family planning, it is not as direct an indicator of overall health status as IMR. Option (C) – Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) measures deaths due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth. While it is important, it is not as sensitive or widely used as IMR for assessing a country’s general health status. Option (D) – Crude Death Rate (CDR) The Crude Death Rate (CDR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 people in a year. It includes deaths from all age groups and may not accurately reflect the health status of the infant and maternal population, which are key indicators of health.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 1921 The year 1921 is referred to as the \"Year of the Big Divide\" in the history of demography in India. This term is used because, in 1921, India experienced a significant shift in its population growth trend. Prior to 1921, the population of India had been growing at a slow pace, largely due to high mortality rates. However, after 1921, the country entered a phase of rapid population growth, driven by a decline in mortality rates, especially infant mortality. This demographic shift marked the beginning of a new population growth pattern, which has continued in India to the present day, with both increasing life expectancy and a growing population. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – 1881 (Incorrect): While the 1881 Census was an important milestone in the demographic history of India, it does not represent the significant shift in population growth rates that occurred in 1921. Option (C) – 1947 (Incorrect): The year 1947 marks the independence of India, not a demographic milestone. It does not signify the \"Big Divide\" in terms of population growth patterns. Option (D) – 1978 (Incorrect): The year 1978 does not correspond to a major demographic shift in India. While this period saw some changes in the population policies and family planning programs, the \"Big Divide\" was in 1921, not 1978.",

The first census in independent India was conducted in 1951, and subsequent censuses have been conducted every 10 years.

This data is crucial for policymaking, resource allocation, and planning in various sectors. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – 25 years The census is conducted every 10 years, not 25 years.

The Sample Registration System (SRS) is a system used for the collection of data to provide national and sub-national estimates of vital indicators like birth and death rates. It involves a continuous enumeration system and is backed by 6-monthly surveys. This system is one of the most reliable sources of data for estimating the birth rate, death rate, and other demographic statistics in India. The SRS uses a dual-record system, with data collected from households and civil registration records (birth and death certificates). This helps ensure accuracy and consistency in the estimation of vital statistics, even in rural and remote areas. Incorrect Options: Option (A) – Model Registration Survey The Model Registration Survey is a separate system for testing and improving the reliability of birth and death registration data, but it is not the system that is continuously collecting data for national and sub-national estimates. Option (B) – National Sample Survey The National Sample Survey (NSS) is focused on collecting data on various socio-economic indicators (such as income, employment, and consumption) and is not specifically designed for estimating vital indicators like birth and death rates.

Explanation of the Correct Answer: An IUCD (Intrauterine Contraceptive Device), such as a Copper-T or hormonal IUD (e.g., Mirena), is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), not a barrier method. It works by: • Preventing sperm from fertilizing the egg • Creating an unfavorable uterine environment for implantation Since the patient specifically requests only a barrier method, IUCD would not be an appropriate suggestion. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Vaginal Sponge (Barrier Method). A vaginal sponge is a barrier contraceptive that contains spermicide and is placed inside the vagina before intercourse to block and kill sperm. (B) Female Condom (Barrier Method). A female condom is a physical barrier that prevents sperm from entering the cervix, reducing the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). (C) Spermicidal Jellies (Barrier Method). Spermicidal jellies contain chemicals that kill sperm and are often used alongside other barrier methods like diaphragms or condoms.",

Incorrect Options: (A) Declining Stage In the declining stage, both birth rates and death rates decrease, leading to low population growth or even negative growth. The demographic gap is narrow in this stage. (B) High Stationary Stage In this stage, both birth and death rates are high, resulting in low population growth. Since the birth and death rates are close to each other, the demographic gap is small.
