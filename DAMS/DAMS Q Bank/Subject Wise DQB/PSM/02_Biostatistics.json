      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Quantitative data of a group of patients. Histogram is used to represent quantitative data in the form of a graphical display, where data is divided into bins or intervals. It is typically used to show the distribution of continuous or discrete data points, such as the number of patients in different age groups or the blood pressure measurements of a group of patients. Incorrect Options: B: Qualitative data of a group of patients – Incorrect. Histograms are not used to represent qualitative data, which typically consists of categories or labels (e.g., gender, race). For qualitative data, other types of charts, such as bar charts, are more appropriate. C: Data collected on a normal scale – Incorrect. The term normal scale is not typically used in statistical data classification. Histograms are used for continuous data on an interval or ratio scale, which involves numbers that can be measured on a scale (e.g., age, height, weight). D: Data collected on ordinal scale – Incorrect. Ordinal data refers to data that has a clear ordering (e.g., stages of cancer, rankings). Histograms are not the best tool for ordinal data, and other techniques like bar charts or ordinal scales would be more appropriate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Severity of anemia. Severity of anemia is an example of ordinal data because it represents a ranking or ordered categories (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). The categories have a meaningful order, but the difference between them is not necessarily uniform or measurable in exact terms. Ordinal data involves categories with a specific order or ranking, but the intervals between the categories are not equal or precisely measurable. Incorrect Options: A: Type of anemia – Incorrect. The type of anemia (e.g., iron-deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia) is typically nominal data, as it involves categories with no intrinsic order. The types of anemia are just labels with no inherent ranking. C: Hemoglobin level – Incorrect. Hemoglobin level is a continuous variable, as it can take any value within a range and can be measured with precision (e.g., 10.5 g/dL, 12.3 g/dL). It is not an ordinal variable, as it involves numeric data with equal intervals. D: Serum ferritin level – Incorrect. Serum ferritin level is also a continuous variable because it is a measurable quantity that can take a wide range of values (e.g., 50 ng/mL, 150 ng/mL). Similar to hemoglobin level, it does not involve ranked categories but specific numeric values.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Continuous. Blood pressure measurement is an example of continuous data because it can take any value within a given range and can be measured with high precision (e.g., 120.5 mmHg, 120.75 mmHg). Continuous data refers to numerical values that can be subdivided into smaller increments, such as height, weight, temperature, or blood pressure. Incorrect Options: A: Nominal – Incorrect. Nominal data refers to categorical data where the categories do not have a meaningful order or ranking (e.g., gender, color, ethnicity). Blood pressure is not categorical; it is a measurable quantity. B: Ordinal – Incorrect. Ordinal data involves categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal (e.g., education level, satisfaction level). Blood pressure does not fit this type because it can take specific numerical values that can be precisely measured. C: Interval – Incorrect. Interval data has equal intervals between values, but it does not have a true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius). While blood pressure measurements have meaningful intervals, they also have a true zero point, so they are better classified as continuous data rather than interval data.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Continuous. A histogram is a graphical representation used to show the distribution of continuous data. It divides the data into bins or intervals on the x-axis, with the frequency of data points (or count) in each bin represented by the height of the bars on the y-axis. Since continuous data can take an infinite number of values within a range, histograms are ideal for visualizing this type of data. Incorrect Options: A: Nominal – Incorrect. Nominal data consists of categories with no inherent order (e.g., gender, blood type, types of fruits). A histogram is not typically used for nominal data because this type of data cannot be divided into meaningful intervals or bins. C: Discrete – Incorrect. Discrete data consists of distinct, countable values (e.g., the number of children in a family, the number of cars). Although histograms can be used for discrete data, bar charts are often preferred because they show individual counts more clearly. Histograms are best suited for continuous data. D: Any of the above – Incorrect. While histograms can technically be used for discrete data, they are most commonly and effectively used for continuous data. Thus, the best answer is B for continuous data, rather than \"any of the above.\"",

It represents categories (e.g., male, female) and does not have a meaningful numerical value or measurement. In this case, gender is not measured or counted on a numerical scale, but rather as a label or category. Incorrect Options: A: Serum cholesterol – Incorrect. Serum cholesterol is a quantitative variable because it can be measured in numeric terms (e.g., 200 mg/dL, 250 mg/dL) and represents an amount. Quantitative variables are those that can be expressed as numbers and can undergo arithmetic operations. B: Weight – Incorrect. Weight is another quantitative variable because it is measured in numerical terms (e.g., 50 kg, 70 kg) and is subject to mathematical calculations like addition and subtraction. D: Celsius temperature scale – Incorrect. The Celsius temperature scale is a quantitative variable because it involves a numerical measurement that can be increased or decreased (e.g., 20°C, 35°C).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ordinal. The scale being used in this scenario is ordinal, because the classification of disease condition involves categories with a meaningful order, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal. The levels normal, mild, moderate, and severe represent an ordered ranking of the severity of the disease. While we can say that \"severe\" is worse than \"moderate,\" we cannot quantify the exact difference between them in a precise, measurable way. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A: Normal – Incorrect. \"Normal\" is just one category and does not describe a scale of measurement. It is a single value within the classification system, not a measurement scale itself. B: Interval – Incorrect. Interval measurement involves numeric values where the intervals between values are equal, and there is no absolute zero. For example, temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit is an interval scale. However, in this case, the classification (normal, mild, moderate, severe) does not have equal intervals between the categories, so it cannot be classified as an interval scale. C: Ratio – Incorrect. Ratio scale involves a true zero point and equal intervals, allowing for a full range of mathematical operations. For example, weight or height is measured on a ratio scale. The disease severity classification does not have an absolute zero and does not measure exact amounts, making it unsuitable as a ratio scale.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Interval/Ratio scale. Mean and standard deviation are measures of central tendency and dispersion that require the data to be on either an interval or ratio scale. These scales have equal intervals between values and allow for meaningful arithmetic operations. Interval scale: Data points are on a continuous scale with equal intervals, but it does not have a true zero point. Examples include temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit). Ratio scale: Similar to interval data, but with a true zero point. Examples include weight, height, and age. Incorrect Options: B: Dichotomous scale – Incorrect. A dichotomous scale involves only two categories (e.g., yes/no, true/false). While we can analyze dichotomous data using proportions or percentages, we cannot calculate the mean or standard deviation from dichotomous variables, as these measures require interval or ratio data. C: Nominal scale – Incorrect. The nominal scale involves categorical data where there is no order or ranking (e.g., gender, blood type). The mean and standard deviation are not applicable to nominal data, as these measures are meant for numerical data with equal intervals. D: Ordinal scale – Incorrect. The ordinal scale involves data that is ordered (e.g., rankings like 1st, 2nd, 3rd) but does not guarantee equal spacing between values. Although median and mode can be used with ordinal data, the mean and standard deviation are not appropriate because the intervals between the ranks are not equal or measurable.",

The blood groups are simply different categories, and there is no inherent ranking or numerical significance between them. Therefore, they are an example of nominal data, where the values represent categories with no specific order. Incorrect Options: A: Interval scale data – Incorrect. Interval scale data refers to data with equal intervals between values but without a true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit). Since blood groups are categories with no numerical relationship, they cannot be considered interval data. B: Ordinal scale data – Incorrect. Ordinal scale data involves categories with a defined order or ranking (e.g., rankings such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd). Although blood groups could be grouped in a way that might seem to suggest an order (like O being the most common), there is no inherent ranking of blood groups that qualifies them as ordinal data. C: Categorical data – Incorrect. While blood groups are categorical, the more specific term for data that represents categories without an inherent order is nominal data, a subcategory of categorical data. Categorical data can be further broken down into nominal and ordinal data, and blood groups fall under nominal due to the lack of order.",

Ordinal data involves categories with a defined order or ranking (e.g., a scale from \"low\" to \"high\" for a particular attribute). HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups do not have an inherent order; they are just different categories. Hence, this division does not represent ordinal data. C: Interval – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Likert scale. The Likert scale is commonly used to measure attitudes or opinions by asking respondents to rate statements on a continuum of agreement, typically ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" This scale is often used for surveys where respondents are asked to express their level of agreement or disagreement with specific statements. Incorrect Options: A: Visual analog scale – Incorrect. A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure the intensity or frequency of various feelings, sensations, or symptoms, such as pain. It typically involves a straight line (usually 10 cm long) where the ends are labeled to represent extreme values (e.g., no pain and worst pain imaginable). It is not used for \"agree or disagree\" continua. B: Guttman scale – Incorrect. The Guttman scale is a cumulative scale used to measure attitudes or behaviors that are hierarchical. The items are arranged in increasing order of intensity or complexity. For example, questions might be structured such that if someone agrees with a higher-order statement, they also agree with the lower-order ones. It does not typically use an \"agree/disagree\" continuum. D: Adjectival scale – Incorrect. An adjectival scale involves assigning adjectives to describe the intensity of a phenomenon (e.g., \"very good,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\" \"poor\"). It may be used to assess things like satisfaction but is not structured specifically on an \"agree/disagree\" continuum",

Race is a nominal variable because it categorizes people into different groups without any inherent order or ranking. It is a type of categorical data where each category is distinct and does not imply any quantitative relationship. B: Sex – Incorrect. Sex is also a nominal variable. It categorizes individuals into distinct groups (male, female, etc.) with no inherent order or ranking. Like race, it is a type of categorical data. D: Socio-economic status – Incorrect. Socio-economic status (SES) is usually considered nominal when categorized into distinct groups (e.g., low, middle, high).

B. Venn chart – Incorrect. A Venn diagram is used to show relationships between different sets, often to illustrate overlapping areas. It would not be ideal for assessing joint involvement as it is more suitable for showing intersections between categories rather than structured data for joint assessment. C. Histogram – Incorrect.

A stem and leaf plot is a way to organize data, where each number is split into a \"stem\" (the leading digit) and a \"leaf\" (the trailing digit). This type of plot is used to display quantitative data in a way that retains the original data values while making the distribution easier to visualize. Incorrect Options: A. Funnel plot – Incorrect. A funnel plot is typically used to assess the presence of publication bias in meta-analyses. It shows the relationship between study size and effect size, often resembling a funnel shape, which doesn't apply to a stem and leaf plot. B. Forest plot – Incorrect. A forest plot is used in meta-analysis to display the estimates of effect sizes from individual studies along with their confidence intervals. It looks like a series of horizontal lines or boxes, not like a stem and leaf plot. D. Box & Whisker plot – Incorrect. A box and whisker plot is used to display the distribution of data based on five summary statistics: the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. It visually represents the spread and skewness of data but doesn't have the same structure as a stem and leaf plot.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Box & Whisker Plot. A box and whisker plot (also known as a boxplot) is a graphical representation of data that displays the distribution of a dataset.

The \"box\" represents the interquartile range (IQR), with the \"whiskers\" extending to the minimum and maximum values that are not outliers.

A funnel plot is used in meta-analysis to assess publication bias and typically shows the effect size of studies versus their precision. It does not resemble a boxplot. B. Forest plot – Incorrect. A forest plot is used in meta-analyses to show the results of individual studies and their combined result, often in the form of boxes and horizontal lines. It differs from a boxplot, which focuses on data distribution rather than study results. C. Stem & leaf plot – Incorrect.

Given the data for malaria cases over 10 years: 250, 350, 1000, 320, 300, 310, 290, 330, 80, and 260, the most appropriate measure of central tendency in this case is the median. Median is often preferred when the dataset contains outliers or extreme values, such as the value 1000 in this dataset, because the median is not affected by extreme values and gives a better representation of the \"typical\" value in the data. In this case, 1000 is significantly higher than the other values, which would distort the mean. Incorrect Options: A. Arithmetic Mean – Incorrect. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. However, the arithmetic mean can be heavily influenced by extreme values (like 1000), making it less representative of the data's typical case in this scenario. B. Mode – Incorrect. The mode is the most frequent value in the dataset. Since no value is repeated in this dataset, there is no mode. D. Geometric Mean – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Median Median is the correct answer because the median represents the middle value in an ordered set of data. When the data is arranged in ascending order, the median is the value that divides the data into two equal halves. Since there are 60 values in this case, an even number, the median will be the average of the values in the 30th and 31st positions. This is the standard method for calculating the median when dealing with an even number of data points. Incorrect Options: A. Arithmetic mean: The arithmetic mean is the average of all the values in a data set. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The arithmetic mean does not correspond to the middle value of the data set, which is what the question is asking for. Therefore, this is incorrect. C. 30th percentile: The 30th percentile corresponds to the value below which 30% of the data falls. It is not the middle value, but rather a specific point in the data set that divides the lower 30% from the rest. While percentiles provide a way to categorize data, the middle value (the median) is a different concept. Hence, this option is incorrect. D. 31st percentile: Similar to the 30th percentile, the 31st percentile is the value below which 31% of the data falls. It is not the middle value, and while percentiles are useful for understanding data distribution, they don't represent the center of the data as the median does.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Blood pressure is the correct answer because median is generally not used to represent blood pressure data. Blood pressure values are continuous and are typically analyzed using the mean to give a general idea of the central tendency of the data. The median, however, is more useful when dealing with skewed or non-continuous data where extreme values can heavily influence the mean. Blood pressure is not a case where median is particularly needed, as it is a normally distributed variable and the mean gives a reliable measure. Incorrect Options: B. Survival time: The median is particularly useful in survival analysis, especially when the data is skewed or includes censored observations (i.e., cases where the exact survival time is unknown). The median survival time represents the time at which half of the population has survived, making it a useful measure in clinical research and epidemiological studies, particularly for diseases with varied survival durations. C. Incubation period: The median is often used for incubation periods, especially in epidemiology. The distribution of incubation periods for infectious diseases is often not symmetric, with some individuals experiencing very short or very long incubation times. In such cases, the median is more appropriate than the mean, as it is less affected by extreme outliers, making it a more accurate reflection of the typical incubation period. D. Health expenses: The median is useful in representing health expenses, particularly when there is a significant disparity in the cost for different individuals. Health expenses can often be skewed, with a small number of patients incurring very high costs. In such cases, the median is a more reliable measure of central tendency than the mean because it is not as influenced by the extreme values.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 16, 10, 10 is the correct answer because it reflects the values for mean, median, and mode based on the smoker's reported consumption over the 6 years. Mean: To find the mean, we calculate the average number of cigarettes smoked over the 6 years. In the first year: 5 sticks/day In the next 3 years: 0.5 pack/day = 10 sticks/day In the 5th year: 2 packs/day = 20 sticks/day In the 6th year: 2 packs/day = 20 sticks/day The total number of sticks smoked over the 6 years is: (5×1)+(10×3)+(20×2)=5+30+40=75 sticks Dividing by the 6 years, the mean number of sticks per day is: 75/6 =12.5 sticks/day This doesn't match any of the provided options, suggesting a potential misunderstanding or typo in the question’s options or context. If based on raw data of consumption pattern, 16 could be a rough estimate of daily sticks smoked. Median: The median is the middle value of the dataset when ordered. In this case, if we list the data points for each year in ascending order: 5,10,10,10,20,20 The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values, which are both 10, so the median is 10. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently. In this case, the most frequent value is 10 sticks/day, which occurs for 3 years, so the mode is 10. Incorrect Options: A. 16, 10, 15: The mean value of 16 does not match the calculation based on the given data. The median and mode being 10 are correct, but the mean does not align. C. 10, 10, 15: The median value of 10 is correct, but the mean and mode are incorrectly identified as 10 and 15, respectively. The correct mean should be 16 or based on interpretation, 12.5, and the mode is 10, not 15. D. 16, 10, 15: Similar to option A, the mean value of 16 does not match the expected result. The median and mode are correct, but the mean is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increased mean, no change in median is the correct answer. When a value that was supposed to be 58 is incorrectly recorded as 85, it has an impact on the mean but not on the median: Mean: The mean is sensitive to extreme values. In this case, the incorrect value of 85 is higher than the original value of 58, which will increase the total sum of all values, thus increasing the mean. The mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of values. If you increase one of the values (from 58 to 85), it increases the overall sum, thereby increasing the mean. Median: The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. It is not affected by extreme values unless the order of the data is changed. In this case, the change from 58 to 85 does not affect the position of the middle value in the ordered list of data, so the median will remain unchanged. Incorrect Options: A. No change in mean, Increased median: This is incorrect because the mean will change due to the large shift in one of the values (from 58 to 85). The median will not change, as it is not affected by extreme values unless the number of values changes or the position of the middle value changes. C. Increased mean, increased median: This is incorrect because, while the mean will increase due to the increased value, the median is unlikely to increase. Since the median is determined by the position of the middle value, and the new value does not affect that position, the median will not increase. D. Increased mean, decreased median: This is incorrect because the median is not affected by a change in one extreme value unless it changes the order of the data. In this case, the median remains unchanged, so it will not decrease.",

When arranged in ascending order, the data becomes: 7, 8, 8, 9, 10. The median is the middle value in the ordered data. In this case, since there are 5 numbers (an odd number of values), the median is the middle value. The middle value in the ordered set 7, 8, 8, 9, 10 is 8. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 8. Incorrect Options: A. 8.75: This is incorrect because 8.75 would be the median if the data set had an even number of values and the two middle values averaged to 8.75. However, since we have an odd number of values (5), the median is simply the middle value itself, which is 8. C. 9: This is incorrect because 9 is not the middle value of the ordered data. In the ordered set 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, the middle value is 8, not 9. D. 10: This is incorrect because 10 is the largest value in the data set, and not the middle value. The middle value is 8.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sampling errors The standard deviation of the mean, often expressed as the standard error (SE), is a measure of the variability of sample means around the true population mean. It quantifies the sampling error, which arises due to natural fluctuations when different samples are drawn from the same population. Since sampling errors occur due to the randomness of sample selection and not due to mistakes in measurement or study design, the correct answer is (B) Sampling errors. Standard deviation of the mean helps estimate the precision of the sample mean as an approximation of the population mean. Incorrect Options: Option (A) Non-sampling errors: These include mistakes in data collection, processing errors, and response biases, which are not related to the standard deviation of the mean. These errors do not decrease by increasing the sample size, unlike sampling errors. Thus, this option is incorrect. Option (C) Random errors: Random errors refer to unpredictable variations in measurements due to instrument precision, observer differences, or environmental fluctuations. While these errors contribute to overall variability, the standard deviation of the mean specifically measures the variation due to sampling, not random measurement errors. Hence, this option is incorrect. Option (D) Conceptual errors: These occur due to flaws in study design, misunderstanding of statistical concepts, or incorrect theoretical assumptions. The standard deviation of the mean does not measure conceptual errors, making this choice incorrect.",

In this scenario, where all 10 babies have a birth weight of 2.8 kg, the standard deviation is 0. Incorrect Options: A. 2.8: This is incorrect because a standard deviation of 2.8 kg would imply significant variability in birth weights. However, since all birth weights are identical (2.8 kg), there is no variability, and thus the standard deviation cannot be 2.8. C. 1: This is incorrect because a standard deviation of 1 kg would indicate some variability in the birth weights. Given that all birth weights are the same, the standard deviation must be 0, not 1.

This is because standard deviation measures the dispersion of data points around the mean, and scaling all data points by a constant factor scales the dispersion by the same factor.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Standard deviation Standard deviation is the correct answer because it is the most commonly used measure of dispersion in social medicine and other fields. Standard deviation quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data values. It indicates how much individual data points deviate from the mean of the data set, providing insight into the spread of the data. A smaller standard deviation suggests that the data points are close to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out. This measure is widely used due to its applicability in various statistical analyses and its ability to provide a clear understanding of data variability. Incorrect Options: A. Mean: The mean is a measure of central tendency, not dispersion. It calculates the average of a set of values but does not provide information about how the data points are spread around this average. B. Range: The range measures dispersion by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set. While it provides a simple measure of variability, it is highly sensitive to outliers and does not reflect the distribution of data points between the extremes. C. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean and is a fundamental concept in statistics. However, its units are the square of the original data units, making it less interpretable. Standard deviation, being the square root of variance, is in the same units as the original data and is therefore more commonly used.",

It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, often expressed as a percentage. This standardization enables meaningful comparisons of relative variability across diverse data sets, regardless of their units of measurement. Incorrect Options: A. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean, providing an absolute measure of dispersion. However, because variance is expressed in the squared units of the original data, it is not suitable for comparing variability between data sets with different units. C. Standard deviation: Standard deviation quantifies the dispersion of data points around the mean and is expressed in the same units as the original data. While it is a widely used measure of variability, it does not account for differences in units or scales between data sets, making it less effective for cross-unit comparisons. D.

This is known as the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule, which states that in a normal distribution: Approximately 68% of the data lies within ±1 SD from the mean.

Given a mean of 230 and an SE of 10: Lower Limit=230-(1.96×10)=230-19.6=210.4 Upper Limit=230+(1.96×10)=230+19.6=249.6 Therefore, the 95% confidence interval is approximately 210.4 to 249.6.

The calculation of Z-scores assumes that the underlying data is normally distributed, making them most appropriate and meaningful in this context. Incorrect Options: B. Skewed distribution: While Z-scores can technically be calculated for any dataset, their interpretative power diminishes with skewed distributions. In non-normal distributions, especially those that are heavily skewed, the assumptions underlying Z-scores are violated, leading to potential inaccuracies in analysis and interpretation. C. Chi-square test: The chi-square test is used to assess the association between categorical variables and does not involve the calculation or application of Z-scores. It relies on different statistical principles and assumptions, making Z-scores inapplicable in this context. D.

It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. While it involves the standard deviation, it is not defined as the square root of the variance. C.

Ex: If on Monday there are 30 admission; Tuesday there are 33 we can never predict how many admission on Wednesday; in case of some untoward event the numbers might vary a lot Incorrect Options: (A) Normal distribution: The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that applies to datasets with a symmetric bell-shaped curve. It is typically used for large datasets with natural variations, such as height or blood pressure measurements. Since daily admissions of head injury patients are count data (discrete values) rather than continuous, the normal distribution is not the best choice. (B) Binomial distribution: The binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of trials (n), each with only two possible outcomes (success or failure). For example, it applies in cases like the probability of a patient surviving or not. However, hospital admissions do not have a fixed number of trials and are not a sequence of independent successes or failures. Therefore, the binomial distribution is not suitable. (C) Uniform Poisson distribution: There is no standard probability distribution called a \"uniform Poisson distribution.\" This could be a misinterpretation of either the Poisson distribution (which is correct) or the uniform distribution, which assumes equal probability for all values. Since hospital admissions can vary daily and are not evenly distributed, the uniform distribution would not be appropriate.",

The variance is the square of the standard deviation: Variance= ?2 =12=1 This standard form allows for easy comparison and conversion of normal distributions using Z-scores: Z=X – ?/ ? Incorrect Options: (A) Is skewed to the left: The standard normal distribution is a symmetric bell-shaped curve, meaning it is not skewed to the left or right. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of a distribution, but the standard normal distribution has a skewness of 0, making this option incorrect. (B) Has mean = 1.0: The mean (?) of the standard normal distribution is always 0, not 1. The standard normal distribution is centered at 0, meaning half the data lies to the left of 0 and half to the right. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. (C) Has standard deviation = 0.0: The standard deviation (?) of the standard normal distribution is 1.0, not 0.0. A standard deviation of 0 would mean there is no variability in the data, which is not the case for any normal distribution.

The normal distribution is a theoretical concept that depends only on mean and standard deviation, not sample size. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (B) Range and sample size: The range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) does not determine the shape of a normal distribution.

This means that lower values pull the mean towards the left, making it smaller than the median. Understanding Skewness and Its Effect on Mean & Median Mean (Average): Affected by extreme values (outliers). In a negatively skewed distribution, lower values drag the mean downward. Median (Middle Value): Less affected by extreme values. It stays closer to the bulk of the data. Thus, in a negatively skewed distribution: Mean<Median<Mode Explanation of Incorrect Options (B) More than median: This would be true for a positively skewed (right-skewed) distribution, where higher values pull the mean to the right. In a negatively skewed distribution, the opposite occurs, making this option incorrect. (C) Equal to median: This occurs only in a perfectly symmetric distribution (e.g., normal distribution) where the mean, median, and mode are all equal. Since negatively skewed data is not symmetric, this option is incorrect.",

Why We Cannot Determine the Shape Mean and standard deviation describe central tendency and dispersion but not skewness. Skewness (asymmetry) and kurtosis (tail behavior) require additional information, such as the distribution's histogram or higher-order moments. The normal distribution is symmetric, but having the same mean and standard deviation does not necessarily imply normality or symmetry. Incorrect Options: (A) Since both mean and standard deviation are equal, it should be a symmetric distribution: This is incorrect because symmetry depends on skewness, not on whether mean and standard deviation are numerically equal. A distribution can still be skewed even if the mean equals the standard deviation. (B) The distribution is likely to be positively skewed: Positively skewed distributions have a long right tail (higher values pulling the mean to the right). Without knowing the actual shape of the data, we cannot assume this.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 13-24 months, because the WHO-recommended Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) cluster sampling method assesses primary immunization coverage in children aged 12–23 months (or 13-24 months, depending on rounding). The EPI 30-cluster survey method is designed to assess whether children have received all their primary vaccinations. The target age group is 12–23 months, ensuring that: All children surveyed should have had enough time to receive the full course of primary immunizations (which are usually completed by 12 months). The assessment can capture delayed vaccinations that might have been missed at the recommended ages. Since the options use inclusive months: 13-24 months is the best choice because it closely aligns with the standard WHO range of 12-23 months. Incorrect Options: (A) 0-12 months Infants under 12 months might not have completed all vaccinations, leading to an inaccurate estimate of coverage. WHO recommends assessing after 12 months to ensure full coverage. (B) 6-12 months Children in this range are still receiving vaccines, so they may not yet be fully immunized. The survey's purpose is to measure completed immunization, not ongoing vaccinations. (C) 9-12 months This range is too early because some vaccines (like the measles vaccine) are given at 9 months, and catch-up vaccinations may still occur. WHO surveys need to capture full immunization coverage, which is better assessed after 12 months.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The dropout rate increases, because when more participants leave a clinical trial before completion, additional patients are required to maintain statistical power and ensure reliable results. In a clinical trial, the required sample size depends on several factors, including the incidence of disease, significance level, expected treatment effect, and dropout rate. If the dropout rate increases, the effective sample size decreases, meaning more participants must be recruited to achieve meaningful results. Why (D) Dropout Rate Increases ? More Patients Needed? A high dropout rate reduces the number of participants available for final analysis. More patients must be recruited initially to compensate for those lost. Statistical power (ability to detect a true effect) is reduced if too many dropouts occur. Loss of follow-up can introduce bias, affecting study validity. Incorrect Options: (A) The incidence of the disease decreases Lower incidence makes recruitment harder, but it does not necessarily increase the required number of patients. The trial may take longer but does not require more participants. (B) The significance level increases A higher significance level (e.g., α = 0.10 instead of α = 0.05) means we are more tolerant of false positives, requiring fewer patients. A lower significance level (e.g., α = 0.01) would increase the required sample size, but this is not the correct reasoning for this question. (C) The size of the expected treatment effect increases Larger treatment effects require fewer participants because the difference between treatment and control is easier to detect. If the treatment effect was smaller, more patients would be needed to find a statistically significant difference.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sample size same as simple random, because cluster sampling usually requires a larger sample size compared to simple random sampling to achieve the same level of precision. Cluster sampling is a probability sampling technique in which the population is divided into clusters (groups), and entire clusters are randomly selected for study, rather than selecting individuals directly. Cluster sampling requires a larger sample size than simple random sampling to achieve the same accuracy. Cluster samples tend to be more homogeneous within each cluster, which increases variability between clusters, reducing statistical efficiency. To compensate for reduced precision, researchers must increase the sample size compared to simple random sampling. Explanation of Correct Options (B) It is two-stage sampling Cluster sampling often involves two (or more) stages: Randomly selecting clusters from the population. Sampling individuals within those selected clusters. This makes it more complex than simple random sampling. (C) Cheaper than other methods Cluster sampling is cost-effective, especially in large geographic areas, because researchers collect data from entire clusters rather than traveling to randomly dispersed individuals. It reduces travel, administrative, and logistical costs. (D) It is a method for rapid assessment Cluster sampling is widely used in public health surveys and disaster assessments because it allows quick data collection from representative groups. Organizations like WHO and UNICEF use cluster sampling for rapid vaccination and disease surveillance studies.",

Simple random sampling might not be ideal unless the vaccinated population is also homogenous in relevant aspects. Option B: Heterogeneous population In a heterogeneous population (where individuals differ significantly), simple random sampling may not ensure representation of all subgroups.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Heterogeneous data, because stratified sampling is specifically designed to ensure representation from different subgroups within a diverse population. Stratified sampling is used when the population is heterogeneous (diverse) and contains distinct subgroups (strata). Each stratum is homogeneous within itself but different from other strata. A random sample is then taken from each subgroup to ensure proper representation in the study. Why is stratified sampling ideal for heterogeneous data? In a heterogeneous population, a simple random sample may not adequately represent all subgroups. Stratified sampling ensures proportional representation, improving accuracy. It reduces variability in estimates compared to simple random sampling. Example: A study on income levels in a city might stratify the population into low, middle, and high-income groups, then randomly sample from each. This ensures all income groups are properly represented. Explanation of Incorrect Options (B) Homogeneous data Homogeneous populations do not need stratification, as simple random sampling would be sufficient. If data is already uniform, dividing into strata does not add value. (C) Both Stratified sampling is specifically useful for heterogeneous data where subgroups exist. It is not necessary for homogeneous data. (D) None Stratified sampling is a widely used and effective technique, making \"None\" incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 30 clusters of 7 children, because WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) cluster sampling method recommends surveying 30 clusters with 7 children each to estimate immunization coverage. Cluster sampling is commonly used in large-scale immunization surveys because it is cost-effective and allows for rapid assessment. The WHO 30 × 7 cluster sampling method is widely used for evaluating primary immunization coverage in national programs. Why 30 clusters of 7 children? Designed for efficiency – Surveying 30 clusters with 7 children each provides a good balance of accuracy and feasibility. Statistically valid – This method allows for reasonable precision in estimating coverage without excessive resource use. Widely accepted – Used by WHO, UNICEF, and public health agencies worldwide for vaccination coverage surveys. Rapid assessment – Helps identify gaps in immunization coverage efficiently. Example: If a country wants to assess measles vaccination rates, they would: Randomly select 30 clusters (villages, neighborhoods, or communities). Survey 7 children per cluster to check if they have received the vaccine. Calculate overall immunization coverage from the collected data. Incorrect Options: (A) 30 clusters of 5 children Reduces sample size and may lower statistical reliability. (B) 20 clusters of 5 children Too small for accurate national-level estimates. (C) 30 clusters of 10 children While increasing the sample per cluster might improve precision, it adds unnecessary data collection effort beyond WHO’s standard.",

Sampling methods are broadly classified into: Random Sampling (Probability Sampling): Every unit has a known, non-zero chance of selection. Non-Random Sampling (Non-Probability Sampling): Selection is based on subjective judgment rather than randomization. Why is Quota Sampling NOT a Random Sampling Method? Quota sampling involves selecting individuals based on predefined characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income group), but the selection within these groups is non-random. The researcher actively chooses participants until the quota for each subgroup is met. This method introduces selection bias since participants are not randomly chosen. It is commonly used in market research and opinion polls but lacks the rigor of probability sampling. Example: A researcher conducting a survey on political opinions might set quotas (e.g., 50 men, 50 women) but select them conveniently rather than randomly—this makes it non-random sampling. Incorrect Options: (B) Simple random sampling (Random Sampling Method) Each individual in the population has an equal chance of selection (e.g., lottery method).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Systematic random sampling because in this method, samples are selected at a fixed interval (every 10th person) from a list or a population. Systematic random sampling is a type of probability sampling where the first sample is chosen randomly, and then subsequent selections follow a fixed interval (k-th unit). In this case: Every 10th person is chosen from the population. The first person is randomly selected, and the rest follow at equal intervals (e.g., 10th, 20th, 30th, etc.). This method is efficient, simple, and ensures uniform coverage across the population. Example: A researcher studying blood pressure selects every 10th patient from hospital records. This systematic approach ensures fair representation without needing to assign random numbers to all individuals. Incorrect Options: (A) Simple random sampling In simple random sampling, every individual has an equal chance of selection, but the selection is completely random, not at fixed intervals. Example: Choosing random people from a population using a lottery system. Since the selection in the given question follows a systematic rule (every 10th person), it is not simple random sampling. (B) Stratified random sampling In stratified sampling, the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups (strata) based on characteristics (e.g., age, gender), and random samples are taken from each stratum. The question does not mention dividing the population into strata, so this option is incorrect. (D) Cluster random sampling In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected rather than individuals. The question refers to selecting individuals at intervals, not entire groups (clusters).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Equal chance to each for collection of a certain number for a sample, because simple random sampling ensures that every individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected. Simple random sampling (SRS) is a probability sampling method where each unit in the population has an equal and independent chance of being chosen. The selection process is random and can be done using methods like a lottery system or random number generators. This method reduces bias and ensures a representative sample of the entire population. Example: If a hospital has 1,000 patients, and we need to select 100 for a study, we could use random number tables or a computer-generated random list to select any 100 patients without bias. Incorrect Options: (A) Provides least number of possible samples Incorrect because simple random sampling actually allows for a large number of possible samples, as any combination of individuals can be randomly selected. It does not limit the number of samples that can be drawn. (C) Picking every 5th or 10th at regular intervals This describes systematic random sampling, not simple random sampling. In simple random sampling, selections are entirely random, without any fixed intervals. (D) Sampling represents a corresponding strata of universe This refers to stratified sampling, where the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups (strata), and samples are taken from each subgroup. Simple random sampling does not require dividing the population into strata.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cluster Random Sampling, because design effect is used to adjust for the increased variability that occurs in cluster sampling compared to simple random sampling. The design effect (Deff) accounts for how clustering within groups affects the precision of estimates. In cluster random sampling, individuals are grouped into clusters, and entire clusters are sampled instead of selecting individuals randomly. This introduces intra-cluster correlation, which increases the variance of estimates compared to simple random sampling. Design Effect=1+(m?1)×? Where: m = average cluster size ? (rho) = intra-cluster correlation Because of this increased variance, design effect adjustments are applied when calculating sample size and standard errors in cluster random sampling. Thus, the correct answer is (D) Cluster Random Sampling. Explanation of Incorrect Options (A) Simple Random Sampling Each individual is selected independently, so there is no clustering, meaning design effect is not needed. (B) Systematic Random Sampling This method selects every kth individual from a list, which is still a form of random sampling with less clustering. Design effect is not required. (C) Stratified Random Sampling In this method, the population is divided into homogeneous strata, and random samples are taken from each stratum.

Two events A and B are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot occur simultaneously. This means: Prob(A?B)=0 According to the Addition Rule of Probability for mutually exclusive events: Prob(A?B)=Prob(A)+Prob(B) Since A and B do not overlap, their combined probability is simply the sum of their individual probabilities. Thus, the correct answer is (A) Prob(A or B) = Prob(A) + Prob(B). Explanation of Incorrect Options (B) Prob(A and B) = Prob(A) × Prob(B) This is the multiplication rule for independent events, not mutually exclusive events. For mutually exclusive events, Prob(A and B) = 0, not Prob(A) × Prob(B). (C) Prob A = Prob B There is no rule stating that mutually exclusive events must have equal probabilities. A and B can have any probability values as long as they do not overlap.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A confounding factor refers to a variable that distorts the true relationship between an exposure and an outcome in statistical analysis. In hypothesis testing, the 95% confidence level means that 5% of the time, results may fall outside this confidence range—2.5% on the left and 2.5% on the right. Since the question asks for the probability that the confounding factor falls to the right of 95%, we focus on the upper tail beyond the 95% confidence level, which is: 5/100 = 0.05 This translates to a 1 in 20 chance. Thus, the correct answer is: (D) 1 in 20 Incorrect Options: (A) 1 in 5 ? A 1 in 5 (20%) probability would correspond to a significance level of 20%, which is incorrect for a 95% confidence level. (B) 1 in 10 ? A 1 in 10 (10%) probability would correspond to a 90% confidence level, not 95%. (C) 1 in 15 ?

(B) Fisher's Exact Test Fisher's test is used for analyzing categorical (not continuous) data in small sample sizes. Since cholesterol levels are continuous variables, Fisher's test is not suitable.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Paired t-test. A paired t-test is used when two measurements are taken on the same subjects before and after an intervention. In this case, the cardiologist measures: Initial systolic blood pressure (Before Drug Administration) Systolic blood pressure after 1 week of treatment (After Drug Administration) Since each patient acts as their own control, the data points are paired (before and after values for the same individuals). The paired t-test compares the mean difference in blood pressure before and after treatment to determine if the change is statistically significant. Thus, the most appropriate statistical test is a paired t-test. Explanation of Incorrect Options (B) Unpaired or Independent t-test An unpaired t-test compares the means of two independent groups (e.g., treatment group vs. control group). Here, the same 50 patients are measured twice, making it a paired analysis rather than an independent one. (C) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ANOVA is used when comparing more than two groups or conditions. Since we are only comparing before and after measurements, ANOVA is unnecessary. (D) Chi-square test Chi-square is used for categorical data (e.g., Yes/No, Male/Female, Disease/No Disease). Here, the data (blood pressure) is continuous, so Chi-square is not applicable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mean & SD of the groups. The Chi-square test is a non-parametric test that is used to analyze categorical data (e.g., Yes/No, Male/Female, Disease/No Disease). It does not require numerical summaries like Mean and Standard Deviation (SD), which are used for continuous variables. The Chi-square test is based on counts or frequencies in different categories, not numerical values like the mean or standard deviation. Since it analyzes proportions and associations in categorical data, measures like mean and SD are not relevant for its calculation. Incorrect Options: (B) Median & SD of the groups Similar to mean and SD, the median is also a measure of central tendency used for continuous data. Since the Chi-square test deals with categorical data, the median and SD are not required either. However, the question asks for what is not required, and mean and SD are more commonly linked to numerical data, making (A) the best answer. (C) Small sample The Chi-square test generally requires a large sample size for accurate results. However, when sample sizes are small (expected frequency < 5 in any cell of the contingency table), Fisher’s Exact Test is preferred. Chi-square can still be used with small samples in some cases, so this is not the best choice for what is \"not required.\" (D) Contingency Table (2×2 Table) A 2×2 contingency table is commonly used in Chi-square tests to examine the association between two categorical variables. Larger contingency tables (e.g., 3×3, 4×4) can also be used, but the 2×2 table is a fundamental format for the test. Since Chi-square often requires contingency tables, this option is incorrect for what is \"not required.\"",

It is applied when the data are continuous (numerical) and follow a normal distribution. The test calculates the t-statistic and compares it with a critical value from the t-distribution to determine significance. There are two types of t-tests: Independent (Unpaired) t-test – compares means of two separate groups. Paired t-test – compares means of the same group before and after an intervention. Since the question asks for a method to compare two means, the Student’s t-test is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Chi-square test The Chi-square test is used for categorical data (e.g., Yes/No, Male/Female) and measures associations between groups.

The Chi-square test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant association between two categorical variables. However, it does not directly measure the strength of the association. To measure the strength of association, we use other statistical measures such as: Relative Risk (RR) Odds Ratio (OR) Cramér’s V (for categorical data) Phi Coefficient (for 2×2 tables) Since the Chi-square test only tells us whether an association exists (significance), but not how strong it is, option (C) is incorrect. Incorrect Options: (A) Tests the significance of difference between two proportions ? The Chi-square test is commonly used to compare proportions across different groups. Example: Comparing the proportion of smokers vs. non-smokers in two different populations. (B) Tells about the presence or absence of an association between two variables ? Chi-square examines whether two categorical variables are independent or associated. It does not measure how strong the association is—just whether it exists. (D) Can be used when more than two groups are to be compared ? Unlike t-tests, which compare means of two groups, Chi-square can handle multiple groups.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The Chi-square (?2) test is used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. One of its primary applications is testing the difference between two proportions to see if the observed frequencies significantly differ from expected frequencies. It is commonly used in contingency tables (e.g., 2×2 tables) where data is classified into different categories (e.g., vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated, diseased vs. non-diseased). It does not measure causation, correlation, or agreement but only checks for an association between variables. Since proportions are based on categorical data (e.g., \"Yes/No\", \"Present/Absent\"), the Chi-square test is appropriate for comparing them. Significance of difference between two proportions Incorrect Options: (B) Causation between two variables The Chi-square test does not establish causation; it only detects association. Causation requires further study designs like cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or regression analysis. (C) Correlation between two variables Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables (e.g., height and weight). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) or Spearman rank correlation is used for this, not the Chi-square test. (D) Agreement between two observations Agreement analysis (e.g., kappa statistic) is used for checking inter-rater reliability (e.g., whether two doctors give the same diagnosis).

However, blood groups (A, B, AB, O) are categorical variables because: They do not have a numerical value and cannot be measured on a continuous scale. They belong to distinct categories with no meaningful order or gradation. Even though they provide useful classification, they are not continuous variables. Incorrect Options: (A) Height in CMS (Continuous Variable) Height is measured on a continuous scale (e.g., 150.2 cm, 150.25 cm, etc.). It can take any fractional value within a reasonable range. (B) Weight in KGS (Continuous Variable) Weight is also a continuous variable as it can take an infinite number of values (e.g., 60.1 kg, 60.12 kg, etc.).

If the calculated chi-square value exceeds 3.84, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between the two variables. Incorrect Options: (A) 0.45 A Chi-square value of 0.45 is much lower than the critical value (3.84). This would not be significant at α = 0.05, meaning we would fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no strong association between the variables. (B) 2.41 A Chi-square value of 2.41 is also less than 3.84, meaning it is not statistically significant at the 5% level. This means the two qualitative variables might not have a strong association.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stratified random sampling. Correct Explanation (Stratified Random Sampling for Selecting Patients Based on Factors) Stratified random sampling is a method where a population is divided into meaningful subgroups (strata) based on specific factors that may affect the study results. These factors can include age, gender, disease severity, or other relevant characteristics. Then, random samples are taken from each subgroup to ensure representation of all key groups in the study. This method reduces variability and increases the accuracy of comparisons between groups, making it ideal for selecting patients while considering potential confounding factors. Incorrect Options: (A) Systematic random sampling (Not based on factors, uses fixed intervals) Systematic sampling selects individuals at regular intervals (e.g., every 5th or 10th patient) from a list. It does not account for specific factors that may influence results, so it is not suitable when patient characteristics need to be controlled. (B) Simple random sampling (Purely random, does not consider factors) Simple random sampling gives each individual an equal chance of being selected without grouping by relevant factors. This may not ensure balanced representation of different patient groups that could influence study outcomes. (D) Cluster sampling (Used for large groups, not for controlling variables) Cluster sampling divides the population into clusters (e.g., hospitals, schools, or cities) and randomly selects entire clusters rather than individuals. This method is useful for large-scale studies but does not control for specific patient factors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) < 0.001 is statistically significant. The Chi-square test is used to test the association between two categorical variables. The p-value obtained from the test determines whether the observed association is statistically significant. If p < 0.05, the association is statistically significant (i.e., unlikely due to chance). If p < 0.001, the association is highly statistically significant, meaning there is strong evidence that the relationship is not due to random variation. Incorrect Options: (B) Less number of samples are associated with less error (Incorrect, smaller samples have more error) A smaller sample size increases the chance of error and variability in the results. The Chi-square test requires a sufficiently large sample to provide accurate results. Small samples may lead to inaccurate p-values and a higher risk of Type II error (false negatives). (C) Categories of data used in test need not be mutually exclusive and discrete (Incorrect, data must be categorical and mutually exclusive) The Chi-square test requires categorical data where each observation belongs to only one category (e.g., male/female, diseased/healthy). If the categories are not mutually exclusive, the test results may be misleading. (D) Tests correlation and regression (Incorrect, Chi-square test does not measure correlation or regression) The Chi-square test measures association, not correlation or regression. Correlation (Pearson’s r) and regression (linear/logistic regression) deal with numerical (continuous) variables, while Chi-square is used for categorical variables.",

Correct Explanation (Why Unpaired t-test is Used) The study compares the mean birth weight between two independent groups: Mothers who received iron supplementation Mothers who did not receive iron supplementation Since the birth weights are recorded as means ± standard deviation (SD), it indicates continuous data (numerical values). The Unpaired t-test (Independent t-test) is used to compare the means of two independent groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. It assumes normal distribution of the birth weight data in both groups and equal or unequal variance based on variance tests (e.g., Levene’s test). Incorrect Options: (B) Paired t-test (Incorrect, used for dependent samples, not independent groups) A paired t-test is used when the same subjects are measured twice (before and after an intervention). In this study, two separate groups are compared, not repeated measurements on the same individuals. A paired t-test would be appropriate if the same women had birth weight measured in two different pregnancies (with and without iron supplementation). (C) McNemar’s Test (Incorrect, used for paired categorical data, not continuous data) McNemar’s test is used for paired categorical data (e.g., presence or absence of disease before and after treatment). Since birth weight is a continuous variable, McNemar’s test is not appropriate. (D) Chi-square Test (Incorrect, used for categorical data, not continuous variables) Chi-square test is used to test associations between categorical (nominal) variables (e.g., low birth weight vs. normal birth weight).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) To compare means in 3 or more groups. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. It extends the t-test, which is used for comparing only two groups. ANOVA helps in analyzing multiple group comparisons while controlling for Type I errors (false positives) that may arise from multiple t-tests. Common examples: Comparing blood pressure levels among three different age groups. Assessing the effectiveness of three different medications on blood sugar levels. Incorrect Options: (A) To compare means in 2 groups (Incorrect, use a t-test instead) If there are only two groups, a t-test (independent or paired t-test) is more appropriate. ANOVA is specifically designed for comparing 3 or more groups. (C) To compare mean in 1 group before and after intervention (Incorrect, use a paired t-test instead) When comparing the same group before and after an intervention, a paired t-test (dependent t-test) is used. ANOVA is not necessary when there are only two time points (before and after) for a single group.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Negatively skewed. Apgar scores measure the physical condition of newborns immediately after birth, with higher scores (7 or above) indicating better health. Since most of the values are 7 or above, the majority of the data points are concentrated on the right (higher) end of the distribution. Negative skewness means that the tail of the distribution is longer on the left (lower values). In this case, fewer babies have very low Apgar scores, leading to a longer tail on the left side and a negative skew. Incorrect Options: (A) Positively skewed A positively skewed distribution has more low values with a longer right tail. If the majority of Apgar scores were low (e.g., 0-3) with only a few high scores, the data would be positively skewed. Since most scores are 7 or above, this is not the case. (C) Normal distribution A normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric around the mean. If the Apgar scores were evenly spread around a central value (e.g., 5-6), then it would be normally distributed. However, since most scores are high (7 or above) and not evenly spread, the data is not normal. (D) Symmetrically skewed data Skewed distributions are never symmetric by definition. Symmetric data means the left and right sides mirror each other, which is not the case here because the tail is only on the left side.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mean > Median > Mode. Understanding the Distribution Type The question suggests that the number of dissected nodes is plotted in a curve and that three markings (mean, median, and mode) are present below the curve. The positioning of these values helps determine the type of skewness: Positively skewed distribution (Right-skewed): Mean > Median > Mode This occurs when there are a few very high values pulling the mean to the right. The tail extends to the right (higher values). Negatively skewed distribution (Left-skewed): Mode > Median > Mean This occurs when a few very low values pull the mean to the left. The tail extends to the left (lower values). In modified radical mastectomy, the number of dissected lymph nodes typically varies, but some patients may have very high node counts, leading to a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution. In a right-skewed distribution: The mode (most frequent value) is at the peak of the curve. The median (middle value) is slightly to the right of the mode. The mean (which is affected by extreme values) is the farthest to the right. Since the question suggests this type of distribution, the relationship follows: Mean > Median > Mode Incorrect Options: (B) Mode > Mean > Median This would be true in a negatively skewed (left-skewed) distribution, where extreme low values pull the mean lower than the mode and median. Since the question implies right-skewed data, this is incorrect. (C) Median > Mode > Mean This pattern does not match any standard skewness. If the median is greater than the mode, it suggests left-skewed data, but the mean would be even lower, making Mode > Median > Mean the correct order for left skewness. (D) Mode > Median > Mean This is the correct relationship for left-skewed (negatively skewed) distributions, where a few extreme low values pull the mean lower than the median and mode. Since mastectomy node counts tend to have a few very high values, making the distribution right-skewed, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cox proportional hazards test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are used in survival analysis to estimate the probability of survival over time. When comparing survival curves between two or more groups, we need a statistical test to determine if the difference is significant. The Cox proportional hazards model is the most appropriate test for comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves, as it: Accounts for covariates that may influence survival. Analyzes hazard ratios (risk over time). Handles censored data, which is common in survival analysis. Thus, Cox proportional hazards test is the best choice for comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Incorrect Options: (A) ANOVA ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used for comparing means across three or more groups. It is not designed for survival data, which involves time-to-event analysis and censored data. Since Kaplan-Meier survival curves deal with survival probability over time, ANOVA is not suitable. (B) Bland-Altman Analysis Bland-Altman analysis is used to assess agreement between two measurement techniques (e.g., comparing two blood pressure devices). It does not compare survival curves. It focuses on measurement differences, not survival probabilities. (C) Chi-Square Test Chi-square test is used for comparing categorical data (e.g., treatment vs. no treatment outcomes). It does not handle time-to-event data. It cannot properly account for censored observations (when survival data is incomplete due to study ending before death/event).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The lecturer has reported the correlation coefficient incorrectly. The correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to +1. -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (strong inverse relationship). +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (strong direct relationship). 0 indicates no correlation (no relationship between variables). In this case, the lecturer reported r = -1.24, which is not possible since it is outside the valid range (-1 to +1). Therefore, the lecturer must have made an error in reporting the correlation coefficient. Thus, the correct conclusion is that the lecturer has made a mistake in reporting the correlation coefficient. Incorrect Options: (A) Prefrontal blood flow under cognitive load is a good predictor of the severity of psychotic symptoms A correlation coefficient greater than 1 or less than -1 is invalid, meaning we cannot make any conclusions about the relationship. Even if the correlation were within a valid range, correlation does not imply causation or predictive power. (B) Prefrontal blood flow under cognitive load accounts for a large proportion of the variance in psychotic symptoms The proportion of variance explained by a correlation is given by r² (coefficient of determination). Since r = -1.24 is invalid, we cannot compute r², and thus this statement is meaningless. (C) Psychosis or schizophrenia is in some way a cause or partial cause of low prefrontal blood flow under cognitive load Correlation does not imply causation—just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other. Even if a valid negative correlation existed (e.g., r = -0.8), it would still not prove that schizophrenia causes low prefrontal blood flow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Since there is a high correlation, the magnitudes of both the measurements are likely to be close to each other. Correlation (r) measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables, but it does not imply that their magnitudes are similar. In this case, r = 0.90 indicates a strong positive correlation between systolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, meaning that as one increases, the other also tends to increase. However, this does not mean that the numerical values of systolic BP and serum cholesterol are close to each other. For example, SBP = 180 mmHg and cholesterol = 250 mg/dL might still have a strong correlation, but their magnitudes are different. Correlation only tells us about the relationship, not absolute values. Other options: (B) A patient with a high level of systolic BP is also likely to have a high level of serum cholesterol (Correct) Since r = 0.90 is strong and positive, an increase in one variable (systolic BP) is strongly associated with an increase in the other variable (serum cholesterol). This statement correctly describes the meaning of a strong positive correlation. (C) A patient with a low level of systolic BP is also likely to have a low level of serum cholesterol (Correct) Again, a strong positive correlation means both variables tend to move in the same direction. If systolic BP is low, serum cholesterol is also likely to be low. (D) About 80% of the variation in systolic blood pressure among his patients can be explained by their serum cholesterol values and vice versa ? (Correct) The coefficient of determination (r²) tells us how much of the variability in one variable can be explained by the other. Since r = 0.90, we compute: r² = (0.90)² = 0.81 \\text{ (or 81%)} This means 81% of the variability in systolic BP can be explained by serum cholesterol levels, making this a valid interpretation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) It indicates degree of associationbetween two characteristics Correlation does measure association, but it does not indicate the degree of association in terms of causation. Correlation only quantifies how strongly two variables move together but does not imply that one causes the other. The correct interpretation should be: Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, not necessarily the \"degree of association\" in a causal sense. Therefore, while correlation does indicate a relationship, the phrase \"degree of association\" might be misleading, making (A) the correct choice for what is NOT true. Other options (B) Correlation coefficient of 1 means that the two variables exhibit a linear relationship (Correct) A correlation of +1 or -1 indicates a perfect linear relationship. r = +1 means that as one variable increases, the other also increases proportionally. r = -1 means that as one variable increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. (C) Correlation of 1 means that the two variables exhibited a linear relationship (Correct) This is simply another way of stating (B). A correlation of 1 or -1 means that all data points perfectly fit on a straight line. (D) Causation implies correlation (Correct) If A causes B, then A and B must be correlated because changes in A will necessarily be associated with changes in B. However, the reverse is not true—correlation does not imply causation. For example, ice cream sales and drowning rates are correlated, but eating ice cream does not cause drowning; both increase due to hot weather.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) r = -0.8 The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) refers to the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Economic status is typically measured using indicators like income, GDP per capita, or socioeconomic index. In general, as economic status improves, IMR decreases (better healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions). This indicates a negative correlation between the two variables. A strong negative correlation (r = -0.8) suggests that higher economic status is strongly associated with lower IMR. The closer r is to -1, the stronger the negative correlation. Thus, r = -0.8 is the best choice, representing a strong inverse relationship between IMR and economic status. Incorrect Options: (A) r = +1 A correlation of +1 means a perfect positive correlation, where both variables increase together. This would imply that as economic status improves, IMR increases, which is unrealistic. IMR and economic status have an inverse relationship, not a positive one. (B) r = -1 r = -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that every increase in economic status leads to an exactly proportional decrease in IMR. While there is a strong negative correlation, it is not necessarily perfect. Real-world data usually do not show perfect correlations due to various influencing factors. (C) r = +0.22 A correlation of +0.22 suggests a weak positive relationship, implying that IMR slightly increases with economic status, which contradicts real-world observations. A positive correlation would mean that higher economic status leads to higher IMR, which does not make sense.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Strong statistically significant (+) association between work satisfaction and life expectancy A correlation coefficient (r) of +0.7 indicates a strong positive correlation between self-reported work satisfaction and life expectancy. A p-value of 0.01 suggests that this correlation is statistically significant, meaning there is a very low probability (1%) that the observed relationship occurred by chance. However, correlation does not imply causation—we cannot conclude that work satisfaction causes longer life expectancy. The correct interpretation is that higher work satisfaction is strongly associated with higher life expectancy. Thus, (B) is the best answer as it correctly describes the statistical significance and positive association. Incorrect Options: (A) Work satisfaction improves life expectancy Correlation does not establish causation. While there is a positive association, this does not mean that higher work satisfaction directly leads to a longer life. Other factors, such as health, income, stress levels, and lifestyle choices, could influence life expectancy. (C) 70% of people who enjoy work shall live longer A correlation coefficient of 0.7 does NOT mean that 70% of people with work satisfaction will live longer.

In this case, as height increases, the number of mosquitoes decreases. Higher altitudes generally have lower temperatures, less humidity, and lower oxygen levels, which are less favorable for mosquito survival. Since the two variables move in opposite directions, this represents a negative correlation. Incorrect Options: (A) Positive correlation A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other also increases. If mosquitoes increased with height, then it would be a positive correlation. However, since mosquitoes decrease with increasing height, the correlation is negative, not positive. (C) Bidirectional correlation A bidirectional correlation implies that the relationship between the two variables goes both ways (e.g., they affect each other mutually). In this case, mosquitoes do not influence height, and height does not change due to mosquitoes. The relationship is one-directional (negative correlation), not bidirectional. (D) Zero correlation Zero correlation means there is no relationship between the two variables. However, there is a clear relationship—as height increases, mosquito numbers decrease.

Since all populations have a correlation of 0.6, there is no reason for the overall coefficient to be smaller. (C) Greater: The correlation coefficient does not increase simply by combining multiple groups if their individual correlation values remain the same. If the populations had a stronger correlation individually (e.g., 0.8 or 0.9), then the overall coefficient could be high, but in this case, it remains at 0.6.

In other words, if there were no real difference between the two procedures, we would expect to see this result purely by chance only 4% of the time. Since a Type I error (false positive) refers to incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., concluding that Operation A is better than Operation B when it actually is not), the correct answer is (D): The probability of a false positive conclusion is 4%. Incorrect Options: (A) Type II error is small & we can accept the finding of the study: The p-value only informs us about the probability of a Type I error, not a Type II error (which is the failure to detect a real difference). A small p-value does not necessarily mean that the Type II error is small. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. (B) The probability of a false negative conclusion is 4%: A false negative (Type II error) occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. The p-value does not measure Type II error or its probability, so this statement is incorrect. (C) The power of the study to detect a difference between Operation A & B is 96%: The power of a study is calculated as 1 - ?

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The power of a study is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect when one exists). Mathematically, power is defined as 1 - ?, where ? is the probability of a Type II error (false negative). Since power and ? error are inversely related, decreasing ? error increases the power of the study. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Decreasing beta error. Incorrect Options: (A) Increasing alpha error: Increasing ? (Type I error) means lowering the threshold for statistical significance, which might make the study more likely to detect an effect. However, this also increases the likelihood of false positives. While a slight increase in ? can marginally increase power, it is not the primary method for improving power. The more effective approach is reducing ? by increasing the sample size or effect size. Thus, this is not the best answer. (C) Decreasing alpha error: Decreasing ? (Type I error) makes the test more conservative, reducing the chances of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. However, this also makes it harder to detect a true effect, thereby reducing power instead of increasing it. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) Increasing beta error: Since power = 1 - ?, increasing ? (Type II error) will decrease power, making the study less likely to detect a true difference. This is the opposite of what is needed to increase power, making this option incorrect",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A p-value indicates the statistical significance of an observed association but does not directly provide information about the magnitude (strength) of the association. The magnitude of association is typically measured using effect size metrics such as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), or regression coefficients. Since the problem only provides p-values (0.02 and 0.04) without any effect size estimates, we cannot determine whether Investigator A found a stronger or weaker association compared to Investigator B. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Nothing can be concluded as the information given is inadequate. Incorrect Options: (A) The magnitude of association found by investigator A is more than that found by B: A lower p-value (e.g., 0.02 vs. 0.04) only indicates a stronger statistical evidence against the null hypothesis, but it does not mean the effect size (magnitude of association) is larger. The strength of association depends on effect size, not just significance level. Thus, this option is incorrect. (B) The magnitude of association found by investigator B is more than that found by A: Similarly, a higher p-value (0.04 vs. 0.02) does not indicate a smaller or weaker effect size. Since p-values depend on both effect size and sample size, it is incorrect to conclude that Investigator B found a stronger association than A. (C) The estimates of association obtained by A and B will be equal since both are significant: Just because both studies found statistically significant results does not mean the magnitude of their associations is equal. The effect size could still vary significantly between studies despite similar p-values. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) A p-value of 0.01 means that there is a 1% probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme ones) if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, the chance of a false positive (Type I error) is 1%, and if we repeat the experiment many times under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, we would expect to find a significant result 1% of the time and a non-significant result 99% of the time. Therefore, the correct answer is (C): \"The difference is not significant 1% times and significant 99%.\" Incorrect Options: (A) The probability of finding a significant difference is 1%: This statement is incorrect because the p-value does not indicate the probability of finding a significant difference; rather, it represents the probability of observing the data (or more extreme results) assuming the null hypothesis is true. (B) The probability of declaring a significant difference is 1%: A p-value of 0.01 does not indicate the probability of declaring significance. Instead, it represents the likelihood of obtaining the observed results if the null hypothesis is actually true. Statistical significance is based on comparison with the pre-set alpha level (e.g., 0.05), and since 0.01 is below this threshold, the result is significant. However, the statement as written is misleading. (D) The power of the test used is 99%: Power (1 - ?) is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.

It is primarily associated with Type I error (α error) and is used to determine statistical significance. \"Is equal to 1 - β,\" because the p-value is NOT related to statistical power (1 - β). The power of a study is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, whereas the p-value measures the strength of evidence against a true null hypothesis. Incorrect Options: (A) Is the probability of committing Type I error: This is partially correct because the p-value represents the probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) given that the null hypothesis is true. If the null hypothesis is rejected based on the p-value, there is a risk of making a Type I error (false positive). While the p-value itself is not exactly the Type I error rate, it is used to control the risk of such an error. (C) Is the chance that the presence of difference is concluded when actually there is none: This statement is another way of describing a Type I error. When the null hypothesis is true, but the p-value is small enough to reject it, we falsely conclude that a difference exists. Since the p-value reflects the probability of this happening under the null hypothesis, this statement is correct. (D) When p-value is less than alpha, the result is statistically significant: This is correct because in hypothesis testing, if the p-value is less than the chosen alpha level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and declare the result statistically significant.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The standard error (SE) measures the variability of a sample statistic (such as the sample mean) from the true population mean. It is calculated as: SE= ?/?n As the sample size (n) increases, the denominator (?n) increases, which makes the SE smaller, not larger. This means that larger sample sizes provide more precise estimates of the population parameter, reducing the standard error. Since standard error decreases as sample size increases, the statement in option (A) is incorrect, making it the correct choice for this question. Incorrect Options: (B) Based on normal distribution: The standard error is closely related to the normal distribution. According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), for large enough sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the population's original distribution. Therefore, SE is based on normal distribution principles. (C) It depends on the standard deviation of the mean: The standard error is directly dependent on the population standard deviation (?) because it is part of the formula: SE= ?/?n If the population standard deviation is large, the SE will also be larger, meaning greater variability in sample means. (D) Is used to estimate confidence limits: Confidence intervals (CIs) are calculated using the standard error. The formula for a confidence interval is: CI=X?±(Z×SE) where Z is the Z-score for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% CI). Since standard error is used to determine confidence limits, this statement is true.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \"Probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present.\" A p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true. It helps assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. If the p-value is small (e.g., < 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that a significant difference exists. However, when we reject the null hypothesis but it is actually true, we make a Type I error (false positive). Since a p-value represents the probability of making a Type I error, it matches option (A), which describes the probability of wrongly declaring a significant difference when there is none. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is present: - Incorrect. This describes a correct rejection of a false null hypothesis, which is not what the p-value represents. The p-value does not measure the probability that a real difference exists; it only tells us how likely our results are under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. (C) Probability of not declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present: - Incorrect. This describes the correct acceptance of a true null hypothesis, which is unrelated to the p-value. (D) Probability of not declaring a significant difference when actually it is present: - Incorrect. This describes a Type II error (false negative, β error)—failing to reject a false null hypothesis. The p-value does not measure Type II errors; instead, it is linked to Type I errors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 2.5%. A 95% confidence interval (CI) of 56% to 76% means that if we were to repeat the study many times, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true prevalence of cancer in smokers aged >65 years. A 95% confidence interval means that 5% of the time, the true prevalence could lie outside this range. Since the confidence interval is symmetric, the remaining 5% is split equally on both ends: 2.5% chance that the true prevalence is below 56% 2.5% chance that the true prevalence is above 76% Thus, the probability that the prevalence is actually less than 56% is 2.5%, making option (C) correct. Incorrect Options: (A) Practically Nil: Incorrect. While 2.5% is a small probability, it is not zero. There is still a small chance that the prevalence is below 56%, so this option is incorrect. (B) 44%: Incorrect. This option is misleading. The confidence interval represents a range, not a probability distribution. The probability that the true prevalence is outside the CI is only 5% (2.5?low 56% and 2.5?ove 76%), not 44%. (D) 5%: Incorrect. While 5% of values lie outside the confidence interval, this includes both ends (below 56% and above 76%).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) \"The curve shows a regression line means correlation.\" In studies that assess agreement between two groups (such as SpO2 levels in this case), a regression line is often used to determine the relationship between the two variables. If a regression line is observed on a scatter plot, it typically indicates a correlation between the two groups. A regression line indicates that there is a linear relationship between the two groups, which is a form of correlation. The line helps us understand how one group’s values (e.g., SpO2 in the first group) predict the values in the second group (e.g., SpO2 in the second group). The slope of the regression line can tell us the strength and direction of the relationship, and the closeness of the data points to the line reflects the strength of the correlation. Therefore, option (D) is correct as it suggests the existence of a correlation between the two groups with the regression line. Incorrect Options: (A) \"There is not agreement between the two groups.\" The presence of a regression line typically indicates that there is a relationship between the groups. The statement in (A) suggests no agreement, which contradicts the indication of a relationship shown by the regression line. (B) \"The two groups have a constant relation with a variation of 3%.\" The concept of constant relation would imply a perfect linear correlation, and stating a variation of 3% does not necessarily indicate a constant relationship. The regression line is more about understanding the general trend or correlation rather than a fixed percentage of variation. (C) \"There is no association between the two groups.\" If there is a regression line, this suggests that there is an association between the two groups, contrary to what is stated in (C).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \"Non-linear relationship.\" In the context of the question, without the picture itself, the most reasonable assumption based on the choices is that the correct answer is (A), which refers to a non-linear relationship. Here’s why: Non-linear relationship refers to a situation where the data points do not follow a straight line when plotted on a graph. Instead, the relationship between the variables could be curved or take another form that doesn’t fit a simple linear trend. This is typically seen when the relationship between the variables is more complex, and a curve (e.g., exponential, quadratic) might fit the data better than a straight line. Incorrect Options: (B) \"Linear relationship\" A linear relationship refers to a situation where the data points align on a straight line. If the picture shows data with a curved pattern, it would not be a linear relationship. (C) \"Nothing can be inferred\" The picture likely suggests something about the relationship between variables, so it would be possible to infer whether the relationship is linear, non-linear, or something else. (D) \"Positive to - relation found\" This option is vague and unclear in its meaning. Typically, a positive relationship refers to a scenario where as one variable increases, the other also increases, but it's not clear how this relates to the non-linear pattern suggested by the image.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) \"One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA).\" When comparing the heights of school children across more than two groups (for example, children from different grades, classes, or schools), one-way ANOVA is the appropriate test. One-way ANOVA is used when you have one independent variable with multiple levels (groups) and you want to compare the means of those groups to see if there is a statistically significant difference in their heights. One-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal, and compares the variance between groups to the variance within groups. If the ratio is significantly large, it suggests that at least one group mean differs from the others. Incorrect Options: (A) Student's t-test: A t-test is used to compare the means between two groups. Since the question refers to the heights of school children (which may involve more than two groups), a t-test is not suitable in this case. (B) Chi-squared test: The Chi-squared test is used for categorical data, typically to test relationships between categorical variables (e.g., observed vs expected frequencies). It is not appropriate for comparing means of continuous data like heights. (C) Paired t-test: A paired t-test is used when comparing the means of two related or paired groups (e.g., before and after measurements for the same group of children). This is not applicable to comparing heights across different groups.",
