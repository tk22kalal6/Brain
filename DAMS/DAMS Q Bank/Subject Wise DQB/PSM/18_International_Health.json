      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Oral rehydration therapy. The UNICEF GOBI campaign focuses on four primary interventions aimed at improving child survival rates in developing countries. GOBI is an acronym for: G: Growth monitoring O: Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) B: Breastfeeding I: Immunization Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a simple, cost-effective treatment for dehydration caused by diarrhea, a leading cause of child mortality in many parts of the world. It involves the use of a solution made with water, salt, and sugar to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. O in the GOBI campaign stands for Oral rehydration therapy, which is a cornerstone intervention to reduce deaths caused by diarrhea in children. Incorrect Options: A (Oral contraceptives): This is incorrect. Oral contraceptives are not part of the GOBI campaign, which focuses on child survival and primary healthcare interventions. C (Obesity): This is incorrect. Obesity is not a focus of the GOBI campaign, which addresses issues affecting child health and survival in low-resource settings.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) UNFPA. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the leading global agency that provides the highest funding for reproductive health programs. UNFPA works to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, maternal health, and programs addressing gender-based violence and reproductive rights. The organization plays a pivotal role in advancing reproductive health initiatives, especially in developing countries, through funding, advocacy, and capacity-building. UNFPA focuses specifically on reproductive health and related issues, making it the largest global funding agency in this domain. Its mission includes improving maternal health, reducing unmet needs for family planning, and supporting reproductive health services worldwide. Incorrect Options: B (UNICEF): UNICEF focuses on child survival, development, and welfare, including nutrition, education, and immunization. While it indirectly supports maternal health through child survival programs, it does not provide the majority of funding for reproductive health. C (ILO): The International Labour Organization (ILO) primarily focuses on labor rights, social protection, and working conditions. It does not significantly fund reproductive health programs. D (WHO): The World Health Organization (WHO) provides technical expertise and guidance on global health, including reproductive health policies and programs. However, it does not allocate the highest funding for reproductive health; its role is more about leadership and advocacy rather than direct funding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) TB. Internationally notifiable diseases are those that countries are required to report to the World Health Organization (WHO) under the International Health Regulations (IHR). These diseases pose a significant threat to global health security due to their potential to cause outbreaks and spread internationally. The current list of internationally notifiable diseases includes Plague, Cholera, and Yellow Fever because of their epidemic potential. Tuberculosis (TB), although a global health issue, is not included in the internationally notifiable diseases list under the IHR. Tuberculosis (TB), while a major public health concern globally, is not an internationally notifiable disease. It does not meet the criteria of posing an acute international health threat like Plague, Cholera, or Yellow Fever, which require immediate international coordination to prevent outbreaks. Incorrect Options: A (Plague): Plague is an internationally notifiable disease under the IHR because of its high fatality rate and potential for rapid international spread. Reporting cases of plague is essential to prevent outbreaks. B (Cholera): Cholera is also an internationally notifiable disease due to its potential to cause severe outbreaks, particularly in areas with inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure. C (Yellow fever): Yellow fever is included in the internationally notifiable diseases list because of its epidemic potential and the availability of a vaccine, which makes controlling its spread possible with prompt international response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Yellow fever. Yellow fever is an internationally notifiable disease under the International Health Regulations (IHR) because of its high epidemic potential and global health threat. It is subject to mandatory reporting to the World Health Organization (WHO), not merely international surveillance. Diseases under international surveillance, however, are typically those monitored closely for their spread or public health impact, but reporting them is not mandatory. Yellow fever is not just under international surveillance; it is an internationally notifiable disease under the IHR. This means that member states must report cases of yellow fever to WHO as part of mandatory global health security measures. Incorrect Options: A (Louse-borne typhus fever): Louse-borne typhus fever is under international surveillance due to its historical association with outbreaks, especially in crowded or unhygienic conditions. While it is monitored, it is not an internationally notifiable disease. B (Relapsing fever): Relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia species, is included in diseases under international surveillance because of its public health importance in certain regions. It is closely monitored but does not require mandatory reporting to WHO. C (Paralytic polio): Paralytic poliomyelitis is under international surveillance as part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). While eradication efforts focus on monitoring cases closely, it is not the same as being internationally notifiable like yellow fever.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Onchocerciasis. While Onchocerciasis (commonly known as river blindness) is a significant public health issue, it is not one of the tropical diseases specifically targeted by WHO under its Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR). The diseases targeted by the TDR program include those that disproportionately affect low-income populations and require focused research and training efforts to control or eradicate. The TDR program prioritizes diseases such as trypanosomiasis, filariasis, and schistosomiasis because they are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions. Although Onchocerciasis is a tropical disease and a public health concern, it is not specifically listed under the WHO's TDR program for research and training. Efforts to control onchocerciasis have been addressed through other WHO initiatives, such as the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) and the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA). Incorrect Options: A (Trypanosomiasis): Trypanosomiasis (e.g., African sleeping sickness) is a parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei and is a major focus of the TDR program. It affects rural populations in Africa and requires significant research and training for its control and elimination. B (Filariasis): Filariasis, including lymphatic filariasis, is another tropical disease targeted by the TDR program. It is caused by parasitic worms and leads to chronic morbidity, making it a priority for research and control efforts. C (Schistosomiasis): Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (Schistosoma species) and is also a major focus of the TDR program. It is prevalent in tropical regions and is responsible for significant morbidity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Health of travellers. Emporiatrics is the branch of medicine that focuses on the health of travelers. It encompasses the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases associated with travel, especially international travel. This field of study involves assessing health risks in specific destinations, providing vaccinations, advising on preventive measures (e.g., against malaria or foodborne illnesses), and managing illnesses acquired during travel. Emporiatrics is specifically concerned with the health and well-being of individuals traveling to different regions of the world. It includes managing the risks posed by infectious diseases, environmental factors, and lifestyle changes during travel. Incorrect Options: A (Occupational disease): This is incorrect. The study of occupational diseases falls under occupational medicine, which deals with diseases and injuries caused by work environments or job-specific activities.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Plague. The concept of quarantine originated in the 14th century as a public health measure to combat the spread of the plague, specifically the Black Death. Ships arriving at ports were required to stay anchored for 40 days (from the Italian word \"quaranta,\" meaning forty) to ensure that no active cases of plague were present among the crew or passengers. This method was one of the earliest and most effective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious disease. The plague was the primary reason for the introduction of quarantine during the Middle Ages. This measure was critical in controlling outbreaks of the highly infectious and deadly disease Incorrect Options: B (Tuberculosis): While isolation is used for diseases like tuberculosis to prevent its airborne spread, quarantine was not originally introduced for this purpose. TB became a significant public health concern much later, in the 19th and 20th centuries. C (AIDS): AIDS, caused by HIV, emerged in the late 20th century and is not transmitted through casual contact, so quarantine is not a relevant measure for it. AIDS prevention relies on education, safe practices, and antiretroviral therapy. D (Malaria): Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and is not a contagious disease between humans. Quarantine would not be effective for malaria and was not introduced for its control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Compulsory sickness benefit. Germany's significant contribution to public health lies in the introduction of compulsory sickness benefit systems. This was part of the Bismarck Model, named after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who established the Health Insurance Act of 1883. This legislation was the first of its kind and mandated employers and workers to contribute to a sickness fund that provided workers with access to medical care and compensation for lost income during illness. This system laid the foundation for modern social health insurance schemes worldwide. Germany introduced the world's first compulsory health insurance system under Bismarck in 1883. This system ensured financial protection for workers and access to healthcare, which became a model for other countries. Incorrect Options: A (Germ theory): Germ theory, which states that microorganisms cause disease, was developed by scientists like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. While Koch was German and made significant contributions to microbiology, germ theory is not exclusively Germany’s contribution to public health; it was a broader scientific advancement. B (Pasteurization): Pasteurization is a process developed by Louis Pasteur, a French scientist. It involves heating liquids, such as milk, to kill harmful microbes, and it is not related to Germany's contribution to public health. C (Social medicine): Social medicine focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of health. While Germany played a role in this field, the term is more closely associated with other public health pioneers like Rudolf Virchow, who emphasized the social causes of disease.",
