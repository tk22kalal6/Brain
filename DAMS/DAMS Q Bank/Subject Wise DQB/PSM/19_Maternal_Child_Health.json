      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 350 Kcals. During pregnancy, a woman’s body undergoes significant physiological and metabolic changes to support fetal growth and maternal health. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) guidelines, an additional 350 Kcal per day is recommended during pregnancy to meet the increased energy demands. This extra energy is essential for the development of the fetus, placenta, and maternal tissues, as well as for supporting the increased basal metabolic rate. Adequate energy intake also helps in preventing maternal undernutrition, low birth weight, and complications during pregnancy. Incorrect options: A. 150 Kcals An additional 150 Kcal per day is insufficient to meet the increased energy requirements of pregnancy. While early pregnancy may not demand a large increase in energy, as the fetus grows, a significantly higher intake is necessary. B. 200 Kcals Although 200 Kcal is closer to the actual requirement than 150 Kcal, it still falls short of the recommended 350 Kcal/day. This amount might be adequate in early pregnancy but is not sufficient for the second and third trimesters when fetal growth accelerates. C. 300 Kcals While 300 Kcal is a considerable increase, it is still slightly below the recommended level of 350 Kcal per day. To ensure optimal fetal growth and maternal well-being, the requirement has been set at 350 Kcal/day, as per national and international health guidelines.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 60 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid. During pregnancy, a woman’s iron and folic acid requirements increase significantly to support fetal growth, placenta development, and increased maternal blood volume. According to the National Health Mission (NHM) guidelines in India, pregnant women should receive daily supplementation of 60 mg elemental iron and 500 mcg (0.5 mg) folic acid starting from the second trimester and continuing for at least 180 days postpartum. This helps in preventing iron-deficiency anemia and neural tube defects (NTDs) in the developing fetus. Incorrect options: B. 100 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid While 100 mg iron is sometimes recommended in cases of severe anemia, the standard daily prophylactic dose is 60 mg iron. Excess iron intake without medical supervision may cause gastrointestinal side effects like constipation and nausea. C. 60 mg iron + 100 mcg folic acid Though 60 mg iron is correct, the amount of folic acid given in this option (100 mcg) is insufficient. 500 mcg (0.5 mg) folic acid is recommended to prevent neural tube defects and support fetal brain development. D. 100 mg iron + 100 mcg folic acid This option includes an incorrect folic acid dose (100 mcg instead of 500 mcg) and a higher-than-routine iron dosage, which is not the standard prophylactic recommendation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Clean perineum. The \"5 cleans\" in the conduct of delivery are essential measures to ensure a safe and hygienic childbirth process, reducing the risk of infections for both the mother and the newborn. These five cleans include: Clean hands – Ensuring the hands of the birth attendant are washed with soap and water or disinfected reduces the risk of introducing harmful pathogens. Clean perineum – While maintaining perineal hygiene is important, it is not explicitly listed as one of the \"5 cleans.\" Instead, emphasis is placed on the sterility of the delivery environment and tools. Clean cutting and care of the cord – Using a sterile instrument to cut the umbilical cord and ensuring proper cord care prevents neonatal infections, such as neonatal tetanus and sepsis. Clean surface for delivery – A sanitized surface minimizes the risk of maternal and neonatal infections, ensuring a safer birth environment. Clean cord tie – A sterile cord tie or clamp helps prevent infection at the umbilical stump. Thus, while a clean perineum is important in general hygiene, it is not included in the official \"5 cleans,\" making option B the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (Clean hands): Correct but not the answer – Clean hands are one of the most critical aspects of safe delivery. Birth attendants must wash hands thoroughly with soap and water or use a disinfectant before handling the mother and newborn. Option C (Clean cutting & care of cord): Correct but not the answer – Cutting the umbilical cord with a sterile instrument and ensuring proper post-cutting care is crucial in preventing infections like neonatal tetanus. Option D (Clean surface for delivery): Correct but not the answer – A clean and sanitized surface prevents contamination and minimizes infection risks for both the mother and baby",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Give a dose of Tetanus Toxoid (TT) & explain to her that it will not protect the newborn & she should take the second dose after 4 weeks even if she delivers in the meantime. Tetanus immunization is a crucial part of antenatal care to protect both the mother and newborn from neonatal tetanus, a life-threatening condition. Since this woman has not received any antenatal care before 37 weeks, she is likely unvaccinated or under-immunized against tetanus. The TT vaccine requires two doses, given at least 4 weeks apart, to provide effective protection. Since she is already at 37 weeks, a single dose of TT will not provide immediate protection to the newborn. However, it will initiate maternal immunity, and if she continues with the second dose after 4 weeks, it will contribute to future protection for subsequent pregnancies. Even if she delivers before the second dose, she should still receive it to ensure long-term immunity and partial protection for future pregnancies. Incorrect Options: Option B (Don’t waste TT vaccine as it would anyhow be of no use in this pregnancy): Incorrect. Even though the first dose will not provide immediate neonatal protection, it will help the mother build immunity for future pregnancies and reduce her own risk of tetanus. Additionally, it is never appropriate to deny vaccination simply because it may not offer complete protection in the current pregnancy. Option C (Give one dose of TT & explain that it will not be useful for this pregnancy): Incorrect. While it is true that a single dose will not immediately protect the newborn, the mother should be advised to take the second dose to build long-term immunity. Just giving one dose without follow-up is inadequate. Option D (Give her anti-Tetanus Ig along with the TT vaccine): Incorrect. Anti-Tetanus Immunoglobulin (Ig) is typically given in cases of high-risk tetanus exposure (such as contaminated wounds), not as routine antenatal care. TT vaccine alone is sufficient for immunization, and Ig is not required unless the mother has an injury and is at immediate risk of tetanus.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Birth weight less than 2.8 kg. Infants at risk are those who have a higher likelihood of morbidity and mortality due to various biological, environmental, and social factors. While low birth weight (LBW) is a recognized risk factor, the commonly accepted threshold for LBW is less than 2.5 kg (as per WHO guidelines). A birth weight of less than 2.8 kg does not necessarily place an infant in the high-risk category, as many healthy full-term babies weigh between 2.5 kg and 2.8 kg. Thus, option A is incorrect because the standard cutoff for LBW is 2.5 kg, not 2.8 kg. Incorrect Options: Option B (Birth order 4 or more): Correct but not the answer – Higher birth order (fourth child or beyond) is considered a risk factor because of nutritional depletion in the mother, reduced healthcare access, and increased competition for resources among siblings. It is associated with higher neonatal and infant mortality. Option C (PEM, diarrhea): Correct but not the answer – Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and recurrent diarrhea significantly increase the risk of infant morbidity and mortality due to weakened immunity, poor growth, and susceptibility to infections. Malnutrition and diarrhea often form a vicious cycle, making an infant vulnerable. Option D (Working mother): Correct but not the answer – A working mother, especially in lower-income settings, may struggle with exclusive breastfeeding, timely complementary feeding, and childcare due to limited maternity leave and inadequate childcare support. This can contribute to growth faltering and poor health outcomes in infants.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 6.5 kgs. Weight gain during pregnancy is an important indicator of maternal and fetal health. In well-nourished women, the recommended weight gain during pregnancy is around 11–13 kg. However, in poor Indian women, the average weight gain is significantly lower, around 6.5 kg, due to factors like malnutrition, inadequate calorie intake, anemia, and poor healthcare access. Low maternal weight gain is associated with higher risks of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birth weight (LBW) infants, and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. Poor dietary intake, recurrent infections, and hard physical labor contribute to this low weight gain. Thus, option C (6.5 kg) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (12 kgs): Incorrect – This is the expected weight gain in well-nourished women but is not observed in poor Indian women due to inadequate nutrition. Option B (10 kgs): Incorrect – While 10 kg may be a reasonable weight gain for moderately nourished women, poor Indian women typically gain much less due to chronic undernutrition. Option D (2.5 kgs): Incorrect – A weight gain as low as 2.5 kg is severely inadequate and would indicate extreme malnutrition or underlying medical conditions, which is not the general average.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR). Maternal and Child Health (MCH) care is assessed through indicators that reflect the quality of healthcare services provided to mothers and children. Among these, Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is one of the most important measures. It represents the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births due to pregnancy-related causes. A high MMR indicates poor maternal healthcare, lack of access to skilled birth attendants, inadequate antenatal care, and insufficient emergency obstetric services. A low MMR suggests good healthcare infrastructure, proper maternal nutrition, effective antenatal care, and access to institutional deliveries. Since MMR directly reflects the effectiveness of maternal healthcare services, it is the most appropriate measure for assessing MCH care. Incorrect Options: Option A (Death rate): Incorrect – The general death rate (crude death rate) includes all deaths from all causes in a population. While it is an important demographic measure, it does not specifically assess MCH care. Option B (Birth rate): Incorrect – The birth rate measures the number of live births per 1,000 people in a year. While it helps understand population growth, it does not reflect the quality of maternal and child healthcare services. Option D (Anaemia in pregnancy): Incorrect – Anaemia in pregnancy is a significant maternal health issue, especially in developing countries.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 0 During the first trimester of pregnancy, there is no significant increase in calorie requirements because: The fetus is still very small, and its energy demands are minimal. The mother’s body primarily undergoes hormonal and physiological changes, but there is no substantial increase in metabolic needs. The focus in the first trimester is on quality rather than quantity of nutrition, emphasizing folic acid, iron, and other micronutrients rather than increased calorie intake. Thus, no extra calories are required in the first trimester, making option A the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option B (150 calories): Incorrect – A slight increase in calorie needs occurs in the second trimester, but in the first trimester, no extra calories are necessary. Option C (350 calories): Incorrect – This is the recommended extra calorie intake for the second trimester, not the first. Option D (450 calories): Incorrect – This is the extra calorie requirement for the third trimester, when fetal growth is at its peak.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 500 babies. To accurately estimate the percentage of low birth weight (LBW) babies in a population, a sufficiently large and representative sample size is required. LBW is defined as birth weight less than 2.5 kg. A sample size of at least 500 newborns is generally considered adequate for reliable statistical estimation of LBW prevalence in a given population. This number allows for reasonable precision while maintaining feasibility in data collection. A smaller sample (e.g., 100 babies) may lead to unreliable or highly variable results, while a larger sample (e.g., 1000 or 10,000 babies) may provide greater accuracy but could be unnecessary for routine surveillance. Thus, examining at least 500 newborns provides a balance between accuracy and practicality, making option B the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (100 babies): Incorrect – A sample size of only 100 is too small and may not provide a reliable estimate due to higher statistical variability. Option C (1000 babies): Incorrect – While a larger sample increases accuracy, 1000 is not the minimum required; 500 is generally sufficient for estimation. Option D (10,000 babies): Incorrect – A sample size of 10,000 is excessive for routine calculations and is usually unnecessary unless conducting a large-scale epidemiological study.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 2.8 kgs. The mean birth weight of Indian babies is approximately 2.8 kg, which is lower than that of newborns in developed countries. This difference is primarily due to factors such as: Maternal malnutrition and anemia, which are common in India and contribute to lower fetal growth. High prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) babies (birth weight < 2.5 kg), which affects the overall average. Socioeconomic disparities and inadequate prenatal care, leading to suboptimal maternal health and fetal development. Studies have shown that while the average birth weight of newborns in developed countries ranges from 3.2 to 3.5 kg, Indian babies tend to have a lower average, around 2.8 kg. Thus, option B (2.8 kg) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (2.5 kgs): Incorrect – This is the cutoff for low birth weight (LBW), not the mean birth weight of Indian babies. Option C (3.1 kgs): Incorrect – This is closer to the average birth weight in developed countries, but Indian babies typically have a lower average. Option D (3.5 kgs): Incorrect – This is significantly higher than the Indian average and is usually seen in high-income countries with better maternal nutrition and healthcare.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Continue breastfeeding. For infants with mild diarrhea, the best approach is to continue breastfeeding. Breast milk provides essential nutrients, antibodies, and hydration, which help manage the condition and promote healing. It also helps prevent dehydration, which is one of the main concerns during diarrhea. Breastfeeding supports immune function, provides hydration, and prevents the infant from becoming malnourished or dehydrated. Breastfeeding can be continued even during episodes of mild diarrhea, and it may help shorten the duration of the illness. In addition to breastfeeding, oral rehydration solution (ORS) should be given to maintain hydration. However, the priority should be continuing to breastfeed. Incorrect Options: Option B (Antibiotics): Incorrect – Antibiotics are not routinely required for mild diarrhea unless there is suspicion of a bacterial infection, which is not the case in most instances of mild diarrhea in infants. Most cases of mild diarrhea are viral, for which antibiotics are ineffective. Option C (Stop all breastfeeding and start ORS): Incorrect – Breastfeeding should not be stopped during mild diarrhea. In fact, breast milk is the best way to support the infant during diarrhea, and ORS should be given alongside breastfeeding if dehydration is a concern. Option D (Intravenous fluid administration): Incorrect – Intravenous fluids are typically used for moderate to severe dehydration, not for mild diarrhea. For mild diarrhea, oral rehydration with ORS and continuing breastfeeding is usually sufficient.",

These visits should occur at the following stages: First visit: As early as possible, ideally in the first trimester, for initial screenings and evaluations. Second visit: Around 16-20 weeks for further assessments, including an ultrasound. Third visit: Around 28 weeks to monitor fetal growth and maternal health. Fourth visit: Around 36 weeks, closer to delivery, to assess readiness for childbirth and address any last-minute concerns. These visits are crucial for detecting complications, providing appropriate care and advice, and administering necessary vaccinations and supplements like iron and folic acid. Incorrect Options: Option A (1 visit): Incorrect – One antenatal visit is insufficient to assess the health status of the mother and fetus and to address complications that may arise during pregnancy. Option B (2 visits): Incorrect – Two visits are also too few to adequately monitor maternal and fetal health, provide necessary tests, and intervene if any issues arise.

The prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) in India is approximately 18%, according to various health surveys and data from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. LBW is a significant public health concern in India, as it is associated with increased neonatal morbidity and mortality. Factors contributing to LBW in India include maternal malnutrition, inadequate antenatal care, anemia, and high rates of premature births. India has one of the highest rates of LBW in the world, despite efforts to improve maternal and child health. Thus, option D (18%) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (26%): Incorrect – While LBW prevalence is significant in India, 26% is an overestimate of the current prevalence. Option B (28%): Incorrect – Similarly, 28% is too high compared to the actual prevalence of LBW in India.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) MAC (Mid-Arm Circumference). Mid-Arm Circumference (MAC) is an age-independent indicator of malnutrition. It is a simple and reliable measurement that reflects the nutritional status and muscle mass of an individual.

MAC is especially useful in identifying malnutrition in adults, and it can also be used for children older than 5 years, making it a valuable tool in various age groups. Thus, option D (MAC) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (Underweight): Incorrect – Underweight is age-dependent because it is determined by the ratio of a person's weight to their age or height, meaning it is typically measured using growth charts specific to age and sex. Option B (Stunting): Incorrect – Stunting refers to low height-for-age and is age-dependent, as it is based on a child's height relative to their age.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tetanus. Tetanus is not a common cause of post-neonatal infant mortality in India, as it is generally a concern in the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life). Neonatal tetanus is primarily caused by unhygienic practices during delivery and cutting of the umbilical cord, but with the widespread use of tetanus toxoid immunization and improved hygiene, the incidence of neonatal tetanus has significantly decreased in many parts of India. As a result, it is less commonly associated with post-neonatal mortality (after 28 days). Incorrect Options: Option B (Malnutrition): Incorrect – Malnutrition is a major cause of post-neonatal infant mortality in India. Poor nutrition during infancy can lead to increased vulnerability to infections and chronic conditions that can contribute to death. Option C (Diarrhoeal diseases): Incorrect – Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of post-neonatal infant mortality in India, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration, which can be fatal in infants without appropriate treatment. Option D (Pneumonia): Incorrect – Pneumonia is another major cause of post-neonatal infant mortality in India. It is a common respiratory infection that can lead to severe complications and death, especially among malnourished infants or those with poor access to healthcare.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Maternal deaths/100,000 live births. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births during a given time period. It is an important indicator of maternal health and reflects the quality of healthcare systems, especially in terms of pregnancy-related complications and access to care. MMR provides insights into the risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth in a population and is widely used by global health organizations to track progress in maternal health and guide health interventions. Thus, option C (Maternal deaths/100,000 live births) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: Option A (Maternal deaths/live birth): Incorrect – This is not a valid way to calculate MMR. It is more appropriate to calculate the ratio per 100,000 live births, not a direct proportion to a single live birth. Option B (Maternal deaths/1000 live births): Incorrect – While this was used in some earlier definitions of MMR, the current standard is to calculate it per 100,000 live births, not 1000. Option D (Maternal deaths/100000 live population): Incorrect – This is a misrepresentation. MMR should be calculated specifically per live births, not the total population. Total population includes those who are not pregnant and thus should not be used in this calculation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) During lactation 8th month. Maternal death is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration or site of the pregnancy. It can result from pregnancy-related complications, childbirth-related complications, or the consequences of abortion. However, deaths occurring during lactation in the 8th month are not classified as maternal deaths because the 42-day period after delivery is the cutoff for maternal mortality. After this period, the death is not counted as maternal unless it is caused by a complication directly related to pregnancy or childbirth. Incorrect Options: Option A (Following abortion): Incorrect – Deaths following abortion, especially unsafe or incomplete abortion, are classified as maternal deaths. These are considered direct causes of maternal mortality. Option B (During lactation 1st month): Incorrect – Deaths during the first month of lactation are considered maternal deaths if they are related to complications arising from pregnancy or childbirth (e.g., hemorrhage, infection). Option D (During the last trimester due to APH): Incorrect – Antepartum hemorrhage (APH) during the last trimester is a pregnancy-related complication and can result in maternal death. APH can lead to severe bleeding, shock, and death if not managed properly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infant mortality rate. Infant mortality rate (IMR) is considered one of the best indicators of death in a community because it reflects the overall health and well-being of a society, including: Healthcare access and quality (availability of prenatal care, safe delivery practices, and neonatal care). Nutrition and sanitation. Maternal health (since poor maternal health directly impacts infant survival). Socioeconomic conditions. A high IMR often signals that there are significant health challenges within a community, such as inadequate healthcare, malnutrition, and poor sanitation. It provides insight into the overall quality of life and health systems in a given population.. Incorrect Options: Option A (Maternal mortality rate): Incorrect – While maternal mortality rate (MMR) is an important indicator of maternal health, it does not necessarily reflect the overall death rates in the population or community as a whole. It is more specific to pregnancy and childbirth-related deaths. Option C (Life expectancy rate): Incorrect – Life expectancy provides an estimate of the average number of years a person can expect to live, but it is a broader metric and doesn't focus on recent mortality within the community, which is why it is not the best indicator of current death rates. Option D (Neonatal mortality rate): Incorrect – While neonatal mortality rate (deaths in the first 28 days of life) is also a critical indicator of infant health, infant mortality rate includes deaths from both neonatal and post-neonatal periods, making it a more comprehensive measure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hemorrhage. The leading cause of maternal deaths in India is hemorrhage, specifically postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which accounts for a significant percentage of maternal mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage typically occurs within the first 24 hours after childbirth and is often caused by: Uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract after delivery). Retained placenta or lacerations. Coagulopathies (disorders that affect blood clotting). Inadequate access to skilled birth attendants and timely medical interventions often contribute to the high incidence of hemorrhage-related maternal deaths in India. This is why hemorrhage remains the leading cause. Incorrect Options: Option A (Anemia): Incorrect – Anemia is a significant contributing factor to maternal deaths, but it is generally not the primary cause. It can complicate pregnancy, leading to severe fatigue, heart failure, and increased susceptibility to other complications, but hemorrhage remains the leading direct cause. Option C (Sepsis): Incorrect – Sepsis, or severe infections, particularly postpartum infections, is another leading cause of maternal death, but it ranks second in India after hemorrhage. It is a major concern, especially in settings with poor sanitation and inadequate healthcare. Option D (Obstructed labour): Incorrect – Obstructed labor can cause birth injuries and fetal deaths, and it may lead to maternal mortality, especially in remote areas without access to emergency obstetric care, but it is not the leading cause.",

Incorrect Options: Option A (Early neonatal mortality): Incorrect – Early neonatal mortality is the death of infants within the first 7 days of life, and it is a key component of infant mortality. Option C (Post neonatal mortality): Incorrect – Post neonatal mortality refers to infant deaths occurring between 28 days and one year, and it is also included in the infant mortality rate.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IMR (Infant Mortality Rate). Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is an important sensitivity parameter of combined pediatric and obstetric care in a country. It reflects the overall effectiveness of healthcare systems in reducing deaths during the first year of life, encompassing the combined efforts of maternal health (obstetric care) and child health (pediatric care). IMR is influenced by both maternal health (such as antenatal care, safe delivery, and maternal nutrition) and newborn care (such as neonatal care, immunization, and postnatal care). It serves as a key indicator of health system performance in preventing infant deaths, which are closely linked to the quality of obstetric and pediatric services in a country. Incorrect Options: Option B (PNMR – Perinatal Mortality Rate): Incorrect – PNMR measures the deaths of infants during the perinatal period (from 22 weeks of gestation to 7 days after birth) and does not directly reflect the combined effectiveness of pediatric and obstetric care during the entire first year of life. Option C (NNMR – Neonatal Mortality Rate): Incorrect – NNMR refers specifically to deaths within the first 28 days of life and focuses on neonatal care.

Perinatal Mortality Rate (PNMR) refers to the number of stillbirths and neonatal deaths (within the first week of life) occurring between 28 weeks of gestation and 7 days after birth. It combines two types of mortality: Stillbirths: Deaths of fetuses after 28 weeks of gestation but before or during delivery. Early neonatal deaths: Deaths within the first 7 days of life. The perinatal period is crucial as it reflects the quality of antenatal care, safeguards during delivery, and the immediate care after birth. Incorrect Options: Option A (Deaths within the first week of life): Incorrect – While neonatal deaths within the first week are part of perinatal mortality, the perinatal mortality rate also includes stillbirths, which occur before birth, making this option incomplete. Option B (Abortion, stillbirths, deaths within first year of life): Incorrect – Perinatal mortality includes only stillbirths and early neonatal deaths (within the first 7 days). It does not include abortions or deaths after the first week of life. Deaths within the first year fall under infant mortality, not perinatal mortality.

So, the total number of neonatal deaths is: Neonatal deaths (0-28 days) = 50 + 150 = 200 Now, applying the formula for NMR: NMR = (200/4000) x 1000 = 50",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The Child Survival Index (CSI) is calculated using the formula: CSI = 1000 - U5MR / 10 Where U5MR (Under-5 Mortality Rate) represents the number of deaths of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births. This formula reflects child survival by subtracting U5MR from 1000 and dividing by 10. Since a higher U5MR indicates higher child mortality, the CSI effectively converts this into a survival measure—higher CSI values indicate better child survival rates. This approach provides a simple and interpretable way to assess child health and mortality trends in different populations. Incorrect Options: Option A (1000 - IMR / 10): Incorrect Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) refers to deaths of infants under one year per 1,000 live births, whereas the Child Survival Index is based on U5MR, which includes deaths up to five years of age. IMR does not fully capture child survival beyond infancy, making this formula unsuitable. Option B (IMR - 1000 / 10): Incorrect This formula does not follow the correct mathematical structure. Subtracting 1000 from IMR and then dividing by 10 does not align with how survival rates are typically measured. Additionally, IMR is not the correct indicator for this index. Option D (U5MR - 1000 / 10): Incorrect This formula is a misinterpretation of the correct formula. By subtracting 1000 from U5MR rather than the other way around, it would produce negative or misleading values, which do not accurately represent child survival rates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Postpartum) because the postpartum period (up to 42 days after delivery) is the most critical time for maternal mortality. Studies indicate that a majority of maternal deaths occur within this period, primarily due to postpartum hemorrhage, infections (puerperal sepsis), eclampsia, thromboembolism, and complications from unsafe deliveries. The immediate postpartum phase (first 24–48 hours) is particularly dangerous, as excessive bleeding and complications can develop rapidly. Lack of access to timely medical intervention in this period significantly increases the risk of death. Incorrect Options: Option A (Antepartum) – Incorrect The antepartum period (during pregnancy) does contribute to maternal mortality, but it is not the leading phase. Conditions such as severe anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), antepartum hemorrhage (placenta previa, abruptio placentae), and infections can lead to maternal deaths, but most deaths occur after delivery rather than during pregnancy. Option B (Peripartum) – Incorrect The peripartum period refers to labor and delivery, which is a high-risk phase but accounts for fewer maternal deaths compared to the postpartum period. While complications like obstructed labor, uterine rupture, and eclampsia can be fatal, timely medical intervention can prevent most of these deaths. However, if not managed properly, complications during delivery can lead to postpartum complications, which increase the risk of death. Option D (None) – Incorrect Since maternal mortality is significantly higher in the postpartum period, choosing \"None\" as an answer would be incorrect. Maternal deaths do occur in various phases of pregnancy and childbirth, but the highest risk is clearly in the postpartum period.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (ALL) because Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI), including pneumonia, are a leading cause of Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) in India, particularly in remote and underserved areas. A comprehensive strategy is required for prevention and control, involving case management, health education, vaccination, nutrition, and supplementation. These interventions address different risk factors and collectively help in reducing the incidence, severity, and mortality associated with respiratory infections in children. Case Management and Health Education to Mothers (Option A) – Correct Effective case management is critical for reducing ARI-related deaths. Training health workers in Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) ensures early diagnosis and proper treatment of ARI cases. Educating mothers about early symptoms of pneumonia (fast breathing, chest in-drawing, fever) encourages timely medical care-seeking behavior. Additionally, promoting good hygiene, sanitation, and reducing indoor air pollution (by using clean cooking fuels) significantly lowers ARI risk. Vaccination (Option B) – Correct Immunization is one of the most effective preventive measures against ARI. Vaccines such as Measles, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB), Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV), and Pertussis (DPT vaccine) protect children from major respiratory pathogens that cause pneumonia and other severe infections. Expanding vaccine coverage in remote areas helps reduce the burden of ARI significantly. Controlling Malnutrition, Breastfeeding, and Vitamin A Supplementation (Option C) – Correct Malnutrition weakens immunity, making children more vulnerable to severe respiratory infections. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months provides antibodies and essential nutrients that protect against infections. Vitamin A supplementation boosts immunity and has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from ARI. Proper nutrition enhances overall child health and resilience against respiratory diseases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (Total deaths) because the Under-5 Proportionate Mortality Rate (U5PMR) is the proportion of all deaths in a given population that occur in children under five years of age. It is calculated using the formula: Under-5 Proportionate Mortality Rate = Deaths in children under 5 years / Total deaths in the population × 100 This measure helps assess the relative contribution of child mortality to overall mortality in a population. It is useful for monitoring child health programs and understanding the burden of childhood deaths compared to total deaths in a country or community. Incorrect Options: Option A (Mid-Year Population) – Incorrect The mid-year population represents the estimated total number of people in a given area at the middle of the year. It is commonly used as a denominator for Crude Death Rate (CDR) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR) but is not suitable for calculating proportionate mortality, which is based on total deaths rather than the population at risk. Option B (Mid-Year Population in 5 Years Age Group) – Incorrect The mid-year population of under-five children is used as a denominator in measures like the Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), which estimates the risk of dying before the age of five. However, proportionate mortality focuses on the share of total deaths occurring in children under five, not their population size, making this denominator inappropriate. Option C (Number of Live Births in Same Year) – Incorrect The number of live births in a year is used as the denominator in measures like Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), and Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR). These rates measure the risk of death among children in relation to the number of births. However, proportionate mortality is concerned with the relative proportion of deaths among all age groups, so total deaths, not live births, should be the denominator.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Neonatal tetanus) because neonatal tetanus primarily affects newborns (within the first 28 days of life) and is not a direct indicator of Under-Five Care in the community. Under-Five Care focuses on reducing mortality and morbidity in children under five years of age, emphasizing aspects like nutrition, immunization, hygiene, and management of common childhood illnesses. While neonatal tetanus is a serious health concern, it is specifically related to birth practices and maternal immunization rather than the broader scope of Under-Five Care. Incorrect Options: Option A (Infant Mortality Rate) – Incorrect Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is a key indicator of Under-Five Care because it represents the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. A high IMR suggests poor healthcare access, malnutrition, infections, and inadequate maternal and child health services, all of which are crucial aspects of Under-Five Care in the community. Option B (1-4 Year Mortality) – Incorrect Mortality in the 1-4 year age group is a direct measure of Under-Five Care, as it reflects the survival and health status of children after infancy. High mortality in this age group is often due to malnutrition, diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases, indicating inadequate healthcare services and poor living conditions. Option D (Deaths Due to Diarrheal Disease Between 1-5 Years) – Incorrect Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of under-five mortality, especially in communities with poor sanitation, lack of safe drinking water, and inadequate healthcare access. High deaths due to diarrhea indicate deficiencies in child care practices, preventive health measures, and community health interventions, making this a strong indicator of Under-Five Care.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (100) because the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is calculated as the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. • Population = 5000 • Birth rate = 30/1000 population, so the total number of live births = 30/1000 X 5000 = 150 • Infant deaths = 15 (total deaths in the first year of life) To calculate the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), use the formula: IMR = Number of infant deaths / Total live births × 1000 Substituting the values: IMR = 15 / 150 × 1000 = 100 Thus, the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) for this population is 100 per 1000 live births. Incorrect Options: Option B (60) – Incorrect This answer is too low, and it results from using incorrect data or an incorrect calculation. The correct IMR is based on the actual number of infant deaths (15) and the total number of live births (150), leading to a result of 100, not 60. Option C (150) – Incorrect This option overestimates the IMR. To reach a value of 150, the total number of infant deaths would need to be significantly higher relative to the number of live births. The given data results in an IMR of 100, not 150. Option D (45) – Incorrect Again, this is too low and not aligned with the data provided. The correct calculation for IMR yields a value of 100, not 45.",

This week is observed to raise awareness about the importance of breastfeeding for both mothers and babies, promoting the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life. It also encourages support for breastfeeding mothers and aims to educate communities about breastfeeding practices. Incorrect Options: Option A (January) – Incorrect While January is an important month for other health-related observances, World Breastfeeding Week is not celebrated in January. This makes it an incorrect option. Option C (October) – Incorrect October is also a significant month for various health campaigns, such as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but it is not the time for World Breastfeeding Week. The correct month for this event is August. Option D (April) – Incorrect April has its own set of health observances, but World Breastfeeding Week is not one of them.

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Concomitant acute and chronic malnutrition) because a deficit in weight in a 3-year-old child can indicate a combination of both acute and chronic malnutrition. In children, weight deficits often reflect both short-term (acute) malnutrition, which can occur due to recent illness or inadequate food intake, and long-term (chronic) malnutrition, which results from sustained poor nutrition and growth failure over time. A child who is both underweight (acute) and stunted (chronic) shows signs of both types of malnutrition. This is known as concomitant malnutrition, where a child exhibits both weight-for-age deficits (acute) and height-for-age deficits (chronic). Incorrect Options: Option A (Acute Malnutrition) – Incorrect Acute malnutrition typically refers to a recent and severe deficiency in calorie intake or an illness-induced weight loss, leading to a rapid drop in weight. However, a deficit in weight in a 3-year-old child does not always reflect only acute malnutrition. The presence of chronic malnutrition (e.g., stunting) suggests the condition is not solely acute. Option B (Chronic Malnutrition) – Incorrect Chronic malnutrition generally results in stunting (low height for age) over a prolonged period and does not typically manifest solely as a weight deficit in the short term. While stunted growth can be indicative of chronic malnutrition, a weight deficit in a 3-year-old child can signal a combination of both acute and chronic malnutrition, not just chronic alone. Option D (All of These) – Incorrect While it may seem plausible, Option D (All of These) is incorrect because the best description of a weight deficit in this context is concomitant acute and chronic malnutrition. It is not simply acute malnutrition or chronic malnutrition alone.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Haemoglobin > 11 gm%) because a haemoglobin level greater than 11 gm% is considered normal in children, indicating adequate nutrition. Specifically, it suggests that the child is not suffering from iron deficiency anemia, which is a common nutritional issue. In the absence of other signs of poor nutrition, a haemoglobin level above 11 gm% generally rules out anaemia, which is a key indicator of poor nutrition in children. Incorrect Options: Option A (Low Birth Weight) – Incorrect Low birth weight is often a result of poor nutrition during pregnancy, leading to underweight infants who may be more vulnerable to growth and developmental issues. Low birth weight is a significant indicator of poor maternal and child nutrition, and it is associated with increased risks of malnutrition and infections. Option B (Infection) – Incorrect Infections in children, particularly recurrent or severe infections, often stem from poor nutrition, as malnutrition weakens the immune system, making children more susceptible to illnesses. A child's nutritional status directly impacts their ability to fight infections, so frequent or severe infections are often a sign of poor nutrition. Option D (Malnutrition) – Incorrect Malnutrition itself is a direct indicator of poor nutrition. It refers to deficiencies or imbalances in the child’s diet, leading to underweight, stunted growth, or deficiency diseases such as vitamin A deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Malnutrition is one of the most prominent signs of poor nutritional status in children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (Weight for Height) because weight-for-height is the most accurate parameter for assessing acute malnutrition. Acute malnutrition refers to a rapid deterioration in a child's nutritional status due to factors such as insufficient food intake, illness, or infection, which leads to rapid weight loss. The weight-for-height index is used to identify children who are wasted (i.e., have low weight for their height) and is directly related to acute malnutrition. This parameter is particularly useful in identifying severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Incorrect Options: Option A (Weight for Age) – Incorrect Weight for age is a general indicator of a child's nutritional status, but it does not specifically capture acute malnutrition. This measure combines both weight loss and growth stunting, so it may not accurately reflect acute malnutrition in children. Additionally, weight-for-age can be influenced by chronic malnutrition as well, not just acute conditions. Option C (Height for Age) – Incorrect Height for age is primarily used to assess chronic malnutrition, which results in stunted growth over a long period of inadequate nutrition. It does not reflect the recent changes in nutritional status that characterize acute malnutrition, making it inappropriate for detecting acute malnutrition. Option D (Any of the Above) – Incorrect While all the options are useful for assessing various aspects of nutritional status, only weight-for-height specifically measures acute malnutrition. The other parameters, such as weight-for-age and height-for-age, are more useful for assessing general malnutrition or chronic malnutrition, not specifically acute malnutrition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (1-5 years) because mid-arm circumference (MAC) remains relatively constant during the period from 1 to 5 years of age. During this phase, the child’s arm growth tends to stabilize as they move from infancy to early childhood, and the arm circumference does not show significant fluctuations. This makes MAC a reliable indicator of nutritional status during this age group, particularly for identifying wasting or malnutrition. Incorrect Options: Option A (0-6 months) – Incorrect Mid-arm circumference is not constant in the 0-6 months age range because infants experience rapid growth, and their muscle mass and fat stores undergo significant changes during the first months of life. During this period, measurements like weight-for-height or length-for-age are more commonly used to assess nutritional status. Option C (5-10 years) – Incorrect While mid-arm circumference still remains somewhat constant during the 5-10 years period, it does increase gradually as children grow, particularly with changes in muscle development and fat accumulation. It does not remain as stable as during the 1-5 years period, making it less reliable in this range for monitoring acute malnutrition. Option D (10 years) – Incorrect After the age of 10 years, mid-arm circumference will begin to show noticeable changes due to the onset of puberty and the development of muscle mass and fat stores. During this period, the arm circumference will not be constant and will fluctuate based on growth and development.",

He developed this card in the 1960s as part of his work in the Community-based health programs, especially in India. The purpose of the card was to help mothers and community health workers track the growth and development of children and to serve as a tool for early identification of malnutrition. This simple, effective tool became essential in the monitoring of children’s health and helped in promoting better health practices within communities. Incorrect Options: Option A (Edwin Chadwick) – Incorrect Edwin Chadwick was a British social reformer and a pioneer of public health who contributed significantly to the sanitation movement in the 19th century. However, he was not involved in the design of the Road to Health Card or growth charts. His contributions were primarily related to the improvement of public health infrastructure and sanitation, not child growth monitoring. Option C (C. Gopalan) – Incorrect C. Gopalan was a renowned Indian nutritionist who made significant contributions to the field of nutrition and health, particularly in relation to protein-energy malnutrition and nutritional interventions. However, he did not design the Road to Health Card. His work focused on improving nutritional standards in India but was not related to the creation of the growth chart used for health monitoring. Option D (C.E. Winslow) – Incorrect C.E. Winslow was a leading figure in the development of public health in the early 20th century, particularly in the United States. He is known for his work on public health policies and is often associated with the definition of public health. However, he was not involved in the design of the Road to Health Card or growth charts for child health monitoring.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Dental Ailments) because dental problems, including tooth decay and gum disease, are the most common health issues faced by school-aged children worldwide. Poor oral hygiene, high sugar consumption, and lack of regular dental check-ups contribute to the prevalence of these ailments. In many schools, dental problems are often the most frequently reported morbidity due to the widespread nature of tooth decay and the lack of proper preventive care. Incorrect Options: Option B (Worm Infestations) – Incorrect Worm infestations are indeed common, especially in developing countries where access to clean water and sanitation may be limited. However, while worm infestations are a significant public health concern in certain regions, they do not occur as frequently as dental ailments in school children. The general trend shows that dental problems are more prevalent due to factors like diet, hygiene, and lack of preventive care. Option C (Malnutrition) – Incorrect Malnutrition remains a critical issue in many parts of the world, but it is not typically the most common morbidity in school-aged children. Although malnutrition can affect growth and development, its direct and visible effects are not as immediately common in school settings compared to dental problems. Efforts to address malnutrition are ongoing in many regions, but dental ailments remain the leading issue for children. Option D (Skin Disease) – Incorrect Skin diseases, such as fungal infections or eczema, are certainly common in schools, but they are not as widespread as dental ailments. While skin problems can be a cause of concern, particularly in areas with poor sanitation, dental problems still surpass them in terms of frequency and visibility in children’s health reports from schools.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (Mother to initiate breastfeeding within 2 hours of normal delivery) because, according to the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) guidelines, while the early initiation of breastfeeding is strongly encouraged, it does not specifically require that it be done within 2 hours of normal delivery. The BFHI focuses on promoting exclusive breastfeeding and ensuring that mothers and babies are given the necessary support for establishing breastfeeding successfully. However, the exact timing for initiating breastfeeding can vary slightly based on individual circumstances. Incorrect Options: Option A (Mothers and infant to be together for 24 hours a day) – Incorrect This is correct according to BFHI guidelines. One of the key principles of the initiative is rooming-in, which encourages that the mother and infant be together at all times, promoting early and frequent breastfeeding, as well as bonding. Keeping mothers and infants together helps with effective breastfeeding and supports the baby's emotional and nutritional needs. Option C (Giving newborn infants no food or drink other than breast milk) – Incorrect This is also correct according to BFHI guidelines. The initiative emphasizes that exclusive breastfeeding should be practiced, meaning that newborn infants should receive only breast milk, and no other food or drink (including formula or water), for the first 6 months of life. This guideline is in line with global recommendations to ensure optimal infant health and development. Option D (Encouraging breastfeeding on demand) – Incorrect This is a key principle of the BFHI guidelines. Breastfeeding on demand, which means feeding the infant whenever they show signs of hunger, is encouraged. This practice supports the establishment of successful breastfeeding and ensures that the baby receives adequate nutrition while fostering a strong mother-baby bond.",

The ICDS program is a comprehensive initiative aimed at improving the nutritional and health status of children under six years of age, as well as pregnant and lactating mothers. This ministry is in charge of implementing policies, monitoring the programs, and coordinating the various services provided under ICDS, which include nutrition supplementation, immunization, health check-ups, and early childhood education. Incorrect Options: Option A (Ministry for Human Resource Development) – Incorrect The Ministry for Human Resource Development (MHRD) is primarily responsible for education policies and initiatives related to school education and higher education in India. While MHRD may intersect with ICDS through early childhood education in some cases, it is not the nodal ministry for child development and welfare. The Ministry of Women and Child Development oversees these areas. Option B (Ministry for Rural Development) – Incorrect The Ministry for Rural Development focuses on rural development and poverty alleviation programs. While it works closely with various child welfare initiatives, its primary responsibilities are related to infrastructure development, employment generation, and poverty alleviation in rural areas. The ICDS, however, is managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry for Rural Development. Option C (Ministry for Health and Family Welfare) – Incorrect The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare plays a key role in healthcare services, including maternal and child health, but it is not the nodal ministry for the Integrated Child Development Services. While this ministry collaborates with the ICDS program in areas such as immunization and health check-ups, the overall coordination and administration of ICDS are under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (Neonatal Tetanus) because the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy focuses on preventing and managing common childhood illnesses such as malaria, malnutrition, and otitis media, but it does not specifically address neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is a preventable condition that primarily results from unsanitary delivery practices and lack of immunization, and while it is a critical issue in maternal and child health, it is not directly managed through the IMCI approach, which is more focused on immediate childhood illnesses. Incorrect Options: Option A (Malaria) – Incorrect Malaria is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among children in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The IMCI strategy includes guidelines for managing malaria through early detection, appropriate treatment, and preventive measures like insecticide-treated nets. Therefore, malaria is included in the IMCI framework. Option B (Malnutrition) – Incorrect Malnutrition is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, contributing to stunted growth, immunocompromised states, and increased susceptibility to infections. The IMCI strategy incorporates nutritional assessments and interventions to improve the nutritional status of children, focusing on breastfeeding, vitamin supplementation, and growth monitoring. Hence, malnutrition is included in the IMCI approach. Option C (Otitis Media) – Incorrect Otitis media (middle ear infection) is a common childhood illness that can lead to hearing loss and complications if not treated appropriately. The IMCI strategy provides guidelines for managing otitis media, including antibiotics for bacterial infections and pain management. Thus, otitis media is an included condition in the IMCI framework.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (Anganwadi) because the Anganwadi is considered the \"heart\" of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) system. Anganwadi workers are the frontline workers who deliver the ICDS services at the grassroots level, providing essential services such as early childhood education, nutrition, health check-ups, immunization, and prevention of malnutrition. The success of the ICDS program heavily depends on the effectiveness of the Anganwadi centers, which serve as the primary point of contact for children and mothers in rural and underserved areas. Incorrect Options: Option A (Mother and Children) – Incorrect While mothers and children are the central beneficiaries of the ICDS program, they are not considered the \"heart\" of the system. The heart of the ICDS system refers to the key infrastructure or personnel that drive the delivery of services. While mothers and children benefit from ICDS services, they are not the core operational units within the system. Option B (CDPO) – Incorrect The Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) is an important supervisory role within the ICDS system. They oversee the operations of Anganwadi centers and monitor the implementation of the ICDS program in a specific geographic area. While the CDPO plays a crucial role in the administration and coordination of the program, they are not the \"heart\" of the ICDS system. The Anganwadi is the key functional unit that delivers services directly to the community. Option C (Primary Health Centre) – Incorrect The Primary Health Centre (PHC) is an important health facility that provides basic medical care to rural populations. While the PHC may collaborate with ICDS for health-related services such as immunization and maternal care, it is not considered the \"heart\" of the ICDS system. The Anganwadi centers are the core units delivering the community-based services of the ICDS program.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (USA) because the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative (MFCI) was launched in the USA. This initiative was introduced in 1996 by the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services (CIMS) to promote mother-friendly and baby-friendly birthing practices. The MFCI aims to ensure that women have a respectful and supportive birth experience, focusing on improving maternity care by emphasizing birth practices that encourage freedom of movement, minimal intervention, and support for women’s choices during childbirth. Incorrect Options: Option A (India) – Incorrect While India has implemented various maternity care programs and initiatives, including the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) and the Mother and Child Health (MCH) programs, the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative was not launched in India. India’s maternity care efforts are focused on reducing maternal and infant mortality and improving accessibility to care, but this specific initiative originated in the USA. Option B (Britain) – Incorrect Britain has implemented programs to improve maternal care, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for maternity services, which emphasize safe and respectful care. However, the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative was not launched in Britain. The focus in the UK has been more on standardized guidelines for maternity services rather than an initiative specifically named \"Mother-Friendly.\" Option C (Australia) – Incorrect Australia has made significant strides in improving maternity care, with initiatives like the Australian College of Midwives promoting midwifery-led care and choice-based birthing practices. However, the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative originated in the USA, not Australia. While Australia supports woman-centered birth care, the MFCI was not launched there.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (6) because the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program includes children up to the age of 6 years. The ICDS program aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children from 0 to 6 years, as well as pregnant and lactating women. The services provided by ICDS, such as nutrition supplementation, immunization, health check-ups, and early childhood education, are targeted to children in this age group to support their growth and development during the critical early years of life. Incorrect Options: Option A (3) – Incorrect The ICDS program does not limit its services to children up to the age of 3 years. Although children between the ages of 0 and 3 years are a key target group due to their nutritional and developmental needs, the ICDS services extend to children up to 6 years to ensure proper development, education, and health care. Option B (5) – Incorrect While the age of 5 years is often mentioned in child development contexts, the ICDS program provides services to children up to 6 years, not just 5 years. This ensures that children receive essential nutrition and early childhood education until they are ready for formal schooling, typically around the age of 6. Option D (14) – Incorrect The ICDS program focuses specifically on children under 6 years and pregnant and lactating women. It does not extend services to children up to the age of 14 years. Services beyond 6 years, particularly related to school education and adolescent health, are addressed by other programs and ministries, such as the Ministry of Education and the National Adolescent Health Program.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Covers population of 5000) because this statement is incorrect. The Anganwadi worker does not necessarily cover a population of 5000. In rural and urban areas, each Anganwadi center typically serves a smaller population, ranging from about 500 to 1500 people, depending on the density and need of the area. The number of people covered by an Anganwadi worker is not fixed at 5000, and varies based on the local conditions and needs. Incorrect Options: Option B (Part-time workers) – Incorrect Anganwadi workers are part-time workers. While their duties are vital, they typically work for a few hours a day depending on the needs of the community and the specific program being implemented (e.g., nutrition delivery, immunization programs, childcare, and pre-school education). This makes them part-time workers in comparison to full-time employees. Option C (Supply nutrition, educate for vaccination) – Incorrect Anganwadi workers are responsible for providing nutrition to children and educating mothers about vaccination, sanitation, and healthcare. They play a crucial role in the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program by distributing nutritional supplements (e.g., Take Home Ration or Hot Cooked Meals) and by educating the community about the importance of immunization and health practices. This responsibility is a core function of Anganwadi workers. Option D (Under controls of Women and Child Development – Incorrect) Anganwadi workers come under the control of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD). This ministry is responsible for overseeing the ICDS program, which is implemented at the ground level through the Anganwadi centers. The ministry ensures that workers are adequately trained, and that services like early childhood education, healthcare, and nutrition are provided to communities.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Prevention of iodine deficiency disorders) because iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) are not specifically covered under the scope of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS). While iodine deficiency is a critical public health issue and is addressed through other programs (such as salt iodization programs), the ICDS program focuses primarily on nutrition, health education, immunization, and early childhood education rather than targeting iodine deficiency specifically. Incorrect Options: Option A (Immunization) – Incorrect Immunization is a key component of the ICDS program. The program actively works to ensure that children and pregnant women receive essential vaccinations, aiming to reduce morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases. Anganwadi workers play a significant role in promoting immunization and tracking vaccination schedules in the community. Option B (Health Education) – Incorrect Health education is an integral part of the ICDS program. Anganwadi workers provide health education to mothers, families, and communities, focusing on important topics such as childcare, hygiene, sanitation, and preventive healthcare. The goal is to raise awareness about basic health practices to improve the overall well-being of children and mothers. Option D (Supplementary nutrition) – Incorrect Supplementary nutrition is a critical aspect of the ICDS program. One of the main objectives of ICDS is to provide nutritional support to children and pregnant/lactating women to combat malnutrition. Anganwadi centers provide nutritious meals or supplements to children under 6 years of age, as well as to pregnant women and lactating mothers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Two months) because, according to the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) program, the term \"young infants\" refers to infants who are under the age of 2 months. The IMNCI program specifically focuses on the first two months of life as this period is critical for monitoring and addressing various health issues that can arise during infancy, including newborn infections, malnutrition, and breastfeeding practices. Incorrect Options: Option A (Seven days) – Incorrect The term \"young infants\" refers to infants under 2 months, not just 7 days. The first week of life is considered a very important period in terms of neonatal care, but \"young infants\" as defined by IMNCI covers a broader age range of 0 to 2 months. Option B (28 days) – Incorrect While 28 days is commonly used as a reference for the neonatal period, which is the first month of life, the IMNCI specifically uses the term \"young infants\" to refer to children up to 2 months of age. The 28-day period is part of this, but it is not the age limit used for \"young infants\" in IMNCI. Option D (Six months) – Incorrect Six months refers to the age at which complementary feeding is generally introduced and not to the age group that the IMNCI considers as \"young infants.\" In the context of IMNCI, six months would fall into the category of older infants or children, not \"young infants.\"",

This statement is incorrect because the tool shown in the image likely refers to the Road to Health Chart, which is based on z-scores (standard deviations) rather than percentiles. The World Health Organization (WHO) and many national growth monitoring programs use z-scores to assess malnutrition and deviations in child growth. Z-scores provide a more precise and standardized method for comparing a child's growth status to a reference population, making them preferable to percentiles in clinical and research settings. Correct Answer (C) (A) It was developed by David Morley David Morley, a British pediatrician, developed the Road to Health Chart in the 1960s as a simple, effective tool for tracking child growth, particularly in resource-limited settings. His work emphasized community-based healthcare and growth monitoring to prevent malnutrition and improve child survival. (B) On x-axis age of the child is taken and on y-axis weight of the child Growth monitoring charts, including the Road to Health Chart, typically plot age on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis to track a child’s growth trajectory over time. This format allows easy comparison with standard growth curves and helps healthcare workers detect malnutrition or faltering growth. (D) It is a tool for teaching and action regarding child’s growth The Road to Health Chart is not just for recording data but is also an educational and intervention tool. It helps parents and healthcare workers identify malnutrition early, promotes appropriate feeding practices, and guides actions such as nutritional supplementation or medical intervention if needed.",

The Five Cleans recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other maternal health guidelines focus on reducing infection risks during childbirth and include: Clean Hands – Ensuring that the birth attendant washes hands with soap and water and wears gloves. Clean Delivery Surface – Using a clean rubber or plastic sheet to prevent contamination. Clean Cord Care – Using a sterile blade to cut the umbilical cord and keeping it clean. Clean Cutting Instrument – A sterilized or new blade/scissors for cutting the cord. Clean Perineum – Cleaning the mother’s perineal area to reduce infection risk. Incorrect Options: (A) Clean Delivery Surface (rubber/plastic sheet) A clean delivery surface helps prevent infections by reducing contact with contaminated materials, ensuring the baby is delivered in a hygienic environment. (B) Clean Hands (soap and gloves) Hand hygiene is crucial in preventing infections during childbirth. Washing hands with soap and using sterile gloves minimizes the risk of introducing harmful bacteria.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Weight < 55 kgs because a weight below 55 kg alone is not considered a standard criterion for high-risk pregnancy. While low maternal weight may indicate nutritional concerns, the commonly used threshold for identifying risk is maternal weight below 40–45 kg rather than 55 kg. A woman weighing less than 55 kg can still have a healthy pregnancy if she has good overall health, proper nutrition, and no other risk factors. Incorrect Options: (B) Height < 145 cm A maternal height of less than 145 cm is a recognized high-risk pregnancy factor because it is associated with cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), which can lead to complications during labor, including obstructed labor and the need for cesarean delivery. (C) Severe Anemia Severe anemia (Hemoglobin <7 g/dL) is a significant high-risk pregnancy factor as it increases the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and maternal mortality. Proper management with iron and folic acid supplementation is essential to prevent complications. (D) Previous LSCS (Lower Segment Cesarean Section) A previous LSCS (Cesarean Section) classifies a pregnancy as high-risk because of the increased risk of uterine rupture, placenta previa, placenta accreta, and complications during labor. Women with a prior C-section require careful monitoring, and the mode of delivery (VBAC vs. repeat C-section) is decided based on individual risk assessment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Majority of areola is outside the mouth because a good latch (attachment) requires that more of the areola, especially the lower part, is inside the baby's mouth. If most of the areola is visible, it suggests a shallow latch, which can lead to ineffective milk transfer and nipple pain for the mother. In a proper latch, the baby takes in a deep portion of the breast tissue, allowing for efficient milk removal and comfortable feeding. Incorrect Options: (B) Baby’s lower lip everted – Correct A flanged or everted lower lip is a sign of good attachment, as it helps create a secure seal around the breast. If the lip is turned inward, it may indicate a poor latch, leading to discomfort and inadequate milk intake. (C) Baby’s chin touching the breast – Correct The baby’s chin should be pressed against the breast during feeding, ensuring a deep latch. This position allows the baby to use their jaw effectively for sucking and milk extraction. (D) Baby’s mouth wide open – Correct A wide-open mouth is essential for a proper latch, ensuring that the baby takes in a significant portion of the areola rather than just the nipple. A small mouth opening can lead to a shallow latch, making breastfeeding ineffective and painful for the mother.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) (Numerator is 4000 and denominator is 1,00,000). Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths per 1,00,000 women of reproductive age in a given time period. Maternal deaths include deaths occurring due to pregnancy-related causes, such as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and postpartum sepsis, but exclude deaths due to accidental or incidental causes like accidents and suicides. In the given data, total maternal deaths = 4500. However, accidental deaths (250) and suicides (250) are not considered maternal deaths, since they are not directly related to pregnancy. Thus, actual maternal deaths = 4500 - (250 + 250) = 4000. The denominator for Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is the total number of women in the reproductive age group, which is 1,00,000. Therefore, MMR = (4000 / 1,00,000) × 100,000 = 4000 per 1,00,000 women of reproductive age, making option C the correct choice. Incorrect Options: Option A: Numerator is 4500 and denominator is 1,00,000 – Incorrect The numerator includes all 4500 deaths, but not all of them are due to maternal causes. Since accidental and suicide deaths (500 total) are not maternal deaths, the numerator should be 4000, not 4500. Option B: Numerator is 4500 and denominator is 40,000 – Incorrect The numerator again incorrectly includes all 4500 deaths, whereas only 4000 are maternal deaths. The denominator (40,000) is the number of live births, which is used to calculate Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR ratio), not the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR rate). MMR rate uses the total reproductive-age women (1,00,000) as the denominator, not live births. Option D: Numerator is 4000 and denominator is 40,000 – Incorrect The numerator is correct (4000 maternal deaths). However, the denominator (40,000 live births) is incorrect because it is used for Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR ratio), not MMR rate. The correct denominator for Maternal Mortality Rate is the total reproductive-age women (1,00,000), not the number of live births.",
