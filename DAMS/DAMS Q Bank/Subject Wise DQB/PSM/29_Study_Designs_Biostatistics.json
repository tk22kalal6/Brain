      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) No new case reported for twice the incubation period of disease since the last case. When an area is declared free of an epidemic, it means that the disease has been effectively controlled and no new cases have appeared for a specific duration. The standard practice is to wait for twice the incubation period of the disease after the last reported case to ensure that any remaining cases have had time to manifest. This ensures that any hidden cases or delayed onset of symptoms are accounted for before declaring the epidemic over. Incorrect Options: A. Till last secondary case recovers: This is incorrect because waiting for the recovery of the last secondary case does not guarantee that no new cases will arise. The disease could still be transmitted, and the focus should be on the absence of new cases for a specified period after the last known case, not the recovery of an individual. B. No new case reported for the incubation period of disease since the last case: This is incorrect because declaring an area free of an epidemic based on the incubation period alone may not be sufficient. Some diseases have long or variable incubation periods, so waiting for only one cycle of incubation may not fully account for all possible new cases. Twice the incubation period is more reliable for ensuring the epidemic has truly ended. D. No new case reported for six months since the last case: This is incorrect because six months is an arbitrary time frame that may not fit the specifics of every disease. Different diseases have different incubation periods, and using a fixed duration like six months does not take the disease’s incubation period into account, making it less accurate than the \"twice the incubation period\" standard.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Confirmation of existence of an epidemic. The initial most step in the investigation of an epidemic is to confirm the existence of the epidemic. Before any further steps can be taken, it is essential to verify whether an outbreak is truly occurring or if the reported cases are due to some other factors (e.g., misdiagnosis, natural fluctuations in disease occurrence). This step involves determining if the number of cases exceeds the expected level for a given time and place, and whether the disease is spreading within a community. Incorrect Options: A. Defining the population at risk: This is an important step, but it comes after confirming the existence of an epidemic. Once the epidemic is confirmed, the next logical step is to identify the population at risk in order to prioritize interventions and target those most likely to be affected. C. Verification of diagnosis: This is also crucial but typically follows the confirmation of an epidemic. After confirming an outbreak, the next step would involve ensuring that the cases are correctly diagnosed, as misdiagnosis could lead to erroneous conclusions about the nature and scope of the epidemic. D. Rapid search for all cases and their characteristics: While searching for all cases and identifying their characteristics is critical for understanding the spread and risk factors, this step comes after confirming the epidemic's existence. The search for cases helps in mapping the scope and determining the affected population.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Elimination of disease. Elimination of disease refers to the reduction of a disease's incidence to zero in a specific geographic area as a result of deliberate efforts. However, this does not mean that the causative agent of the disease has been eradicated, only that the disease itself no longer occurs in that area. The disease can still be present in other regions, but it is no longer causing cases in the area where it has been eliminated. Incorrect Options: B. Eradication of disease: Eradication refers to the complete and permanent worldwide reduction to zero of the incidence of a specific disease, such that the disease no longer exists anywhere on Earth. Eradication is a more global and permanent concept than elimination, which is restricted to a specific area. C. Elimination of infection: Elimination of infection refers to the absence of infection (the causative agent) in a population, which may or may not result in the elimination of the disease. It's about the agent's presence, not just the disease. D. Eradication of infection: Eradication of infection refers to the complete removal of the causative agent (infection) from the global population. This is a higher standard than elimination, which only aims to eliminate disease in a specific area, not the infection itself globally.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 90. Secondary attack rate (SAR) refers to the probability of infection occurring among susceptible individuals within a specific group (such as a household or school) after exposure to a primary case. Chickenpox (varicella) is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and its secondary attack rate is approximately 85-90% among susceptible household contacts. This means that if an infected individual is in close contact with susceptible people, almost 90% of them will contract the disease. Incorrect Options: A. 60 – Incorrect While chickenpox is highly contagious, the secondary attack rate is much higher than 60%, particularly in close-contact settings like households. B. 50 – Incorrect A secondary attack rate of 50% is too low for chickenpox. Diseases with moderate contagiousness, such as influenza, may have SARs around this level, but chickenpox is much more infectious. D. 40 – Incorrect This is too low for chickenpox. Such a SAR might be seen in diseases that are less contagious or require prolonged close contact.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most reliable indicator of a decrease in the tuberculosis problem in a community is a decrease in the incidence of infection, also known as the annual risk of tuberculosis infection (ARTI). This parameter measures how many new individuals are getting infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a given year. If fewer people are acquiring infection, it means transmission in the community is falling, reflecting better control of the TB problem. Hence, decline in incidence of infection is considered the most sensitive and primary indicator of improvement in TB control at the population level. Incorrect Options: B. Prevalence of infection – This reflects the total number of people already infected with TB in the population. Since tuberculin positivity persists for years, prevalence decreases very slowly and is not a sensitive marker for short-term trends. C. Incidence of disease – This measures the number of new TB disease cases per year. While useful for program monitoring, it depends not only on transmission but also on host factors (like immunity, HIV, malnutrition), so it is less precise as a direct indicator of TB control. D. Prevalence of disease – This indicates the total number of existing TB patients in the population. It is influenced by detection and treatment duration. Prevalence may fall if patients die or are cured quickly, even if transmission continues, so it is not the best indicator of overall TB problem reduction.",

Population at risk = 16,500 (the population of the village). We multiply the result by 100,000 to express the rate per 100,000 population. Calculation: Incidence rate=(22/16500) x 100000 Incidence rate=0.0013333 × 100000=133.33 So, the incidence rate is approximately 133 per 100,000",

Enhanced knowledge and awareness: While important for public health, McKeown's theory does not focus on awareness as the primary factor in reducing TB prevalence. B. Medical advancement: Although medical advancements, such as the development of antibiotics, contributed to controlling TB, McKeown's theory attributes a larger role to social factors than to medical technology alone.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) In the case of a lactating woman with sputum-positive tuberculosis (TB) and a neonate child, the child is at risk of contracting TB due to exposure from the mother. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended to prevent the development of active tuberculosis in the infant. The recommended chemoprophylaxis for neonates who have been exposed to a sputum-positive TB case is Isoniazid (INH). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other tuberculosis control guidelines, the appropriate dose of INH for TB chemoprophylaxis in neonates and infants under the age of 6 months is 10 mg/kg for 6 months.

Incorrect Options: A. INH 5 mg/kg for 3 months: This dose is too low, and the duration is insufficient for effective TB prevention. B. INH 10 mg/kg for 3 months: While the dose is correct, the duration should be 6 months, not 3 months, for effective prophylaxis. C.
