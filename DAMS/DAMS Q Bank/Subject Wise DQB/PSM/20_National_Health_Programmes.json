      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 2(HRZE) + 4(HRE) The recommended treatment regimen for drug-sensitive, previously treated tuberculosis (TB) follows the guidelines set by the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) in India and WHO recommendations. HRZE stands for Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), and Ethambutol (E). HRE stands for Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), and Ethambutol (E). The standard regimen for previously treated drug-sensitive TB is: 2 months of intensive phase (HRZE) + 4 months of continuation phase (HRE). This regimen is effective, short-course, and helps prevent the development of resistance. Incorrect Options: (B) 2 (HRSZE) + 1 (HRZE) + 5 (HRE) (Incorrect): This regimen includes Streptomycin (S), which is not recommended for drug-sensitive TB anymore. Also, the continuation phase should be 4 months, not 5 months. (C) 3 (HRZE) + (HRZE) + 2 (HRE) + 4 (HR) (Incorrect): This regimen overextends the intensive phase, which is not required for drug-sensitive TB. The correct protocol is 2 months of HRZE, not 3 months. The continuation phase should include HRE, but this option also includes HR for 4 months, which is not a standard recommendation. (D) 3(HRSZE) + 1 (HRZE) + 6(HRE) (Incorrect): This regimen again includes Streptomycin (S), which is not part of the current standard treatment for drug-sensitive TB. The intensive phase is too long (3 months instead of 2 months), which is unnecessary for drug-sensitive TB. The continuation phase is 6 months instead of 4 months, which is longer than the recommended regimen.",

This labeling system helps in proper identification, transport, and tracking of the samples in the laboratory. Incorrect Options: (A) Alpha & Beta (Incorrect): The RNTCP does not use Greek letters for labeling sputum samples. Standard practice is to label the containers as A and B to maintain uniformity across TB testing centers. (B) 1 & 2 (Incorrect): While numbering is a logical approach, RNTCP guidelines specifically use the labels A and B for clarity and consistency. Using numbers instead of letters could lead to misidentification in some settings. (D) Y & Z (Incorrect): The labels Y and Z are not used under the RNTCP/NTEP system.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) He is declared a sputum smear-positive case and started with DOTS drug-sensitive new case. According to the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), now under National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP), the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is based on sputum smear microscopy results. If a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of TB, at least two sputum samples (one on-the-spot and one early morning) are tested for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB). If one out of two sputum smears is positive, the patient is considered a sputum smear-positive case and immediately started on treatment under the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course) regimen for drug-sensitive TB. Since TB is a public health concern, early diagnosis and treatment initiation are crucial to prevent further transmission. Incorrect Options: (B) He is declared a sputum smear-negative case (Incorrect): A sputum smear-negative case is one where both sputum samples are negative, but the patient has persistent symptoms. In this case, since one sample is positive, he is classified as sputum smear-positive, and not smear-negative. (C) He will undergo sputum smear examinations after 12 months again (Incorrect): Delaying diagnosis and treatment for 12 months would lead to disease progression and increased transmission. Instead, TB treatment should be initiated immediately upon confirmation of smear-positive status. (D) Drug-resistant TB (Incorrect): Drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB or XDR-TB) is diagnosed based on GeneXpert, Line Probe Assay (LPA), or Culture & Drug Sensitivity Testing (DST). A single positive sputum smear does not confirm drug resistance. The patient is classified as having drug-sensitive TB unless further testing indicates resistance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 2 & 6 months Under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), now integrated into the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP), the sputum examination schedule for drug-sensitive new pulmonary TB patients is conducted at 2 months (end of intensive phase) and 6 months (end of treatment). At 2 months (End of Intensive Phase - IP): A sputum smear examination is done to assess response to treatment. If the sputum is still positive, an extended intensive phase may be considered. At 6 months (End of Continuation Phase - CP): A final sputum examination is conducted to confirm treatment completion and cure. If the patient remains positive, further evaluation for drug resistance (MDR-TB/XDR-TB) is required. This schedule ensures that treatment is monitored effectively and that the patient is responding well to anti-TB therapy. Incorrect Options: (A) 2, 3, and 5 months (Incorrect): The standard protocol does not include sputum testing at 3 and 5 months for drug-sensitive TB. The key check points are 2 months and 6 months. (C) 1, 3, and 5 months (Incorrect): Sputum testing at 1 month is unnecessary, as it does not significantly change management. Testing at 3 and 5 months is also not part of the standard protocol for new drug-sensitive TB cases. (D) 2, 5, and 7 months (Incorrect): Sputum testing at 5 and 7 months is not standard practice for monitoring new drug-sensitive TB cases. Testing at 6 months (not 7 months) is the correct approach to confirm cure and treatment completion.",

According to RNTCP/NTEP guidelines, this patient would still be categorized as a new case because: New case: A patient who has not been previously treated for TB or has received treatment for less than 1 month. Since the patient discontinued treatment early, it is not considered a previously treated case, and he is still treated as a drug-sensitive new case. The patient is sputum positive, which indicates that he still has active tuberculosis, and he will be started on DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course) with the standard drug regimen for drug-sensitive TB. Incorrect Options: (B) As drug-sensitive previously treated (Incorrect): The patient is considered new because he has not completed the full 1-month treatment course. A previously treated case refers to someone who has received TB treatment for 1 month or more but has either been relapsed or experienced treatment failure. (C) As drug-resistant (Incorrect): There is no indication from the information provided that this patient has drug-resistant TB. The patient is receiving RHZE (which is for drug-sensitive TB), and there is no mention of drug resistance tests or signs of treatment failure. (D) Investigate again (Incorrect): While it is important to confirm the diagnosis, the patient has already been diagnosed as sputum-positive and is likely to have TB. Further investigation is not necessary unless there is suspicion of drug-resistant TB, but based on the information provided, the treatment should proceed as drug-sensitive TB.",

These practices focus on safe handling of sputum, regular medication intake, and communication with healthcare providers. Dispose sputum safely: Sputum is the primary vehicle for TB transmission. The patient must dispose of sputum properly to prevent infecting others. This includes using a covered container and discarding it in a safe manner, such as through incineration or proper waste disposal systems. Collect drugs regularly: Adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen is crucial for the effective treatment of TB. The patient is expected to collect their medication from a healthcare facility, ensuring they continue the treatment without interruption. Report to PHC if new symptoms arise: If any new symptoms develop, such as worsening cough, fever, or side effects from the medication, the patient must report to the Primary Health Centre (PHC). This allows for early detection of complications or issues with treatment. Incorrect Options: (A) Dispose sputum safely (Correct): Proper disposal of sputum is essential to avoid the spread of TB. The patient should follow this practice to minimize the risk of infecting others in their household or community. (C) Collect drugs regularly (Correct): Regular drug collection ensures the patient adheres to their treatment regimen, which is critical for cure and preventing drug resistance. This practice is a standard requirement in the TB treatment process. (D) Report to PHC if new symptoms arise (Correct): Reporting to the PHC when new symptoms emerge helps the healthcare team monitor treatment effectiveness and address any complications, including potential drug side effects or treatment failure.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) All children between 0-5 years of age on a single day irrespective of their previous immunization status Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI) is a key part of the global strategy to eradicate polio. It involves the administration of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to all children under the age of 5 years, regardless of their previous immunization status. The goal is to boost immunity and prevent any missed cases of polio in the population. Pulse polio campaigns are carried out on specific days, targeting all children in this age group, even if they have already received the vaccine in the past. This approach helps ensure widespread immunity across all children and reduces the chances of the virus circulating in the community. Incorrect Options: (B) Children in the age group 0-1 year only who have not been immunized (Incorrect): Pulse polio is not limited to children aged 0-1 year or those who have not been immunized. It targets all children aged 0-5 years, regardless of prior vaccination status. Limiting it only to children in this age group would not provide sufficient protection to the broader population. (C) Children in the age group of 12-24 months only as the booster dose (Incorrect): Pulse polio immunization is not a booster dose for children aged 12-24 months. The objective is to administer OPV to all children under 5 years to ensure universal immunity, not just as a booster for a specific group. (D) All children between 0-5 years of age, wherever there is an outbreak (Incorrect): While it is crucial to provide pulse polio immunization during an outbreak, the program is not limited to outbreak situations. Pulse polio campaigns are conducted regularly, nationwide, to prevent polio transmission, not just in response to outbreaks.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 60 days In the context of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance, residual paralysis is assessed after 60 days to help determine whether the paralysis is due to polio or another cause. The 60-day evaluation is a standard protocol used to differentiate between polio and other causes of paralysis. After 60 days, if the patient still has residual paralysis, it is more likely to be due to a condition other than polio, such as a non-polio enterovirus. This assessment helps in ensuring that cases of polio are identified and monitored appropriately as part of the global effort to eradicate polio. Incorrect Options: (A) 30 days (Incorrect): A 30-day evaluation would be too early to determine if paralysis is residual or not. The assessment needs to be done after 60 days, as acute paralysis can sometimes improve within a month but may still leave lasting effects. Therefore, 30 days is not sufficient to establish whether paralysis is residual. (C) 90 days (Incorrect): While a 90-day evaluation could potentially show residual effects, the standard protocol is to perform the evaluation after 60 days, which is the established timeframe for the residual paralysis assessment in AFP surveillance. (D) 120 days (Incorrect): A 120-day evaluation is unnecessary and longer than required. The 60-day period is the standard used to determine if there is residual paralysis due to polio or another condition. Any evaluation at this stage would not provide additional clinical benefit in the context of polio surveillance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) To confirm year of onset of illness Line listing of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) is an essential part of surveillance to ensure thorough monitoring and identification of polio cases. The purpose of line listing is to systematically document each case of AFP and track specific data points to ensure no cases are overlooked and to better understand trends in the disease's spread. The line listing is not used specifically for confirming the year of onset of illness, but rather for organizing and analyzing important epidemiological data. Incorrect Options: (A) To check for duplication (Correct): Line listing helps in identifying duplicate cases by comparing case details. This ensures accurate data collection and avoids the possibility of counting the same case more than once. This is a critical part of surveillance to maintain the integrity of the data. (B) To document high risk groups (Correct): One of the primary goals of line listing is to document high-risk groups affected by AFP. This helps in identifying populations that may require additional intervention or surveillance, such as those living in areas with poor healthcare access or communities with low vaccination coverage. (D) To identify high-risk population (Correct): Line listing is used to identify high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to developing AFP or polio. This could include children under five years, those in areas with lower immunization rates, or regions experiencing outbreaks. Understanding these groups helps tailor health interventions more effectively.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) All cases of AFP should be reported irrespective of diagnosis within 6 months of onset In the National Polio Eradication Programme, specific guidelines are followed for the surveillance of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) to help detect polio cases and ensure no cases go undiagnosed. However, the statement that all cases of AFP should be reported irrespective of diagnosis within 6 months of onset is incorrect. While it is critical to report all suspected AFP cases, the key focus is on reporting within a shorter timeframe, generally within 30 days of onset, not 6 months. After this period, the likelihood of identifying polio-related cases decreases significantly, and follow-up guidelines differ. Incorrect Options: (A) Acute flaccid paralysis in a child <15 years of age (Correct): The surveillance for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) specifically targets children under 15 years of age because polio primarily affects young children. This age group is the focus of active polio monitoring. (C) Two specimens collected within 14 days of paralysis (Correct): In the National Polio Eradication Programme, two stool specimens are collected from the patient within 14 days of paralysis onset for laboratory testing. This is necessary to confirm whether the paralysis is caused by polio and to help with effective surveillance. (D) 60 days follow-up examination (Correct): After the initial diagnosis, residual paralysis is examined 60 days after the onset. This follow-up helps to determine if the paralysis is likely due to polio or another cause. A prolonged paralysis could indicate polio infection if residual symptoms persist after 60 days.",

The DLHS is specifically designed to collect such community-level data, and it is regularly used for monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of health programs, including immunization campaigns. Incorrect Options: (A) Census data (Incorrect): While the Census provides detailed demographic data about the population (e.g., age, sex, and geographic distribution), it does not focus specifically on health indicators like immunization rates. Census data typically doesn’t track trends in health-related topics such as immunization. (B) Rural survey (Incorrect): Although a Rural Survey can provide insights into the health situation in rural areas, it is not the primary source for detailed, recent immunization data. Rural surveys may capture some health data but often do not provide the comprehensive immunization trends that DLHS does.

Screening for Hemoglobin helps in identifying anemia in pregnant women, which is a common condition that can lead to complications for both the mother and the baby, such as premature birth, low birth weight, and maternal mortality. Early detection and management of anemia through iron supplementation or other interventions are vital for improving maternal and fetal health outcomes. Incorrect Options: (B) Rh (Incorrect): Rh factor screening is important in some cases, especially in detecting Rh incompatibility (which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn), but it is not routinely performed as a primary screening test at the subcenter level. Rh testing is more often done in the context of specific risk factors or clinical indications. (C) TSH (Incorrect): Screening for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels is important for identifying thyroid disorders like hypothyroidism during pregnancy, but it is typically done in higher health facilities (like PHCs, CHCs, or district hospitals) rather than at the subcenter level. (D) Urinary analysis for UTI (Incorrect): While urinary analysis for UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) may be performed during antenatal visits, it is not typically a primary screening test at the subcenter level.

(B) There is one ASHA worker per 800 population (Correct): The norm for the number of ASHAs in a community is one ASHA worker per 800 people. This ensures that there is sufficient coverage for health promotion activities and support in rural and urban areas. (C) ASHA is not a skilled birth attendant (Correct): While ASHA workers are involved in maternal health care, they are not skilled birth attendants. Skilled birth attendants are typically trained nurses or doctors who assist during delivery. ASHAs help by providing support and encouraging women to give birth in health facilities, but they do not perform medical procedures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Village level Under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), the lowest level at which a health action plan is prepared is at the village level. This plan is developed to address the specific health needs of the local community. It is based on the assessment of health priorities and resources in the village, and it aligns with broader health objectives at the district, state, and national levels. This community-driven approach ensures that health services are tailored to the local population's needs. Incorrect Options: (A) State level (Incorrect): The state level plays a crucial role in the overall coordination and implementation of health policies and programs. However, the health action plan under NRHM is not developed at the state level but at more localized levels, like the village or district levels. (B) District level (Incorrect): While the district level also prepares health action plans and is important for coordination, the village level is the most localized and grassroots level at which health action plans are made in the NRHM. The district-level plans are often based on inputs from the village-level plans. (C) Sub centre level (Incorrect): Sub-centres are the first point of contact for rural health services, but health action plans are not specifically prepared at the sub-centre level. Rather, the village-level health plan, developed with inputs from the community and healthcare workers, feeds into broader health action strategies at higher levels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) ANM and Anganwadi Worker The Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) is a key component of India’s community health programs, particularly under the National Health Mission (NHM). ASHAs are trained by Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Anganwadi Workers (AWWs), who serve as resource persons due to their experience in community health and maternal-child healthcare. ANMs provide technical knowledge related to maternal health, immunization, family planning, and disease prevention, while Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) focus on nutrition, early childhood care, and community mobilization. Since ASHAs work closely with both ANMs and AWWs at the village level, these two are best suited to train them in health education and service delivery. Incorrect options: A. Medical Officer & ANM While Medical Officers (MOs) play a role in overseeing healthcare services at the Primary Health Centre (PHC) level, they are not directly involved in the routine training of ASHAs. ANMs have a more direct role in training ASHAs at the community level, making ANM & AWW the correct choice. B. Medical Officer & Anganwadi Worker Medical Officers are responsible for higher-level supervision and treatment rather than the hands-on training of ASHAs. Anganwadi Workers, while involved in community nutrition and childcare, are not the sole trainers. Training ASHAs requires a combination of expertise in healthcare (ANMs) and community engagement (AWWs). D. Medical Officer Medical Officers provide guidance and supervision but do not conduct the practical, community-based training required for ASHAs. Their role is more focused on clinical services and policymaking rather than grassroots-level training.",

ASHAs are recruited to act as a bridge between the community and the healthcare system, promoting maternal and child health, immunization, family planning, and disease control at the village level. They are selected from the local community to ensure better outreach and trust. Incorrect options: B. National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) NUHM focuses on providing healthcare services in urban areas, but ASHAs were originally introduced under NRHM, which is specifically designed for rural healthcare. Although NUHM has its own community health workers, ASHAs are primarily recruited under NRHM. C. ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services) ICDS is a program under the Ministry of Women and Child Development that primarily deals with nutrition, child health, and preschool education through Anganwadi Workers (AWWs). ASHAs, however, work under the health ministry’s NRHM, not ICDS. D. Village Health System There is no separate scheme called the \"Village Health System\" under which ASHAs are recruited.

The goal is to increase institutional deliveries and reduce the number of home births that are risky for both the mother and the baby. Incorrect Options: (A) Tetanus immunization (Incorrect): While tetanus immunization is an important aspect of maternal care, it is not the primary focus of the Janani Suraksha Yojana. The JSY primarily focuses on promoting institutional deliveries by offering incentives for women to give birth in health facilities. (C) Iron supplementation (Incorrect): Iron supplementation is a part of maternal care to prevent anemia during pregnancy, but it is not a direct component of JSY. While iron supplements are given during pregnancy, they are part of broader maternal health interventions, not specific to JSY. (D) Abortions (Incorrect): Abortions are not a focus of JSY.

ASHA is involved in tasks such as promoting institutional deliveries, ensuring zero dose of OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) and BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccinations, and facilitating birth registration, but the act of recording birth weight is typically part of routine health monitoring and is not directly linked to a payment under the ASHA remuneration system. Incorrect Options: (A) Institutional delivery (Correct): ASHA workers do receive remuneration for promoting institutional deliveries. They are incentivized to encourage pregnant women to give birth in health facilities, ensuring safer deliveries and better maternal and child health outcomes. (B) Zero dose of OPV and BCG (Correct): ASHAs are paid for ensuring the administration of the zero dose of OPV and BCG vaccines to newborns.

The scheme provides free healthcare services to pregnant women and newborns, particularly for those who are economically disadvantaged. One of the key components of JSSK is the free treatment for mothers and children, but free treatment for children under JSSK is not limited to only 28 days. Children are provided with free treatment up to 1 year of age in the event of sickness or complications, and not just up to 28 days. Incorrect Options: (A) Free diet to mother during hospital stay (Correct): JSSK ensures that mothers receive free diet during their hospital stay, which is aimed at providing better nutrition to support recovery and breastfeeding. This is part of the comprehensive support provided by JSSK during maternal care. (B) Free delivery (Correct): Under JSSK, delivery services (normal and cesarean) are provided free of charge, ensuring that women can give birth in a health facility without financial burden. This is a key feature of the scheme aimed at promoting institutional deliveries. (C) Free transport from home to hospital and back (Correct): JSSK covers free transport services for women in labor, from their homes to the hospital and back.

This formulation is recommended for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia among women of reproductive age, particularly in adults. The combination is aimed at improving hemoglobin levels and reducing the incidence of anemia. Incorrect Options: (B) 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 micrograms of folic acid (Incorrect): The recommended dose for adult women under the National Program is 60 mg of elemental iron, not 100 mg. Although 100 mg of iron may be used in certain therapeutic contexts, it is not the standard dose for prevention and general supplementation under the program. (C) 120 mg of elemental iron and 750 micrograms of folic acid (Incorrect): The standard formulation for adult tablets under the National Program contains 60 mg of elemental iron. The amount of 750 micrograms of folic acid is also higher than the required dosage under the typical national guidelines. (D) 200 mg of elemental iron and 1000 micrograms of folic acid (Incorrect): This dosage of 200 mg of elemental iron and 1000 micrograms of folic acid is too high for general supplementation purposes under national programs. Excessive iron supplementation can lead to side effects and is not routinely recommended unless medically indicated for severe anemia.",

Incorrect Options: (A) 20 mg of elemental iron & 100 microgram of folic acid to 2-5 year old children weekly for an entire year (Incorrect): 20 mg of elemental iron and 100 micrograms of folic acid is not the correct dosage for weekly supplementation in children under the Modified NIPI. The typical dosage for 2-5 year-old children is usually iron at a lower dose than what is provided in the option. (B) 100 mg of elemental iron & 500 micrograms of folic acid to pregnant women biweekly for an entire year (Incorrect): The correct dosing schedule for pregnant women under NIPI is 60 mg of elemental iron and 500 micrograms of folic acid daily, not 100 mg biweekly. This biweekly dosage of 100 mg is higher than the recommended daily supplementation for pregnancy. (D) 20 mg of elemental iron to all 2-5 year old children biweekly for an entire year (Incorrect): Biweekly supplementation of 20 mg of elemental iron is typically used for certain populations (such as those at risk for anemia), but the Modified NIPI recommends daily supplementation for children, not biweekly, and typically uses higher iron doses when giving supplements to young children.",

Incorrect Options: (A) Tuberculosis (TB) - Under IDSP TB is included in IDSP, but it is also primarily managed under the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP). Since TB is a major public health concern, its surveillance is crucial for tracking drug-resistant cases and controlling transmission. (B) Dengue - Under IDSP Dengue is a vector-borne disease that causes seasonal outbreaks in India, especially during monsoons. IDSP actively tracks Dengue cases as part of its early warning system to control outbreaks.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Presumptive Diagnosis In the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), different levels of healthcare facilities perform different types of diagnosis. The Primary Health Centre (PHC) Medical Officer is responsible for presumptive diagnosis, which means diagnosing a disease based on clinical symptoms and signs, without laboratory confirmation. Presumptive diagnosis is essential at the PHC level because many rural and remote healthcare centers lack advanced diagnostic facilities. The PHC Medical Officer initiates treatment based on clinical findings and, if needed, refers patients for further confirmatory testing at higher healthcare facilities. Incorrect Options: (A) Syndromic Diagnosis - Not Specific to PHC Medical Officers Syndromic diagnosis is a broader approach where diseases are identified based on a group of symptoms (syndromes) rather than a specific disease. It is used at the community level by frontline workers (e.g., ASHAs, ANMs) who do not have medical training but can identify cases needing medical attention. PHC doctors do not rely solely on syndromic diagnosis; they make presumptive diagnoses based on symptoms and clinical examination. (C) Confirmed Diagnosis - Done at Higher Centers Confirmed diagnosis requires laboratory testing or specialized investigations, which are usually done at district hospitals, medical colleges, or reference labs under IDSP. PHC-level facilities do not have advanced testing infrastructure for confirmatory diagnosis. (D) Active Surveillance - Conducted by Health Workers Active surveillance involves actively searching for cases in the community, especially during outbreaks. This is primarily done by health workers, epidemiologists, and surveillance officers, not by PHC medical officers, whose role is mainly clinical management and presumptive diagnosis.",

IMNCI guidelines include fever management protocols to distinguish malaria from other causes of fever. (B) Respiratory Infection - Included Acute respiratory infections (ARIs), particularly pneumonia, are a major cause of death in children. IMNCI provides guidelines for diagnosing and treating pneumonia at the community level.

It helps health workers quickly decide the appropriate treatment and management for sick children. IMNCI classifies cases into three color-coded categories: Pink (Severe illness - Urgent Referral to Hospital) Yellow (Moderate illness - Treatment at PHC/Health Facility) Green (Mild illness - Treatment at Home with Advice) Children classified under the green color category have mild illnesses and do not require hospitalization. These cases are treated at home with basic medications, fluids, nutrition, and supportive care. The caregiver is given instructions on home treatment and when to return if symptoms worsen. Incorrect Options: (A) Pink - Incorrect Pink is used for severe illness that requires urgent referral to a hospital. Conditions under this category include severe pneumonia, severe dehydration, severe malnutrition, convulsions, or danger signs (e.g., unconsciousness, inability to drink). These children must be sent to a higher healthcare facility immediately. (B) Red - Incorrect There is no \"Red\" color in the IMNCI classification system. Some emergency medical triage systems use red for life-threatening conditions, but IMNCI uses \"Pink\" instead. (D) Yellow - Incorrect Yellow is for moderate illness requiring treatment at a health facility but not urgent referral. Children in this category need oral antibiotics, oral rehydration, or specific treatment at a healthcare center before being sent home.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Up to 5 years The Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) strategy is designed to reduce child mortality and morbidity by focusing on the most common childhood illnesses. It targets children from birth up to 5 years of age (0-59 months) because this age group is the most vulnerable to infections, malnutrition, and other preventable health conditions. IMNCI integrates preventive and curative care for newborns and children, addressing conditions such as: Neonatal health issues (e.g., infections, low birth weight, hypothermia) Respiratory infections (e.g., pneumonia) Diarrhea and dehydration Malaria and fever Malnutrition By targeting this specific age group, IMNCI helps in early identification, treatment, and referral of serious illnesses, ensuring improved child survival rates.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Training Under the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) in India, medical colleges are classified as \"Training Centers\" because they play a crucial role in: Training Eye Care Professionals – Medical colleges provide specialized training to ophthalmologists, medical officers, and paramedical ophthalmic assistants (PMOAs) to enhance eye care services. Capacity Building – They help in developing human resources by training healthcare professionals at different levels. Research and Development – Many medical colleges conduct research on eye diseases, blindness prevention, and newer treatment modalities. Referral Services – These institutions serve as tertiary care centers, handling complex ophthalmic cases referred from lower healthcare facilities. Support for NPCB Goals – By training skilled personnel, medical colleges help in achieving the NPCB’s objective of reducing blindness prevalence. Incorrect Options: (A) Excellence – Incorrect The term \"Centers of Excellence\" is used for specialized institutes like AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) and RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, which focus on advanced research and super-specialty treatment. Medical colleges under NPCB are primarily training centers, not necessarily \"centers of excellence.\" (C) Service – Incorrect While medical colleges do provide eye care services, their primary role under NPCB is training rather than direct service delivery like district hospitals or eye camps. (D) Vision – Incorrect The term \"Vision Centers\" generally refers to primary-level eye care centers that provide basic ophthalmic services in rural and underserved areas. Medical colleges function at a higher level, focusing on training and research rather than basic eye care.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) API The Annual Parasite Incidence (API) is the most reliable and widely used measure for estimating the burden of malaria in a population. API reflects the number of confirmed malaria cases (usually confirmed by slide examination) per 1,000 population in a year. This measure helps to quantify the incidence of malaria and directly correlates with the disease burden in the community. Why API is the best: • It specifically measures the incidence of malaria in the population, making it the most accurate way to estimate the burden. • API helps in comparing the malaria burden over time or between different geographic regions. Formula for API: API=(Number of Confirmed Malaria Cases/Total Population at risk) x 1000 Incorrect Option (A) Mosquito Rate Mosquito rate refers to the density of mosquitoes in an area, which gives an idea of the vector population. However, it does not directly measure the disease burden. High mosquito density does not necessarily equate to high malaria transmission or high disease burden in humans. (C) Parasite The term \"parasite\" alone is vague. While the presence of the malaria parasite in individuals is essential, it does not directly estimate the burden of malaria. API is more specific and directly correlates the number of cases with the population size. (D) SPR (Slide Positivity Rate) Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) refers to the percentage of malaria positive slides out of the total number of slides examined. While it is useful for understanding the proportion of malaria cases detected, it does not fully capture the burden of the disease in the population, as it may miss many cases, especially in asymptomatic individuals",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 6 days The malaria eradication program using insecticides aims to reduce the lifespan of mosquito larvae to less than 6 days. The reasoning behind this is that malaria transmission relies on the mosquito's ability to develop into an adult capable of spreading the malaria parasite. If the larvae do not survive long enough to reach adulthood, the transmission cycle is broken. By targeting and shortening the lifespan of larvae, insecticides prevent mosquitoes from becoming vectors, effectively reducing malaria transmission. Incorrect Options: (A) 1 day – Incorrect A lifespan of 1 day is too short for the mosquito larvae to develop into adult mosquitoes. While it is important to reduce the survival period, 1 day is not realistic for mosquito larvae to fully mature into adult mosquitoes capable of transmitting malaria. The target is to reduce their lifespan to a maximum of 6 days, not as short as 1 day. (B) 3 days – Incorrect 3 days is also too short for mosquito larvae to develop and survive into adults capable of transmission. While controlling the lifespan to 3 days would be beneficial, the key target is typically 6 days or less, which ensures that the mosquito larvae do not reach the adult stage in a time frame that would allow for the transmission of malaria. (D) 10 days – Incorrect While reducing the lifespan of larvae is crucial for stopping transmission, 10 days is too long. If mosquito larvae survive for 10 days, they can likely mature into adult mosquitoes that can carry and transmit the malaria parasite. The goal is to prevent their survival long enough to reach adulthood, and 6 days is the target for effective transmission control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ACT only. In the case of a pregnant woman diagnosed with falciparum malaria in the third trimester, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) is the recommended treatment under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDC). ACT is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnant women, particularly in the second and third trimesters. This regimen has shown to be both safe and effective in treating malaria during pregnancy. It targets the malaria parasite efficiently while minimizing potential harm to the fetus. Artemisinin-based therapies have been carefully studied and are known to be the most effective antimalarial agents for this condition. Incorrect options: B. ACT + single dose of Primaquine on day 2 Primaquine is not recommended for use during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester and should be avoided in women who are pregnant. Although it is effective against the gametocyte stage of malaria, primaquine can cause hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency and is contraindicated in pregnant women due to potential risks to the fetus. C. Quinine only While quinine is another option for the treatment of falciparum malaria during pregnancy, it is usually used in more severe cases or when ACT is not available. Quinine can be used with additional antimalarial drugs, but it is less preferred compared to ACT because ACT has shown to be more effective and better tolerated. D. Chloroquine Chloroquine is an older antimalarial drug and is generally not effective against Plasmodium falciparum in areas with widespread resistance. As falciparum malaria has developed resistance to chloroquine in many parts of the world, it is no longer recommended for treating falciparum malaria, particularly in regions with high resistance rates. Thus, ACT only is the most appropriate choice for treating falciparum malaria in a pregnant woman in the third trimester.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Primaquine contraindicated in infants and pregnant women. According to the Revised Malaria Drug Policy (2013), primaquine is contraindicated in pregnant women and infants under the age of 6 months. This is because primaquine can cause hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, a condition that is relatively common and can lead to severe complications, particularly in newborns and infants. In pregnancy, primaquine can pose a risk to the fetus, and it is therefore not recommended during this period. Incorrect options: A. Presumptive treatment with chloroquine is given Presumptive treatment with chloroquine is not recommended under the revised policy for treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria, as chloroquine resistance is widespread. Chloroquine is typically recommended only for Plasmodium vivax in areas where resistance has not developed, but it is not used for presumptive treatment of falciparum malaria. B. ACT is not given in falciparum This is false. Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, particularly in areas where resistance to other antimalarial drugs like chloroquine is present. ACT is recommended for treating both uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria under the revised drug policy. C. Primaquine is not given in falciparum This statement is incorrect because primaquine is used in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria only for the purpose of gametocyte clearance in certain cases, though it is not used for the treatment of the active stage of falciparum infection.

Chloroquine has been widely used for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria and is considered safe during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. It effectively clears the parasite and is recommended under the revised malaria treatment guidelines. Incorrect options: B. Quinine Quinine is typically used for Plasmodium falciparum malaria or in cases of severe malaria, but it is not the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax. While quinine can be used when chloroquine is not available or in cases of chloroquine resistance, it is less commonly recommended for vivax malaria. C. Pyrimethamine Pyrimethamine is not a standard treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria. It is sometimes used in combination with sulfadoxine in cases of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, but it is not used for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax during pregnancy. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fortnightly. Malaria surveillance is typically done fortnightly (every two weeks) in endemic areas. This frequent monitoring helps in identifying new cases early, monitoring trends in malaria transmission, and ensuring timely responses to outbreaks. Regular surveillance also helps in evaluating the effectiveness of malaria control programs and interventions. Incorrect options: B. Yearly Yearly surveillance is too infrequent to effectively monitor and control malaria transmission. Malaria is a dynamic disease, and relying on yearly checks could allow outbreaks to go unnoticed for too long, delaying intervention and control measures. C. Monthly While monthly surveillance is better than yearly, it is still not frequent enough in high-risk areas, where cases can fluctuate rapidly. Fortnightly surveillance is more appropriate for timely interventions and better control of malaria transmission. D. Weekly Although weekly surveillance could be ideal in some high-risk settings, fortnightly surveillance is generally sufficient to monitor the situation effectively without overwhelming resources. Weekly checks may be unnecessary and resource-intensive in areas where transmission is stable and malaria incidence is relatively low.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Filaria. A blood smear for filaria must be made at night because the adult worms of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, the parasites responsible for filariasis, release their microfilariae (larval stage) into the bloodstream primarily at night. This phenomenon is known as nocturnal periodicity. For accurate diagnosis, blood smears should be taken between 10 PM and 2 AM, as this is when the microfilariae are most abundant in the peripheral circulation. Incorrect options: A. Malaria Malaria parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum, vivax, malariae, and ovale, circulate in the blood throughout the day, making it unnecessary to specifically collect blood at night. Blood smears for malaria can be done at any time. C. Leprosy Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which does not require blood smears for diagnosis. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical features, skin biopsy, and smear from lesions. A blood smear is not typically used for diagnosing leprosy, and the time of day does not affect the test. D. Onchocerciasis Onchocerciasis, caused by Onchocerca volvulus, also does not require blood smears at night. The microfilariae of Onchocerca are typically found in the skin and are diagnosed by skin snips rather than blood smears.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Risk factors of NCD. Surveillance for risk factors of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) involves monitoring and identifying factors that increase the likelihood of developing NCDs, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and poor diet. Surveillance of these risk factors allows for early identification of individuals at higher risk, enabling public health programs to intervene and promote healthier lifestyles to prevent the onset of NCDs. Incorrect options: B. Incidence of NCD While surveillance of the incidence (new cases) of NCDs is important for understanding the burden of disease, it is not typically the first step in surveillance. Monitoring risk factors is usually a proactive approach that helps prevent the incidence of NCDs, while incidence surveillance focuses more on tracking the occurrence of the diseases themselves. C. Evaluation of treatment of NCD Evaluating the treatment of NCDs involves assessing how effectively the existing treatment protocols are working, which is part of health program evaluation rather than initial surveillance. Treatment evaluation focuses on patient outcomes and treatment adherence, which is a step that occurs after identifying and diagnosing the condition, not during surveillance. D. Mortality from NCD Surveillance of mortality from NCDs focuses on tracking the number of deaths attributed to these diseases, which provides valuable epidemiological data. However, monitoring risk factors (option A) is typically more proactive and preventive, aiming to reduce the burden of NCDs before they lead to mortality.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Urinary iodine levels. Urinary iodine levels are considered the best indicator for monitoring the impact of the iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) control program. This is because iodine is primarily excreted through urine, and its concentration in urine reflects recent dietary intake of iodine. A median urinary iodine level of at least 100 micrograms per liter in a population is considered an indicator of sufficient iodine intake and effective iodine deficiency control. This measure is widely used to assess the iodine status of a population and the success of the iodine supplementation program. Incorrect options: A. Prevalence of goiter among school children While the prevalence of goiter among school children is a commonly used indicator for assessing iodine deficiency, it is not the best indicator of iodine deficiency control. Goiter is a late manifestation of iodine deficiency, and by the time goiter appears, iodine deficiency may already be a long-standing issue. Urinary iodine levels provide a more immediate and accurate reflection of iodine status. C. Neonatal hypothyroidism Neonatal hypothyroidism can result from iodine deficiency, but it is a less direct and less sensitive measure compared to urinary iodine levels. It is a more severe outcome and may not be seen as early as changes in urinary iodine levels, making it less effective for routine monitoring. D. Iodine level in soil While iodine levels in soil can affect the iodine content of local food sources, it is not a reliable indicator of the effectiveness of an iodine deficiency control program. Iodine status is better reflected by measures of intake and excretion (like urinary iodine) than by iodine levels in the soil, which can vary widely based on geographic and environmental factors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) TB. Nikshay is an online platform developed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) for the tracking and monitoring of tuberculosis (TB) patients in India. It is part of the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) and is used to record and track TB cases, monitor treatment progress, and ensure timely and effective intervention. The platform helps in improving the surveillance, reporting, and management of TB cases in the country. Incorrect options: A. High risk newborns There is no specific program called \"Nikshay\" for tracking high-risk newborns. Newborn care is typically managed through other healthcare initiatives like RCH (Reproductive and Child Health) and IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness). B. Malaria While malaria tracking is vital for public health, Nikshay is not used for malaria. Malaria surveillance in India is typically handled under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). D. High risk pregnancy High-risk pregnancies are monitored under maternal and child health programs such as RCH and Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), but not through the Nikshay platform.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Entitled for 30,000 rupees/family. Ayushman Bharat, specifically the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), is a health insurance scheme aimed at providing financial protection to economically vulnerable populations. It offers coverage of up to 5 lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. The amount mentioned in option B (30,000 rupees) is incorrect because the coverage is much higher. Incorrect Options: A. Applicable for BPL only Ayushman Bharat primarily targets the economically vulnerable population, which includes both Below Poverty Line (BPL) families and other identified groups. It is not limited only to BPL families but covers a broader range of the underprivileged population. C. Smart card based Ayushman Bharat uses a smart card for accessing healthcare services. The card is used to avail benefits at empanelled hospitals, simplifying the process of treatment under the scheme. D. Is a type of insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat is indeed a health insurance scheme that provides coverage for hospitalization expenses. It is designed to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure for medical treatment and improve access to healthcare services for the underprivileged.",

Hence, option A is incorrect. Incorrect Options: B. Objective is to reduce 2% per year Stunting & Under-nutrition in children less than 6 years – Correct POSHAN Abhiyaan aims to reduce stunting and undernutrition by 2% per year among children under 6 years of age to improve their overall health and development. C. Objective is to reduce 2% per year low birth weight in children less than 6 years – Correct The program also targets reducing low birth weight by 2% per year, which is essential for improving neonatal and infant health outcomes. D.

It is meant for all eligible beneficiaries, irrespective of their economic status, though priority is often given to marginalized communities. Hence, option A is incorrect and the correct choice for this question. Incorrect Options: B. This scheme is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development The ICDS scheme is implemented under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD), which oversees nutrition and welfare programs for mothers and children. C. Immunization of child is one of the key services provided One of the six main services under ICDS includes immunization to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases. This is done in coordination with the National Health Mission (NHM). D. Adolescent girls are also beneficiaries of this scheme The Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG), earlier a part of ICDS, now functions under POSHAN Abhiyaan and focuses on nutrition, health, and life skills for adolescent girls aged 11-18 years.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Labour room quality. The image shown is likely related to ensuring quality care in the labour room, which is a critical aspect of maternal and neonatal health. Labour room quality focuses on factors such as infection prevention, skilled birth attendance, availability of essential equipment, respectful maternity care, and adherence to protocols for safe childbirth. Many global and national health programs, including WHO’s Quality of Care Framework and India’s LaQshya (Labour Room Quality Improvement Initiative), emphasize the importance of maintaining high standards in labour rooms to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. Incorrect Options: (A) Giving incentive for institutional delivery – Incorrect While programs like Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) provide financial incentives to encourage institutional deliveries, they focus on increasing the number of hospital births rather than directly improving labour room quality. The image is more likely related to labour room standards rather than financial incentives. (C) Free delivery – Incorrect Many governments offer free delivery services, such as Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) in India, to ensure that pregnant women receive free medical care. However, the image does not necessarily depict cost-free childbirth services but rather focuses on labour room quality and standards. (D) Free child care up to 28 days – Incorrect While some schemes, such as JSSK, provide free healthcare for newborns up to 28 days, this is a postnatal care initiative rather than a labour room quality improvement program. The image more likely highlights labour room protocols and standards rather than newborn care services after discharge.",
