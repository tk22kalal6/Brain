      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP). Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is the most common form of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in children. It is a small-vessel vasculitis that is characterized by purpura, particularly on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and sometimes renal involvement (glomerulonephritis). HSP is most commonly seen in children aged 2-11 years and often follows an upper respiratory tract infection. The condition is typically self-limited, but it can lead to complications, particularly renal involvement, which may require monitoring. Explanation of incorrect responses: A. Takayasu disease: Takayasu arteritis is a large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects young women, and it is much less common in children. It typically involves the aorta and its major branches, causing vascular inflammation and narrowing, which leads to symptoms such as claudication, hypertension, and ischemia. It is not the most common vasculitis in children. B. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki disease): Kawasaki disease is a medium-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects children under the age of 5. It is characterized by fever, conjunctivitis, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and coronary artery aneurysms. While it is an important vasculitis in children, it is not classified as a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and HSP remains more common in the pediatric population. D. Polyarteritis nodosa: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare vasculitis affecting medium- and small-sized arteries, typically in adults but can occasionally affect children. It is less common than HSP in children and involves systemic inflammation of the vessels, which can lead to organ damage and a variety of systemic symptoms, including abdominal pain, muscle and joint pain, and kidney involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Failure to make patient afebrile despite 2 courses of IVIG. Prednisolone (a corticosteroid) is used in the management of Kawasaki disease in specific situations, particularly when there is a failure to achieve defervescence (fever resolution) after two courses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Despite the initial standard treatment with IVIG, if the child continues to have fever for more than 36 hours after the second dose, prednisolone is often added to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications, such as coronary artery damage. Explanation of incorrect responses: A. Giant coronary aneurysms: The presence of giant coronary aneurysms is a severe complication of Kawasaki disease, and while it is important to monitor and manage these patients closely, corticosteroids like prednisolone are not typically used solely for the treatment of aneurysms. IVIG and aspirin are the mainstays of treatment to reduce the risk of coronary artery abnormalities. B. Age 50/hr: While thrombocytosis (elevated platelet count) and elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are common findings in Kawasaki disease, they are not direct indications for the use of prednisolone. The treatment decision is more focused on managing the fever and inflammation, which is why failure to resolve the fever with IVIG (option D) is a key factor in deciding to add prednisolone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 1-3%. Kawasaki disease (KD) is a rare condition, and while most children who receive appropriate treatment (such as intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin) do well, a small percentage can experience a recurrence of the disease. The recurrence rate of Kawasaki disease is generally low, typically around 1-3% of children who have had the disease. Explanation of incorrect options: A. 0-1%: The recurrence rate is slightly higher than this, and 0-1% would underestimate the true recurrence rate of the condition. C. 3-10%: While this range is somewhat close, it overestimates the recurrence rate. Research generally places the recurrence rate closer to 1-3%.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Oligoarticular. Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common form of juvenile arthritis, accounting for about 50-60% of cases. This type of JIA typically affects 4 or fewer joints in the first 6 months of the disease. It primarily involves the large joints such as the knees and hips, and often has a better prognosis compared to other types. Explanation of incorrect options: A. Polyarticular: Polyarticular JIA affects 5 or more joints and is less common than oligoarticular JIA. It tends to have a more aggressive course and can involve both small and large joints, often leading to more complications. B. Enthesitis-related: This type involves inflammation at the sites where tendons or ligaments attach to bones (entheses). It is less common and often associated with HLA-B27 positivity, typically affecting the lower limbs and sometimes the spine. D. Systemic-onset JIA: Systemic-onset JIA, also known as Still's disease, is the least common type of JIA and is characterized by systemic symptoms such as fever, rash, and organ involvement (e.g., liver, spleen).

Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the first-line treatment for Kawasaki disease and is used to reduce the risk of coronary artery complications, particularly coronary artery aneurysms, which are a major concern in this condition. IVIG is administered in a high dose (2 g/kg) over a period of 8-12 hours. It is most effective when given within the first 10 days of illness, ideally as early as possible to reduce the risk of long-term cardiovascular complications. Incorrect options: A. Prednisolone: While corticosteroids like prednisolone are sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy in resistant cases, they are not the first-line treatment for Kawasaki disease. In fact, IVIG is preferred over steroids for initial treatment. C. Rituximab: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used for certain autoimmune diseases, but it is not the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease. It may be considered in refractory cases, but it is not routinely used. D. Infliximab: Infliximab is an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody that is used in some autoimmune diseases like Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not a standard treatment for Kawasaki disease.",

These aneurysms are a serious complication of Kawasaki disease and can lead to significant long-term cardiovascular issues, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and even death in severe cases.

Incorrect options: A. <5%: This is an underestimate of the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms in untreated Kawasaki disease. The risk is much higher in untreated cases.

Arthritis: Especially in larger joints. Renal involvement: Hematuria and proteinuria can occur. The perivascular IgA deposition and the neutrophilic collection described are classic findings for HSP. Incorrect options: B. Wegener’s granulomatosis: This is a type of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and typically affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis, but not by perivascular IgA deposition. C. Cryoglobulinemia: This is a condition characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood, leading to symptoms such as purpura and vasculitis, but the rash and pathophysiology do not fit as well with the description in this case.

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis primarily affecting children, and it can lead to renal involvement, which typically manifests as hematuria or proteinuria. Renal complications in HSP can occur up to 6 months after the initial diagnosis, and in some cases, they may even appear later. Most cases of renal involvement occur during the acute phase, but it's important to monitor for renal issues up to 6 months or longer, as the condition can have a delayed onset of kidney problems. Incorrect options: A. Within 1 month: Although renal involvement can appear early, it is more likely to occur within a longer time frame, typically up to 6 months, rather than just within 1 month. B. Within 2 months: While some renal complications can present within 2 months, the full range of renal issues in HSP may emerge later, closer to the 6-month mark. C.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, primarily affecting the lungs but also involving other organs. While the exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, familial clustering suggests a genetic predisposition. The familial form of sarcoidosis follows an autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance pattern, meaning that having one affected parent can increase the likelihood of inheriting the disease. Studies have shown that genetic factors contribute significantly to the disease, and the autosomal dominant inheritance is most commonly seen in cases where multiple family members are affected. Incorrect options: A. AR (Autosomal Recessive): While some diseases show autosomal recessive inheritance, sarcoidosis typically does not follow this pattern. It is more likely to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in familial cases. C. XLD (X-linked Dominant): This type of inheritance involves genes located on the X chromosome. Sarcoidosis does not typically follow an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. D. XLR (X-linked Recessive): X-linked recessive inheritance usually affects males more severely, as they only have one X chromosome. Sarcoidosis is not linked to X-linked recessive inheritance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fever lasting more than 4 weeks. Explanation: Kawasaki disease is an acute inflammatory condition that predominantly affects children and leads to systemic vasculitis. It typically presents with fever and other characteristic symptoms. However, the fever in Kawasaki disease does not last for more than 4 weeks. Fever lasting more than 4 weeks: This is not characteristic of Kawasaki disease. The fever in Kawasaki disease usually lasts for at least 5 days but resolves with appropriate treatment (such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)) within a shorter duration. Prolonged fever lasting more than 4 weeks may suggest a different underlying condition. Incorrect options: B. Desquamation after 2-3 weeks of disease onset: This is a classic feature of Kawasaki disease. Desquamation (peeling of the skin) typically occurs after 2-3 weeks, especially in the periungual area (around the nails). C. Raised acute phase reactants: Elevated markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are common in Kawasaki disease, indicating ongoing inflammation. D. High risk of cardiac complications: One of the major concerns in Kawasaki disease is the development of coronary artery aneurysms, which can lead to significant cardiac complications, including heart attacks. Thus, Kawasaki disease is associated with a high risk of cardiac complications.",
