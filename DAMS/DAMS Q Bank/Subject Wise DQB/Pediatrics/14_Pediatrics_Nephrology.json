      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Micro RNA 122. Micro RNA 122 is not a biomarker involved in acute kidney injury (AKI). It is primarily associated with liver injury, particularly liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. It does not play a role in the detection or diagnosis of acute kidney injury, making it the correct answer. Incorrect options: A. NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin): NGAL is a well-established biomarker for acute kidney injury. It is released from renal tubular cells in response to kidney injury and is used to detect early kidney damage, especially in cases of ischemic and nephrotoxic injuries. B. KIM-1 (Kidney Injury Molecule-1): KIM-1 is another important biomarker that is involved in AKI. It is expressed in renal tubular cells after injury and has been shown to correlate with the severity of kidney damage. It is useful for detecting early kidney injury, particularly in cases of ischemia or nephrotoxicity. D. Cystatin-C: Cystatin-C is a biomarker used to evaluate renal function and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is not affected by muscle mass and is often used to detect kidney dysfunction, including in the context of AKI. It is a reliable marker for kidney impairment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Juvenile nephronophthisis. Juvenile nephronophthisis is a genetic disorder that often presents in childhood with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia (excessive thirst and urination), which is consistent with the case described. This condition is characterized by progressive renal dysfunction, leading to small kidneys, which is also evident in the ultrasound findings. The typical biochemical abnormalities include metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), which is seen in this child. Additionally, the child has short stature, a common feature in nephronophthisis due to growth impairment associated with kidney failure. Elevated serum creatinine and low bicarbonate levels further support the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, which is commonly seen in juvenile nephronophthisis. Incorrect options: B. Reflux nephropathy: This condition is caused by vesicoureteral reflux, where urine flows back into the kidneys, leading to scarring and eventual renal dysfunction. While it can cause kidney damage, it typically does not present with small kidneys on ultrasound and is more commonly associated with hypertension and proteinuria, neither of which are observed in this child. C. Polycystic kidney disease: Polycystic kidney disease often presents with enlarged kidneys (not small kidneys) and typically involves the development of multiple cysts. The kidneys in polycystic kidney disease are usually large and irregularly shaped, which contradicts the finding of bilateral small kidneys in this case. Additionally, polycystic kidney disease tends to manifest later in childhood or adolescence with more prominent symptoms. D. Medullary cystic kidney disease: This condition is associated with medullary cysts and progressive renal failure, but it typically presents in adults rather than children. It also tends to involve normal-sized kidneys, not small kidneys, and is often associated with normal BP, which does not fit the presentation in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Start Cyclosporine. The child described in the scenario has frequent relapses of nephrotic syndrome (more than 2 relapses in 6 months or 4 relapses in one year), which is indicative of steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). This condition is characterized by a high risk of relapse whenever corticosteroids are tapered or discontinued. In such cases, the best management includes the use of immunosuppressive agents to reduce the frequency of relapses and minimize corticosteroid dependence. Cyclosporine is one of the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs for managing steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in children. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of relapses and is used as a steroid-sparing agent in such cases. It works by inhibiting T-cell activation and reducing the inflammatory response that leads to nephrotic syndrome. Incorrect options: A. Pulse methylprednisolone: While pulse methylprednisolone is used in severe cases or to induce remission in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, it is generally not the first-line treatment for steroid-dependent cases. Frequent relapses in SDNS are typically managed with long-term immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclosporine, rather than high-dose corticosteroid pulses. B. Start Levamisole: Levamisole is sometimes used as an adjunct treatment in nephrotic syndrome; it has some steroid-sparing effects, but it is less commonly used for frequent relapses and is generally reserved for steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome that does not respond to cyclosporine or other therapies. C. Start Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is another immunosuppressive agent used in nephrotic syndrome; however, it is generally reserved for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or in cases where other treatments have failed. It has a more significant side-effect profile compared to cyclosporine, and its use in frequent relapses is not as common as cyclosporine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bartter syndrome. The most likely diagnosis in this case is Bartter syndrome, which is a group of inherited renal disorders characterized by defective sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This leads to electrolyte imbalances and metabolic alkalosis. The key features in this case that point to Bartter syndrome are: Failure to thrive: A common sign in infants with this syndrome due to chronic dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Polyuria: Occurs due to impaired renal concentration ability as a result of abnormal sodium and water handling. Medullary nephrocalcinosis: A common finding in Bartter syndrome due to chronic hypercalciuria (excess calcium in urine). Electrolyte disturbances: Hypokalemia (low potassium, 2 mEq/l), which is typical in Bartter syndrome due to excessive potassium loss in the urine. Hyponatremia (low sodium, 126 mEq/l), which occurs due to a compensatory increase in renin and aldosterone, leading to sodium loss. Hypochloremia (low chloride, 88 mEq/l), another typical finding in Bartter syndrome due to the loss of chloride along with sodium. Metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.48, bicarbonate 25 mEq/l), which is often seen due to the renal loss of potassium and hydrogen ions, leading to an increase in bicarbonate. Incorrect options: A. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA): While dRTA also presents with metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia, it is characterized by a normal anion gap and hypercalciuria, not medullary nephrocalcinosis. Additionally, dRTA causes failure to acidify urine, which is not the case here. B. Primary hyperaldosteronism: This condition leads to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis due to increased aldosterone secretion. However, hyponatremia and polyuria would not be as prominent as seen in this case, and medullary nephrocalcinosis is not typical for this condition. D. Pseudohypoaldosteronism: This condition results in resistance to aldosterone and is characterized by hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis, which is the opposite of the electrolyte findings in this case. Therefore, it is an unlikely diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Liddle syndrome. Liddle syndrome is the most likely diagnosis based on the following features: Hypokalemia: Low potassium levels are common in Liddle syndrome due to increased renal potassium excretion. Mild hypercalciuria: Mild excess calcium in the urine can also be seen in Liddle syndrome. Hypertension: This is a hallmark of Liddle syndrome, which is due to excessive sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and the resultant volume expansion. Metabolic alkalosis: The condition also leads to metabolic alkalosis, as the kidney compensates for the increased sodium and water retention by excreting hydrogen ions. Liddle syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), leading to increased sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules. This results in hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and mild hypercalciuria. The condition is often misdiagnosed as primary hyperaldosteronism, but unlike hyperaldosteronism, it does not show elevated aldosterone levels. Incorrect options: A. Bartter syndrome: Bartter syndrome presents with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hyponatremia, not hypertension. It is due to defects in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle affecting sodium chloride reabsorption, and does not cause hypertension. The hypercalciuria seen in Bartter syndrome is typically more severe. B. Gitelman syndrome: Gitelman syndrome is a thiazide-like diuretic effect condition that causes hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia, but it does not cause hypertension. It is associated with defects in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule. D. Alport syndrome: Alport syndrome primarily affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes. It presents with hematuria, progressive renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. It does not typically cause hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, or mild hypercalciuria.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Renal vein thrombosis. Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is a common complication in children with nephrotic syndrome. This occurs due to the hypercoagulable state induced by nephrotic syndrome, where there is an increased risk of thrombosis. The clinical presentation in this case is highly suggestive of RVT: Fever and sudden onset severe abdominal pain are characteristic symptoms of renal vein thrombosis. The pain is often due to kidney infarction or swelling. Palpable mass in the lower abdomen could indicate a swollen kidney, which is a result of thrombosis, edema, or infarction. Incorrect options: A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): SBP is an infection of the peritoneal cavity, often associated with ascites, especially in children with nephrotic syndrome. While fever and abdominal pain can occur in SBP, it does not typically present with a palpable mass in the lower abdomen. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by peritoneal fluid analysis showing bacterial growth, which is not described in this case. C. Chronic pyelonephritis: Chronic pyelonephritis typically presents with recurrent UTIs, fever, and flank pain. It might cause scarring of the kidneys over time, but it usually does not cause a sudden, localized mass or acute onset of severe abdominal pain. Also, it is more likely to present with a history of recurrent infections rather than a sudden onset of symptoms like in this case. D. Acute renal failure: While acute renal failure can present with abdominal pain, it usually leads to oliguria, elevated creatinine, and fluid retention. The abdominal mass and sudden onset of pain in this case are more likely to be due to renal vein thrombosis, which leads to kidney swelling or infarction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Oral cyclosporine. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) refers to a condition where the child does not respond to the standard treatment with oral prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for at least 4 weeks. In such cases, alternative immunosuppressive therapies are needed. Oral cyclosporine is one of the first-line treatments for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). It is an effective immunosuppressive agent that works by inhibiting T-cell activation, which is involved in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome. Cyclosporine has been shown to reduce proteinuria and improve renal function in children with SRNS. Incorrect options: A. IV methylprednisolone: While intravenous methylprednisolone is used in certain severe cases of nephrotic syndrome, especially in patients who are resistant to oral steroids, it is typically more effective in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. In SRNS, oral cyclosporine is more appropriate as a next step. B. IV cyclophosphamide: IV cyclophosphamide is an alternative treatment for SRNS, particularly for cases that are resistant to cyclosporine or when there is significant renal impairment. However, oral cyclosporine is preferred first because it is more commonly effective and easier to manage as an outpatient. C. Oral Levamisole: Levamisole is used in some cases of nephrotic syndrome, particularly for patients who relapse frequently after steroid therapy. It has a role in frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome, but oral cyclosporine is the first choice in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome as it is more effective in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cyclophosphamide. Frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) refers to a form of nephrotic syndrome in which the child experiences multiple relapses despite initial remission with steroid therapy. When treating FRNS, the goal is to achieve remission with steroid therapy and then prevent relapses. Cyclophosphamide is the most commonly used immunosuppressive drug for managing frequent relapsers in nephrotic syndrome. It works by suppressing the immune system and preventing the abnormal immune response that contributes to the relapses. It is generally used after the patient has had multiple relapses despite standard steroid treatment. Incorrect options: A. Methylprednisolone: Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid, and while it may be used in nephrotic syndrome, it is not typically used for preventing relapses in frequent relapsers. It may be used in cases of severe nephrotic syndrome, but cyclophosphamide is preferred for frequent relapsers. C. Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine is another immunosuppressive drug, and it can be used in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) or in cases where other therapies are not effective. However, it is not the first-line choice for frequent relapsers compared to cyclophosphamide. D. Rituximab: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20+ B-cells, and it has been used in some cases of nephrotic syndrome with steroid resistance or frequent relapses. However, it is not considered the first-line treatment for frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome, with cyclophosphamide typically being the preferred option.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dehydration. Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is a condition where a blood clot forms in the renal vein, which can lead to kidney damage. In children, the most common cause of RVT is dehydration. Dehydration leads to blood hypercoagulability, and in the setting of reduced fluid intake or excessive fluid loss (e.g., from diarrhea, vomiting, or other illnesses), the risk of clot formation increases, particularly in the renal veins. Incorrect options: A. Minimal change disease: Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children but is not typically associated with renal vein thrombosis. While nephrotic syndrome can increase the risk of thrombosis due to hypercoagulability, the direct cause of RVT in MCD is not as commonly observed as dehydration. B. PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus): PDA is a congenital heart defect that involves an abnormal opening between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Although PDA can cause cardiovascular issues, it is not a common cause of renal vein thrombosis. RVT in children is more commonly linked to factors like dehydration or nephrotic syndrome rather than PDA. D. FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis): FSGS is another kidney disorder that can lead to nephrotic syndrome, but it is not directly associated with a higher risk of renal vein thrombosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) USG-KUB + DMSA. After a child has been successfully treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI), it is important to assess for any structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract that may predispose the child to recurrent infections or renal damage. The following investigations are typically performed: USG-KUB (Ultrasonography of Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder): This imaging is a non-invasive way to evaluate the structure of the kidneys and urinary tract. It can help identify anatomical abnormalities, such as hydronephrosis, kidney stones, or structural malformations. DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic Acid) Scan: This nuclear medicine test is used to assess renal scarring or dysfunction. It helps identify any damage to the kidneys that may have occurred as a result of the UTI, particularly in cases where there is a concern for pyelonephritis or scarring. Performing both USG-KUB and DMSA is the recommended course of action for a child who has had a UTI. The combination of these tests provides a good evaluation of both structural abnormalities and renal scarring, which are important in determining the need for further management or monitoring. Reasons for other options: C. USG-KUB + DMSA + MCU (Micturating Cystourethrogram): While MCU is useful for evaluating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), it is not routinely done at the first follow-up visit unless there are significant concerns regarding reflux, recurrent infections, or abnormal findings on the initial imaging (like USG or DMSA). Therefore, it is not the first-line investigation. D. DMSA + MCU: This option excludes USG-KUB, which is an essential part of the initial evaluation to assess for structural abnormalities, making this combination less ideal for the first follow-up.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) VUR (Vesicoureteral reflux). Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common abnormality associated with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children. VUR occurs when urine from the bladder flows backward into the ureters and kidneys. This backward flow can allow bacteria from the bladder to reach the kidneys, increasing the risk of pyelonephritis and recurrent UTIs. VUR is often diagnosed in children with recurrent UTIs, particularly if they have symptoms such as fever, irritability, and poor feeding, or if the UTIs are complicated by renal scarring. Reasons for other options: A. PUV (Posterior urethral valves): PUV is a rare congenital anomaly in male infants where there is a membrane in the urethra that obstructs urinary outflow, potentially causing urinary retention, hydronephrosis, and recurrent UTIs. While it can lead to recurrent UTIs, it is less common than VUR. C. Neurogenic bladder: Neurogenic bladder refers to a condition where bladder function is impaired due to a neurological issue (such as spina bifida, spinal cord injury, or brain injury). While neurogenic bladder can cause recurrent UTIs due to incomplete emptying of the bladder, it is a less common cause than VUR in children. D. Renal and ureteric calculi (stones): Renal or ureteric stones can cause recurrent UTIs by obstructing the urinary tract, but they are much less common than VUR in children. Stones typically present with more specific symptoms, such as hematuria, flank pain, or colicky pain, and are not as commonly associated with recurrent UTIs.",

The most important feature of MCD is severe hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood) due to significant protein loss through the urine. The proteinuria leads to low serum albumin levels, which causes edema, a hallmark symptom of nephrotic syndrome. Reasons for other options: A. More common in girls than boys: MCD is more common in boys than girls, especially in the younger age group. It is most commonly seen in children aged 2-6 years, with a higher incidence in boys. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. B. Non-selective proteinuria: In MCD, the proteinuria is typically selective, meaning that primarily albumin is lost in the urine. The proteinuria is usually less severe than in other forms of nephrotic syndrome, and the loss of larger proteins is relatively limited. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. D. Cyclosporine is effective first-line therapy: The first-line treatment for Minimal Change Disease (MCD) is steroids (prednisolone or prednisone), not cyclosporine. Most children with MCD respond well to steroids, with many experiencing remission. Cyclosporine is used for frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, not for initial treatment. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Nothing needed. In this scenario, the child is asymptomatic and has 1 million colony count/mm³ of E. coli in an incidentally done urine culture. The most likely diagnosis is asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), which is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine without symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI). In children, asymptomatic bacteriuria does not require treatment unless there are specific risk factors, such as structural abnormalities of the urinary tract or the child is immunocompromised. Otherwise, treatment is not needed for isolated bacteriuria in an otherwise healthy child. Reasons for other options: A. Repeat urine culture: There's no indication to repeat the urine culture in this case, as the child is asymptomatic. If symptoms arise or other risk factors are present, then repeat culture may be considered, but it's not routinely needed in an asymptomatic child. B. Nitrite test: The nitrite test is useful in diagnosing a UTI, as certain bacteria, like E. coli, convert urinary nitrates into nitrites. However, this child is asymptomatic, and no signs of UTI are present, so there's no need for further testing based on the initial asymptomatic finding. D. Start oral antibiotics: Antibiotics are not recommended for asymptomatic bacteriuria unless there are specific indications (e.g., underlying urinary tract abnormalities or immunocompromised state). Routine treatment for ASB has been shown to have no benefit and may contribute to antibiotic resistance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 3 months. The RIFLE staging system is used to classify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) and to guide management. The system divides AKI into Risk, Injury, Failure, and Loss, with an additional category for End-stage renal disease (ESRD). According to the RIFLE criteria, to define end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there must be a persistent decrease in renal function. Specifically, ESRD is diagnosed if renal failure lasts for more than 3 months. This timeframe allows for the differentiation between acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Reasons for other options: A. 4 weeks: While 4 weeks can be a timeframe for acute kidney failure, it does not meet the criteria for ESRD, which requires 3 months of persistent renal failure. B. 8 weeks: An 8-week duration is longer than necessary for classifying end-stage renal disease. The threshold for ESRD is 3 months of impaired renal function. D. 6 months: Six months is also longer than the 3-month requirement for defining ESRD in the RIFLE system. This would be more relevant for chronic kidney disease classification.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Antibiotic prophylaxis. Primary grade V vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) refers to severe reflux where urine from the bladder flows back into the kidneys, and it is graded based on the severity, with grade V being the most severe form. In a 6-month-old child, especially one with bilateral involvement, the typical first-line management approach is antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can lead to kidney damage in cases of VUR. This is typically followed by regular monitoring of renal function and potential imaging, with the aim of allowing for resolution of reflux as the child grows. Reasons for other options: B. Ureteric reimplantation: Surgical intervention like ureteric reimplantation is typically considered for refractory VUR (for example, when the VUR persists despite long-term antibiotic prophylaxis or leads to significant kidney damage), especially for high-grade reflux that does not resolve over time. However, in a 6-month-old with grade V VUR, surgery is usually not the immediate step unless there are severe complications like renal scarring or recurrent UTIs despite prophylaxis. C. Cystoscopy followed by sub-ureteric injection of Teflon: This treatment is typically used for less severe VUR (grades I-IV) and is generally reserved for cases where antibiotic prophylaxis does not work or for children who are not suitable for surgery. It is not a first-line choice for severe grade V reflux. D. Bilateral ureterostomies: This would be an extreme measure for managing severe VUR and would not be the first approach in managing primary VUR. Ureterostomies are typically considered in situations where other treatments have failed and the child is at risk of severe kidney damage. This is not a common approach for VUR in otherwise healthy children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cyclophosphamide. This 9-year-old boy has steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (NS), which is characterized by a need for long-term steroid therapy to maintain remission. However, long-term steroid use has led to significant side effects, including cushingoid appearance, hypertension, and subcapsular cataracts, which are typical complications of prolonged corticosteroid use. In steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, where the disease is poorly responsive to steroids alone, immunosuppressive therapy is often required to reduce the dependence on steroids and to control disease activity. Cyclophosphamide is an effective immunosuppressive agent used in this context. It works by reducing the immune response that is believed to contribute to the nephrotic syndrome, particularly in cases that are resistant or dependent on steroids. Reasons for other options: A. Long-term prednisolone with enalapril: While enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) can be used to control blood pressure and reduce proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome, long-term prednisolone is not appropriate in this case. The child has been steroid-dependent for 5 years, and continuing steroids will only worsen the side effects (e.g., cushingoid features, cataracts, and hypertension). The goal in steroid-dependent cases is to reduce or eliminate steroid use, not prolong it. C. IVIG: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used in certain autoimmune conditions but is not indicated as a first-line treatment for steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Its role in nephrotic syndrome is limited, and it is generally not effective for reducing steroid dependence in such cases. D. IV pulse corticosteroids: Although IV pulse corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) can be used in some forms of nephrotic syndrome to induce remission, in a child who is already steroid-dependent, giving further steroids would only exacerbate the side effects without addressing the underlying issue of steroid dependence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sepsis. The most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in neonates is sepsis. Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates and can lead to kidney injury due to systemic inflammation, hypoperfusion, and endothelial dysfunction. Neonates have immature kidneys and are more susceptible to the effects of sepsis, which can lead to acute renal failure. The kidneys in neonates are particularly vulnerable to ischemia due to low blood pressure and low circulating blood volume during sepsis. Reasons for other options: A. Hypovolemia: Hypovolemia can indeed cause acute kidney injury by reducing renal perfusion, but in neonates, sepsis is more commonly associated with AKI. Hypovolemia can occur as a result of sepsis or other conditions, but on its own, it is not the most common cause in neonates. B. HUS (Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome): HUS is a condition that primarily affects children, often following an episode of gastroenteritis caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. It is a less common cause of AKI in neonates. Neonates are less likely to develop HUS compared to older children. D. Urinary obstruction: Urinary obstruction, while it can cause AKI in neonates (e.g., from posterior urethral valves), is not the most common cause. Sepsis is a more frequent cause of AKI in the neonatal period.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Low serum complement levels. A renal biopsy is typically indicated in cases where the cause of nephrotic syndrome is unclear or there is concern about a specific underlying condition. Low serum complement levels can suggest an underlying systemic condition (such as lupus nephritis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis) or an immune-mediated glomerular injury. In these cases, a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment. Reasons for other options: A. Massive proteinuria: While massive proteinuria is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, it does not by itself indicate the need for a biopsy. Most cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (such as minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) can be diagnosed based on clinical presentation and proteinuria without needing a biopsy. B. Age 2-8 years: The age of the child can be important in determining the most likely cause of nephrotic syndrome (e.g., minimal change disease is more common in this age group). However, age alone is not an indication for biopsy. Biopsy is more likely to be indicated if there are atypical features or if the child does not respond to treatment as expected. D. 2nd attack of nephrotic syndrome in 1 year: A second episode of nephrotic syndrome within the same year is concerning, but it is not an absolute indication for a biopsy. Recurrent nephrotic syndrome can be managed based on the previous diagnosis (e.g., minimal change disease). A biopsy would be more appropriate if there were atypical features or a suspicion of a different underlying pathology.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Posterior urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the most common cause of urinary obstruction in male infants. PUV are abnormal flaps of tissue in the posterior urethra that obstruct the flow of urine, leading to a range of urinary tract issues, including bladder dysfunction, hydronephrosis, and renal impairment. This condition is typically detected in newborns or during infancy, often through prenatal ultrasound or after the baby develops signs of urinary retention or infection. Reasons for other options: A. Anterior urethral valves: These are rare and less common than posterior urethral valves. They are congenital folds of tissue in the anterior part of the urethra but are much less frequently associated with significant obstruction compared to PUV. C. Stone: Urinary stones can cause obstruction, but they are much less common in infants and neonates compared to older children or adults. Stones in the urinary tract are more likely to be secondary to other conditions, such as metabolic disorders, in infants. D. Stricture: Urethral strictures can cause obstruction, but they are also less common in infants and tend to develop as a result of injury, infection, or surgical procedures, rather than being a congenital anomaly like PUV.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Multicystic dysplastic kidney. Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the most common cause of an abdominal mass in neonates. It is a congenital condition where the kidney does not develop normally, resulting in multiple cysts replacing normal renal tissue. This condition is typically detected on prenatal ultrasound, but in cases where it's not diagnosed prenatally, it may present as an abdominal mass in a neonate. Although it usually affects only one kidney, it can lead to kidney enlargement in the affected side. Reasons for other options: A. Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor arising from neuroblasts in the sympathetic nervous system, most commonly in the adrenal glands. While it is a common abdominal mass in infants, it is less frequent than multicystic dysplastic kidney. B. Wilm’s tumor: Wilm's tumor is the most common renal malignancy in children but is relatively uncommon in neonates. It typically presents in infants or toddlers, with an abdominal mass being a primary symptom. C. Distended bladder: A distended bladder can present as an abdominal mass, but it is more commonly seen in the context of urinary retention or obstruction, which are less likely to be the primary cause of abdominal masses in neonates.",
