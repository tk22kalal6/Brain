      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Autosomal recessive. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of genetic disorders affecting adrenal steroidogenesis, most commonly caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning a child must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of the child being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected. Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene are the most common cause of CAH. This enzyme deficiency disrupts cortisol and sometimes aldosterone synthesis, leading to excess androgen production. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Autosomal dominant: Autosomal dominant inheritance would mean that a single defective copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. However, CAH requires two defective copies (one from each parent), making it autosomal recessive, not dominant. C. X-linked recessive: X-linked recessive conditions are caused by mutations on the X chromosome and typically affect males more than females. CAH is not linked to the X chromosome; it is caused by mutations on autosomal genes (non-sex chromosomes). D. Sporadic condition: A sporadic condition occurs due to random, non-heritable mutations, but CAH is an inherited disorder with a clear autosomal recessive pattern.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism, specifically congenital hypothyroidism, is a preventable cause of mental retardation if detected and treated early. Thyroid hormones are essential for brain development in infancy, and untreated hypothyroidism during the neonatal period can lead to severe developmental delays and intellectual disability. Newborn screening programs are crucial for early detection and initiation of treatment with thyroid hormone replacement, which can prevent these complications and ensure normal cognitive development. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. Down’s syndrome: Down’s syndrome (Trisomy 21) is a genetic condition and not preventable. While early intervention and supportive therapies can improve quality of life and development, the intellectual disability associated with Down’s syndrome cannot be entirely prevented. C. Cerebral palsy: Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder resulting from damage to the developing brain, often due to prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal factors such as hypoxia, infections, or trauma. While some risk factors for cerebral palsy can be mitigated (e.g., improving maternal care and preventing birth injuries), it is not entirely preventable in all cases, and it is not a specific, direct cause of mental retardation in all instances. D. All of the above: While hypothyroidism is a preventable cause of mental retardation, Down’s syndrome and cerebral palsy are not preventable causes. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 21 hydroxylase deficiency 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in newborns. It accounts for approximately 90-95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This autosomal recessive disorder leads to impaired cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, resulting in excess production of androgens by the adrenal glands. The elevated androgen levels cause virilization of the external genitalia in genetic females (46,XX), leading to ambiguous genitalia at birth. In genetic males (46,XY), external genitalia are typically normal, but the condition may manifest as salt-wasting crises in the neonatal period due to aldosterone deficiency. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency: This is another form of CAH, but it is less common than 21-hydroxylase deficiency. It also leads to androgen excess and ambiguous genitalia in 46,XX individuals. However, it is associated with hypertension due to the accumulation of deoxycorticosterone, a mineralocorticoid precursor. C. 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency: This condition causes decreased synthesis of both cortisol and androgens, leading to undervirilization of genetic males (46,XY) rather than virilization. It is not a common cause of ambiguous genitalia and is often associated with hypertension and hypokalemia due to mineralocorticoid excess. D. 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency: This is a rare form of CAH that affects the production of all adrenal and gonadal steroids, leading to ambiguous genitalia in both 46,XX and 46,XY individuals. However, it is far less common than 21-hydroxylase deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 11 beta hydroxylase. 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) that leads to an overproduction of adrenal androgens while causing an accumulation of deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a precursor with mineralocorticoid activity. This results in the following: Androgen excess: Causes precocious puberty with early development of pubic hair and other secondary sexual characteristics in boys. Normal genitalia: In 46,XY males, the external genitalia are typically normal, as androgen excess does not affect genital development prenatally. Hypertension: Elevated levels of DOC lead to sodium retention and increased blood pressure, as seen in this case (BP: 120/90). The clinical picture of precocious puberty, well-developed pubic hair, and hypertension fits 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency, which is the second most common cause of CAH. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Deoxycorticosterone: Deoxycorticosterone is not deficient in this condition; rather, it accumulates in 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency, contributing to hypertension. C. 17 alpha hydroxylase: Deficiency of 17 alpha hydroxylase results in decreased androgen synthesis. This would cause undervirilization in males rather than precocious puberty. It is also associated with hypertension, but the lack of androgens makes it incompatible with the clinical presentation. D. Aldosterone: Aldosterone levels may be normal or low in 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency, but the excess DOC compensates for its mineralocorticoid effects. Aldosterone deficiency alone would not explain the precocious puberty and hypertension observed in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone is the drug of choice for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) because: Glucocorticoid Replacement: Hydrocortisone is a short-acting glucocorticoid that mimics the natural cortisol production rhythm in the body. It effectively suppresses excessive secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which reduces adrenal androgen overproduction. Safety Profile: It is preferred in children because of its lower risk of growth suppression compared to long-acting glucocorticoids like dexamethasone or prednisolone. Optimal Dosing: The ability to titrate doses multiple times a day allows for more precise control of symptoms and hormone levels, crucial in growing children. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. Prednisolone: Prednisolone is a longer-acting glucocorticoid and is not commonly used in children for CAH because it has a higher risk of causing growth suppression. It may be considered in older children or adults in specific cases. C. Fludrocortisone: Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid used for aldosterone replacement therapy in salt-wasting forms of CAH. While important in such cases, it does not replace cortisol or suppress androgen excess, making it insufficient as monotherapy. D. Dexamethasone: Dexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid and may be used in prenatal therapy for CAH to reduce virilization in female fetuses. However, it is not recommended for routine management in children due to a high risk of growth suppression and other side effects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypothyroidism. Epiphyseal dysgenesis is a characteristic feature of hypothyroidism, especially congenital or long-standing hypothyroidism in children. The following mechanisms explain this association: Delayed Bone Maturation: Thyroid hormones are critical for normal growth and skeletal development. In hypothyroidism, the lack of these hormones leads to delayed ossification, resulting in dysplastic and irregular epiphyseal development. Radiographic Features: On X-rays, epiphyseal dysgenesis manifests as fragmented, irregular, or stippled epiphyses, commonly observed in hypothyroid children. Growth Impairment: This condition is often associated with short stature, delayed skeletal maturation, and other symptoms like coarse facial features and developmental delay in untreated hypothyroidism. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. Cushing’s syndrome: Cushing’s syndrome leads to growth retardation and osteoporosis in children due to excess cortisol, but it does not typically cause epiphyseal dysgenesis. Instead, it affects the overall bone density and growth plates indirectly. C. Addison’s disease: Addison’s disease, characterized by adrenal insufficiency, does not significantly impact bone maturation or epiphyseal development. Its effects are more systemic, such as weakness, fatigue, and hypotension. D. Hypoparathyroidism: Hypoparathyroidism is associated with low calcium levels and may lead to calcifications in soft tissues but does not cause epiphyseal dysgenesis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency. 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency is a type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) characterized by: Virilization: Excessive production of androgens due to the enzymatic block in cortisol synthesis leads to masculinization or virilization in females. Hypertension: Accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a precursor with strong mineralocorticoid activity, causes sodium retention, hypernatremia, and hypertension. Low Renin Levels: The increased mineralocorticoid activity suppresses renin secretion, resulting in low renin levels. Hypokalemia: Increased sodium retention leads to potassium wasting, causing hypokalemia. The clinical picture of a virilized female child with hypertension, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and decreased renin levels strongly points to 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. 3 beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase deficiency: This condition is a rare form of CAH that can lead to ambiguous genitalia in both males and females due to impaired synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex steroids. However, hypertension and virilization are less pronounced, and the condition is more commonly associated with salt-wasting rather than hypernatremia and hypokalemia. C. 21 alpha hydroxylase deficiency: This is the most common form of CAH and typically causes virilization. However, it is associated with hypotension and salt-wasting (in the classic form) rather than hypertension, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia. Renin levels would be elevated in this condition due to aldosterone deficiency. D. Conn syndrome: Conn syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and low renin levels but is not associated with virilization, as androgen excess is not a feature of this condition. It typically occurs in adults rather than children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenoma, specifically an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma, also known as Cushing's disease, is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing syndrome in children. The adenoma leads to excessive ACTH secretion, stimulating the adrenal glands to produce high levels of cortisol. This results in symptoms such as weight gain, growth retardation, moon facies, central obesity, hypertension, and skin changes (e.g., striae, thinning of skin). In children, Cushing's disease accounts for the majority of endogenous causes of hypercortisolism. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Glucocorticoid ingestion: Although exogenous glucocorticoid ingestion (iatrogenic Cushing syndrome) is the most common overall cause of hypercortisolism, it does not fall under \"endogenous\" causes, which originate from within the body. This option is therefore incorrect. C. McCune Albright syndrome: McCune Albright syndrome is a rare cause of endogenous Cushing syndrome. It results from an activating mutation of the GNAS gene, leading to adrenal hyperfunction. However, it is much less common compared to pituitary adenomas in children. D. Tumors: Adrenal tumors, such as cortisol-secreting adenomas or carcinomas, are rare in children and are a less common cause of endogenous Cushing syndrome compared to pituitary adenomas.",

Glucokinase is an enzyme in the pancreas and liver that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood glucose levels by converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. In MODY2: Glucokinase mutations result in impaired glucose sensing in the pancreas, leading to a reduced insulin secretion in response to elevated blood glucose levels. Individuals with MODY2 typically present with mild, non-progressive hyperglycemia, often diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. MODY1: MODY1 is caused by mutations in the HNF4A gene (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha), which leads to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and impaired insulin secretion. This is not related to glucokinase deficiency. C. MODY3: MODY3 is caused by mutations in the HNF1A gene (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha), which also affects insulin secretion, but again, it does not involve glucokinase deficiency. D.
