      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Liver iron measurement by MRI The best investigation to monitor iron overload in patients with long-standing thalassemia is liver iron measurement by MRI. This technique uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess iron content in the liver, which is the primary site of iron deposition in cases of chronic transfusion therapy. It provides a non-invasive, reliable, and accurate way to quantify the degree of iron overload, which is crucial in guiding management and preventing complications like liver damage. Explanation for the other options: B. Cardiac iron measurement by MRI While cardiac iron measurement by MRI is important for detecting cardiac iron overload (which is a significant risk in thalassemia), it is not typically the first investigation to assess general iron overload. It is more specific to assessing the risk of heart failure or arrhythmias caused by excessive iron accumulation in the heart. C. Serum Free iron measurement Serum free iron levels are not a reliable marker for iron overload in thalassemia. This is because free iron in the blood is usually tightly regulated by transferrin, and serum levels may not reflect the degree of tissue iron deposition. D. Bone marrow ferritin levels after BM aspiration Bone marrow ferritin levels can give some indication of iron stores, but bone marrow aspiration is an invasive procedure that is not practical or commonly used to monitor iron overload in long-term thalassemia management. Non-invasive methods like MRI are preferred.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) DKC-1 gene detection The symptoms described in the case—short stature, poor growth, Café-au-lait spots, and bony abnormalities involving the radial bone and thumb—are characteristic of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which results in tubular bones abnormalities (such as radial bone and thumb issues) and Café-au-lait spots on the skin. Incorrect Answers: A. Chromosomal breakage test The chromosomal breakage test is useful in diagnosing Fanconi anemia, which involves chromosomal instability and increased susceptibility to breaks, but it may not be as useful for diagnosing NF1. However, it can help in conditions that show chromosomal abnormalities and is often part of workups for genetic disorders in children. B. Complementation test This test can be helpful in diagnosing conditions with defective DNA repair, such as Fanconi anemia or other genetic conditions associated with defects in DNA repair pathways. This may not be the first-line test for NF1, but it could potentially help in identifying related genetic issues, although NF1 is typically diagnosed based on clinical features and NF1 gene mutations. C. Gene sequencing Gene sequencing is the most appropriate test for diagnosing NF1, as the disorder is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. It will identify mutations in the NF1 gene, confirming the diagnosis. D. DKC-1 gene detection DKC1 gene mutations are associated with Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC), a rare inherited disorder that affects skin pigmentation, nails, and bone marrow function, and is not related to NF1. Since the clinical features presented do not align with Dyskeratosis Congenita, testing for the DKC1 gene would not be helpful in diagnosing NF1.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Intake of large amounts of unmodified cow's milk The most likely cause of microcytic anemia in an 18-month-old toddler is iron deficiency anemia, and one of the common dietary factors leading to this is the excessive intake of unmodified cow's milk. Cow's milk contains low levels of iron and can inhibit iron absorption. Additionally, cow's milk can cause gastrointestinal blood loss due to its potential to cause minor mucosal damage in the intestines, leading to iron loss. Consuming large amounts of cow's milk (more than 24 oz per day) is a well-known risk factor for iron deficiency anemia in toddlers. Explanation for the other options: A. Lack of fresh vegetables in the diet A lack of fresh vegetables may contribute to nutritional deficiencies in general, such as vitamins and minerals (especially vitamin C), but it is not a primary cause of microcytic anemia. The primary concern for microcytic anemia is iron deficiency, not the absence of vegetables. While vegetables provide some iron, they are not typically the primary source of iron for toddlers compared to other foods like meat and fortified cereals. B. Intake of inadequate amounts of fruit juice Inadequate fruit juice intake is not a significant factor in causing microcytic anemia. While fruit juice (particularly orange juice) can be a good source of vitamin C (which helps in iron absorption), a lack of fruit juice would not lead to microcytic anemia unless it is associated with a broader dietary deficiency. Fruit juice intake would more commonly be linked to scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) if it were absent, but this would not typically cause microcytic anemia on its own. C. Intake of excessive amounts of vitamin C Excessive vitamin C intake is not a cause of microcytic anemia. In fact, vitamin C is beneficial for iron absorption and typically does not interfere with iron levels in the body. High levels of vitamin C are not associated with causing iron deficiency anemia and would not lead to microcytic anemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lupus anticoagulant Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is not a congenital cause of hypercoagulable states. It is an acquired condition associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Lupus anticoagulant is an autoantibody that interferes with the normal clotting process, leading to an increased risk of thrombosis. However, it is not congenital, as it typically develops later in life, often in individuals with autoimmune disorders. Explanation for the other options: A. Protein C deficiency Protein C deficiency is a congenital hypercoagulable state. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant that helps regulate clotting by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa. A deficiency in Protein C increases the risk of abnormal clotting and venous thromboembolism. B. Protein S deficiency Protein S deficiency is another congenital hypercoagulable condition. Protein S works as a cofactor to Protein C in regulating clotting. A deficiency in Protein S also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. C. MTHFR mutation MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) mutation is a genetic risk factor for hypercoagulability. This mutation can lead to elevated homocysteine levels, which is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. It is considered a congenital or inherited hypercoagulable state.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) X-linked recessive Congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of sideroblasts in the bone marrow, which are erythroblasts with iron deposits in the mitochondria. This condition is often associated with a genetic defect that impairs heme synthesis. The most common form of congenital sideroblastic anemia is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Therefore, males, who have only one X chromosome, are typically affected, while females (who have two X chromosomes) are more likely to be carriers unless both X chromosomes are affected. Explanation for the other options: A. Sporadic Sporadic inheritance implies that the condition arises without a family history of the disorder and occurs due to random mutations. While some cases of sideroblastic anemia may occur sporadically, the most common inheritance pattern is X-linked recessive, not sporadic. C. Autosomal dominant In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of the mutated gene, inherited from either parent, is enough to cause the disorder. Sideroblastic anemia is not typically inherited in this manner. D. Autosomal recessive In autosomal recessive inheritance, an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. This is not the typical mode of inheritance for congenital sideroblastic anemia, although some rare forms of the condition may follow this pattern.",

Corticosteroids, particularly prednisone, are often effective in stimulating erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients. While DBA is a congenital disorder of red blood cell production, corticosteroids help some patients achieve partial or full remission, reducing the need for regular blood transfusions. Explanation for the other options: A. IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) IVIG is typically used for conditions with immune-mediated processes, such as autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiencies, but it is not the treatment of choice for Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

Erythropoietin Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow, but it is generally not effective in treating Diamond-Blackfan anemia, as the issue in DBA is not related to EPO deficiency but rather to intrinsic defects in red blood cell production. Corticosteroids are more effective in stimulating erythropoiesis in DBA patients. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Streptococcus pneumoniae The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in a child with CSF rhinorrhea (cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the nose) is Streptococcus pneumoniae. CSF rhinorrhea often occurs as a result of trauma, surgery, or conditions like sinusitis or skull base fractures. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children, particularly in cases where there is an underlying condition that increases the risk of bacterial entry into the central nervous system, such as CSF leaks. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a highly virulent pathogen that can cause both meningitis and pneumonia, and its presence in the CSF is particularly concerning in the setting of CSF leakage, as it can easily colonize the CSF space, leading to infection. Incorrect Responses: A. Streptococcus agalactiae: Incorrect. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a major cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis but is not typically associated with CSF rhinorrhea in older children or the general pediatric population. It usually causes meningitis in newborns, particularly in the first few days of life. C. Escherichia coli: Incorrect. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen in neonatal meningitis, particularly in premature infants or those with other risk factors such as low birth weight. However, it is not the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in a child with CSF rhinorrhea, where Streptococcus pneumoniae is more likely. D. Staphylococcus aureus: Incorrect. Staphylococcus aureus can cause a variety of infections, including meningitis and brain abscesses, but it is less commonly the cause of meningitis in the setting of CSF rhinorrhea compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Defect in common pathway The common pathway in the coagulation cascade involves factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, and X. Both the PT (prothrombin time) and APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) are prolonged when there is a defect in any of the components of the common pathway. Since both of these tests are prolonged in this case, the most likely diagnosis is a defect in one or more factors in the common pathway (such as factor V, factor X, or prothrombin), which can lead to a bleeding disorder. Explanation for the other options: A. Defect in extrinsic pathway The extrinsic pathway is primarily tested by the PT. A defect in this pathway (for example, a deficiency in factor VII) would typically only result in a prolonged PT, not a prolonged APTT. Therefore, a prolonged APTT would not be seen in isolation with a defect in the extrinsic pathway. B. Defect in intrinsic pathway The intrinsic pathway involves factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII, and a defect in this pathway would primarily affect the APTT (not PT). If the APTT is prolonged but the PT remains normal, the defect would likely be in the intrinsic pathway. However, in this case, both PT and APTT are elevated, making a defect in the intrinsic pathway less likely. C. Platelet function defect A platelet function defect would typically present with bleeding symptoms such as easy bruising, mucosal bleeding, or prolonged bleeding after injury. It would not typically affect the PT or APTT, which measure clotting factor function. A platelet defect would result in a normal PT and APTT with abnormal platelet function tests.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lewis The Lewis blood group is associated with antibodies that do not cause clinical hemolysis in the context of neonatal blood group incompatibility. Unlike other blood group incompatibilities (like ABO or Rh incompatibility), the Lewis antigen antibodies are typically IgM antibodies, which do not readily cross the placenta and hence, are less likely to cause hemolysis in the neonate. Therefore, in the case of neonatal blood group incompatibility, a Lewis blood group incompatibility is less likely to result in clinical hemolysis. Explanation for the other options: A. Bombay blood group The Bombay blood group is a rare blood group where individuals lack the H antigen (a precursor to A and B antigens). This can lead to severe hemolysis in the neonate when there is incompatibility between the mother and infant's blood group, resulting in a clinically significant hemolytic reaction. B. Kelly The Kelly blood group is associated with antibodies that may cause hemolysis in the newborn. It is relatively uncommon, but it can lead to blood group incompatibility and hemolysis in some cases. C. Duff The Duff blood group is another rare blood group, and incompatibility between the mother and infant's blood type can result in hemolysis. It is not typically associated with the absence of clinical hemolysis in neonates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atransferrinemia The likely diagnosis in this case is Atransferrinemia, a rare congenital disorder characterized by absence or severe deficiency of transferrin, the primary protein responsible for transporting iron in the bloodstream. In this condition, there is iron overload despite low iron availability in the plasma for hematopoiesis, leading to the microcytic hypochromic anemia observed in the blood picture. Key features supporting Atransferrinemia: Serum iron is low (20 ?g/dL), but ferritin is elevated (>800 ?g/L), suggesting iron overload within tissues, which is a hallmark of Atransferrinemia. Transferrin saturation is relatively high at 40%, which indicates that even though there is less transferrin, the available iron is being effectively bound to the small amount of transferrin present in the body. Explanation for the other options: A. Iron deficiency anemia In iron deficiency anemia, serum iron would typically be low, but ferritin would also be low. Ferritin >800 and high transferrin saturation do not fit the typical profile of iron deficiency anemia. B. Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload but typically presents with elevated serum iron and ferritin levels, along with increased transferrin saturation. However, microcytic anemia is not a typical feature of hemochromatosis. The microcytic hypochromic anemia seen here is more consistent with a disorder like Atransferrinemia, where iron is not adequately utilized due to lack of transferrin. D. DMT1 gene mutation DMT1 (Divalent Metal Transporter 1) mutations cause defects in iron absorption and transport, but these would typically lead to iron deficiency anemia, rather than the iron overload seen in this case. In DMT1 mutation-related anemia, iron levels would not be elevated as seen in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pseudo-vWD The condition described, with severe thrombocytopenia, decreased von Willebrand factor (vWF), and mildly decreased factor 8 levels, is most consistent with pseudo-von Willebrand disease (pseudo-vWD). Pseudo-vWD is a mimic of von Willebrand disease (vWD), but it is typically caused by thrombocytopenia or disorders affecting platelet function rather than a true deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor. In pseudo-vWD, the platelets are often involved in the process, which can result in decreased vWF and a mild decrease in factor VIII levels, similar to what is seen in vWD. Explanation for the other options: A. Type 1 Type 1 von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a mild form of vWD characterized by partial quantitative deficiency of vWF. It typically does not present with severe thrombocytopenia or marked decrease in factor VIII levels. The platelet count is usually normal in Type 1 vWD. B. Type 2A Type 2A von Willebrand disease is a qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), where the vWF is present but does not function properly. This can lead to bleeding symptoms, but it does not typically present with severe thrombocytopenia. Instead, there are abnormalities in platelet aggregation. C. Type 3 Type 3 von Willebrand disease is a severe form of vWD with complete absence of vWF. This type leads to severe bleeding and typically presents with very low or absent vWF levels, but it does not cause severe thrombocytopenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ankle In children with Hemophilia A, the joint most commonly affected by hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joint space) at an early age is the ankle. This is due to the anatomical position and the greater mobility of the ankle joint in young children, making it more vulnerable to traumatic injuries that can lead to bleeding into the joint. Explanation for other options: A. Knee While the knee joint is frequently affected in hemophilia, especially as children grow older, the ankle joint tends to be the first to show signs of hemarthrosis due to the relatively higher incidence of ankle injuries in children. C. Hip The hip joint is less commonly involved early in life because it is less mobile compared to other joints like the ankle or knee. Hemarthrosis in the hip occurs later in life in children with hemophilia, often after significant joint damage has already occurred in other areas. D. Elbow The elbow joint is another common site for hemarthrosis in hemophilia patients, but it is typically affected later in life than the ankle joint.

G6PD deficiency is an X-linked hereditary disorder that affects the enzyme responsible for protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage. In the absence of these triggering factors, individuals can remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. Explanation for the other options: A. Acute hemolytic crisis While acute hemolytic crises can occur in individuals with G6PD deficiency after exposure to oxidative stressors (e.g., certain medications or infections), it is not the most common presentation. These crises are often triggered and tend to be episodic rather than a constant issue. B. Gallstones Gallstones can develop as a complication of chronic hemolysis, which may be seen in some individuals with G6PD deficiency after repeated episodes of hemolysis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Presence of splenomegaly The presence of splenomegaly in a child with suspected immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a key feature that rules out ITP as the likely diagnosis. In ITP, the primary abnormality is an isolated low platelet count without significant organomegaly (hepatomegaly or splenomegaly). If splenomegaly is present, it suggests the possibility of a different underlying cause, such as hemolytic anemia, leukemia, or a viral infection with associated lymphoproliferative involvement. Explanation for the other options: A. Non-palpable lesions The presence of non-palpable petechiae is actually a common finding in ITP. Non-palpable petechiae can appear when platelets drop due to immune-mediated destruction, so this does not rule out ITP. B. Elevation of CRP An elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) indicates inflammation, which is often seen in viral infections, and it does not rule out ITP. ITP can be triggered by viral infections, and CRP may be elevated in the setting of an infection that precipitates the thrombocytopenia. C. Age of the child ITP is common in children, especially those between the ages of 2 and 6 years. The age of the child is consistent with a diagnosis of ITP, so it does not rule out the condition.",

Note the presence of shortened/hypoplastic forearm with thumb being present (Fanconi anemia has absent thumb as well). Points of difference of TAR syndrome V/S Fanconi anemia (from MCQ perspective) • In Fanconi anemia, thrombocytopenia is rarely present at birth; it develops later on in childhood or even in adulthood. • Radial defects are seen in only 30% of patients with Fanconi anemia; when present, such defects are usually associated with absent thumb, unlike in TAR, where radial defects are the sine qua non and the thumb is usually present, even though it could be abnormal",

These pigmented lesions are a hallmark feature of Fanconi anemia, a genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow and leads to pancytopenia (low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Explanation for the other options: B. Short stature Short stature is also a common finding in Fanconi anemia, but it is not the most prevalent or distinguishing physical feature. Short stature may develop over time due to growth hormone deficiency or delayed growth associated with the disorder. C. Ear anomalies Ear anomalies (such as microtia) can occur in Fanconi anemia but are less common than other physical findings, such as hyperpigmentation. These ear abnormalities are part of the spectrum of birth defects seen in some patients with Fanconi anemia, but they are not the most frequent manifestation. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 3-6 mg/kg/day The therapeutic dose of elemental iron for childhood iron-deficiency anemia typically ranges from 3-6 mg/kg/day. This dosage is recommended to replenish iron stores, increase hemoglobin levels, and correct the anemia. The iron is usually given in divided doses to maximize absorption and reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Explanation for the other options: A. 1-3 mg/kg/day This dose is too low to treat iron-deficiency anemia effectively. It may be used for prevention of iron deficiency, but not for treatment once anemia has developed. C. 6-12 mg/kg/day This dose is slightly higher than typically necessary for therapeutic treatment and could increase the risk of iron toxicity, especially if not carefully monitored. The recommended range is usually 3-6 mg/kg/day. D. 12-15 mg/kg/day This dose is typically too high for iron-deficiency anemia treatment in children.

The hallmark hematological abnormality in orotic aciduria is macrocytic anemia, which is characterized by the presence of large red blood cells (macrocytes) in the peripheral blood. This type of anemia occurs due to defective pyrimidine synthesis, leading to impaired DNA synthesis and resulting in abnormally large red blood cells. Explanation for the other options: A. Microcytic anemia Microcytic anemia is typically associated with iron deficiency or thalassemia, not orotic aciduria. In microcytic anemia, red blood cells are smaller than normal due to decreased hemoglobin content. C. Hemolysis Hemolysis is the destruction of red blood cells, which is not a characteristic feature of orotic aciduria. While hemolysis can occur in various other hematologic disorders, it is not commonly associated with this metabolic disorder. D.

It is caused by defects in the red blood cell membrane, leading to spherically shaped red blood cells that are more prone to hemolysis. In newborns, this condition can lead to neonatal jaundice and anemia due to the destruction of these abnormally shaped red blood cells. Explanation for the other options: B. Sickle cell trait Sickle cell trait refers to individuals who carry one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. While individuals with sickle cell trait typically do not exhibit hemolytic disease or sickle cell anemia, they do not usually develop severe hemolytic disease of the newborn. In contrast, sickle cell disease (homozygous for the sickle cell gene) can result in hemolysis, but not in the context of hemolytic disease of the newborn as described in this case. C. Dubin-Johnson syndrome Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism that leads to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, it does not present with hemolytic disease of the newborn, as it is not associated with red blood cell destruction. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sickle cell disease This 9-year-old African-American child presents with painful swelling in the hands and feet (likely due to dactylitis or hand-foot syndrome, a common symptom of sickle cell disease), along with abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, icterus (yellowing of the eyes), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). These are all typical signs of a painful sickle cell crisis, a common complication in individuals with sickle cell disease. In a sickle cell crisis, sickle-shaped red blood cells can block blood flow, leading to pain, organ damage, and other systemic symptoms. Explanation for the other options: B. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) While ALL can cause symptoms like fever, hepatomegaly, and tachycardia, it typically presents with pallor, bruising, and frequent infections due to bone marrow involvement. Painful swelling in the hands and feet is not a characteristic feature of ALL, making it less likely in this case. C. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) HSP is a small vessel vasculitis that typically presents with purpura (rash), abdominal pain, and arthritis, often following a viral infection. While abdominal pain is present in this child, HSP does not usually cause hepatomegaly, icterus, or painful swelling in the hands and feet. This makes it a less likely diagnosis in this case. D. Aplastic anemia Aplastic anemia results in pancytopenia (low red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets), leading to symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, easy bruising, and infections. It does not typically cause painful swelling of the hands and feet or hepatomegaly. This makes aplastic anemia less likely as a diagnosis for this child.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pernicious anemia A decreased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score is often found in pernicious anemia, a condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. In pernicious anemia, there is often decreased granulocyte function, which leads to a low LAP score. The LAP score is typically used to evaluate granulocyte activity, and a low score is seen in conditions that impair neutrophil function, such as pernicious anemia. Explanation for the other options: A. Leukaemoid reaction A leukaemoid reaction, which occurs in response to severe infections, inflammation, or other stressors, is associated with an increased LAP score, not a decreased one. The LAP score helps differentiate between leukemoid reaction and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), with a high LAP score indicating a reaction to infection or stress. B. Myelofibrosis Myelofibrosis is a condition characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the bone marrow, and while it can cause abnormal blood cell counts, it typically shows a normal to mildly decreased LAP score, not a marked decrease. However, this condition is more often associated with bone marrow abnormalities and cytopenias. D. Polycythemia Polycythemia is a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells, and it is usually associated with normal or elevated LAP scores, as there is no intrinsic dysfunction in the white blood cells or granulocytes to lower the score.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Absence of Alpha granules Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare inherited platelet disorder characterized by the absence of alpha granules in platelets. Alpha granules are essential for platelet function, and their absence leads to a defective platelet response to injury, contributing to bleeding symptoms. The condition is named for the grayish appearance of the platelets when viewed under a microscope, as they lack the typical granules that give platelets their normal appearance. Explanation for the other options: B. Absence of Gamma granules Gamma granules (also known as dense granules) are responsible for storing and releasing substances like ADP and calcium, which are important for platelet aggregation. Gray platelet syndrome is characterized by the absence of alpha granules, not gamma granules. C. Abnormal platelet aggregation in response to ristocetin Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) is typically abnormal in von Willebrand disease or Bernard-Soulier syndrome, but Gray platelet syndrome does not typically present with abnormal aggregation to ristocetin. Instead, platelets in GPS are deficient in alpha granules, which affects their function in clot formation. D. Pre-malignant condition Gray platelet syndrome is not considered a pre-malignant condition.

The condition is characterized by low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) due to autoimmune destruction of platelets, but clotting factors (such as PT and APTT) are usually normal because the coagulation cascade itself is not directly affected by ITP. Explanation for the other options: B. Preceded by viral infection ITP in children is often preceded by a viral infection, such as viral upper respiratory infections (e.g., rubella, varicella, or adenovirus). This viral infection may trigger an immune response leading to autoimmune platelet destruction, which is characteristic of ITP. C. Increased bone marrow megakaryocytes In ITP, the bone marrow typically shows increased megakaryocytes (the precursor cells to platelets), as the body attempts to compensate for the platelet loss by producing more platelets. However, despite this increased production, the platelets are being destroyed in circulation. D. VIG useful in severe cases Viral immunoglobulin (VIG) is useful in treating severe cases of ITP, particularly in cases of acute or chronic ITP with significant bleeding or risk of bleeding.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Factor XIII The patient described has recurrent bleeding episodes (epistaxis, hematuria, hematochezia), and the urea clot lysis test is positive, which suggests a deficiency in Factor XIII. Factor XIII deficiency is a rare inherited bleeding disorder that typically presents with delayed bleeding after trauma or surgery, and can present early in life with excessive bleeding, including from the umbilical stump at birth. The urea clot lysis test is used to detect Factor XIII deficiency. Normally, after the formation of a clot, Factor XIII stabilizes the fibrin clot by cross-linking the fibrin molecules, preventing premature clot dissolution. In the case of Factor XIII deficiency, the clot is unstable, leading to clot lysis (breakdown of the clot) when exposed to urea, resulting in a positive urea clot lysis test. Explanation for the other options: A. Factor X Deficiency of Factor X (a part of the common pathway of coagulation) typically causes bleeding symptoms, but it does not cause a positive urea clot lysis test. The clotting time (PT and APTT) would also be prolonged in Factor X deficiency, which is not the case here. B. Factor XI Factor XI deficiency leads to a bleeding disorder, often in the form of mild hemophilia. Like Factor X deficiency, it does not affect the stability of the clot itself and would not cause a positive urea clot lysis test. The PT, APTT, and fibrinogen levels would be affected in Factor XI deficiency, which is not observed in this case. C. Factor XII Factor XII deficiency may increase the risk of thromboembolism but does not typically present with significant bleeding problems. It does not cause a positive urea clot lysis test, and the bleeding symptoms in the patient are not consistent with Factor XII deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Blood cell counts Deferiprone is an iron chelating agent used in the treatment of iron overload, particularly in patients with thalassemia or other conditions requiring repeated blood transfusions. While it is effective at reducing iron levels, Deferiprone can cause bone marrow suppression, which may lead to neutropenia (low white blood cell count) or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Therefore, it is crucial to monitor blood cell counts regularly (especially absolute neutrophil count) to detect any early signs of bone marrow suppression, as this can lead to serious infections or bleeding complications. Explanation for the other options: A. LFT (Liver Function Test) Although liver function tests are important for monitoring any drug therapy, Deferiprone is not particularly associated with significant liver toxicity, so routine LFT monitoring is not the most critical aspect of therapy. B. RFT (Renal Function Test) While renal function should always be monitored during any long-term therapy, Deferiprone is not commonly associated with renal toxicity, so regular monitoring of renal function is not as important as monitoring blood cell counts in this case. D. LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) LDH levels are more useful in detecting tissue damage, hemolysis, or certain cancers, but LDH monitoring is not specific to Deferiprone use. The primary concern with Deferiprone is its potential to affect blood cell counts, particularly white blood cells and platelets.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thalassemia The hair-on-end appearance seen on X-ray skull is classically associated with thalassemia, particularly beta-thalassemia major. This radiological finding results from expansion of the bone marrow in response to chronic anemia and the body's attempt to compensate by increasing erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) in the bone marrow. The trabeculae (bone structures) in the skull appear more prominent and spiky, resembling hair on end. This appearance is a result of bone marrow hyperplasia, where the bone marrow tries to compensate for the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity due to chronic hemolytic anemia. Explanation for the other options: B. Hydrocephalus Hydrocephalus is characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain, leading to increased head size and possibly causing a variety of neurological symptoms. While the condition may be visible on an X-ray or CT scan, it does not typically produce the hair-on-end appearance on the skull. C. Chronic malaria While malaria can cause anemia, it does not lead to the hair-on-end appearance on the skull X-ray. Chronic anemia due to malaria is generally not associated with the same degree of bone marrow hyperplasia as seen in thalassemia. D. Myelophthisis Myelophthisis refers to the replacement of bone marrow by abnormal tissue, such as tumor cells or fibrous tissue.

Patients with thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions to manage anemia, which can lead to the accumulation of iron in various organs, including the heart. Over time, this excess iron can cause myocardial damage, leading to cardiomyopathy and ultimately heart failure. This is one of the primary complications that contribute to increased mortality in these patients. Explanation for the other options: A. BM suppression (Bone marrow suppression) While bone marrow suppression can occur in thalassemia, especially in the context of treatment (such as chelation therapy or medications), it is not the most common cause of death. Bone marrow suppression typically causes anemia or neutropenia but is less directly fatal than the complications associated with iron overload and cardiac dysfunction. B. Secondary infections Patients with thalassemia are at an increased risk of infections, particularly due to splenectomy or immunosuppressive treatments. However, infections are generally not the most common cause of death in these patients, as iron overload-related cardiac complications are more prevalent. D.

Explanation for the other options: A. Thalassemia Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that results in abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia. In this condition, the red blood cells are smaller than normal (microcytic) and have less hemoglobin (hypochromic). Therefore, it is associated with microcytic anemia. B. Sideroblastic anemia Sideroblastic anemia is a group of disorders where the bone marrow produces ringed sideroblasts (immature red blood cells with iron deposits). It leads to microcytic anemia because of impaired hemoglobin production. The anemia is often microcytic due to iron utilization issues. C. Lead poisoning Lead poisoning interferes with several enzymatic processes in the heme synthesis pathway, leading to microcytic anemia. It inhibits enzymes involved in hemoglobin production, causing microcytic hypochromic anemia, especially in children who are exposed to lead.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) X-linked Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked genetic disorder, meaning it is inherited on the X chromosome. Because males have only one X chromosome (XY), they are more frequently affected by G6PD deficiency. Females, who have two X chromosomes (XX), are usually carriers if they inherit the defective gene on one X chromosome and will show symptoms only if both X chromosomes carry the mutation (which is rare). Explanation for the other options: B. Acquired G6PD deficiency is not acquired; it is an inherited genetic condition. However, certain triggers (such as infections, certain medications, or food like fava beans) can cause hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, but the deficiency itself is genetically inherited. C. AR (Autosomal Recessive) G6PD deficiency is not autosomal recessive. It is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that the defective gene is located on the X chromosome, not one of the autosomal chromosomes. D. AD (Autosomal Dominant) G6PD deficiency is not autosomal dominant. If it were, an individual with just one copy of the mutated gene (from either parent) would exhibit the condition, but this is not the case for G6PD deficiency, which is X-linked.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Antifibrinolytics In von Willebrand disease (vWD), mucosal bleeding (such as nosebleeds, gum bleeding, and heavy menstrual bleeding) is a common feature, especially in types 1 and 2. Antifibrinolytics (such as tranexamic acid) are particularly useful in controlling mucosal bleeding in all types of von Willebrand disease (vWD) because they help to prevent the breakdown of clots by inhibiting the fibrinolytic process. By stabilizing blood clots at the site of injury, antifibrinolytics effectively reduce mucosal bleeding. Explanation for the other options: A. Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is often used to treat type 1 von Willebrand disease by stimulating the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII from the endothelial cells, helping to improve hemostasis. However, it is not effective in all types of vWD, especially in types 2B and 3, where there is a more significant deficiency or dysfunction of vWF. B. FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma) FFP contains all coagulation factors, including vWF, but it is generally not the first-line therapy for vWD. vWF concentrates (which contain higher concentrations of von Willebrand factor) are preferred for more severe cases of vWD, particularly in type 3, where there is a significant deficiency of vWF. D. vWF concentrates While vWF concentrates are highly effective in treating severe cases of von Willebrand disease, especially in type 3 vWD, they are typically used in more severe bleeding episodes or pre-surgical settings, rather than for routine management of mucosal bleeding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) The most common cause of acquired red cell aplasia in children is Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC). TEC is a condition that primarily affects children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years and is characterized by a temporary failure of red blood cell production in the bone marrow. The condition is typically self-limiting, and most children recover without any long-term complications. The exact cause is often unknown, but it is thought to be associated with viral infections or immune-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis. Explanation for the other options: A. Parvovirus B19 Parvovirus B19 is a well-known cause of acute red cell aplasia, particularly in children with hemolytic disorders like sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Parvovirus B19 can infect erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and cause temporary aplastic crisis, but it is not the most common cause of acquired red cell aplasia in healthy children. B. Mitochondrial defects Mitochondrial defects can lead to a variety of hematologic issues, including anemia and other cytopenias, but they are not a common cause of acquired red cell aplasia in children. Mitochondrial diseases are usually associated with other systemic issues and are much rarer. D. HLH syndrome Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe and often life-threatening condition involving immune dysregulation, which can lead to cytopenias, including red cell aplasia. However, HLH is much less common than TEC and is usually associated with systemic inflammation and multiorgan involvement. It is not the most common cause of acquired red cell aplasia in children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) >1% In a normal, healthy individual, red blood cells (RBCs) are continuously produced and replaced by the bone marrow to maintain proper blood oxygen-carrying capacity. On a daily basis, approximately 1% of the total RBCs in the body are replaced through a process of erythropoiesis. This rate of RBC turnover is sufficient to replace the RBCs lost through natural destruction in the spleen and other organs without causing any significant alteration in the total RBC count. Explanation for the other options: B. 1-5% This percentage range is not accurate for the daily RBC replacement rate in a healthy person. The replacement rate is typically less than 1% in a normal, steady state. C. 5-10% A 5-10% daily replacement rate would be considered unusually high. Such a high turnover might be seen in certain conditions like hemolytic anemia or after significant blood loss, but it is not typical in healthy individuals. D. >10% Replacing more than 10% of RBCs each day would be an abnormal process and usually reflects a pathological state such as severe hemolysis or excessive blood loss.",
