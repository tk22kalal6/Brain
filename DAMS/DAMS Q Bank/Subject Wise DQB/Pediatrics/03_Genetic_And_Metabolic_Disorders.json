      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 25%. 25%: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. If the first child is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, this indicates that both parents are carriers of the CF gene mutation, as the child must have inherited one mutated gene from each parent. Since both parents are carriers, the chance for each child to inherit two mutated genes (one from each parent) and thus develop cystic fibrosis is 25%. The other 75% chance would result in the child either being a carrier or not affected. C. 50%: This answer is incorrect because, even though both parents are carriers, there is only a 25% chance (not 50%) for the child to inherit both mutated copies of the CF gene and be affected by cystic fibrosis. The 50% chance would be correct if one parent had the disease and the other was a carrier.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Multiple carboxylase deficiency. D. Multiple carboxylase deficiency: This metabolic disorder is caused by a defect in the biotin-dependent carboxylase enzymes, leading to a deficiency in enzymes involved in several metabolic pathways, including fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism. Symptoms often begin in infancy and include failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis, elevated blood ketone levels, seizures, and skin rashes. The skin rash is often due to a biotin deficiency, which is common in this condition. This fits well with the clinical presentation described in the question. Incorrect responses: A. Propionic acidemia: Propionic acidemia is a disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, typically presenting with similar symptoms (e.g., metabolic acidosis, seizures, failure to thrive) but without the characteristic skin rash seen in multiple carboxylase deficiency. Also, propionic acidemia often shows increased propionyl-CoA in the blood, rather than the ketone levels mentioned here. Hence, this is less likely than multiple carboxylase deficiency. B. Urea cycle disorder: Urea cycle disorders typically cause hyperammonemia rather than metabolic acidosis and ketonuria. While failure to thrive and seizures are common, urea cycle disorders do not present with increased blood ketone levels or the skin rash seen in this case. Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct diagnosis. C. PKU (Phenylketonuria): PKU presents with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and fair skin and blue eyes, not the combination of failure to thrive, seizures, metabolic acidosis, and skin rash seen in the patient. Additionally, blood tests would show elevated phenylalanine levels rather than ketone bodies. Hence, PKU is an unlikely diagnosis here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phenylketonuria. In Phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder, there is a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the body. This accumulation can result in a distinct mousy or musty odor in the urine. The mousy odor is due to the build-up of phenylacetic acid, a byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism. This condition is typically diagnosed through newborn screening and requires dietary management to prevent intellectual disability and other neurological issues. Now, let's examine the incorrect options: A. Isovaleric acidemia: This is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, leading to a buildup of isovaleric acid. It can cause a distinctive \"sweaty feet\" odor rather than a mousy odor in the urine. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B. Maple syrup urine disease: This genetic disorder is due to a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, resulting in the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids and their corresponding alpha-keto acids. The condition is characterized by a sweet, maple syrup-like odor in the urine, not a mousy odor. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Tyrosinemia: This disorder involves a deficiency in the enzymes responsible for the breakdown of tyrosine, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites. However, tyrosinemia typically does not cause a mousy odor in the urine. Instead, the urine may have a strong, cabbage-like smell. Thus, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Genomic imprinting. Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is most commonly caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Genomic imprinting, a mechanism in which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, is not involved in the genetic basis of Down syndrome. In Down syndrome, the extra chromosome 21 is typically inherited from one parent, but the specific expression of genes due to imprinting is not a relevant factor in this condition. Now, let's review the incorrect options: A. Robertsonian translocation: This is a form of chromosomal rearrangement that can lead to Down syndrome. In this case, part of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, usually chromosome 14, resulting in an extra copy of chromosome 21. This type of translocation is a well-known mechanism in the genetics of Down syndrome. C. Non-disjunction of maternal chromosomes: This is the most common cause of Down syndrome. It occurs when the 21st chromosome pair fails to separate properly during meiosis, resulting in an egg or sperm with two copies of chromosome 21, which, upon fertilization, leads to trisomy 21. D. Mosaicism: Mosaic Down syndrome occurs when some cells have the typical two copies of chromosome 21, while others have three. This is due to an error in cell division during early development, leading to a mixture of normal and trisomic cells. It is a recognized genetic mechanism for Down syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Duodenal atresia. Duodenal atresia is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants with Down syndrome. It occurs due to a congenital absence or closure of a segment of the duodenum, leading to a blockage that prevents the normal passage of food. This condition is present in about 20-30% of infants with Down syndrome and is often diagnosed prenatally through ultrasound or immediately after birth. A key radiological sign of duodenal atresia is the \"double bubble\" appearance, seen on an X-ray, where the stomach and duodenum are distended with air due to the obstruction. Incorrect options: B. Jejunal atresia: Jejunal atresia, where there is a blockage or absence of a portion of the jejunum, is less common in Down syndrome compared to duodenal atresia. While it can cause intestinal obstruction, it is not the most frequent cause in these individuals. C. Hirschsprung disease: Hirschsprung disease, which results from the absence of ganglion cells in the colon, leading to functional obstruction, is seen in some individuals with Down syndrome. However, it is not as common as duodenal atresia as a cause of intestinal obstruction in these patients. D. Colonic atresia: Colonic atresia, a rare condition where a part of the colon is narrowed or absent, is an infrequent cause of intestinal obstruction in general. It is even rarer in individuals with Down syndrome, making it an unlikely cause in this context.",

Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) is a severe chromosomal disorder characterized by a high mortality rate, with most affected infants dying within the first year of life, often due to cardiac or other organ complications. Only a very small percentage of individuals with Edwards syndrome live beyond 5 years, making the statement about life expectancy inaccurate for the majority of patients. Incorrect options: A. Association with advanced maternal age: Edwards syndrome is indeed associated with advanced maternal age. Similar to other trisomy conditions, the risk of having a child with Edwards syndrome increases with the mother's age, particularly after 35 years. Therefore, this association is correct. B. Digit abnormalities: Digit abnormalities, such as clenched fists with overlapping fingers, are a characteristic feature of Edwards syndrome. These abnormalities are commonly seen in infants affected by trisomy 18. This makes this option incorrect as it is observed in Edwards syndrome. D. Rocker bottom feet: Rocker bottom feet, where the soles of the feet appear rounded with an abnormal arch, are a typical physical finding in Edwards syndrome. This abnormality is one of the key features that help in the diagnosis of the condition. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Trisomy 13. The combination of microcephaly, cleft palate, hypotelorism (close-set eyes), and scalp defects is characteristic of Trisomy 13, also known as Patau syndrome. Trisomy 13 is associated with severe intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies, including the facial abnormalities mentioned in the question. These features are highly suggestive of Patau syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13. Incorrect options: A. Trisomy 21: While Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is associated with intellectual disability and various physical abnormalities, it typically does not present with the same combination of facial defects as seen in this case. Common features of Down syndrome include a flat facial profile, upward slanting eyes, and a small mouth, but not cleft palate or hypotelorism. B. Trisomy 18: Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) presents with abnormalities such as clenched hands, rocker bottom feet, and prominent occiput, but the specific combination of microcephaly, cleft palate, hypotelorism, and scalp defects is more typical of Trisomy 13. While facial abnormalities can occur in Trisomy 18, they are different from those seen in Patau syndrome. D. Trisomy 8: Trisomy 8 is a rare chromosomal disorder that can present with features like developmental delay, skeletal abnormalities, and skin changes, but it does not typically cause the facial anomalies described in the question. The combination of microcephaly, cleft palate, hypotelorism, and scalp defects is not characteristic of Trisomy 8.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a condition that occurs when a female is born with only one complete X chromosome instead of the usual two (45,X karyotype). One of the common features at birth in Turner syndrome is webbed neck, which is a result of excess skin on the neck due to lymphatic malformations. Other features that may be observed include low-set ears, a broad chest, and short stature. While these features can vary, the webbed neck is one of the most distinctive and early signs of the syndrome. Incorrect options: A. Noonan syndrome: Noonan syndrome can present with some facial features similar to Turner syndrome, such as a webbed neck, but it is not as consistently seen at birth. It also involves other features like heart defects and developmental delay. Webbed neck is not as specific to Noonan syndrome as it is to Turner syndrome, making this option less likely. C. Fragile X syndrome: Fragile X syndrome is typically characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and a long, narrow face with large ears, but it does not commonly present with webbed neck at birth. The physical features of Fragile X syndrome tend to become more apparent as the child grows, making it an unlikely option for the question. D. Down syndrome: Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21 and presents with intellectual disability, characteristic facial features (such as a flat face and epicanthal folds), and hypotonia. While some individuals with Down syndrome may have a webbed neck, it is not a primary or characteristic feature seen at birth, making it less likely to be the correct answer compared to Turner syndrome",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Somatic gene mutation. The combination of webbed neck, short stature, antimongoloid slant of eyes, and obesity in a male child suggests a rare condition that is not typically associated with a chromosomal abnormality like the ones listed in the other options. Somatic mutations, which occur in the body cells after fertilization, can lead to developmental and physical abnormalities in a localized or mosaic fashion, which might explain these specific symptoms in this child. This option reflects a condition that does not follow the usual patterns of chromosomal syndromes. Incorrect options: A. 45, XO genotype: The 45,XO genotype refers to Turner syndrome, which affects females and is characterized by a missing or incomplete second X chromosome. Turner syndrome typically does not occur in males. This makes this option incorrect for the given description of a male child. B. Trisomy 11: Trisomy 11 is a rare chromosomal abnormality and is not typically associated with the features described in the question (webbed neck, short stature, antimongoloid slant, obesity). Therefore, this is an unlikely genetic abnormality for this particular presentation. C. 45, XO/46, XY mosaicism: This refers to a mosaic form of Turner syndrome, where there is a mixture of cells with 45,XO (missing one X chromosome) and 46,XY (normal male chromosome complement). Although Turner syndrome can present with webbed neck and short stature, it typically occurs in females, and this case describes a male child. Additionally, this pattern is less likely given the other features of the case, making this option less appropriate.",

This gene is responsible for encoding a protein involved in regulating the expression of other genes in the brain. Mutations in MECP2 lead to a loss of normal brain function, resulting in developmental regression, loss of purposeful hand movements, gait abnormalities, and cognitive impairments. MECP2 mutations are the most common cause of Rett syndrome. Incorrect options: A. RET: The RET gene is primarily associated with Hirschsprung disease and certain types of cancer, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma. It is not involved in Rett syndrome. B. P53: The P53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene involved in preventing cancer by regulating cell division and apoptosis. Mutations in P53 are commonly linked to various cancers but are not involved in Rett syndrome. C. RB: The RB gene (retinoblastoma gene) is associated with retinoblastoma and other cancers. It plays a critical role in controlling the cell cycle. However, mutations in the RB gene are not responsible for Rett syndrome",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Krabbe’s disease. Globoid cells are a diagnostic feature of Krabbe’s disease, which is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC), leading to the accumulation of psychosine, which is toxic to the nervous system. One of the hallmark features of Krabbe's disease is the presence of globoid cells, which are abnormal, multinucleated macrophages found in the brain and other tissues. These cells are a key finding in the histopathological examination of affected individuals. Incorrect options: B. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is a viral infection of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. It does not involve globoid cells but instead presents with demyelination in the brain. Therefore, it is not associated with globoid cells. C. Tay-Sachs disease: Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain. Although it results in neurodegeneration, Tay-Sachs is not characterized by globoid cells, but rather by cherry-red spots in the retina. D. Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD): MLD is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A, leading to the accumulation of sulfatides in the brain and nervous system. While MLD involves demyelination and other neurological issues, it is not characterized by globoid cells. Instead, it is associated with lipid-laden macrophages and metachromatic staining.",

Developed initially as an herbicide, it was later found to be beneficial in hereditary type 1 tyrosinemia in which the absence of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the fifth step in tyrosine catabolism, causes build-up of toxic intermediates that cause early onset liver failure and severe renal tubular dysfunction. Treatment of infants and children with nitisinone combined with a low protein diet led to reversal of liver failure and correction of renal tubular dysfunction, allowing for normal growth and development. Children treated before the onset of liver failure avoided the need for liver transplantation and did not develop hepatocellular carcinoma, common outcomes before the availability of this agent.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/2(651).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Deficiency of galactokinase produces very mild disease with the only significant complication being cataract formation. • In contrast, homozygous deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase produces severe disease culminating in death in infancy. • In addition to galactosemia and galactosuria, these patients have impaired renal tubular resorption leading to aminoaciduria, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, cataracts, bleeding diathesis, hypoglycemia, and mental retardation. • Pathologically, the CNS shows neuronal loss and gliosis and the liver shows fatty change progressing to cirrhosis. Benign disease with cataract formation (choice A) is characteristic of galactokinase deficiency. • Chronic emphysema (choice B) is not associated with homozygous galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency, but rather with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. • Impaired tubular reabsorption (producing aminoaciduria) is seen within a few days or weeks of feeding milk to an infant with severe galactosemia, as opposed to chronic renal failure appearing in adolescence (choice C).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gaucher disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available for Gaucher disease, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down a lipid called glucocerebroside. In Gaucher disease, the accumulation of this lipid leads to organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. ERT involves the intravenous administration of recombinant glucocerebrosidase to replace the deficient enzyme, helping to reduce the symptoms and improve organ function. Incorrect options: A. Albinism: Albinism is a genetic condition characterized by a lack of melanin production due to mutations in genes involved in pigmentation. It is not related to enzyme deficiencies, and there is currently no enzyme replacement therapy for albinism. C. Niemann-Pick disease: Niemann-Pick disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiencies in enzymes like acid sphingomyelinase (for type A and B) or NPC1 (for type C). While there are some treatments in development, enzyme replacement therapy is not widely available for all types of Niemann-Pick disease, making it an incorrect choice in this context. D. Metachromatic leukodystrophy: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A, leading to the accumulation of sulfatides in the nervous system.
