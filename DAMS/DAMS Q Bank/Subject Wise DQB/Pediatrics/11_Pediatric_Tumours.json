      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hemangioma. Hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors in children. These are typically composed of abnormal blood vessels and often appear on the skin (cutaneous hemangiomas), but they can also be found in internal organs such as the liver. In infants, hemangiomas often appear shortly after birth and grow during the first few months of life before gradually shrinking and disappearing, often without the need for treatment. While most hemangiomas do not cause significant problems, larger or more complicated ones may require intervention. Incorrect options: B. Teratoma: Teratomas are benign tumors composed of different types of tissues, such as hair, muscle, or bone. They are relatively common in children but are not as prevalent as hemangiomas. Teratomas most commonly occur in the ovaries and testes, and they can sometimes present as sacrococcygeal masses in newborns. While they can grow large and require surgical removal, they are less common than hemangiomas. C. Leukemia: Leukemia is a malignant (cancerous) condition, not a benign tumor. It involves the uncontrolled growth of abnormal white blood cells. Leukemia is one of the most common types of cancer in children, but it is not classified as a benign tumor. The question specifically asks for a benign tumor, making leukemia an incorrect answer. D. Osteoma: Osteomas are benign bone tumors that can occur in children but are much less common than hemangiomas. They are typically slow-growing and found in the skull or facial bones. While osteomas are benign, they are not as frequently diagnosed in pediatric patients compared to hemangiomas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. It is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, characterized by an overproduction of immature white blood cells (lymphoblasts). ALL typically affects children between the ages of 2 and 5 years. It is treatable with chemotherapy and has a relatively high survival rate when diagnosed early, but it remains the most common form of cancer in the pediatric population. Incorrect options: A. Wilm’s tumour: Wilm's tumor is a type of kidney cancer that occurs in children, typically under the age of 5. While it is the most common kidney cancer in children, it is not the most common overall malignancy. Wilm’s tumor is much less common than ALL, which is a blood cancer. B. Lymphomas: Lymphomas (which include Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) are cancers of the lymphatic system. While lymphomas are common in children, they do not surpass ALL in frequency. They are more common in adolescents, but ALL remains the most prevalent childhood malignancy. D. Brain tumours: Brain tumors are the second most common malignancy in children, after leukemia. Although they can be serious and often require complex treatment, brain tumors are less common than ALL, which affects the blood and bone marrow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Retinoblastomas are the most common inherited malignancy in children. Retinoblastoma can be either hereditary or sporadic. Hereditary cases usually are diagnosed at a younger age and are multifocal and bilateral, whereas sporadic cases are usually diagnosed in older children who tend to have unilateral, unifocal involvement. The hereditary form is associated with loss of function of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) via gene mutation or deletion. The RB1 gene is located on chromosome 13q14 and encodes the retinoblastoma protein, a tumor suppressor protein that controls cell-cycle phase transition and has roles in apoptosis and cell differentiation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngiomas are benign tumors that typically occur near the pituitary gland, often in the suprasellar region. These tumors are frequently associated with calcification on imaging studies, and the presence of suprasellar calcification is a classic feature of craniopharyngiomas. Craniopharyngiomas can cause symptoms such as visual disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and headaches due to their location and pressure on nearby structures. Calcification in the tumor is often seen in CT scans or MRI as well, helping in the diagnosis. Incorrect options: B. Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastomas are malignant tumors that primarily occur in the cerebellum in children. These tumors are not typically associated with suprasellar calcification. While they may have certain characteristic features on imaging (like posterior fossa involvement), calcification is not commonly seen in medulloblastomas, and the location is different from that of craniopharyngiomas. C. Papilloma of the choroid plexus: Papillomas of the choroid plexus are benign tumors that arise from the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain. They can cause hydrocephalus but are not typically associated with suprasellar calcification. They may present with imaging findings related to the ventricular system but do not generally have calcification in the suprasellar region. D. Oligodendroglioma: Oligodendrogliomas are slow-growing tumors that originate from oligodendrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain. While calcification can be seen in oligodendrogliomas on imaging, it is not commonly suprasellar. Oligodendrogliomas are typically located in the cerebral hemispheres and are not associated with the classic suprasellar calcifications seen in craniopharyngiomas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Astrocytoma. Astrocytomas are the most common type of posterior fossa tumors in children. These tumors arise from astrocytes, which are a type of glial cell in the brain. In children, posterior fossa tumors most frequently occur in the cerebellum and are often low-grade astrocytomas (such as pilocytic astrocytoma). These tumors are usually slow-growing and have a relatively good prognosis compared to other types of brain tumors. They may present with symptoms like headache, ataxia, and nausea due to increased intracranial pressure from the tumor mass. Incorrect options: A. Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastomas are indeed one of the most common malignant tumors in the posterior fossa in children, but they are not the most common overall. Medulloblastomas are more aggressive and present with more significant neurological symptoms due to their rapid growth. They arise from the cerebellum and typically occur in younger children. B. Glioblastoma multiforme: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant tumor but is not the most common tumor in the posterior fossa in children. GBM is more commonly seen in adults, and while it can occur in children, it is relatively rare in the pediatric population. GBM tends to occur in the cerebral hemispheres, not the posterior fossa. D. Meningioma: Meningiomas are typically benign tumors that arise from the meninges (the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord). They are most common in adults and are rarely seen in children. When they do occur in children, they are more likely to be located in the supratentorial region rather than the posterior fossa.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Wilms tumor. Wilms tumor (also known as nephroblastoma) is the most likely diagnosis for this child based on the presence of a mass in the abdomen along with other associated features. Wilms tumor is the most common renal malignancy in children and often presents with an abdominal mass that can be palpated during routine activities such as bathing. In addition, Wilms tumor is associated with certain congenital anomalies, such as aniridia (absence of the iris), hypospadias (a malformation of the male urethra), horseshoe kidney (where the kidneys are fused), and hemihypertrophy (asymmetric growth of one side of the body). These features are part of the WAGR syndrome, a condition caused by a deletion of the 11p13 chromosome region, which increases the risk of developing Wilms tumor. Incorrect options: A. Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is a cancer that originates from neuroblasts (immature nerve cells) and commonly arises in the adrenal glands, though it can also occur in other parts of the sympathetic nervous system. While it can present with an abdominal mass, neuroblastoma is not typically associated with the congenital anomalies described in the question. Additionally, neuroblastomas often have a different set of symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and bone pain. C. Hepatoblastoma: Hepatoblastoma is a rare liver tumor that typically occurs in children younger than 3 years old. It can present with an abdominal mass, but it is not associated with the congenital abnormalities mentioned in this case, such as aniridia, hypospadias, horseshoe kidney, or hemihypertrophy. Hepatoblastoma primarily affects the liver, whereas Wilms tumor originates in the kidneys. D. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle tissue, and while it can present with an abdominal mass, it is not associated with the specific congenital features described here. Rhabdomyosarcoma typically affects soft tissues, such as the head, neck, genitourinary tract, and extremities, rather than the kidneys. [4:55 pm, 11/1/2025] Rakesh Sir (DAMS) -Office:",

It typically arises in the cerebellum (posterior fossa) and is classified as a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Medulloblastomas are highly malignant, tend to spread via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways, and require a combination of surgery, radiation (depending on age), and chemotherapy. Incorrect Options: A. Glioblastoma – Incorrect Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults, not children. It is a highly aggressive astrocytic tumor and is rare in the pediatric population. B. Astrocytoma – Incorrect Astrocytomas are actually the most common overall brain tumors in children, but many of them (like pilocytic astrocytoma) are benign or low-grade. While astrocytomas can be malignant, medulloblastoma is the most common malignant type in children. D. Meningioma – Incorrect Meningiomas are typically benign tumors and are far more common in adults. They are rare in children and are not considered a common cause of pediatric brain malignancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CD1a. The presence of Langerhans giant cells and scattered lesions in the skull are suggestive of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells, a type of dendritic cell, in various tissues. CD1a is the most important marker associated with Langerhans cells. It is a cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed on these cells and is widely used in the diagnosis of LCH, as it helps differentiate Langerhans cells from other cell types. Incorrect options: B. CD3: CD3 is a marker that is primarily found on T lymphocytes and is not associated with Langerhans cells or Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. CD3 is more relevant for diagnosing T-cell-related conditions, such as certain lymphomas or autoimmune diseases. C. CD208: CD208, also known as DC-LAMP, is a marker for dendritic cells. While dendritic cells are involved in immune responses, CD208 is not specific for Langerhans cells and is not the most common marker associated with LCH. It is more typically used to identify certain subsets of dendritic cells but not specifically Langerhans cells. D. CD68: CD68 is a marker for macrophages and monocytes, not Langerhans cells. While CD68 may be expressed by some cells within LCH lesions (as macrophages are often present), it is not a specific or diagnostic marker for Langerhans cells. The most specific marker for LCH remains CD1a.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) ALL. L-asparaginase is primarily used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. L-asparaginase works by breaking down asparagine, an amino acid essential for the growth of leukemia cells. Normal cells can produce their own asparagine, but leukemia cells depend on an external supply of it. By depleting asparagine levels, L-asparaginase inhibits the growth of leukemia cells and is a crucial component of chemotherapy regimens for ALL, especially in children. Incorrect options: A. AML: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a different type of leukemia that affects the myeloid lineage of blood cells. L-asparaginase is not typically used in the treatment of AML. AML treatment generally involves chemotherapy agents like cytarabine, daunorubicin, and others rather than L-asparaginase. C. CML: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of leukemia that is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Treatment for CML usually includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib) rather than L-asparaginase. L-asparaginase is not effective in treating CML. D. CLL: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a form of leukemia that typically affects older adults and is characterized by the gradual accumulation of mature, but functionally incompetent, lymphocytes. L-asparaginase is not used in CLL treatment, which typically involves chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies like ibrutinib.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CNS. The central nervous system (CNS) is the most common site of extramedullary relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This is because leukemia cells can infiltrate the brain and spinal cord, leading to relapse even when the disease is in remission in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. In ALL, particularly in certain high-risk cases, the blood-brain barrier is not sufficient to prevent the infiltration of leukemic cells into the CNS. This relapse can cause neurological symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, cranial nerve palsies, and seizures. Consequently, CNS prophylaxis (using intrathecal chemotherapy) is a key part of treatment to prevent such relapses. Incorrect options: B. Lung: The lungs are not a common site for extramedullary relapse in ALL. While leukemia can spread to various parts of the body, the lungs are generally not the primary location for relapse in ALL. Pulmonary involvement is more commonly seen in other cancers or conditions, but it is not a hallmark of extramedullary relapse in ALL. C. Liver: The liver can be involved in leukemia, but it is not the most common site for extramedullary relapse in ALL. The liver may show signs of infiltration during acute leukemia or during treatment, but it is less likely to be the site of relapse compared to the CNS or testis. Liver involvement can occur in some cases, but it is generally not a primary concern in the context of relapse. D. Testis: The testis is another possible site for extramedullary relapse in ALL, particularly in males. Testicular relapse occurs in a proportion of cases, but it is less common than CNS relapse. While the testis is an important site to monitor for relapse, it is not as frequently affected as the CNS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Medulloblastoma. Chang staging is specifically used for medulloblastoma, a common malignant brain tumor in children. This staging system assesses the extent of the tumor both within the central nervous system and its spread to other parts of the body. It is divided into M stages, which describe metastatic spread: M0: No evidence of metastasis. M1: Tumor cells are present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). M2: Nodular seeding in the brain. M3: Nodular seeding in the spinal cord. M4: Metastasis outside the central nervous system. This staging system is critical in guiding treatment and determining prognosis in medulloblastoma patients. Incorrect Options: A. Neuroblastoma: Staging for neuroblastoma typically uses the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) or the newer International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS). These systems assess the extent of disease and the presence of metastatic spread. Chang staging is not used for neuroblastoma. C. Wilms tumor: The staging of Wilms tumor follows the National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) system, which classifies tumors from Stage I (localized) to Stage V (bilateral). Chang staging is not applicable to Wilms tumor. D. AML: Staging in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not typically used in the same way as solid tumors. Instead, AML classification is based on cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities (e.g., FAB classification or WHO classification). Chang staging is irrelevant for AML.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) AML. Chloroma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma, is an extramedullary solid tumor composed of immature myeloid cells. It is most commonly associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The name \"chloroma\" comes from its greenish color due to the presence of myeloperoxidase in the myeloid cells. Chloromas can occur in various parts of the body, including the skin, bones, lymph nodes, or soft tissues, and may precede or accompany the systemic manifestation of AML. Its presence often indicates aggressive disease and requires urgent treatment. Incorrect Options: B. ALL: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) generally does not form solid tumors like chloroma. Instead, it predominantly affects the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Extramedullary involvement in ALL may present in the CNS or testis but does not typically form chloromas. C. Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor derived from neural crest cells and typically arises in the adrenal medulla or along the sympathetic chain. It may metastasize to bone or other organs, but it is unrelated to chloroma. D. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin and arises from skeletal muscle precursors. It does not involve myeloid cells and is not associated with the formation of chloromas.",
