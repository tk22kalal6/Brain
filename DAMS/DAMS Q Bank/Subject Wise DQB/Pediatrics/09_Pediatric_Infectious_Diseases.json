      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cataracts. The Hutchinson triad refers to a set of three clinical features that are seen in congenital syphilis, particularly in newborns whose mothers were infected with syphilis during pregnancy. The three classic features of the Hutchinson triad are: Interstitial keratitis: This is an inflammation of the cornea, leading to vision impairment and scarring, and is a hallmark of congenital syphilis. Notched incisors: The permanent upper incisors often have a characteristic \"Hutchinson's teeth\" appearance, which includes notching or a peg-shaped appearance, due to damage during the formation of teeth. Deafness: Sensorineural hearing loss, typically affecting both ears, is commonly seen in congenital syphilis. However, cataracts are not part of the Hutchinson triad. While cataracts can occur in congenital syphilis, they are not one of the three key features of the Hutchinson triad, which is specifically related to interstitial keratitis, notched incisors, and deafness. Reasons for other options: A. Interstitial keratitis: This is a key feature of Hutchinson triad and is a chronic condition that affects the cornea, leading to visual disturbances. B. Notched incisors: These characteristic teeth are a defining feature of congenital syphilis and part of the Hutchinson triad. C. Deafness: This is another key feature of Hutchinson triad and typically involves bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.",

The classic manifestations of congenital rubella include: Deafness: One of the most common and significant outcomes of congenital rubella, affecting both ears in many cases. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): This is a common congenital heart defect in CRS, where the ductus arteriosus (a blood vessel that allows blood to bypass the lungs in fetal circulation) fails to close after birth. Cataract: A cloudy lens in the eye, often leading to visual impairment or blindness, is also a common finding in congenital rubella. However, aortic stenosis is not a typical manifestation of congenital rubella. While rubella can cause a variety of cardiac defects, such as PDA, aortic stenosis is not commonly seen in congenital rubella syndrome. Reasons for other options: A. Deafness: This is a hallmark feature of congenital rubella, occurring in a significant percentage of affected infants. B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Congenital varicella. In a neonate presenting with limb hypoplasia, cicatricial skin lesions, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), the most likely diagnosis is congenital varicella syndrome. This syndrome occurs when a pregnant woman contracts varicella (chickenpox) during the early part of pregnancy, particularly during the first or second trimester. The virus can be transmitted to the fetus, leading to several congenital abnormalities. The features of congenital varicella syndrome include: Limb hypoplasia: Underdeveloped or absent limbs are a common finding in congenital varicella. Cicatricial skin lesions: These are scars that result from the congenital varicella infection, often presenting as vesicular lesions that heal with scarring. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR): Many babies born with congenital varicella syndrome show growth restriction due to the infection. Reasons for other options: A. Congenital syphilis: Syphilis can cause skin lesions, nasal discharge (snuffles), hepatosplenomegaly, and bone abnormalities, but limb hypoplasia is not a characteristic feature. Additionally, syphilis does not commonly cause cicatricial skin lesions. B. Congenital rubella: While rubella can cause IUGR, cataracts, deafness, and cardiac defects (like PDA), it does not typically cause limb hypoplasia or cicatricial skin lesions. C. Congenital toxoplasmosis: Toxoplasmosis in neonates can cause chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and intracranial calcifications, but limb hypoplasia and cicatricial skin lesions are not common features.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) No therapy. In a case where a child is born to a mother who had chickenpox during the first trimester and the baby presents with limb hypoplasia and scarring skin lesions (indicative of congenital varicella syndrome), the treatment of choice is typically no therapy. This is because the neonatal effects of congenital varicella syndrome are primarily due to the virus's effects during pregnancy, and there is limited evidence that post-birth antiviral therapy (like acyclovir) or varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) would significantly alter the course of congenital varicella syndrome. The main goal is supportive care, addressing any complications that arise, such as infections or other systemic effects. Reasons for the other options: B. VZIG alone: Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG) is typically used for post-exposure prophylaxis in neonates who are exposed to varicella within 5 days of birth, particularly in cases where the mother had varicella within 5 days before or after delivery. However, it does not offer a benefit for a child who already shows signs of congenital varicella syndrome. C. Acyclovir alone: Acyclovir is an antiviral medication commonly used to treat varicella infections, but in the case of congenital varicella syndrome, it does not reverse the birth defects caused by the virus. It may be considered in severe cases of chickenpox in the neonate, but it is not effective in preventing or reversing congenital malformations caused by the virus in utero. D. VZIG + Acyclovir: This combination is also not indicated for congenital varicella syndrome. VZIG and acyclovir are more useful when given prophylactically within a certain window after birth or exposure, not for treating congenital varicella syndrome that has already caused birth defects.",

CMV (Cytomegalovirus): CMV infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly (a small head) in the neonate. Other signs may include sensorineural hearing loss, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and seizures, but microcephaly is more commonly associated with CMV. C. Rubella: Congenital rubella syndrome often presents with microcephaly, along with other signs such as cataracts, congenital heart defects, and deafness. D. Syphilis: Congenital syphilis can lead to various abnormalities, including Hutchinson teeth, saber shins, and skin lesions, but it does not typically present with a large-sized head. Microcephaly may be seen in severe cases, but it is not a hallmark feature of congenital syphilis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Coxsackievirus A16. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is characterized by a combination of oral ulcers (such as on the buccal mucosa and tongue) and a rash, typically on the hands, feet, and sometimes buttocks. The skin lesions in HFMD appear as red spots that may evolve into small, fluid-filled blisters. Reasons for the other options: A. Enterovirus 71: While Enterovirus 71 (EV71) also causes hand, foot, and mouth disease, it tends to be associated with more severe cases, sometimes leading to neurological complications like encephalitis or meningitis. The typical presentation can overlap with that of Coxsackievirus A16, but EV71 infections are less common and often more severe. C. Coxsackievirus A6: Coxsackievirus A6 is associated with HFMD as well, but it can sometimes present with more severe skin lesions, including larger and more painful blisters. In addition to the typical hand and foot lesions, the rash may also include extensive skin peeling. This virus is often associated with more intense and widespread skin involvement, which is different from the usual presentation seen with Coxsackievirus A16. D. Coxsackievirus B5: Coxsackievirus B5 is primarily linked to diseases affecting the heart (such as viral myocarditis) and other organ systems, but it is not a common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) HIV RNA PCR. In infants under 18 months of age, HIV RNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is the most commonly used and reliable method for diagnosing HIV infection. This test detects the viral RNA in the blood, and it is sensitive enough to detect HIV infection in the early stages, even before the infant has developed a detectable level of antibodies. Reasons for the other options: A. HIV DNA PCR: Although HIV DNA PCR can also be used to diagnose HIV infection in infants, it is less commonly used than HIV RNA PCR. Both tests are effective for detecting HIV infection, but HIV RNA PCR is typically preferred due to its ability to detect the virus at lower levels. C. HIV ELISA: HIV ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) detects antibodies against HIV. In infants under 18 months of age, maternal antibodies can persist in the infant's system, potentially leading to a false positive result. Therefore, it is not the preferred method for diagnosing HIV in young infants. D. P24 Ag assay: The P24 antigen assay detects the p24 protein of the HIV virus and can be used for early detection. However, it is less commonly used than HIV RNA PCR because of its lower sensitivity in detecting infection in the early months of life.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Acute otitis media. The most common complication of measles is acute otitis media (AOM), which occurs in a significant number of children with measles. It is a bacterial infection of the middle ear, and it can lead to ear pain, fever, and hearing loss if not treated appropriately. The incidence of acute otitis media is high in children with measles due to the inflammatory effects of the viral infection on the respiratory and ear passages. Reasons for the other options: A. Pneumonia: While pneumonia is a severe and potentially fatal complication of measles, it is less common than otitis media. Measles-associated pneumonia is often due to secondary bacterial infections or the viral infection itself. However, acute otitis media remains the most frequently encountered complication. B. Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common complication in measles, especially in developing countries, but it is less frequent than otitis media. It can lead to dehydration and malnutrition in severely affected children. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lymph nodes. The most common site of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in children is the lymph nodes. Lymph node involvement, particularly the cervical lymph nodes, is frequently observed in pediatric TB, as the disease often manifests as scrofula (tuberculous lymphadenitis). Children are more likely to present with extra-pulmonary TB because they have a higher tendency for hematogenous spread. Additionally, since childhood TB tends to be paucibacillary (having fewer bacteria), extra-pulmonary TB sites like lymph nodes are more commonly affected. Reasons for the other options: A. GIT (Gastrointestinal Tract): While TB can involve the gastrointestinal tract, it is much less common than lymph node involvement. The gastrointestinal system may be affected in cases of miliary TB or ingestion of infected material, but it is not the most frequent site for extra-pulmonary TB in children. B. CNS (Central Nervous System): CNS TB, including meningitis and tuberculomas, is a serious and potentially life-threatening manifestation. However, it is less common than lymph node involvement.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Continue breastfeeding and give BCG and INH prophylaxis to baby. In a child born to a mother with active tuberculosis (TB), the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend continuing breastfeeding while providing BCG vaccination and Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis for the baby. Breastfeeding is encouraged because the benefits of breastfeeding, such as providing immunological protection and nutrition, outweigh the risks of TB transmission. The child should also receive BCG vaccine to protect against severe forms of TB like TB meningitis and disseminated TB. INH prophylaxis is given to reduce the risk of the child developing active TB. Reasons for the other options: A. Stop breastfeeding and start INH prophylaxis to baby: Stopping breastfeeding is not recommended, as the risk of TB transmission through breast milk is very low, and the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks. This approach would also exclude the child from the protective effects of breastfeeding. C. Continue breastfeeding and give INH prophylaxis but avoid BCG: While breastfeeding and INH prophylaxis are appropriate, BCG vaccination should not be avoided. BCG is recommended for newborns at risk of TB exposure to prevent severe forms of TB. D. Stop breastfeeding, start INH prophylaxis and restart breastfeeding after 3 months: As mentioned, breastfeeding should not be stopped in this situation. There is no reason to stop breastfeeding and then restart after 3 months, as the child is unlikely to be at significant risk from the mother if appropriate precautions are taken.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Erythromycin. Erythromycin is the drug of choice for the treatment of pertussis (whooping cough), caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, effectively treating the infection and reducing transmission. Erythromycin is most effective when administered early in the course of the disease, ideally within the first 1-2 weeks when the symptoms are primarily catarrhal (early cold-like stage) or during the paroxysmal (coughing) phase. If given later, it may not have as significant an effect on the severity of symptoms, but it still helps to reduce contagion. Reasons for the other options: A. Penicillin: Penicillin is not effective against Bordetella pertussis, as this bacteria does not have a cell wall, which is the target for penicillin's action. Therefore, penicillin is not used for pertussis treatment. B. Ceftriaxone: Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic that targets bacterial cell wall synthesis but is also not effective against Bordetella pertussis. It is not recommended for the treatment of pertussis. D. Azithromycin: Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is also used to treat pertussis and is an alternative to erythromycin, especially for patients who cannot tolerate erythromycin. It has a longer half-life, which allows for shorter treatment courses (typically 5 days). While azithromycin is a good choice, erythromycin remains the first-line recommendation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Nasopharyngeal swab. In a child presenting with paroxysmal cough and a characteristic inspiratory whoop, which is indicative of pertussis (whooping cough), the nasopharyngeal swab is the most appropriate sample for investigation. This swab is taken from the back of the throat and the nasopharynx to collect bacteria from the mucosal surfaces where Bordetella pertussis, the causative organism of pertussis, resides. It can be used for several diagnostic methods, including: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is highly sensitive and specific for detecting Bordetella pertussis DNA. Culture: Though this is less commonly done now due to the availability of PCR, it is still a possible method for identifying the organism. Reasons for the other options: B. Tracheal aspirate: While a tracheal aspirate can provide samples for bacterial cultures, it is not typically used for diagnosing pertussis in children. The nasopharyngeal swab is preferred as it targets the site where the bacteria are most likely to be present early in the infection. C. Cough plate culture: This method is not commonly used for diagnosing pertussis. A cough plate culture would involve culturing the bacteria from a sample collected from the child's cough, which may not provide the most reliable result compared to a nasopharyngeal swab. D. Sputum culture: Sputum culture is typically used for respiratory infections where the patient has significant productive cough, which is not characteristic of pertussis in the early stages. Pertussis is primarily diagnosed using a nasopharyngeal swab due to the nature of the infection and the lack of significant sputum production in young children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Diphtheria. Bull neck is a clinical feature seen in severe cases of diphtheria, a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. This term refers to the gross swelling of the neck due to extensive cervical lymphadenopathy and soft tissue edema, which can result in a characteristic \"bull neck\" appearance. It typically occurs in advanced or severe cases when the infection spreads locally, leading to severe inflammation and systemic toxicity. Reasons for the other options: B. Mumps: Mumps is characterized by swelling of the parotid glands, leading to a puffy appearance of the cheeks and jawline. While this can cause neck swelling in some cases, it does not produce the \"bull neck\" appearance associated with diphtheria. C. Tubercular lymphadenitis: Tubercular lymphadenitis (scrofula) involves chronic swelling of the cervical lymph nodes, but the swelling is more localized and not associated with the extensive soft tissue edema seen in diphtheria. D. Goitre: Goitre refers to the enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can cause visible swelling in the neck. However, the swelling is focused in the anterior neck region and lacks the inflammatory component or generalized lymphadenopathy of diphtheria.",

Although PSRA usually involves the large joints like the arthritis of acute rheumatic fever, it may involve small peripheral joints, as well as the axial skeleton, and is typically non-migratory, characteristics distinct from the arthritis of acute rheumatic fever. • The latent period between the antecedent episode of GAS pharyngitis and PSRA may be considerably shorter (usually 38°C (100.4°F).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) • Postnatal infection with rubella is a mild disease not easily discernible from other viral infections, especially in children. Following an incubation period of 14-21 days, a prodrome consisting of low-grade fever, sore throat, red eyes with or without eye pain, headache, malaise, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy begins. • Suboccipital, postauricular, and anterior cervical lymph nodes are most prominent. In children, the first manifestation of rubella is usually the rash, which is variable and not distinctive. It begins on the face and neck as small, irregular pink macules that coalesce, and it spreads centrifugally to involve the torso and extremities, where it tends to occur as discrete macules. • About the time of onset of the rash, examination of the oropharynx may reveal tiny, rose-colored lesions (Forchheimer spots) or petechial hemorrhages on the soft palate. The rash fades from the face as it extends to the rest of the body so that the whole body may not be involved at any one time. The duration of the rash is generally 3 days, and it usually resolves without desquamation. • Subclinical infections are common, and 25-40% of children may not have a rash.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Constipation The first sign of infant botulism is often constipation, which occurs due to the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. This toxin blocks acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to decreased gut motility (intestinal paralysis). Constipation may precede other symptoms by several days, making it a key early indicator. Reasons for the Incorrect Options: A. Diarrhea: Diarrhea is not typically associated with botulism. On the contrary, the toxin-induced paralysis of the gastrointestinal system often leads to constipation rather than diarrhea. B. Fever: Fever is not a common feature of infant botulism because the condition is caused by a toxin rather than an active infection or inflammatory response. Infants with botulism are usually afebrile. D. Cranial nerve palsies: Cranial nerve palsies, such as poor sucking, weak cry, or facial weakness, do occur in infant botulism but typically present later in the progression of the disease, after the onset of constipation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Scarlet fever Explanation for the Correct Answer: A. Scarlet fever: Bradycardia is not a characteristic feature of scarlet fever. Scarlet fever is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and typically presents with a high fever, rash, and a rapid pulse (tachycardia), which is proportional to the fever. Bradycardia is not commonly observed in this condition. Reasons for the Incorrect Options: B. Brucellosis: Bradycardia is a common feature of brucellosis, especially relative bradycardia, where the pulse rate is slower than expected for the degree of fever. It is considered one of the characteristic signs of this zoonotic infection. C. Lyme disease: Bradycardia can occur in Lyme disease due to Lyme carditis, which may cause atrioventricular (AV) block or other conduction abnormalities. This is a well-documented complication of Lyme disease. D. Typhoid: Bradycardia, particularly relative bradycardia, is a hallmark of typhoid fever. It is a distinguishing feature in contrast to many other febrile illnesses, where tachycardia is more typical.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Focal skin infarction: In acute meningococcal septicemia, the most common complication is focal skin infarction. This is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and vasculitis caused by the bacterial toxins. The skin may develop necrosis and hemorrhagic lesions, leading to characteristic petechiae, purpura, and larger skin infarctions, especially in severe cases. These lesions are often found on the extremities and can be associated with gangrene in more severe cases. Reasons for the Incorrect Options: A. Osteomyelitis: Osteomyelitis is not a common complication of meningococcal septicemia. While it can occur as a secondary infection, it is much less frequent than skin infarction. Meningococcal septicemia more commonly causes systemic issues such as DIC, shock, and focal skin lesions. C. Fulminant meningitis: Fulminant meningitis is a severe complication that can arise from meningococcal infection, but it is not as common as skin infarction in septicemia. While meningitis can occur, especially in untreated or late-stage infections, septicemia itself is typically associated with circulatory collapse and skin involvement, rather than primarily with meningitis. D. Adrenal hemorrhage: Adrenal hemorrhage, also known as Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, can be a serious complication of meningococcal septicemia, but it is rare. It involves bleeding into the adrenal glands and is associated with severe septic shock, and is a more dramatic but less common manifestation compared to focal skin infarctions.",
