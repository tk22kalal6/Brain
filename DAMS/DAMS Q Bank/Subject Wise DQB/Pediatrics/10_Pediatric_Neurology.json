      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs is seen. In low sacral meningomyelocele, spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs are typically not seen. Low sacral meningomyelocele primarily affects the sacral nerves, which control bladder, bowel, and some lower limb functions. The motor deficits in this condition are generally mild or absent because the lumbar and thoracic regions of the spinal cord, which supply the main motor control of the lower limbs, are unaffected. Incorrect responses: B. Hydrocephalus is seen: Hydrocephalus is a common complication of meningomyelocele, often associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation (type II), which is frequently seen in patients with meningomyelocele. This makes this statement true. C. Bladder incontinence may be seen: Bladder incontinence is a hallmark of low sacral meningomyelocele. Damage to the sacral nerves (S2-S4) affects the control of the bladder, leading to urinary incontinence. D. Bowel incontinence is present: Bowel incontinence is another common feature of low sacral meningomyelocele due to impaired sacral nerve function, which governs bowel control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Holoprosencephaly. Holoprosencephaly is not classified as a neural tube defect (NTD). It is a brain malformation that occurs due to the failure of the forebrain (prosencephalon) to divide into two hemispheres during embryogenesis. This defect arises from abnormal midline development, not from improper closure of the neural tube. Incorrect Responses: A. Meningomyelocele Meningomyelocele is a classic neural tube defect where the spinal cord and meninges protrude through a defect in the vertebral column. It occurs due to incomplete closure of the neural tube during early fetal development. B. Anencephaly Anencephaly is a severe neural tube defect characterized by the absence of major portions of the brain and skull. It results from the failure of the anterior (cranial) neural tube to close. D. Encephalocele Encephalocele is a neural tube defect where brain tissue and meninges herniate through a defect in the skull.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 4000 micrograms (4 mg) In women with a previous history of a child with neural tube defects (NTDs), the recommended prophylactic dose of folic acid is 4 mg (4000 micrograms) per day. This higher dosage is essential for significantly reducing the risk of recurrence of NTDs in subsequent pregnancies. Folic acid supplementation should begin at least 1 month before conception and continue throughout the first trimester, as this is the critical period for neural tube development. Folic acid plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, which are vital for proper fetal development, particularly in preventing neural tube closure defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly. Incorrect Responses: A. 40 micrograms This dose is far too low to prevent NTDs in any pregnancy. It does not meet the minimum requirements for general prophylaxis. B. 400 micrograms This is the standard recommended dose for low-risk pregnancies in women with no history of NTDs. It is insufficient for high-risk cases, such as women with a previous child affected by NTDs. C. 500 micrograms Although slightly higher than the dose recommended for low-risk pregnancies, this amount is still inadequate for women with a prior history of NTDs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Arnold Chiari Malformation The banana-shaped sign on antenatal ultrasound is a characteristic finding in Arnold Chiari malformation (type II). This malformation involves herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and vermis through the foramen magnum due to a neural tube defect like spina bifida. The shape of the cerebellum appears compressed and curved, resembling a banana. This is often seen in conjunction with other ultrasound findings like the lemon-shaped skull, caused by abnormal flattening of the frontal bones. Incorrect Responses: A. Aicardi Syndrome Aicardi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, chorioretinal lacunae, and infantile spasms. It does not produce a banana-shaped sign on ultrasound. B. Dandy Walker Syndrome Dandy Walker syndrome involves hypoplasia or agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle, and an enlarged posterior fossa. On imaging, it presents as a posterior fossa cyst but does not cause a banana-shaped sign. D. Holoprosencephaly Holoprosencephaly results from incomplete division of the forebrain into hemispheres and lobes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Multifactorial Neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida and anencephaly, follow a multifactorial inheritance pattern. This means that their development results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Key contributors include: Genetic factors: Variants in genes related to folate metabolism (e.g., MTHFR gene) increase susceptibility. Environmental factors: Maternal folate deficiency, poorly controlled diabetes, obesity, and certain medications during pregnancy (e.g., valproate) are associated with a higher risk. This inheritance model explains why NTDs do not follow a single-gene Mendelian inheritance pattern and why their recurrence risk is higher than in the general population but not as high as in typical autosomal dominant or recessive conditions. Incorrect Responses: A. Autosomal dominant NTDs are not inherited through a single dominant gene. While family history may increase risk, the condition does not follow a strictly autosomal dominant pattern. C. Mitochondrial Mitochondrial inheritance involves genes transmitted exclusively through the maternal line and is unrelated to NTDs, which are influenced by both nuclear genes and environmental factors. D. Autosomal recessive NTDs are not inherited through two copies of a mutated gene (recessive inheritance). While some genetic predispositions may exist, the overall inheritance pattern is multifactorial, not recessive.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Duramater A meningocele is a type of spina bifida where the meninges (specifically, the dura mater and arachnoid mater) protrude through a defect in the vertebral column. The sac contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but does not involve neural tissue such as the spinal cord or cauda equina. It is typically covered by skin or a thin membranous layer. This condition is less severe compared to myelomeningocele, as the spinal cord and nerves remain in their usual position and are not involved in the sac. Incorrect Responses: B. Spinal cord The spinal cord is not included in a meningocele. If the spinal cord were present, the condition would be classified as myelomeningocele, which is more severe and associated with neurological deficits. C. Brain tissue Brain tissue is not involved in meningocele. Brain tissue may herniate in other conditions, such as encephalocele, which is a defect involving the cranial vault, not the spinal column. D. Cauda equina The cauda equina, which consists of nerve roots in the lumbar and sacral regions, is not part of the meningocele sac. It remains in its usual position within the spinal column.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lumbo-sacral Meningomyelocele most commonly involves the lumbo-sacral region of the spine. This region is particularly prone to neural tube closure defects during early embryogenesis, leading to herniation of the spinal cord, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid through a bony defect in the vertebrae. The lumbo-sacral area is the most common site due to its complex development and the high prevalence of neural tube defects in this region. It often results in significant neurological deficits, such as lower limb paralysis, bladder and bowel incontinence, and sensory abnormalities, depending on the severity. Incorrect Responses: A. Cervico-dorsal The cervico-dorsal region is rarely affected in meningomyelocele. Neural tube defects in this region are less common because the cervical region usually closes earlier during embryogenesis. B. Dorso-lumbar While the dorso-lumbar region can be affected, it is less frequently involved than the lumbo-sacral region. The dorso-lumbar area typically presents with milder neurological deficits compared to the lumbo-sacral area. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Normal saline In cases of meningomyelocele, the exposed sac is at a high risk of infection, dehydration, and rupture. To minimize these risks, the sac should be covered with a sterile gauze soaked in normal saline until surgery. Normal saline provides a moist, sterile environment that prevents the sac from drying out. Keeping the sac moist reduces the risk of cracking or rupture, which could lead to cerebrospinal fluid leakage and secondary infections like meningitis. Sterile saline is preferred because it is non-irritating and does not introduce chemical agents that might harm the delicate tissue. Incorrect Responses: B. Tincture iodine Tincture iodine is a disinfectant and is not suitable for use on the meningomyelocele sac. It can irritate the tissue and potentially damage the delicate neural structures. C. Methylene blue Methylene blue is used for diagnostic purposes (e.g., dye studies) but has no role in protecting the meningomyelocele sac. It may even cause tissue irritation. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Anencephaly Anencephaly is a severe neural tube defect where the cranial end of the neural tube fails to close, resulting in the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. It is characterized by: Absence of the cerebral hemispheres. Exposed neural tissue that is often covered by a thin membrane. Associated with a frog-like facial appearance on ultrasound or clinical examination. Anencephaly is commonly detected during prenatal ultrasonography and is incompatible with life, leading to death shortly after birth or stillbirth. Incorrect Responses: A. Porencephaly Porencephaly refers to the presence of cystic cavities or cavities in the brain tissue, which may result from intrauterine insults or infections. It does not cause the characteristic absence of the brain and skull seen in anencephaly. B. Meningomyelocele Meningomyelocele is a neural tube defect affecting the spinal cord and meninges, typically in the lumbo-sacral region. It does not involve the absence of the brain or cranial bones. C. Encephalocele Encephalocele involves herniation of the brain tissue and meninges through a defect in the skull. It differs from anencephaly, as there is no complete absence of the cranial vault or major brain structures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Blood culture A 7-day-old infant with a leaky meningomyelocele is at significant risk for infection due to the exposure of the central nervous system to the external environment, and possible leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When there is leakage, the risk of meningitis or systemic infection increases. The blood culture is the most useful test because it can help identify any systemic infection, particularly bacteremia, which is crucial in managing such a delicate case. Identifying infection early can help guide appropriate antibiotic treatment and prevent further complications, including sepsis or meningitis. Incorrect Responses: A. Local wound swab culture While a local wound swab culture can help identify infection at the site of the meningomyelocele, it may not provide an accurate reflection of a systemic infection that could involve other organs or the central nervous system. Additionally, local cultures are less sensitive for detecting deeper or more severe infections like meningitis. B. Urine culture A urine culture is not the best diagnostic tool in this case because the primary concern is a leaky meningomyelocele rather than a urinary tract infection. Although infants can develop UTIs, this is less relevant to a case of spinal defect and possible meningitis. C. Rectal swab culture A rectal swab culture is useful for detecting gastrointestinal infections but is not directly related to the infection risks associated with a leaky meningomyelocele. It would not be as beneficial as a blood culture in diagnosing systemic infections like meningitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lissencephaly Lissencephaly, also known as \"smooth brain,\" is a brain malformation characterized by an absence of normal folds and grooves (gyri and sulci) in the cerebral cortex. This condition results in a smooth appearance of the brain on imaging, as typically observed on an MRI scan. Lissencephaly is associated with severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures, which aligns with the clinical presentation of the child. It occurs due to abnormalities in neuronal migration during brain development, and it is often associated with poor motor and cognitive outcomes. The lack of brain development leads to intellectual disability and frequent seizures. Incorrect Responses: A. Schizencephaly Schizencephaly refers to a cleft or gap in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain, which can be observed on MRI. It often presents with developmental delays and seizures, but unlike lissencephaly, it does not cause a completely smooth brain surface. The MRI would show clefts in the brain, which is not the case here. B. Holoprosencephaly Holoprosencephaly is a condition where the forebrain fails to properly divide into two hemispheres during early development. This leads to structural brain abnormalities, but it is more commonly associated with facial anomalies (e.g., cleft lip/palate, cyclopia) and specific midline brain defects. The MRI findings in holoprosencephaly typically show fused brain structures, which are distinct from the smooth brain appearance of lissencephaly. C. Polymicrogyria Polymicrogyria is characterized by an abnormal number of small gyri in the cerebral cortex, which can cause developmental delay and seizures. On MRI, polymicrogyria appears as abnormal cortical folds, which is different from the smooth, lack of gyri seen in lissencephaly. The presence of extra gyri in polymicrogyria helps differentiate it from lissencephaly.",

The main features include mental retardation, refractory seizures, and structural brain anomalies such as absence of the corpus callosum, which is a significant feature seen on MRI. Additionally, hemivertebrae (abnormalities of the vertebral bones) are commonly observed in this syndrome. These features make Aicardi syndrome the most likely diagnosis in this case. Incorrect Responses: A. Moebius syndrome Moebius syndrome is a congenital neurological disorder that primarily causes facial paralysis and difficulty with eye movements. It does not typically include features like mental retardation, seizures, or hemivertebrae, which are present in this case. Additionally, absence of the corpus callosum is not a typical feature of Moebius syndrome. B. Miller-Dicker syndrome Miller-Dieker syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by lissencephaly (smooth brain), intellectual disability, seizures, and facial dysmorphisms. However, it is not typically associated with hemivertebrae or the absence of the corpus callosum. Thus, it does not fit as well with the clinical picture in this case. D. Joubert syndrome Joubert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, which leads to a \"molar tooth sign\" on MRI. While this syndrome can present with developmental delay, seizures, and breathing irregularities, it is not commonly associated with hemivertebrae or the absence of the corpus callosum.

Although it may be present in some children, it does not warrant routine neuroimaging unless there are other concerning clinical features. Therefore, it is not an indication for neuroimaging in a child suspected of having spina bifida occulta. Incorrect Responses: A. Dermal sinus A dermal sinus is a deep skin pit that may be associated with a structural spinal abnormality such as spina bifida occulta or tethered cord syndrome. If a dermal sinus is found, neuroimaging is warranted to evaluate the underlying spinal anatomy and rule out associated neurological problems. This is an indication for neuroimaging. B. Hyperpigmented patch A hyperpigmented patch or birthmark over the spine can sometimes be associated with spinal cord defects like spina bifida occulta, especially if it is located over the midline or near the sacrum. Such a finding, if associated with other neurological symptoms or signs, may warrant neuroimaging to rule out any underlying structural spinal issues. Therefore, this is an indication for neuroimaging. C. Tuft of hair A tuft of hair on the back, particularly over the lower spine, can be indicative of spina bifida occulta or other neural tube defects. This sign should prompt neuroimaging to assess whether there are any hidden abnormalities in the spinal cord or vertebrae that need to be addressed. This is an indication for neuroimaging.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Developmental delay Developmental delay is associated with an increased risk of deformational plagiocephaly. This condition occurs when an infant's skull becomes misshapen due to pressure on one part of the head, often caused by prolonged lying on one side. Infants with developmental delays, including those with conditions such as cerebral palsy or other neurological impairments, may have difficulty moving their head and changing positions, which can increase the risk of deformational plagiocephaly. These infants may also have limited neck mobility (e.g., due to torticollis), which further predisposes them to this condition. Incorrect Responses: A. Female child Gender is not a significant risk factor for deformational plagiocephaly. The condition can occur in both male and female infants equally, and there is no evidence to suggest that female infants are more prone to it compared to males. Therefore, gender does not increase the risk. B. High birth order High birth order (being the older child in a family) does not increase the risk of deformational plagiocephaly. While some studies suggest that second or later-born children may have slightly different positioning patterns during infancy, birth order is not a major factor in the development of plagiocephaly. The primary risk factor remains the infant’s head position and neck mobility. D. Exclusive breast feeding Exclusive breastfeeding does not increase the risk of deformational plagiocephaly. In fact, breastfed infants may spend more time in an upright position during feedings, which could reduce the likelihood of developing positional plagiocephaly compared to formula-fed infants. Therefore, exclusive breastfeeding is not a risk factor for this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Post-inflammatory obstruction The most common cause of hydrocephalus in children is post-inflammatory obstruction. This can occur following infections like meningitis, which cause inflammation of the brain's meninges and can lead to the obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways, particularly in the ventricular system. This blockage prevents the normal drainage of CSF, causing an accumulation and resulting in hydrocephalus. The inflammation can affect the arachnoid villi or cerebral aqueduct, leading to this obstruction. Incorrect Responses: B. Budd-Chiari syndrome Budd-Chiari syndrome involves hepatic vein thrombosis and is a liver condition, not a cause of hydrocephalus. It is not related to the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus in children. While it can cause significant health issues, including liver failure, it does not directly cause hydrocephalus. Therefore, it is not a correct answer. C. Brain tumour While brain tumors can cause hydrocephalus, particularly if they obstruct CSF flow, they are less common compared to post-inflammatory causes. Tumors can cause hydrocephalus by obstructing the ventricular system or cerebral aqueduct, but overall, post-inflammatory obstruction is a more frequent cause in children. D. Perinatal injury Perinatal injury can lead to hydrocephalus, but it is not as common as post-inflammatory obstruction. Perinatal injuries, including intracranial hemorrhage during birth, can lead to obstruction of CSF pathways or damage to the ventricular system, causing hydrocephalus. However, it is less frequently encountered than post-inflammatory causes, making it a less common etiology.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Narrow posterior fossa In Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), a narrow posterior fossa is not typically seen. Instead, Dandy-Walker malformation is characterized by a large, enlarged posterior fossa due to the abnormal development of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle. It is associated with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, dilatation of the fourth ventricle, and hydrocephalus, but there is no significant narrowing of the posterior fossa. The fossa may be enlarged due to the absence or hypoplasia of parts of the cerebellum. Incorrect Responses: A. Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia is one of the hallmark features of Dandy-Walker malformation. This malformation involves incomplete or absent development of the cerebellar vermis, leading to developmental and motor impairments. This finding is a significant diagnostic feature of DWM. B. Fourth ventricle dilatation Dilatation of the fourth ventricle is another key feature of Dandy-Walker malformation. The fourth ventricle becomes abnormally enlarged due to the absence or hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, which leads to an abnormal distribution of CSF and can result in hydrocephalus. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Aqueductal stenosis Aqueductal stenosis is the most common cause of obstructive hydrocephalus. This condition occurs when there is a blockage or narrowing of the cerebral aqueduct (also known as the aqueduct of Sylvius), which connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. This obstruction prevents the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), causing it to accumulate in the ventricles, leading to hydrocephalus. Aqueductal stenosis can be congenital or acquired and is often diagnosed in infants or children. Incorrect Responses: A. Brain tumours While brain tumors can lead to obstructive hydrocephalus, they are not the most common cause. Brain tumors can obstruct the flow of CSF by blocking the ventricles, particularly around the third ventricle or cerebellopontine angle. However, aqueductal stenosis remains the more frequent cause of obstruction. C. Tubercular meningitis Tubercular meningitis can lead to hydrocephalus due to the inflammation of the meninges and potential CSF obstruction. However, obstructive hydrocephalus in this context is less common and typically results from inflammatory changes rather than a direct anatomical blockage of the CSF pathways like in aqueductal stenosis. D. Pneumococcal meningitis Like tubercular meningitis, pneumococcal meningitis can also lead to hydrocephalus due to inflammatory scarring of the meninges and ventricles, but it is a less frequent cause of obstructive hydrocephalus. The condition may cause communicating hydrocephalus, which involves impaired absorption of CSF rather than a blockage, and this is distinct from obstructive hydrocephalus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Crack pot sign The crack pot sign is not typically a sign of hydrocephalus. It is associated with rickets, where a characteristic audible cracking sound is heard when tapping the skull due to softening of the bones. This sign is not directly related to the condition of hydrocephalus in neonates. Incorrect Responses: A. Enlarged head An enlarged head is a classic sign of hydrocephalus in neonates. As cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulates in the ventricles, the head expands to accommodate the increased volume, leading to an enlarged skull. This is one of the most noticeable features in neonates with hydrocephalus. B. Sunset sign The sunset sign refers to the downward deviation of the eyes, where the sclera is visible above the iris, resembling a sunset. This sign occurs due to increased intracranial pressure from hydrocephalus, and is commonly seen in neonates with the condition. It is a sign of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) caused by raised intracranial pressure. D. Bulging fontanelle A bulging fontanelle is another common sign of hydrocephalus in neonates. The fontanelles (the soft spots on a baby's skull) may become distended due to the increased pressure from the buildup of CSF, which causes the skull to expand and the fontanelles to protrude.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) VP shunt The ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is the most common and preferred surgical procedure for the management of hydrocephalus in children. It involves the insertion of a catheter into the ventricles of the brain, allowing the excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be drained into the peritoneal cavity, where it can be absorbed. This procedure is highly effective for long-term management of hydrocephalus, as it helps regulate CSF levels and prevent the complications associated with increased intracranial pressure. Incorrect Responses: A. Endoscopic ventriculostomy Endoscopic ventriculostomy is an alternative procedure, particularly in cases of non-communicating hydrocephalus or when there is an obstruction in the third ventricle. It involves creating a hole in the floor of the third ventricle, allowing CSF to flow freely. While this can be an effective treatment for some types of hydrocephalus, it is not typically the first choice for most children and may not be suitable for all patients, especially those with communicating hydrocephalus. C. TIPSS TIPSS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) is a procedure used to treat portal hypertension in patients with liver disease and is not related to the treatment of hydrocephalus. It involves creating a shunt between the portal vein and hepatic veins to reduce the pressure in the portal circulation, which has no role in managing hydrocephalus. D. External ventricular drainage External ventricular drainage (EVD) is typically used as a temporary measure in the management of hydrocephalus, especially in emergency situations. It involves the insertion of a catheter into the ventricle and drainage of CSF externally into a collection system. While EVD can relieve pressure and provide short-term control of CSF, it does not offer a long-term solution and is not the definitive treatment for hydrocephalus in children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Coronal suture Brachycephaly is a type of cranial deformity where the head appears short and broad. This condition is caused by the premature fusion of the coronal suture, which runs across the skull from ear to ear. When the coronal suture fuses prematurely, it restricts the skull's ability to grow normally in the front-to-back direction, leading to a broad, shortened head shape. Brachycephaly is often seen in conditions such as craniosynostosis, where early suture closure disrupts normal skull growth. Incorrect Responses: A. Parietal suture The parietal sutures run along the top of the head between the two parietal bones. Premature fusion of the parietal sutures can lead to scaphocephaly (a long, narrow head shape), not brachycephaly. Therefore, the fusion of the parietal suture is not responsible for brachycephaly. B. Sagittal suture The sagittal suture runs from front to back along the top of the skull. Premature fusion of the sagittal suture results in scaphocephaly, a condition where the skull grows long and narrow, rather than broad. Hence, the fusion of the sagittal suture is not associated with brachycephaly. C. Lambdoid suture The lambdoid suture is located at the back of the skull, where the occipital bone meets the parietal bones. Premature fusion of the lambdoid suture can cause plagiocephaly, which results in a flat or asymmetrical shape of the skull, often affecting one side of the head. This is not associated with brachycephaly",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HIE (Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy) Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is the most common cause of neonatal seizures. HIE occurs when the brain is deprived of oxygen and blood supply, often during labor and delivery. This lack of oxygen and blood flow can lead to brain injury and the onset of seizures in the neonate. These seizures are often seen in newborns who had a complicated birth process, such as asphyxia or cord accidents. HIE is considered the primary cause of neonatal seizures, especially in full-term infants. Incorrect Responses: B. Intracranial HGE (Hemorrhagic Encephalopathy) While intracranial hemorrhages can indeed cause seizures in neonates, they are not as common as HIE. Hemorrhagic encephalopathy refers to bleeding in the brain, which can result from factors like birth trauma or clotting disorders. However, it is less common than HIE in causing neonatal seizures. C. CNS infection Central Nervous System (CNS) infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, can cause seizures in neonates, but they are not the most common cause. Infections typically occur later in the neonatal period, and while they can lead to seizures, they are less frequent than HIE as a primary cause of neonatal seizures. D. Metabolic disease Metabolic disorders can cause seizures in neonates, but they are less frequent than HIE. Conditions like hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and inborn errors of metabolism can result in seizures, but they are typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical presentation and laboratory tests. While important to consider, metabolic diseases are not the most common cause of neonatal seizures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phenobarbitone Phenobarbitone (also known as Phenobarbital) is the first-line drug of choice for treating neonatal seizures. It is a barbiturate that acts by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain, which helps to control seizures. Phenobarbital is preferred because it is well-tolerated in neonates, has a relatively long half-life, and has proven efficacy in treating neonatal seizures, particularly those due to perinatal asphyxia or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Incorrect Responses: A. Phenytoin Phenytoin is a commonly used anticonvulsant, but it is not the drug of choice for neonatal seizures. It is generally not used in neonates due to its potential to cause adverse effects such as hypotension and arrhythmias, and it is less effective than phenobarbital for controlling neonatal seizures. C. Diazepam Diazepam (a benzodiazepine) is often used for status epilepticus in older children and adults but is not the first-line treatment in neonates. While it can be used in emergencies, phenobarbital is preferred due to its longer duration of action and better safety profile in neonates. D. Sodium valproate Sodium valproate is effective in treating a range of seizure types, but it is not typically used as the first-line drug for neonatal seizures due to concerns about its safety profile in young infants. It may cause liver toxicity, which is a significant concern in neonates, especially those with underdeveloped liver function.",

The most common site for the focus of mesial temporal sclerosis is the hippocampus. This region is critical for memory processing, and sclerosis of the hippocampus often results in seizures, which may be difficult to control. Hippocampal sclerosis is typically associated with abnormal scarring (gliosis) and atrophy of the hippocampus, which can be visualized on MRI scans. It is strongly linked to temporal lobe epilepsy in adolescents. Incorrect Responses: A. Amygdala While the amygdala is involved in temporal lobe seizures, it is not the most common site for mesial temporal sclerosis. The amygdala can sometimes be affected in conjunction with the hippocampus, but the primary site of sclerosis is the hippocampus. C. Basal ganglia The basal ganglia are typically involved in movement disorders, not in mesial temporal sclerosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Anoxic brain damage A burst-suppression pattern on EEG is commonly seen in cases of anoxic brain injury (brain damage caused by lack of oxygen). In this pattern, the EEG shows alternating bursts of high-amplitude activity followed by periods of suppression (near flat). This pattern is indicative of severe neurological impairment, often seen in conditions like hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest or severe respiratory failure. It is a marker of significant cerebral dysfunction, often seen in critically ill patients. Incorrect Responses: A. HSV encephalitis While HSV encephalitis can cause various EEG abnormalities, such as focal slowing or periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, it is not typically associated with a burst-suppression pattern. HSV encephalitis is more likely to show focal findings related to the temporal lobes or diffuse slowing. B. Prion disease Prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, can result in EEG abnormalities like periodic sharp waves, but burst suppression is not a typical EEG finding in these disorders. Prion disease is more often associated with a specific pattern of periodic complexes or periodic sharp wave complexes. D. Petit mal epilepsy Petit mal epilepsy (absence seizures) is characterized by 3 Hz generalized spike-and-wave discharges on EEG, which is completely different from the burst-suppression pattern. The EEG pattern seen in absence seizures is much more rhythmic and involves generalized discharges, not bursts and suppression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is the most likely agent responsible for severe mucocutaneous rash and ulcers involving mucous membranes in this child. This drug is known to cause severe skin reactions, particularly Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can involve blistering rashes, mucosal ulcerations, and systemic involvement. These reactions are more common when carbamazepine is introduced rapidly or in patients with specific genetic risks, such as those with the HLA-B*1502 allele, which is more prevalent in certain populations like those of Asian descent. Incorrect Responses: A. Lamotrigine While lamotrigine can cause rash, it is less frequently associated with severe mucosal ulceration compared to carbamazepine. However, lamotrigine can still lead to life-threatening reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, especially if the drug is titrated too quickly or in cases of hypersensitivity. Despite this, carbamazepine remains the more likely cause in this scenario. C. Valproate Valproate is generally not associated with severe mucocutaneous rashes or ulcers. Its side effects are more commonly related to hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal disturbances, and weight gain. Valproate does not typically cause the type of severe dermatologic reactions described in this question. D. Zonisamide Although zonisamide can cause rash, it is not typically linked to severe mucosal ulcerations or the more serious skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Zonisamide is more commonly associated with side effects such as metabolic disturbances, cognitive effects, and somnolence rather than severe skin reactions.",

The risk of developing epilepsy in these children is estimated to be around 33%, which is significantly higher than that for children with only febrile seizures but no developmental issues. This heightened risk is linked to the presence of preexisting neurological vulnerabilities that can increase the likelihood of developing chronic seizure disorders. Incorrect Responses: A. 1% A risk of 1% is much too low for a child with both febrile seizures and neurodevelopmental anomalies. This would be more typical for children without any additional neurological concerns. The risk for epilepsy is much higher when combined with neurodevelopmental disorders. B. 15% While 15% represents an increased risk compared to the general population, it is still lower than the actual risk of around 33% for children with neurodevelopmental anomalies who experience febrile seizures.

Although it is an effective anticonvulsant for various types of seizures, it is not commonly used in the acute management of status epilepticus. Status epilepticus requires rapid control of seizures, and carbamazepine works more slowly, making it unsuitable for this urgent situation. Incorrect Responses: A. Phenytoin Phenytoin is commonly used in the acute management of status epilepticus, especially if seizures are not responding to initial benzodiazepines like diazepam. It is used as a second-line treatment after benzodiazepines, often administered intravenously in the hospital setting to control prolonged seizures. B. Diazepam Diazepam (or lorazepam) is typically the first-line treatment for status epilepticus in children. It is a benzodiazepine that rapidly terminates seizures and is usually given intravenously. Diazepam can also be administered rectally in situations where intravenous access is difficult. C. Thiopentone sodium Thiopentone sodium (a barbiturate) is used as an induction agent for anesthesia and can also be used in refractory status epilepticus when seizures do not respond to initial treatments (like benzodiazepines and phenytoin).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Valproate Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by severe language regression, epilepsy, and often abnormal EEG findings. The disorder typically presents in children aged 3-7 years and is associated with seizures and a decline in language skills. The drug of choice in managing Landau-Kleffner syndrome is Valproate, an anticonvulsant that is commonly used to treat various types of seizures, including generalized and partial seizures. Valproate has shown efficacy in improving both the seizure control and language development in children with LKS. Incorrect Responses: B. Phenytoin Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant primarily used for treating partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, it is not the first-line treatment for Landau-Kleffner syndrome and may not be as effective in managing the condition compared to valproate. C. Rufinamide Rufinamide is another anticonvulsant used primarily for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other severe forms of epilepsy. While it may be effective for some seizure types, it is not the drug of choice for Landau-Kleffner syndrome, where valproate is preferred for its ability to control both seizures and language deficits. D. Carbamazepine Carbamazepine is commonly used to treat partial seizures and trigeminal neuralgia, but it is generally avoided in conditions like Landau-Kleffner syndrome, as it can sometimes worsen seizures and has less favorable effects on the language regression seen in LKS.",

A shorter course may not allow sufficient time for the antibiotics to fully eradicate the infection, especially in the central nervous system where penetration of the drug may be slower.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy The most likely diagnosis for this child with recent-onset dropping of objects upon waking up and a family history of similar symptoms, along with a characteristic EEG pattern, is Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME). Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy is a common form of epilepsy that typically presents in adolescence (usually between 12-18 years), with myoclonic jerks (involuntary muscle jerks), often in the morning or after waking up. The EEG pattern in JME typically shows generalized polyspike and wave activity, which is characteristic for this condition. Myoclonic seizures often involve the upper limbs, leading to the child dropping objects, as described in the case. Incorrect Responses: A. Choreoathetoid epilepsy Choreoathetoid movements involve involuntary, continuous, and irregular movements, often affecting the limbs and face. This is not consistent with the description of the morning-onset jerks and dropping of objects seen in the case. Additionally, the characteristic EEG finding of polyspike and wave in JME does not align with choreoathetoid epilepsy. B. Jacksonian march Jacksonian march refers to a type of seizure that starts in a focal area of the brain and then spreads in a specific, predictable pattern (usually motor). This is typically seen in focal seizures and not in the generalized, morning-onset myoclonic seizures seen in JME. D. Rolandic epilepsy Rolandic epilepsy, also known as Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), typically involves focal seizures affecting the face or tongue during sleep or upon waking. While it does affect children, it is not typically associated with the myoclonic jerks and generalized seizures characteristic of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Oral diazepam 6th hourly In the case of a febrile seizure in a 3-year-old child, the main goal is to prevent further recurrence of seizures associated with fever. The correct management typically involves: Oral diazepam given in intervals (e.g., 6-hourly) for 1-2 days after the initial febrile seizure, in order to prevent the recurrence of seizures due to fever spikes. This method is effective in preventing febrile seizures by ensuring the child does not experience another seizure while they recover from the fever. Oral diazepam works by providing sedation and anticonvulsant effects during this high-risk period, especially when the child has a tendency to experience recurrent febrile seizures. Incorrect Responses: A. Paracetamol + Diazepam Paracetamol may help reduce fever, but febrile seizures themselves are typically not treated with paracetamol to prevent recurrence. While diazepam can be used to control an acute seizure, giving paracetamol with diazepam does not specifically target prevention of future seizures. Therefore, this combination is not a standard approach for preventing recurrence. C. Paracetamol 400 mg 6th hourly Paracetamol is often used to control fever but does not prevent febrile seizures from occurring. While reducing fever can help decrease the likelihood of a seizure, it doesn't directly treat or prevent the seizures from recurring. Therefore, this option is not appropriate as a seizure recurrence prevention method. D. IV diazepam infusion over 12 hours IV diazepam is used in the acute management of seizures, particularly for prolonged or refractory seizures, but it is not the recommended approach for preventing recurrent febrile seizures in the context of a simple febrile seizure. Long-term IV infusion of diazepam is not used in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 3 Hz spike and wave Absence seizures (a type of generalized seizure) are characterized by brief episodes of impaired consciousness, often with staring spells and subtle motor activity like blinking or lip-smacking. The EEG pattern that is typically seen in absence seizures is the 3 Hz spike-and-wave pattern. This pattern consists of a spike followed by a slow wave occurring at a frequency of 3 cycles per second (Hz). This is considered a classic feature of absence seizures and is used to confirm the diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: B. 2 Hz spike and wave A 2 Hz spike-and-wave pattern is more commonly associated with certain other types of seizures, but it is not typical for absence seizures, which generally exhibit the 3 Hz pattern. The 2 Hz frequency may be seen in conditions like severe encephalopathies, but it is not a hallmark of absence seizures. C. Brief bursts of polyspikes Polyspikes can be seen in generalized seizures, but they are more commonly associated with myoclonic seizures or other types of generalized epilepsy. Absence seizures typically do not present with polyspike bursts; instead, they show the characteristic 3 Hz spike-and-wave pattern. D. Hypsarrhythmia Hypsarrhythmia is an EEG pattern seen in infantile spasms (a type of seizure disorder in infancy), not in absence seizures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Post-ictal confusion Absence seizures are a type of generalized seizure that typically manifest as brief episodes of impaired consciousness, often accompanied by staring or subtle motor activity. Key characteristics of absence seizures include: Incorrect Response: A. Usually seen in childhood: This is correct. Absence seizures are most commonly diagnosed in children, typically between the ages of 4 and 14 years. They may often resolve with age, but can sometimes persist into adulthood. B. 3 Hz spike wave seen in EEG: This is correct. The hallmark of absence seizures on EEG is the 3 Hz spike-and-wave pattern, which is a key feature used for diagnosis. D. Precipitation by hyperventilation: This is correct. Hyperventilation (rapid breathing) can trigger absence seizures in some individuals, and this is often used as a diagnostic test during an EEG evaluation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ACTH Infantile spasms, also known as West syndrome, is a severe form of epilepsy that typically begins in the first year of life. The drug of choice for the treatment of infantile spasms is ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Here's why: A. ACTH: This is correct. ACTH is considered the first-line treatment for infantile spasms due to its ability to effectively control seizures and induce remission in many infants. It works by reducing inflammation in the brain and regulating the immune response. ACTH is typically administered via intramuscular injection. Incorrect Responses: B. Vigabatrin: This is incorrect. While vigabatrin is a second-line treatment for infantile spasms, especially when ACTH is ineffective or contraindicated, it is not the first-line therapy. Vigabatrin is an anticonvulsant that works by inhibiting the enzyme GABA transaminase, which helps increase GABA levels in the brain. C. Carbamazepine: This is incorrect. Carbamazepine is typically used for partial seizures and other types of generalized seizures, but it is not effective in treating infantile spasms. It is not considered a treatment for West syndrome. D. Ethosuximide: This is incorrect. Ethosuximide is used primarily for absence seizures and does not have efficacy in treating infantile spasms. It is not indicated for West syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Complex partial seizure Automatisms refer to involuntary, repetitive movements that often occur during certain types of seizures. These movements can include lip-smacking, chewing, fidgeting, or other repetitive motions, and are usually seen in complex partial seizures (also known as focal onset impaired awareness seizures). In complex partial seizures, the person experiences a loss of awareness or consciousness while the seizure occurs. Automatisms are a prominent feature of these seizures and may involve repetitive movements like lip-smacking, picking at clothes, or fumbling with objects. These occur because the seizure affects the brain regions responsible for motor control and consciousness. Incorrect Responses: B. Simple partial seizures: Incorrect. Simple partial seizures (now called focal onset aware seizures) do not cause loss of consciousness. These seizures typically involve motor, sensory, or autonomic symptoms but do not involve automatisms since the person remains aware during the seizure. C. Infantile spasms: Incorrect. Infantile spasms are a type of seizure that typically involves sudden jerking or stiffening movements, most commonly of the neck, limbs, and trunk. These spasms occur in clusters and are often associated with developmental delay or conditions like tuberous sclerosis. They do not involve automatisms. D. Absence seizures: Incorrect. Absence seizures (formerly known as petit mal seizures) are characterized by brief episodes of blank staring or loss of awareness without major motor movements. While automatisms (like eye blinking or subtle hand movements) can occasionally occur in some cases, they are not as characteristic or prominent as in complex partial seizures.",

Incorrect Responses: A. Tubercular meningitis: Incorrect. Tubercular meningitis typically presents with: CSF cell count: High white blood cells, usually with a predominance of lymphocytes. Protein: Elevated, often higher than in viral meningitis, typically in the 100-500 mg/dL range. Glucose: Low glucose (typically 1000 cells/mm³, predominantly neutrophils.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 4-6 weeks In the management of a pediatric brain abscess, intravenous antibiotics are typically given for a total duration of 4-6 weeks. The specific duration may vary depending on the clinical response, severity of the abscess, and whether surgery (such as drainage or aspiration) is performed. This extended course of intravenous antibiotics is required to ensure the eradication of the infection, especially in a serious condition like a brain abscess where the risk of further neurological complications is high. Incorrect Responses: A. 7-10 days: Incorrect. A 7-10 day duration is typically used for some simpler infections, but brain abscesses are severe and require a longer course of treatment to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. 7-10 days is too short for a condition like a brain abscess. B. 2-3 weeks: Incorrect. Although 2-3 weeks is longer than the typical course for many infections, brain abscesses generally require an even longer course of intravenous antibiotics to achieve a complete cure, particularly if there is significant intracranial involvement.

While Escherichia coli is a common cause of neonatal meningitis, especially in premature infants, it is typically associated with a lower mortality rate compared to pneumococcal meningitis in children. Mortality is still significant, but generally, it is not as high as that seen with Pneumococcus. C. Neisseria meningitides: Incorrect. Neisseria meningitidis can cause severe meningitis, particularly in adolescents, but the overall mortality rate is lower than that associated with Pneumococcus. Early recognition and antibiotic treatment improve outcomes for meningococcal meningitis, reducing its mortality rate. D. H. influenzae: Incorrect. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) used to be a major cause of bacterial meningitis in children, but due to widespread vaccination, the incidence has significantly decreased. The mortality rate for Hib meningitis was high prior to vaccination but is now considerably lower than that for Pneumococcal meningitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Streptococcus pneumoniae The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in a child with CSF rhinorrhea (cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the nose) is Streptococcus pneumoniae. CSF rhinorrhea often occurs as a result of trauma, surgery, or conditions like sinusitis or skull base fractures. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children, particularly in cases where there is an underlying condition that increases the risk of bacterial entry into the central nervous system, such as CSF leaks. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a highly virulent pathogen that can cause both meningitis and pneumonia, and its presence in the CSF is particularly concerning in the setting of CSF leakage, as it can easily colonize the CSF space, leading to infection. Incorrect Responses: A. Streptococcus agalactiae: Incorrect. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a major cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis but is not typically associated with CSF rhinorrhea in older children or the general pediatric population. It usually causes meningitis in newborns, particularly in the first few days of life. C. Escherichia coli: Incorrect. Escherichia coli is a common pathogen in neonatal meningitis, particularly in premature infants or those with other risk factors such as low birth weight. However, it is not the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in a child with CSF rhinorrhea, where Streptococcus pneumoniae is more likely. D. Staphylococcus aureus: Incorrect. Staphylococcus aureus can cause a variety of infections, including meningitis and brain abscesses, but it is less commonly the cause of meningitis in the setting of CSF rhinorrhea compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Spastic quadriplegic CP Spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy (CP) is characterized by bilateral spasticity affecting all four limbs, and it is the most severe form of cerebral palsy. This type is associated with bulbar palsies (which affect the cranial nerves responsible for swallowing, speech, and facial movement) and intellectual dysfunction. Bulbar palsies can cause difficulties with speech, swallowing, and breathing, while intellectual dysfunction may vary in severity but is often present in these patients. The severity of the neurological involvement, including cognitive and motor impairments, is more profound in quadriplegic CP. Incorrect Responses: A. Spastic diplegic CP: Incorrect. Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy primarily affects the lower limbs, with relatively less involvement of the upper limbs and typically without significant bulbar involvement or intellectual dysfunction. Children with spastic diplegic CP may have mild cognitive issues, but the primary symptoms involve motor impairments, especially in walking. C. Spastic hemiplegic CP: Incorrect. Spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy affects one side of the body (one arm and one leg) and is typically not associated with bulbar palsies or intellectual dysfunction. Children with hemiplegic CP usually have relatively preserved cognitive function, and their main motor difficulties involve one side of the body. D. Choreoathetoid CP: Incorrect. Choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, also known as dyskinetic CP, involves involuntary, uncontrolled movements and can affect both the upper and lower limbs. However, it is not typically associated with bulbar palsies or intellectual dysfunction as prominently as spastic quadriplegic CP. Cognitive impairment may occur but is less common than in spastic quadriplegia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) BERA (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry) Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA) is essential in cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis because one of the significant complications of this infection is sensorineural hearing loss. H. influenzae type b (Hib) meningitis can lead to damage to the auditory pathway, especially the cochlea and brainstem, which may result in permanent hearing impairment. Therefore, testing hearing function using BERA before discharge is crucial for early detection and management of any hearing loss. Incorrect Responses: A. EEG (Electroencephalogram): Incorrect. While an EEG may be useful in detecting seizures or assessing brain function in certain neurological conditions, it is not routinely required prior to discharge in a patient with H. influenzae meningitis unless the patient has developed seizures or other abnormal neurological signs that would warrant such an investigation. C. Developmental screening test: Incorrect. Developmental screening tests are typically done to assess cognitive and developmental milestones, but they are not as urgently required prior to discharge in a child with meningitis as hearing screening. The primary concern in H. influenzae meningitis is hearing loss, so hearing assessment (BERA) takes priority. D. ECG (Electrocardiogram): Incorrect. An ECG is used to assess heart rhythm and function, but it is not typically indicated in the routine follow-up for H. influenzae meningitis unless there are specific cardiovascular concerns. The major concern post-meningitis is hearing impairment, not cardiac issues.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Severity of myotonia is determined by degree of weakness in muscles Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the muscles, and the severity of myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) does not correlate with the degree of muscle weakness. In fact, some individuals with myotonic dystrophy may have significant myotonia but relatively mild muscle weakness, while others may have severe weakness with minimal myotonia. The key feature of the disease is the delayed relaxation of muscles, not the extent of weakness. Incorrect Responses: A. Distal muscles are affected earlier than proximal muscles: Correct. In myotonic dystrophy, the distal muscles (such as those in the hands, fingers, and lower legs) are typically affected earlier and more severely than the proximal muscles (such as those in the upper arms and thighs). This distinguishes it from other forms of muscular dystrophy, where proximal muscles tend to be affected first. B. Cardiac and endocrine abnormalities are common: Correct. Cardiac issues such as arrhythmias (especially conduction defects) and endocrine abnormalities (like insulin resistance, hypothyroidism, and testicular atrophy in males) are indeed common in myotonic dystrophy. These systemic manifestations contribute to the overall disease burden and can lead to significant complications. D. Immune abnormalities with low serum IgG is commonly seen: Correct. Myotonic dystrophy can be associated with immune abnormalities, including low serum IgG levels, which may predispose affected individuals to recurrent infections. Additionally, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been noted in some cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder that results in progressive muscle weakness starting in the lower limbs. Calf hypertrophy (muscle enlargement due to fatty infiltration) is a hallmark feature of DMD. The Gower's sign, which is the difficulty standing up from the floor and the need to use the hands to \"walk up\" the thighs, is pathognomonic for DMD and is typically seen in children with proximal muscle weakness. Elevated CPK (creatine phosphokinase) levels are often extremely high in DMD patients, often in the range of 10,000-100,000 U/L due to muscle breakdown. Incorrect Options: B. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA): SMA is a genetic disorder that affects motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. Although the boy has weakness and calf hypertrophy, SMA is characterized by absence of Gower's sign, and SMA usually presents with proximal muscle weakness and atrophy, rather than hypertrophy. Elevated CPK values are also generally not as elevated in SMA as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. C. Myotonia Congenital: Myotonia is a condition where there is delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction, typically leading to muscle stiffness and difficulty in movement. Myotonia congenital does not typically cause weakness or Gower's sign, and there is no calf hypertrophy or extremely elevated CPK levels. The primary feature is myotonia (muscle stiffness), not weakness. D. Myotonic Dystrophy: Myotonic dystrophy can present with muscle weakness and calf hypertrophy, but it typically presents with distal muscle weakness first and can cause systemic issues such as cardiac conduction defects or endocrine disturbances. Gower’s sign and the extremely elevated CPK value of 10,000 are more characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, not myotonic dystrophy, where CPK levels are usually elevated but not to such a high degree.",

It works by skipping over defective parts of the gene to restore the production of dystrophin, a protein essential for muscle function. This treatment is specific to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness due to a lack of functional dystrophin. Incorrect Options: A. Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle weakness due to the autoantibodies blocking the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
