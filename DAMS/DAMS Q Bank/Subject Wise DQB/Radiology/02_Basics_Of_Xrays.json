      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Osteogenic sarcoma (Osteosarcoma). The sunray (sunburst) appearance on X-ray is a characteristic feature of osteosarcoma, a highly malignant bone tumor that typically affects metaphyses of long bones (e.g., distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus) in adolescents and young adults. The sunburst pattern occurs due to aggressive periosteal reaction, where tumor bone spicules radiate outward in a perpendicular fashion from the cortex. This is caused by rapid tumor growth, which lifts the periosteum and produces new bone in a radiating pattern. Additionally, Codman’s triangle (periosteal elevation) is another radiographic sign commonly seen in osteosarcoma. Incorrect Options: B. Ewing's sarcoma Ewing’s sarcoma more commonly presents with an onion-skin (lamellated) periosteal reaction, not a sunburst pattern. It arises from the diaphysis of long bones and is associated with 11:22 translocation (EWS-FLI1 fusion gene). C. Multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy that produces osteolytic punched-out lesions rather than periosteal reactions like the sunburst pattern. D. Osteoclastoma (Giant Cell Tumor) Osteoclastoma (Giant Cell Tumor, GCT) typically affects the epiphysis of long bones and appears as a soap-bubble lytic lesion on X-ray rather than a sunburst pattern.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Red. In an X-ray department darkroom, safelight selection is critical to prevent film fogging while maintaining sufficient illumination for handling X-ray films. The safest light used is red because: Red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, which means it has the least energy and is least likely to expose or damage the X-ray film. It is commonly used in darkrooms with orthochromatic film, which is insensitive to red light but sensitive to blue and green light. Proper safelight conditions ensure that films can be processed without unintended exposure or degradation. Incorrect Options: A. Dull white White light contains all wavelengths, including blue and green, which are highly sensitive to X-ray films and would fog the film immediately. B. Blue Blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher energy, making it more likely to affect X-ray film exposure. Most X-ray films are blue-sensitive, so blue light is not safe in a darkroom. C. Green Green light is used in some film-screen combinations (green-sensitive films) but is not the safest choice. Green-sensitive films require red safelight, as green light can still expose the film",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1895. X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen on November 8, 1895. While experimenting with cathode rays in a Crookes tube, he noticed that an unknown type of radiation could penetrate opaque materials and cast shadows on a fluorescent screen. Since he did not know the nature of these rays, he called them \"X-rays\", where \"X\" denotes the unknown. For his groundbreaking discovery, Roentgen was awarded the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. Incorrect Options: A. 1886 No significant discovery related to X-rays occurred in 1886. However, earlier work by Philipp Lenard and Heinrich Hertz on cathode rays laid the foundation for Roentgen's discovery. B. 1902 By 1902, X-rays were already widely used in medicine and industry, and Roentgen had received his Nobel Prize (1901). D. 1907 X-ray technology had already advanced significantly by 1907, including the development of early X-ray tubes and diagnostic applications.",

Anatomy of the Right Border of the Heart in PA View: In a PA chest X-ray, the right heart border is formed by structures located on the right side of the mediastinum, which include: Superior vena cava (SVC) - Forms the uppermost part of the right heart border. Right atrium (RA) - Forms the majority of the right heart border. Inferior vena cava (IVC) - Seen at the lower right portion, just above the diaphragm. Thus, options A (SVC), B (IVC), and C (Right atrium) are correct because they contribute to the right heart border. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is part of the left atrium, which is located posteriorly in the mediastinum. In a PA chest X-ray, the left atrial appendage contributes to the left heart border, not the right border.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lateral decubitus positioning is the best method to detect minimal pleural effusion on X-ray. In this position, the patient lies on the side of the suspected effusion, allowing free-flowing fluid to shift and form a layer along the dependent chest wall. This technique can detect as little as 10-15 mL of pleural fluid, making it the most sensitive radiographic method for identifying small effusions. Incorrect Options: B. Full inspiration erect In an erect position, gravity causes pleural fluid to accumulate in the costophrenic angles, making larger effusions visible. However, small pleural effusions (<75 mL) may remain undetected, as they spread thinly along the pleural surface. C. Supine In the supine position, pleural fluid spreads evenly over the posterior pleural space, leading to a diffuse haziness or \"veil-like\" opacity rather than a clearly defined meniscus. Minimal effusions are easily missed in this view. D. Full expiration erect Expiration reduces lung volume, which may enhance detection of pneumothorax but does not improve visualization of minimal pleural effusion. The fluid remains in the dependent area, and smaller amounts may still be difficult to detect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Loss of plane between soft tissue and muscle. In acute osteomyelitis, the earliest radiological change is soft tissue swelling, which appears within 24-48 hours of infection. This is seen as a loss of fat planes between muscles and soft tissues on X-ray. The infection initially affects the bone marrow and adjacent soft tissues, leading to inflammatory edema and swelling, which is detectable before bone changes become apparent. Incorrect Options: A. Periosteal reaction Periosteal reaction occurs later (7-10 days after infection onset) due to subperiosteal pus accumulation. It appears as elevation of the periosteum on radiographs. C. Sequestrum formation Sequestrum (a necrotic bone fragment separated from healthy bone) is a chronic feature of osteomyelitis. It usually develops after weeks to months and is seen in chronic osteomyelitis rather than the acute phase. D. Bony sclerosis Bony sclerosis represents a late response of bone to infection, appearing after several weeks to months as part of the chronic healing process.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Speed of light. X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light, radio waves, and gamma rays. All electromagnetic waves, including X-rays, travel at the speed of light (c), which is approximately 3 × 108 meters per second (m/s) in a vacuum. The speed of X-rays is not dependent on their energy, frequency, or wavelength; it remains constant in a vacuum. Incorrect Options: B. Speed of electrons in the X-ray tube Inside an X-ray tube, electrons are accelerated toward the tungsten target by a high voltage (kVp), but their speed is much lower than the speed of light. The speed of these electrons depends on the applied voltage but is not equal to the speed of X-rays. C. Tube voltage Tube voltage (measured in kilovolts, kVp) determines the energy and penetrating power of X-rays, but it does not influence their speed. Higher tube voltage increases X-ray energy (shorter wavelength, higher frequency) but not their velocity. D. All of the above Only the speed of light is correct; the speed of electrons and tube voltage do not determine the speed of X-rays.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Left atrium. The angle of tracheal bifurcation (also known as the carinal angle) is normally about 60–75 degrees. This angle can increase due to conditions that cause widening of the mediastinum or displacement of the bronchi. Left atrial enlargement (e.g., in mitral valve disease) causes posterior displacement of the left main bronchus, leading to an increased carinal angle. This is commonly seen in conditions like mitral stenosis or left heart failure, where increased pressure in the left atrium leads to its dilation. Incorrect Options: (A) Right ventricle enlargement – Typically causes upward displacement of the cardiac silhouette but does not significantly affect the carinal angle. (B) Left ventricle enlargement – Expands more downward and laterally rather than affecting the tracheal bifurcation. (C) Right atrium enlargement – Primarily affects the right heart border on a chest X-ray, not the tracheal bifurcation.",

Incorrect Options: (B) Low contrast –, because reducing scatter increases contrast, not decreases it. (C) Less motion – as a cone does not affect patient or equipment motion. (D) Long scale contrast – because a long scale contrast means more shades of gray (low contrast), whereas a cone results in short scale contrast (higher contrast).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) First 10 days of the menstrual cycle. In females of reproductive age, radiological investigations involving ionizing radiation (such as X-rays, CT scans) should be restricted to the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle to minimize the risk of radiation exposure to an early pregnancy. This is known as the \"10-day rule,\" which recommends that elective radiological procedures be performed during the first 10 days of the menstrual cycle (starting from day 1 of menstruation) when the probability of pregnancy is extremely low. If a woman is pregnant and exposed to radiation, particularly during organogenesis (weeks 3–8), there is a risk of fetal malformations, growth restriction, or even pregnancy loss. By scheduling imaging in the first 10 days, the risk of exposing a developing embryo to harmful radiation is significantly reduced. Incorrect Options: (B) Last 10 days of the menstrual cycle – Incorrect because this phase is the luteal phase, where fertilization may have already occurred, and implantation might take place. Performing radiological investigations during this period increases the risk of unknowingly exposing an early pregnancy to radiation, which could potentially cause developmental issues. (C) 10-20th day of the menstrual cycle – Incorrect because this timeframe includes ovulation (around day 14), which is the period when a woman is most likely to conceive. If conception occurs, early embryonic development begins within days, and radiation exposure during this critical phase can increase the risk of birth defects or miscarriage. (D) Period of menstruation – While menstruation itself is part of the first 10 days of the cycle, scheduling imaging during menstruation is unnecessary when it can be safely performed at any point within the first 10 days. Some women may also find undergoing radiological procedures during menstruation uncomfortable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Expiratory film. An expiratory film is not a cause of increased radiolucency in one hemithorax. In fact, during expiration, the lung volumes decrease as the air is expelled, leading to a relatively denser (more radiopaque) appearance. Therefore, an expiratory film would not produce the appearance of a hyperlucent (overly dark) hemithorax. Incorrect Options: (A) Obstructive emphysema: This condition causes air trapping and overinflation of the affected lung. The excess air increases radiolucency, making the lung appear darker on the X-ray. Thus, obstructive emphysema is a known cause of unilateral increased radiolucency. (B) Pneumothorax: A pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space. The presence of air, which is radiolucent, results in a darker appearance of the affected hemithorax on the radiograph. This is a classic cause of increased radiolucency. (D) Rotation: Patient rotation during the X-ray can create asymmetry in the appearance of the lung fields. Rotation may cause one hemithorax to seem more radiolucent due to changes in the projected thickness of the chest wall and lung tissues, potentially mimicking increased radiolucency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Caldwell. The Caldwell view, also known as the occipitofrontal projection, is the best radiographic projection to visualize the superior orbital fissure. This view is obtained with the patient's forehead and nose against the film and the X-ray beam angled 15 degrees caudally. Such angulation provides a clear and unobstructed image of the orbital margins, particularly the orbital roof and apex, where the superior orbital fissure is located. This makes the Caldwell view optimal for evaluating bony structures of the orbit. Incorrect Options: (A) Plain AP view: A plain anteroposterior view does not offer the necessary angulation to clearly demonstrate the superior orbital fissure. The direct AP projection can result in superimposition of orbital structures, which may obscure critical details, including the superior orbital fissure. (C) Townes view: The Townes view is not a standard projection used for detailed orbital imaging. It does not provide the proper orientation or angulation required to specifically highlight the superior orbital fissure, making it less suitable than the Caldwell view. (D) Basal view: The basal view (or submentovertex view) is primarily used to evaluate the cranial base and the structures at the bottom of the skull. It does not project the orbital apex or the superior orbital fissure as clearly as the Caldwell view, and therefore is not ideal for this purpose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) An osteogenic sarcoma. Osteogenic sarcoma, also known as osteosarcoma, is a primary malignant bone tumor that often produces a \"sunray\" or \"sunburst\" pattern on X-rays. This appearance results from aggressive periosteal reaction where new bone is produced in a radiating, spiculated pattern around the tumor, mimicking rays emanating from the sun. The characteristic periosteal reaction is a key diagnostic clue in identifying osteogenic sarcoma. Incorrect Options: (A) A chondrosarcoma: Chondrosarcoma typically shows calcifications in a chondroid matrix on X-rays rather than a sunray appearance. Its radiographic features usually include ring-and-arc calcifications and a lobulated mass, not the aggressive periosteal reaction seen in osteosarcoma. (B) A metastatic tumour in the bone: Metastatic lesions in bone generally appear as lytic or blastic lesions depending on the primary source, but they do not produce a sunray pattern. The pattern of bone destruction or sclerosis in metastases is usually more irregular and less structured compared to the spiculated periosteal reaction of osteogenic sarcoma. (D) An Ewing's sarcoma: Ewing's sarcoma is known for its \"onion skin\" periosteal reaction due to layered new bone formation. This pattern is distinctly different from the sunray appearance, which is characterized by radiating bone spicules associated with osteogenic sarcoma.",

This combination gives them a high linear energy transfer (LET), meaning they deposit a large amount of energy over a very short distance as they pass through matter. This dense ionization track makes helium ions the most effective in causing ionization, thereby exhibiting the maximum ionization potential among the options provided. Incorrect Options: (A) Electron: Electrons are very light and carry a single negative charge. They produce less dense ionization tracks because they transfer energy more sparsely as they traverse matter, resulting in a lower ionization potential compared to helium ions. (B) Proton: Protons are heavier than electrons and carry a positive charge, which gives them a higher ionization potential than electrons. However, being singly charged, they do not deposit energy as densely as helium ions, making their ionization potential lower than that of helium ions. (D) Gamma (?)-Photon: Gamma photons are uncharged and interact with matter indirectly (via mechanisms such as the photoelectric effect or Compton scattering). They deposit energy less directly and less densely, resulting in the lowest ionization potential compared to charged particles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Plain radiograph. In a patient with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) who develops shock, a plain radiograph (chest X-ray) is the most efficient and practical method to assess the position and integrity of the ICD. Plain radiography provides clear images of the ICD generator and leads, allowing for the identification of any malposition, lead fractures, or disconnections. It is readily available, quick to perform, and safe for patients with implanted devices. Incorrect Options: (A) Contrast CT: Although CT can offer detailed cross-sectional images, the presence of metal in the ICD leads to significant artifact, which may obscure critical details. Additionally, CT involves higher radiation doses and the use of contrast, making it less ideal for routine assessment of ICD position. (B) MRI: MRI is generally contraindicated in patients with ICDs because the strong magnetic fields can interfere with the device's function and potentially cause harm. Even if an MRI-compatible ICD is in place, MRI is not the first-line investigation for evaluating device integrity. (C) Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not effective in visualizing the metallic components of an ICD. Its utility is limited to soft tissue evaluation, and it does not provide the necessary detail to assess the position or integrity of the ICD leads and generator.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Energy. The primary difference between visible light and X-rays lies in the energy of their photons. X-rays have a much higher frequency than visible light, which according to the equation E = hf (where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency), means they carry significantly more energy. This high energy enables X-rays to penetrate materials that visible light cannot, which is why they are used in medical imaging and other applications where deep tissue visualization is required. Incorrect Options: (B) Mass: Both visible light and X-rays are forms of electromagnetic radiation and are composed of photons, which are massless. Therefore, mass is not a distinguishing factor. (C) Speed: In a vacuum, both visible light and X-rays travel at the same speed—the speed of light, approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s. Hence, speed does not differentiate them. (D) Type of wave: Both visible light and X-rays are electromagnetic waves. They share the same basic nature as waves, even though they differ in wavelength and frequency. Thus, the type of wave is the same for both",
