      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Biparietal diameter (BPD) at 12 weeks. Biparietal diameter (BPD) is one of the most reliable ultrasound parameters for assessing fetal maturity and gestational age. It is measurable from 12 weeks onward and becomes more accurate after 14 weeks. Early and consistent measurement: It can be accurately measured as early as 12 weeks and correlates well with fetal age. Reliable predictor: After the first trimester, it is one of the best predictors of fetal maturity and is used in standard growth charts. Less variability: Compared to femur length or head circumference, BPD shows less variation due to genetic factors. Incorrect Options: (A) Crown-rump length (CRL) at 16 weeks CRL is useful only in the first trimester (up to 13 weeks). After 14 weeks, CRL is not reliable as the fetus begins to curl, making accurate measurement difficult. (B) Head circumference at 36 weeks Head circumference is useful in later pregnancy but is not the best for fetal maturity as it can be affected by fetal head molding. In the third trimester, fetal head size varies, making it less accurate than BPD. (D) Femur length at 12 weeks Femur length is useful later in pregnancy, usually from 14 weeks onward. At 12 weeks, it is too small to provide accurate maturity assessment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Carcinoma stomach (CA stomach). The \"pseudokidney sign\" is an ultrasound (USG) finding that occurs when a segment of bowel (usually affected by malignancy or inflammation) appears kidney-shaped, with a hypoechoic outer layer and a hyperechoic central region, mimicking the appearance of a kidney. In gastric carcinoma, thickening of the gastric wall (especially in the pyloric region) can compress the lumen, creating a kidney-like shape. The hypoechoic outer layer represents the thickened gastric wall and the hyperechoic central area corresponds to the gastric lumen filled with debris or fluid. This sign is also seen in bowel malignancies and inflammatory conditions, but it is classically associated with carcinoma stomach. Incorrect Options: (A) Trichobezoar Trichobezoars (hairballs) are echogenic masses with acoustic shadowing in the stomach. They do not resemble a kidney and do not produce the pseudokidney sign. (C) Carcinoma kidney Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presents as a heterogeneous mass in the kidney on USG. It does not mimic a kidney shape, so it does not show the pseudokidney sign. (D) Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) PKD appears as multiple cysts in both kidneys, leading to enlargement and distortion of kidney shape. The kidney remains recognizable as a kidney, so it does not resemble the pseudokidney sign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CBD stones at the distal end of the CBD. Ultrasonography (USG) has limitations in visualizing the distal common bile duct (CBD) because it is deeply located and often obscured by bowel gas. The distal CBD lies near the duodenum, which contains air and interferes with sound wave transmission, making it difficult to detect small stones. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) is more accurate for detecting distal CBD stones. Incorrect Options: (B) Breast Cyst Ultrasound is the best modality for evaluating breast cysts. It can distinguish between solid and cystic masses and is commonly used in young women where mammography is less effective. (C) Ascites USG is highly sensitive for detecting even small amounts of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. It is the investigation of choice for diagnosing ascites and guiding paracentesis. (D) Full Bladder USG is commonly used for assessing bladder volume, bladder wall abnormalities, and urinary retention. A full bladder is actually helpful in ultrasound examination of the pelvis to visualize the uterus and ovaries.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Intussusception. The \"target sign\" (also called the \"donut sign\") is a classic ultrasound finding in intussusception, which occurs when a segment of the intestine telescopes into another. On a transverse ultrasound scan, this appears as a concentric ring pattern due to alternating layers of the intussusceptum (inner bowel loop) and intussuscipiens (outer bowel loop). It is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing pediatric intussusception. Incorrect Options: (A) Ovarian Carcinoma Ovarian carcinoma is typically seen as a solid-cystic mass with septations and papillary projections on ultrasound, not a target sign. (B) Ectopic Kidney An ectopic kidney is an abnormally positioned kidney (e.g., in the pelvis), which is diagnosed based on absence in the normal location and identification elsewhere, not by a target sign. (D) Liver Metastasis Liver metastases appear as hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or mixed echogenic lesions with irregular margins, but they do not produce the classic concentric ring appearance seen in intussusception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Piezoelectric crystal excitation. Ultrasound machines work on the principle of piezoelectricity, where certain crystals (such as quartz or lead zirconate titanate) generate ultrasonic waves when subjected to an electric current. These high-frequency sound waves travel through tissues and are reflected back to the probe, where they are converted into electrical signals to create an image. This principle is fundamental to diagnostic ultrasonography used in medical imaging. Incorrect Options: (B) Very Low-Frequency Radiowaves Radiowaves are used in MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), not ultrasound. MRI operates with low-frequency radio waves and strong magnetic fields, whereas ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves (typically 2-15 MHz). (C) Microwaves Microwaves are electromagnetic waves and are used in therapeutic applications (e.g., diathermy, microwave ablation) but not in ultrasound imaging.

If the stomach is collapsed, it may appear thicker, but the general upper limit for a normal stomach wall is 5 mm. Thickness greater than 5 mm may suggest pathologies such as gastritis, gastric lymphoma, or gastric carcinoma. Incorrect Options: (A) 2 mm A 2 mm thickness is too thin for a normal gastric wall. This value may be seen in some atrophic gastric conditions, but it is not the standard thickness in a healthy individual. (C) 7 mm A 7 mm thickness is considered borderline abnormal, possibly indicating mild inflammation or early pathology. Normal stomach wall thickness should not exceed 5 mm in a well-distended stomach. (D) 10 mm A 10 mm thickness is abnormally high and strongly suggests pathological conditions, such as gastric cancer, Ménétrier’s disease, or severe gastritis.

They have enough energy to break DNA strands, leading to mutations and potential cancer development. High doses of X-rays can cause chromosomal aberrations. (B) UV rays – Mutagenic Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can induce pyrimidine dimers (thymine-thymine dimers) in DNA. This DNA damage, if not repaired, can lead to mutations and skin cancers (e.g., melanoma). (D) Beta rays – Mutagenic Beta rays (high-energy electrons) are ionizing radiation and can damage DNA.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Down syndrome because ultrasound alone cannot definitively diagnose Down syndrome. Ultrasound can detect markers (e.g., nuchal translucency, absent nasal bone, echogenic bowel) suggestive of Down syndrome, but it cannot confirm the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing like: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Amniocentesis Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free fetal DNA False positives/negatives: Many ultrasound findings overlap with normal variations, making it unreliable as a standalone diagnostic tool for Down syndrome. Incorrect Options: (A) Anencephaly – Diagnosable by Ultrasound Absence of cranial vault and brain tissue can be seen on ultrasound as early as 11-14 weeks of gestation. The \"frog-eye sign\" (prominent orbits with no skull above) is a classic feature. (C) Placenta Praevia – Diagnosable by Ultrasound Ultrasound, particularly transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), is the best modality to identify a low-lying placenta covering the cervix. It helps in grading placenta previa based on its proximity to the internal os. (D) Hydatidiform Mole – Diagnosable by Ultrasound A molar pregnancy appears as a \"snowstorm pattern\" or \"grape-like vesicles\" in the uterus on ultrasound. No identifiable fetus is seen in complete molar pregnancy, while partial moles may show abnormal fetal development.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ultrasound, as it is the initial investigation of choice in an elderly patient with jaundice and abdominal pain. Non-invasive and readily available: Ultrasound is a quick, safe, and widely accessible imaging modality. Detects biliary obstruction: It can easily identify dilated bile ducts, gallstones, or masses obstructing bile flow. Assesses liver and pancreas: It helps evaluate hepatic lesions, pancreatic tumors, or bile duct abnormalities contributing to jaundice. No radiation exposure, making it safer than CT in initial assessment. Incorrect Options: (B) 4-Quadrant Aspiration – Not appropriate This is done in cases of suspected peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscess but has no role in evaluating jaundice. (C) CT Scan – Not the first-line investigation CT scan is more detailed but is usually performed after ultrasound if a mass, tumor, or uncertain pathology is suspected. It is more expensive and involves radiation, making ultrasound the preferred initial test. (D) X-ray Abdomen – Not useful for jaundice evaluation X-rays cannot detect biliary obstruction, gallstones (unless calcified), or liver pathology.

Most common congenital renal tumor: Mesoblastic nephroma (also called mesonephroblastic tumor) is the most common solid renal tumor in neonates and infants. Typically presents at birth or within the first few months: Unlike Wilm's tumor or neuroblastoma, which are more common in older infants and children. Ultrasound findings: Appears as a solid, hypoechoic (low echogenicity) renal mass without significant calcifications. Benign behavior: It has a better prognosis compared to Wilm’s tumor or neuroblastoma. Incorrect Options: (A) Wilm’s Tumor (Nephroblastoma) – Less likely in neonates Wilm’s tumor is the most common renal tumor in children, but it is rare in neonates, typically presenting after 6 months to 5 years. On USG, it usually appears as a mixed echogenic solid-cystic mass, often with necrosis or hemorrhage. (B) Neuroblastoma – Arises from adrenal gland, not kidney Most common extracranial solid tumor in children but usually arises from the adrenal gland, not the kidney. Often heterogeneous with calcifications on ultrasound, unlike the hypoechoic shadow seen here. May show metastasis, unlike localized mesonephroblastic tumors. (D) Renal Adenoma – Rare in neonates Small, benign tumors seen in adults rather than neonates. They are usually asymptomatic and incidental findings rather than presenting as a neonatal mass.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Reflection, as acoustic shadowing on ultrasound occurs due to the reflection of sound waves. Acoustic shadowing is an ultrasound artifact that occurs when sound waves encounter a highly reflective structure (e.g., bone, gallstones, or calcifications). The waves are reflected back completely, preventing further transmission beyond the structure. This results in a dark (hypoechoic or anechoic) area behind the object. Common examples include gallstones, kidney stones, and bones, which create a posterior acoustic shadow on ultrasound imaging. Incorrect Options: (B) Refraction – Incorrect Refraction occurs when sound waves change direction due to different tissue densities, leading to artifacts like edge shadowing, but not the true acoustic shadow seen with strong reflectors. (C) Artefact – Incorrect Acoustic shadowing is a type of artifact, but the question asks for the mechanism behind it, which is reflection. (D) Absorption of Waves – Incorrect Absorption refers to the conversion of sound energy into heat within tissues, which leads to attenuation, not true acoustic shadowing. Structures like soft tissues absorb sound gradually, unlike strong reflectors that create a distinct shadow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anencephaly, as it is the earliest congenital malformation that can be detected on ultrasound (USG). Anencephaly is one of the first detectable fetal anomalies on ultrasound, often as early as 11-14 weeks of gestation during the first-trimester scan. It is a neural tube defect (NTD) characterized by the absence of the cranial vault and brain tissue. On USG, it appears as an absent skull with exposed brain tissue, often described as the “frog-eye” sign due to the prominent orbits. Because it is a severe and easily recognizable defect, it is one of the earliest anomalies diagnosed in prenatal scans. Incorrect Options: (B) Hydrocephalus – Detected later in pregnancy Hydrocephalus (abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles) is usually detected after 18-20 weeks when ventricular dilation becomes evident. It may not be apparent in the first trimester, making it a later diagnosis than anencephaly. (C) Sacral Agenesis – Detected in the second trimester Sacral agenesis (caudal regression syndrome) involves incomplete development of the lower spine. It is best detected in mid-to-late second trimester (after 18-20 weeks) when skeletal abnormalities become clearer. (D) Down’s Syndrome – Requires additional screening tests Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) does not have a single definitive USG finding. Nuchal translucency (NT) measurement can be done between 11-14 weeks, but it is only a marker, not a diagnostic feature. Confirmatory tests like chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis are needed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Real-time ultrasound, as it is the best method for detecting the earliest sign of fetal life. Real-time ultrasound (USG) is the earliest method to detect fetal cardiac activity. Fetal heartbeats can be visualized as early as 5-6 weeks of gestation using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Motion of the fetal heart can be directly observed, confirming fetal viability even before Doppler detects the heartbeat. This makes real-time ultrasound the gold standard for early confirmation of fetal life. Incorrect Options: (A) Doppler – Detects fetal heartbeat later Doppler ultrasound detects blood flow and fetal heart sounds but is not the earliest method to confirm fetal life. It typically detects the fetal heartbeat around 10-12 weeks gestation, which is later than real-time ultrasound. (C) Fetoscopy – Invasive and used later in pregnancy Fetoscopy is an invasive technique used for direct visualization of the fetus but is not used for early detection of fetal life. It is typically performed after 16 weeks of gestation for genetic sampling or fetal interventions. (D) X-ray – Not used for detecting fetal life X-rays are not used in early pregnancy due to the risk of radiation exposure. Fetal skeletons appear on X-rays only after 16-20 weeks, making it a poor choice for detecting early fetal life.",

It helps determine if the IUD is in the correct intrauterine position or has moved into the endometrial cavity, myometrium, or even perforated the uterus. It is a safe, quick, and non-invasive method. (B) X-ray Abdomen (Erect View) – Used if IUD is missing on ultrasound If ultrasound fails to locate the IUD, an X-ray of the abdomen and pelvis can help detect if the IUD has migrated outside the uterus. It is useful in cases of perforation or expulsion of the IUD into the peritoneal cavity. A displaced IUD appears as a radiopaque (visible) structure on X-ray. (C) Uterine Sound and Hysteroscopy – Direct visualization Uterine sound (a thin metal probe) can be used to check if the IUD is within the uterine cavity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anencephaly. Anencephaly is a neural tube defect (NTD) caused by failure of the cranial neuropore to close by the 4th week of gestation (around day 25). It leads to absence of the skull and brain, making it one of the earliest detectable congenital malformations on ultrasound as early as 11–14 weeks. Ultrasound findings: Absence of the calvarium (skull bones). Exposed brain tissue, which eventually degenerates. Polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing. First-trimester transvaginal ultrasound is the investigation of choice. Incorrect Options: (B) Inencephaly – Less likely to be diagnosed in the first trimester A rare neural tube defect involving severe retroflexion (backward bending) of the head and spinal deformities. Usually diagnosed in the second trimester rather than the first. (C) Microcephaly – Not reliably diagnosed in the first trimester Defined as small head circumference due to underdeveloped brain. Difficult to detect before 20–24 weeks, as fetal head growth is still in progress. (D) Holoprosencephaly – Detected later in pregnancy A severe brain malformation where the forebrain (prosencephalon) fails to divide into two hemispheres. Visible after 18 weeks on ultrasound but is not as easily identified in the first trimester.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nuchal Edema Nuchal translucency (NT) or nuchal edema refers to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the fetal neck region during the first trimester (11–14 weeks). It is the strongest ultrasound marker associated with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and other chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, Turner syndrome). A thickened nuchal translucency (>3 mm) significantly increases the risk of Down syndrome. It directly reflects abnormal fetal lymphatic development and cardiac dysfunction, which are common in Trisomy 21. It is used in first-trimester screening along with maternal serum markers (?-hCG and PAPP-A levels). It has a high detection rate (~70–80%) for Down syndrome when combined with maternal age and biochemical screening. Incorrect Options: (A) Echogenic Foci in Heart – Less specific These are bright spots seen in the fetal heart, often in the left ventricle. They are caused by microcalcifications in the papillary muscles and are not structural heart defects. While associated with Down syndrome, they are a soft marker and have a lower predictive value than nuchal translucency. (B) Hyperechogenic Bowel – Moderate association Increased brightness of the fetal bowel on ultrasound. Can be linked to Trisomy 21, cystic fibrosis, fetal infections (e.g., CMV), or bowel obstruction. Not as specific for Trisomy 21 as nuchal edema and can occur in other conditions. (C) Choroid Plexus Cysts – Weak association Fluid-filled cysts within the choroid plexus of the fetal brain. More commonly associated with Trisomy 18, not Trisomy 21. Often transient and resolve by the third trimester, with little significance in an isolated finding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ultrasonography Ultrasonography (USG) utilizes piezoelectric crystals to generate and receive sound waves. These crystals are embedded within the transducer probe and are responsible for both transmitting ultrasound waves into the body and detecting the echoes that return. How it works: When an electric current is applied to the piezoelectric crystals, they vibrate and produce ultrasound waves. These waves travel through tissues and reflect back when they encounter different densities (interfaces between tissues, bones, fluids, etc.). The returning sound waves are received by the same piezoelectric crystals, which convert them into electrical signals that are processed into an image. Piezoelectric effect: This is the fundamental principle in ultrasound, where crystals convert mechanical energy (sound waves) into electrical energy and vice versa. Clinical use: USG is widely used for obstetric imaging, cardiac assessments (echocardiography), abdominal scans, and musculoskeletal evaluations due to its non-invasive and radiation-free nature. Incorrect Options: (B) NMR Imaging (MRI) – Does Not Use Piezoelectric Crystals Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging, or MRI, relies on strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency (RF) waves to generate images. It does not use sound waves or piezoelectric crystals; instead, it works by aligning hydrogen protons in the body and detecting their signals after RF excitation. (C) X-ray Diffraction – Uses X-rays, Not Ultrasound X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a technique used for analyzing the atomic structure of crystals by directing X-rays at a sample. X-rays interact with the crystalline structure and produce diffraction patterns, which help determine material properties. Piezoelectric crystals are not involved in this process since XRD is based on electromagnetic radiation rather than mechanical sound waves. (D) Xeroradiography – Uses Electrostatic Imaging, Not Piezoelectric Crystals Xeroradiography is an older imaging technique used for mammography and soft-tissue imaging. It uses a charged selenium plate and an electrostatic process to create images, rather than sound waves or piezoelectric effects. No piezoelectric crystals are involved, as the technique relies on electrostatic charges and X-ray exposure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pneumothorax Stratosphere sign (also called barcode sign) on M-mode ultrasound is a key diagnostic feature of pneumothorax. Normally, lung ultrasound in M-mode shows the seashore sign, where the chest wall appears static (horizontal lines), but the lung tissue moves with respiration (granular pattern). In pneumothorax, air in the pleural space prevents lung motion, resulting in a stratosphere (barcode) sign, where both the chest wall and the underlying lung appear as parallel static lines. The patient’s low SpO2 and history of trauma (RTA) further support the diagnosis of pneumothorax, as it is a common consequence of chest trauma. Incorrect Options: (A) Hemothorax – Does Not Show Stratosphere Sign Hemothorax involves blood accumulation in the pleural space, which would show a fluid collection on ultrasound rather than a stratosphere sign. It is often diagnosed by FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) showing echogenic or hypoechoic fluid in the pleural space. (C) Cardiac Tamponade – Diagnosed by Pericardial Effusion on USG Cardiac tamponade is caused by fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, leading to heart compression. The primary ultrasound finding would be pericardial effusion and right atrial/right ventricular collapse during diastole, not a stratosphere sign. (D) Pulmonary Embolism – No Stratosphere Sign on USG Pulmonary embolism primarily affects pulmonary circulation and is diagnosed using CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA).
