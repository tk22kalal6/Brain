      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Most Radiosensitive Phase of the Cell Cycle The most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle is the M phase (mitosis). During mitosis, chromosomes are highly condensed and lack the ability to efficiently repair DNA damage. Radiation primarily causes DNA double-strand breaks, which are lethal if not repaired. Since the M phase is a period of rapid cellular activity with little opportunity for DNA repair, cells are most vulnerable to radiation-induced damage in this phase. Explanation of Incorrect Options: G1 Phase : The G1 phase is an intermediate level of radiosensitivity. Cells in this phase prepare for DNA replication and have mechanisms to repair damage before entering the S phase. However, they are less sensitive than M-phase cells. G2 Phase: The G2 phase is more sensitive than the S phase but still less sensitive than the M phase. This phase involves cell growth and preparation for mitosis, but cells have some capacity for DNA repair before division. S Phase : The S phase is the least radiosensitive phase. During DNA replication, cells actively repair radiation-induced damage using homologous recombination mechanisms, making them more resistant to radiation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It decays into daughter Radon, which is a constant hazard. Radium was historically used in radiotherapy for cancer treatment due to its radioactive properties. However, one of the major concerns with radium is that it decays into radon gas, a radioactive element that poses a significant health hazard. Radon is a highly penetrating alpha emitter, which can accumulate in enclosed spaces and increase the risk of lung cancer. Because of this, radium has been largely replaced by safer, more controlled radioactive sources such as cobalt-60 and cesium-137. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) It decays faster and needs frequent replacement (Incorrect) Radium-226 has a very long half-life of 1,600 years, meaning it does not decay quickly. Frequent replacement would not be a significant concern. (C) It has a very long half-life (Incorrect) While it is true that radium-226 has a long half-life, this alone is not the reason it is no longer used. The primary concern is the hazardous decay product (radon gas), not the longevity of radium itself. (D) It is a very unstable element (Incorrect) Radium is radioactive, but it is not considered \"very unstable\" compared to other isotopes used in radiotherapy. Its instability is not the primary reason for its discontinuation in medical treatments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance). NMR imaging, also known as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), does not use ionizing radiation. Instead, it relies on strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency (RF) waves to generate detailed images of internal body structures. The technique exploits the magnetic properties of hydrogen atoms in the body, making it safer than X-ray-based imaging methods. Since it does not expose patients to radiation, MRI/NMR is particularly useful for imaging soft tissues and is commonly used for brain, spinal cord, and joint assessments. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) CAT Scan Computed Axial Tomography (CAT or CT scan) uses X-ray radiation to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. Since it relies on ionizing radiation, it is not the correct answer. (C) Digital Subtraction Imaging Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is an imaging technique used in vascular studies. It involves the use of X-ray radiation with contrast agents to visualize blood vessels clearly, making radiation essential for this procedure. (D) Thyroid Scan A thyroid scan is a nuclear medicine test that uses radioactive isotopes (like iodine-123 or technetium-99m) to assess thyroid function and detect abnormalities such as nodules or cancer.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Denaturation of DNA. Radiation therapy works primarily by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, leading to cell death. Ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, electrons, protons) induces DNA strand breaks, especially double-strand breaks (DSBs). Denaturation of DNA prevents proper replication and transcription, leading to apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells. Tumor cells, due to their rapid division, are more sensitive to DNA damage than normal cells, making radiation therapy effective. Incorrect Options: B. Ionization of the Molecules While radiation causes ionization, its primary effect is through DNA damage rather than generalized molecular ionization. Ionization produces free radicals (like hydroxyl radicals), which then damage DNA, but ionization itself is not the direct cause of cell death. C. Protein Coagulation Radiation does not cause protein coagulation like heat or chemical denaturation. Proteins can be affected indirectly, but DNA is the main target. D. Osmolysis of Cells Osmolysis (bursting of cells due to osmotic pressure) is not a mechanism of radiation-induced cell death. Radiation mainly affects DNA integrity rather than cell membranes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Caesium. Caesium-137 (Cs-137) is the most commonly used radioactive isotope for intracavitary brachytherapy in carcinoma of the cervix. Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source inside or near the tumor, allowing for localized high-dose radiation delivery with minimal exposure to surrounding tissues. Cs-137 is preferred because of its favorable half-life (about 30 years), stable radiation emission, and effective dose distribution for treating cervical cancer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Cobalt-60 Cobalt-60 is not used for intracavitary brachytherapy but is commonly employed in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). It emits high-energy gamma rays and is used in teletherapy units for deep-seated tumors, including cervical cancer, but not for intracavitary placement. (C) Strontium Strontium-90 is used in superficial radiation treatments, mainly for ophthalmic tumors (e.g., pterygium, retinoblastoma) and skin cancers. It does not penetrate deeply enough for intracavitary treatment of cervical cancer. (D) Radio Iodine Radioactive iodine (I-131) is primarily used in thyroid cancer treatment and hyperthyroidism. It works by being selectively taken up by thyroid tissue, leading to targeted destruction. It has no role in intracavitary radiotherapy for cervical cancer.",

Cartilage is the least affected by radiation because it is composed of cells (chondrocytes) that are embedded in an abundant extracellular matrix and exhibit a very low rate of cell division. Additionally, cartilage is avascular, which limits both its metabolic activity and its exposure to circulating radiations that primarily affect rapidly dividing tissues. Incorrect Options: (A) GIT (Gastrointestinal Tract): The GIT is highly sensitive to radiation because its epithelial lining contains rapidly dividing cells. Damage to these cells can result in significant radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. (B) Gonads: Gonadal tissue, especially germ cells, is very radiosensitive due to its high proliferative capacity. Exposure to radiation can lead to impaired fertility and genetic damage. (D) Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes are among the most radiosensitive cells in the body because of their rapid turnover and active cell division.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Seminoma. Seminomas are highly radiosensitive tumors, meaning they respond exceptionally well to radiation therapy. This characteristic makes radiotherapy a primary treatment modality, especially for early-stage seminoma, where it is used to target localized disease effectively. Seminomas have a relatively uniform cell population, a low mutation rate, and a high mitotic index, all of which contribute to their excellent response to ionizing radiation. The prognosis of seminoma with radiotherapy is excellent, with high cure rates, particularly in Stage I and II disease. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Teratoma: Teratomas are radioresistant and do not respond well to radiotherapy. They are composed of differentiated tissues from multiple germ layers, making them less susceptible to radiation-induced damage. Instead, treatment involves surgical excision, and in some cases, chemotherapy for metastatic disease. C. Choriocarcinoma: Choriocarcinoma is highly resistant to radiotherapy but responds very well to chemotherapy, particularly platinum-based regimens (e.g., BEP – Bleomycin, Etoposide, Cisplatin). It is a highly aggressive tumor with early hematogenous spread, making systemic therapy more appropriate. D. Endometrial carcinoma: While radiotherapy is used in the adjuvant setting or for palliation, endometrial carcinoma is not the most radiosensitive tumor. Instead, its treatment often involves surgery (hysterectomy) followed by radiation or chemotherapy in advanced cases. It does not respond as dramatically to radiotherapy as seminoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hodgkin's disease. Mantle irradiation is a form of radiotherapy historically used to treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma (also called Hodgkin’s disease). It involves radiating the lymph nodes in the neck, chest, and underarms, forming a \"mantle\" shape on imaging. This technique was widely used before the advent of more modern, targeted treatments and remains an option in some cases. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is highly radiosensitive, making mantle irradiation an effective treatment, particularly in early-stage disease. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Leukaemia: Radiotherapy is not the primary treatment for leukemia because it is a systemic blood cancer rather than a localized tumor. Whole-body irradiation may be used in bone marrow transplantation protocols, but mantle irradiation is not a standard approach for leukemia. C. Chest secondaries from some cancers: While radiotherapy can be used for palliative treatment of metastatic tumors in the chest (e.g., lung metastases), mantle irradiation is not the preferred approach. Instead, targeted radiation or systemic therapies are typically used. D. Neuroblastoma: Neuroblastoma is primarily treated with chemotherapy, surgery, and targeted radiotherapy for localized tumors. Mantle irradiation is not used because neuroblastomas arise from adrenal or sympathetic nervous system tissue, not the lymphatic system.",

Phosphorus-32: Used mainly for systemic therapy, particularly in treating polycythemia vera and peritoneal or pleural malignancies (e.g., ovarian cancer metastases). It is not used for interstitial therapy. B. Iodine-131: Used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. It is primarily administered orally and functions as a systemic radiopharmaceutical, not for interstitial therapy. D.

Among all blood cells, lymphocytes are the most radiosensitive because they have a high mitotic rate, low DNA repair capacity, and are non-dividing cells in circulation. Even low doses of ionizing radiation can cause a significant reduction in lymphocyte count, which is why radiotherapy and radiation exposure can lead to immunosuppression. Incorrect Options: B. Neutrophil: Although neutrophils are affected by radiation, they are less sensitive than lymphocytes. Neutrophils have a short lifespan and are replaced rapidly, but they are not as vulnerable to radiation damage as lymphocytes. C. Basophil: Basophils are not highly radiosensitive since they have a long lifespan in circulation and do not proliferate rapidly. D.

Oxygen: One of the most potent natural radiosensitizers. The oxygen effect increases radiation damage by stabilizing free radicals produced by ionizing radiation, making DNA damage more lethal. Hypoxic (low-oxygen) tumor cells are more resistant to radiation, while well-oxygenated cells are more sensitive. B. SR 2508: A nitroimidazole compound that acts as a hypoxic cell radiosensitizer. It mimics the effect of oxygen and enhances radiation damage in hypoxic tumor cells, which are otherwise more resistant to radiotherapy. C. Metronidazole: A nitroimidazole drug that can also act as a radiosensitizer under hypoxic conditions. It enhances the effects of radiation on low-oxygen tumor cells, making treatment more effective.

It helps protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage by reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing cellular components. B. Thiophosphate YVR 2721 (Amifostine): Correct. Amifostine (WR-2721) is a well-known radioprotector that preferentially protects normal tissues from radiation damage while allowing radiation to target cancer cells. It works by scavenging free radicals and increasing DNA repair in healthy cells. C. Metronidazole: Incorrect. Metronidazole is a radiosensitizer, not a radioprotector.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) X-rays. X-rays are the most commonly used type of radiation in radiotherapy due to their ability to penetrate deep into tissues and target tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Modern radiotherapy techniques, such as Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), use high-energy X-rays generated by linear accelerators (LINACs) to deliver precise doses of radiation to cancer cells. Incorrect Options: A. Alpha rays: Incorrect. Alpha particles are highly ionizing but have very low penetration power (they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or even human skin). They are not used in external beam radiotherapy but may be used in targeted radionuclide therapy (e.g., Radium-223 for bone metastases). B. Beta rays: Incorrect. Beta particles are electron emissions with moderate penetration. They are sometimes used in brachytherapy or radionuclide therapy (e.g., Strontium-89 and Yttrium-90 for treating bone cancers or liver tumors), but they are not the primary type used in conventional radiotherapy. C. Gamma rays: Incorrect. Gamma rays, emitted from radioactive sources such as Cobalt-60, were historically used in radiotherapy (e.g., in Cobalt therapy).

In Stage I and II seminoma, radiotherapy is used as an adjuvant treatment after orchiectomy to prevent recurrence, with excellent cure rates. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Malignant melanoma: Incorrect. Melanoma is highly radioresistant, meaning it does not respond well to conventional radiotherapy. Instead, treatment primarily involves surgery and immunotherapy (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab or pembrolizumab). C. Osteosarcoma: Incorrect. Osteosarcoma is also radioresistant, meaning radiotherapy has a limited role in its management. Instead, treatment mainly consists of surgery (limb-sparing or amputation) and chemotherapy (e.g., methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin). D. Chondrosarcoma: Incorrect.

These nodes are critical because cervical cancer frequently spreads to them. Incorrect Options: B. Mackenrodt’s ligament: Incorrect. Mackenrodt’s ligament (also called the cardinal ligament) is a connective tissue structure that supports the uterus. While it is important in cervical cancer spread, it is not the anatomical landmark used to define Point B. C. Ischial tuberosity: Incorrect. The ischial tuberosity is a bony prominence in the pelvis that serves as an attachment site for muscles. It is not related to the lymphatic drainage of the cervix and is not considered in radiotherapy dosing. D. Round ligament: Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Californium-252. Californium-252 (Cf-252) is the latest and most widely used neutron source for radiotherapy. It is a spontaneous fission neutron emitter, producing high-energy neutrons that can be used in neutron brachytherapy and neutron capture therapy. Neutron radiation is particularly effective for radioresistant tumors, such as salivary gland tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and certain brain tumors. Incorrect Options: A. Strontium-90: Incorrect. Strontium-90 (Sr-90) is a beta-emitting isotope primarily used for palliative treatment of bone metastases and in superficial ophthalmic applications (e.g., pterygium treatment). It does not emit neutrons and is not used for neutron radiotherapy. B. Iodine-131: Incorrect. Iodine-131 (I-131) is a beta and gamma emitter used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. It is not a neutron source and is not applicable for neutron radiotherapy. D. Radium-226: Incorrect. Radium-226 (Ra-226) is a gamma and alpha emitter that was historically used in brachytherapy but has largely been replaced by safer alternatives like Iridium-192 and Cesium-137. It does not produce neutrons and is not used in neutron therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Radiation. In a modern rotating anode X-ray tube, the primary method of cooling the anode is radiation. The anode becomes extremely hot due to the intense energy of electron bombardment, and it cools primarily by radiating heat as infrared (thermal) radiation. The anode is usually made of tungsten due to its high melting point, and the rotation spreads the heat over a larger surface area, reducing localized overheating. Incorrect Options: A. Conduction: Incorrect. Some heat is transferred through conduction from the anode to the anode stem and rotor, but this is not the primary cooling mechanism since the stem is made of molybdenum or graphite, materials that limit heat conduction. B. Convection: Incorrect. While convection cooling occurs in the oil surrounding the X-ray tube housing, it plays only a minor role in anode cooling. The primary heat dissipation from the anode itself occurs through radiation. D. All of the above: Incorrect. While conduction and convection contribute minimally, radiation is the dominant cooling mechanism in a modern rotating anode X-ray tube.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Reducing scattered radiation. A grid is a device placed between the patient and the X-ray film/detector to reduce scattered radiation. When X-rays interact with the patient's body, some photons are scattered in different directions, leading to fogging and reduced image contrast. The grid absorbs these scattered rays before they reach the detector, thereby improving image quality by enhancing contrast. Incorrect Options: B. Reducing patient’s exposure time: Incorrect. The grid does not reduce exposure time. In fact, using a grid requires an increase in X-ray exposure (higher mAs) to compensate for the X-rays absorbed by the grid, which could increase the patient’s dose. C. Reducing the contrast of the X-ray: Incorrect. The grid actually increases contrast by removing scattered radiation. Scattered radiation reduces image contrast, so by eliminating it, the grid enhances contrast rather than reducing it. D. All of the above: Incorrect. Since B and C are incorrect",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma is generally radioresistant, meaning it does not respond well to conventional radiotherapy. This is due to its high capacity for DNA repair, aggressive nature, and low mitotic rate in some cases. The primary treatment for melanoma is surgical excision, and advanced cases are managed with immunotherapy (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and targeted therapy (e.g., BRAF/MEK inhibitors for BRAF-mutant melanoma). Radiotherapy is sometimes used palliatively for metastatic disease but is not the mainstay of treatment. Incorrect Options: A. Cutaneous lymphoma: Incorrect. Cutaneous T-cell and B-cell lymphomas (e.g., mycosis fungoides) are highly radiosensitive. Low-dose radiotherapy is often used for localized lesions. B. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC): Incorrect. BCC is highly radiosensitive, and radiotherapy can be used as an alternative treatment in patients who are not surgical candidates or for large, recurrent, or difficult-to-treat lesions. D. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): Incorrect. SCC is also radiosensitive, though to a lesser extent than BCC.

Radioactive phosphorus (Phosphorus-32, P-32) is a beta-emitting radioisotope used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and proliferative disorders due to its ability to selectively target rapidly dividing cells. A. Polycythemia (Polycythemia Vera) P-32 is an effective treatment for polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by excessive red blood cell production. Administered intravenously, P-32 selectively targets bone marrow, reducing excessive erythropoiesis and providing long-term disease control. It is especially used in elderly patients or those who cannot tolerate other treatments like hydroxyurea or phlebotomy. C. Multiple myeloma P-32 has been used in the palliation of multiple myeloma, particularly for bone pain relief in cases with extensive skeletal involvement. While modern treatments (e.g., proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and bisphosphonates) have largely replaced P-32, it has historically been used in select cases. Incorrect Options: B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Acute Radiation Sickness (ARS) occurs when the body is exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation over a short period. The severity depends on the radiation dose and the tissues affected. ARS primarily affects rapidly dividing cells, leading to hematological, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system symptoms. Explanation of Each Option: A. Hematological Symptoms Radiation damages bone marrow, leading to pancytopenia (low RBCs, WBCs, and platelets). Symptoms include infection (due to low WBCs), bleeding (low platelets), and anemia (low RBCs). This occurs at doses of 1–2 Gy (Gray units) and is known as the hematopoietic syndrome. B. CNS Symptoms At very high doses (>30 Gy), radiation causes direct damage to neurons and cerebral edema. Symptoms include seizures, loss of consciousness, ataxia, and cardiovascular collapse. This is known as the neurovascular syndrome, which is rapidly fatal. C. Gastrointestinal Symptoms Radiation destroys the intestinal lining, leading to severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. This occurs at doses of 6–10 Gy and is part of the gastrointestinal syndrome. Death can occur due to sepsis, dehydration, and malabsorption.",

The vagina is the most radioresistant among the options listed because it has a relatively low mitotic rate and a strong ability to repair radiation-induced damage. Additionally, squamous epithelium, which lines the vagina, is more resistant compared to glandular tissues. Incorrect Options: A. Rectum The rectum is moderately radiosensitive because it has a high turnover rate of epithelial cells. Radiation exposure can lead to radiation proctitis, ulceration, and fibrosis. B. Colon Like the rectum, the colon has a rapidly regenerating mucosa, making it moderately radiosensitive. Radiation to the colon can cause colitis, ulceration, and perforation in severe cases. C. Cervix The cervix is relatively resistant to radiation but less so than the vagina. This is why radiotherapy is commonly used for cervical cancer.

It is an essential component of the treatment for carcinoma of the cervix, especially in stages IB2 to IVA. This method delivers high-dose radiation directly to the tumor while sparing surrounding healthy tissues. Incorrect Options: B. Carcinoma of the lung Lung cancer is typically treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) rather than intracavitary brachytherapy.

Ovarian cancer, particularly dysgerminomas and some epithelial subtypes, are among the most radiosensitive tumors. These cancers respond well to radiotherapy when used as part of adjuvant or palliative treatment. However, chemotherapy (e.g., platinum-based drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin) remains the primary treatment for ovarian cancer. Incorrect Options: A. Carcinoma of the cervix → Moderately radiosensitive Cervical cancer is sensitive to radiation, which is why radiotherapy (external beam + brachytherapy) is a primary treatment for locally advanced disease. However, it is less radiosensitive than ovarian cancer, particularly dysgerminoma. B. Carcinoma of the kidney → Radioresistant Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is highly resistant to radiation. Surgery (radical nephrectomy) is the treatment of choice, and radiotherapy is used only for palliation in metastatic cases. D. Carcinoma of the pancreas → Highly radioresistant Pancreatic cancer is one of the most radioresistant tumors due to its dense stromal tissue and hypoxic environment.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) DNA damage. The fundamental principle of radiotherapy is to induce DNA damage in cancer cells, leading to cell death. Ionizing radiation (such as X-rays, gamma rays, or charged particles) creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which cancer cells struggle to repair. This ultimately prevents tumor growth and leads to apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe. Radiotherapy is designed to maximize damage to rapidly dividing tumor cells while minimizing harm to surrounding normal tissues. Modern techniques like intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) help achieve precise targeting. Incorrect Options: A. Cytoplasmic coagulation Radiation primarily affects the nucleus (DNA) rather than directly causing cytoplasmic coagulation. While high-dose radiation can cause protein denaturation and cellular necrosis, this is not the main therapeutic mechanism. B. Ionizing the molecules → Partially correct but not the main principle Radiation does ionize molecules, generating free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl radicals from water molecules). However, the critical damage occurs at the DNA level, making DNA damage the primary mechanism. D. Low dose causes tissue necrosis Low-dose radiation does not cause necrosis but may induce sublethal DNA damage, leading to repair or cellular senescence. High-dose radiation, on the other hand, can cause tissue necrosis but is not the main principle of radiotherapy.",

Radiation carditis (radiation-induced heart disease) is a complication of chest radiotherapy, commonly seen in patients treated for breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and mediastinal tumors. The pericardium is the most frequently affected cardiac structure, making pericardial effusion the most common presentation. Over time, it may progress to constrictive pericarditis due to fibrosis and thickening of the pericardium. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Atheromatous plaques Radiation accelerates coronary artery disease (CAD) by causing endothelial damage, leading to fibrosis, intimal thickening, and premature atherosclerosis. However, pericardial effusion is a more common initial manifestation than atherosclerotic plaques. C. Myocardial fibrosis Radiation can cause myocardial fibrosis, leading to cardiomyopathy, conduction defects, and heart failure. However, myocardial fibrosis typically occurs later after significant radiation exposure, whereas pericardial effusion is an earlier and more common presentation. D. Pyogenic pericarditis Pyogenic (infectious) pericarditis is not a typical consequence of radiation exposure.

Radiation erythema usually appears within days to weeks after exposure and progresses depending on the radiation dose and skin sensitivity. Incorrect Options:. B. Atopy → Incorrect Atopy refers to allergic hypersensitivity, which is not a direct effect of radiation. Radiation does not trigger an allergic reaction but causes direct damage to skin cells. C. Hyperpigmentation Hyperpigmentation can occur as a late effect of radiation, especially in people with darker skin tones. However, erythema is the earliest and most common reaction, while hyperpigmentation is a delayed response seen weeks to months after treatment. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) G2M phase. Cells are most sensitive to radiotherapy during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. This is because: M Phase (Mitosis) → Highest sensitivity During mitosis, the cell lacks the ability to efficiently repair DNA damage. Chromosomes are condensed, making double-strand DNA breaks more lethal. G2 Phase (Pre-mitosis checkpoint) Cells in G2 phase are also sensitive to radiation since DNA damage checkpoints are active, making it harder for the cell to survive if DNA damage is severe. If damage is extensive, the cell undergoes apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe. Incorrect Options: A. S phase (Synthesis phase) The S phase is the most radioresistant phase because cells actively replicate DNA, and repair mechanisms are highly active. Cells in the early S phase are particularly resistant due to the presence of high levels of homologous recombination repair. B. G1 phase (Gap 1 phase) Cells in G1 phase are less sensitive than in G2 or M phase. However, late G1 phase cells with damaged DNA can be stopped at the G1/S checkpoint for repair, making them somewhat vulnerable to radiation. C. G2 phase → Partially correct but not the most sensitive While G2 phase cells are highly radiosensitive, the M phase (mitosis) is even more sensitive.

The ideal isotopes for this procedure should have suitable half-lives, appropriate gamma-ray energy, and controlled radiation penetration to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Cobalt-60 is not used for interstitial brachytherapy because it emits high-energy gamma rays (1.17 and 1.33 MeV) that penetrate too deeply, making it more suitable for external beam radiotherapy (teletherapy) rather than localized radiation delivery. Incorrect Options: B. Ir-192 (Iridium-192) → Correct for interstitial brachytherapy Most commonly used isotope for high-dose-rate (HDR) and low-dose-rate (LDR) interstitial brachytherapy, especially in prostate and breast cancer treatments.

Primary bone tumor → Shows increased radioisotope uptake Malignant bone tumors like osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma exhibit high metabolic activity and bone remodeling, leading to increased uptake in nuclear bone scans. B. Osteomyelitis → Shows increased radioisotope uptake Infectious bone inflammation causes hyperemia (increased blood flow) and active bone remodeling, leading to high tracer uptake in bone scans. This helps differentiate osteomyelitis from other bone pathologies. C. Paget’s disease → Shows increased radioisotope uptake Paget’s disease of bone involves excessive bone resorption and abnormal new bone formation, leading to markedly increased isotope uptake in affected areas. This is due to the high bone turnover characteristic of the disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma is the most radiosensitive tumor among the options. It is a highly malignant, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the cerebellum, commonly seen in children. Due to its high mitotic activity and rapid cell division, it responds well to radiotherapy, which is a key component of treatment after surgical resection. Whole craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is often used because medulloblastoma has a high tendency for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spread. Incorrect Options: A. Astrocytoma → Less radiosensitive Low-grade astrocytomas (e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma) are radiation-resistant and primarily treated with surgical excision. High-grade astrocytomas (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) are treated with radiotherapy, but they are less responsive compared to medulloblastomas. C. Craniopharyngioma → Less radiosensitive This is a benign tumor arising from remnants of Rathke’s pouch. It is relatively resistant to radiotherapy, and surgery is the preferred treatment. However, radiotherapy may be used in cases of residual or recurrent tumors. D. Teratoma → Least radiosensitive Teratomas are composed of differentiated tissues and are generally not sensitive to radiation. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment.

Due to its radiosensitivity, radiotherapy was historically used for treatment, but now chemotherapy (with BEP regimen: Bleomycin, Etoposide, Cisplatin) is preferred due to concerns about fertility preservation. However, in cases where chemotherapy is not an option, radiotherapy remains effective. Incorrect Options: A. Endodermal sinus tumor (Yolk sac tumor) → Less radiosensitive This is an aggressive germ cell tumor but is not highly sensitive to radiation. The preferred treatment is chemotherapy (BEP regimen) rather than radiotherapy. B. Dermoid cyst (Mature teratoma) → Not radiosensitive A benign ovarian germ cell tumor containing differentiated tissues (hair, teeth, skin, etc.).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 (Co-60) is the most commonly used radioisotope for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). It emits high-energy gamma rays (1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV), which penetrate deep into tissues, making it effective for treating various cancers, including head and neck cancers, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer. Cobalt-60 machines (Teletherapy units) were widely used before the development of modern linear accelerators (LINACs). Incorrect Options: A. Strontium-89 → Used for palliative treatment, not EBRT Strontium-89 is a beta-emitting isotope used for pain relief in bone metastases, particularly from prostate and breast cancer. It is not used for external beam radiotherapy but rather for targeted internal radiation therapy. B. Radium-226 → Historically used, but replaced by safer alternatives Radium-226 was an early radiation source used in brachytherapy but was discontinued due to concerns about radioactive contamination and long half-life (1600 years). It is no longer used in modern external radiotherapy. C. Cobalt-59 → Not a radioactive isotope Cobalt-59 is the stable, non-radioactive form of cobalt.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 8 Gy in one fraction. A single fraction of 8 Gy is a well-established, effective, and convenient dose for palliative radiotherapy in bone metastases to provide pain relief. Studies have shown that a single dose of 8 Gy provides pain relief comparable to multiple-fraction regimens, with the advantage of requiring fewer hospital visits and greater patient convenience. This approach is especially beneficial for patients with limited life expectancy or poor performance status. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. 20 Gy in 5 fractions → Effective but requires more sessions This fractionation schedule (4 Gy × 5 fractions) is also commonly used for bone metastases. It provides similar pain relief to the 8 Gy single dose but requires more hospital visits. It is preferred for patients with better prognosis who may benefit from a more prolonged pain control. C. 30 Gy in 10 fractions → Used for long-term control This regimen (3 Gy × 10 fractions) is used in patients with a longer expected survival and those with spinal cord compression or pathological fractures. However, for pure pain relief, shorter regimens like 8 Gy single fraction or 20 Gy in 5 fractions are preferred. D. Above 70 Gy → Not used for palliative bone metastases Such high doses are typically used in curative radiotherapy (e.g., head and neck, prostate, or cervical cancers).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Adrenaline. The patient is experiencing severe anaphylactic shock following contrast media injection, characterized by severe hypotension, bronchospasm, and cyanosis. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is the first-line treatment because it acts as: A potent vasoconstrictor (α1 receptor agonist), which helps restore blood pressure. A bronchodilator (β2 receptor agonist), which relieves bronchospasm. A positive inotrope and chronotrope (β1 receptor agonist), which improves cardiac output. The recommended dose in anaphylaxis is intramuscular (IM) Adrenaline 0.3–0.5 mg (1:1000 dilution), repeated every 5–15 minutes if needed. In severe cases, IV Adrenaline may be required under careful monitoring. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Atropine → Used for bradycardia, not anaphylaxis Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist used for bradycardia and organophosphate poisoning. It does not reverse hypotension, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis. B. Aminophylline → Used for asthma, not first-line for anaphylaxis Aminophylline is a bronchodilator (xanthine derivative) used in asthma and COPD. It is not effective in reversing anaphylactic shock and does not treat hypotension. C.

P-32 has a half-life of 14.3 days and decays by emitting high-energy beta particles (1.71 MeV). These beta emissions effectively penetrate tissues, making P-32 useful for targeted radiation therapy. Uses of Phosphorus-32: Treatment of hematologic disorders such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Palliative treatment of bone metastases (though less commonly used today compared to Sr-89 or Sm-153). Radioactive labeling in biological research for studying DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Incorrect Options: B. Alpha particles Alpha particles (helium nuclei) are emitted by isotopes like Radium-226, Polonium-210, and Uranium-238. P-32 does not emit alpha radiation. C. Neutrons Neutron emission occurs in nuclear fission reactions, not in P-32 decay. Isotopes like Californium-252 are neutron emitters. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a highly radioresistant tumor, meaning it does not respond well to radiation therapy. This resistance is due to its high cellular density, poor oxygenation (hypoxia), and efficient DNA repair mechanisms. Instead, the primary treatment for osteosarcoma involves surgical resection with limb-salvage surgery and chemotherapy rather than radiotherapy. Bone tumors generally have poor oxygenation, making them less susceptible to radiation, which works best on well-oxygenated cells. Osteosarcoma cells have efficient DNA repair mechanisms, allowing them to recover from radiation-induced damage. Surgical resection and chemotherapy are the mainstays of treatment, with radiation only being considered for palliative cases or inoperable tumors. Incorrect Options: A. Ewing’s Sarcoma → Radiosensitive Ewing’s sarcoma is highly radiosensitive and responds well to radiotherapy. It is often treated with a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. B. Retinoblastoma → Radiosensitive Retinoblastoma, a pediatric ocular tumor, is radiosensitive, especially in early stages. Radiation is used when eye preservation is desired or when tumors are not completely resectable. D.

Cs-137 is not used as a permanent implant because it has a relatively long half-life (about 30 years) and is primarily used in temporary implants for high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. It is commonly used in intracavitary and interstitial radiation therapy for treating cancers such as cervical and endometrial cancers. Long Half-Life (30 years) → Not ideal for permanent implants, as residual radiation could persist for a long time.

Higher Energy Emission → More suited for controlled external or temporary internal use. Incorrect Options: A. Iodine-125 (I-125) → Used for Permanent Implants Half-life: 59.4 days, making it suitable for permanent implants. Uses: Commonly used in prostate brachytherapy and brain tumors. Low-energy gamma emitter → Reduces radiation exposure to surrounding tissues. B. Palladium-103 (Pd-103) → Used for Permanent Implants Half-life: 17 days, shorter than I-125, leading to a faster dose delivery.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Gating. Respiratory gating is a specialized technique in radiotherapy used to counteract the effects of tumor motion due to breathing. This is particularly useful for treating lung, liver, and upper abdominal tumors, where movement can cause radiation to miss the target or damage healthy tissues. Gating synchronizes radiation delivery with a specific phase of the breathing cycle (usually during exhalation, when motion is minimal). This ensures that radiation is delivered only when the tumor is within the planned treatment field, improving accuracy and reducing damage to surrounding tissues. It is commonly used in Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Incorrect Options: A. Arc Technique → Used for rotational therapy, not motion control Arc therapy (e.g., VMAT - Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy) involves delivering radiation while the machine rotates around the patient. It improves dose conformity but does not specifically address tumor motion due to breathing. B. Modulation → Refers to intensity control, not motion management Intensity Modulation (IMRT) adjusts the radiation beam intensity for precise targeting. While it enhances treatment precision, it does not actively counteract tumor motion. D.

Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) is a highly precise form of radiation therapy that allows modulation of radiation intensity across the treatment field. It is particularly well-suited for prostate cancer due to the following reasons: Better Dose Conformity: IMRT allows high doses of radiation to be delivered to the prostate while sparing nearby critical structures such as the bladder, rectum, and seminal vesicles. This helps in reducing side effects, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities. Deep-Seated Tumor Treatment: The prostate is located deep in the pelvis, making it difficult to target with conventional radiation techniques. IMRT’s ability to shape the radiation beams precisely makes it ideal for treating prostate cancer. Dose Escalation for Better Outcomes: Studies have shown that higher radiation doses improve prostate cancer control. IMRT allows safe dose escalation without increasing toxicity to surrounding tissues. Reduction of Late Radiation Toxicity: Since the rectum and bladder are dose-limiting structures, IMRT helps reduce long-term complications, such as radiation proctitis and urinary incontinence. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Lung Cancer → Not the most suitable IMRT is used in lung cancer, but tumor motion due to breathing (respiratory motion) can limit its effectiveness. Techniques like stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or 3D conformal radiotherapy are often preferred. C. Leukemias → Not treated with IMRT Leukemias are systemic malignancies, meaning they affect the blood and bone marrow rather than a localized tumor. Treatment mainly involves chemotherapy rather than localized radiotherapy. Total Body Irradiation (TBI) is used in some cases (e.g., before bone marrow transplantation), but IMRT is not the standard choice. D. Stomach Cancer → Not a primary indication Stomach cancer (gastric cancer) is usually treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy can be used postoperatively (adjuvant therapy), but IMRT is not the first-line choice. 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) is often preferred for stomach cancer.",

      "solution": "The correct answer is B. Beta rays. Radioiodine therapy (Iodine-131, 131?) is the mainstay of treatment for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, especially after thyroidectomy. The primary mechanism by which radioiodine destroys neoplastic cells is through beta radiation. High Linear Energy Transfer (LET): Beta particles are high-energy electrons that travel short distances in tissue (~0.5-2 mm). This ensures localized destruction of cancer cells while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Direct Cytotoxic Effect on Thyroid Cells: Thyroid cells actively uptake iodine, including radioactive iodine (131?), due to the presence of the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The beta emissions cause DNA damage, leading to cell death (apoptosis). Minimal Systemic Effects: Since beta radiation has limited tissue penetration, its effects are mostly restricted to thyroid cancer cells, reducing systemic toxicity. Incorrect Options: A. X-rays → Not the primary mechanism X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with deep tissue penetration. While they are used in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), they are not involved in radioiodine therapy. C. Gamma rays → Used for Imaging, Not for Cell Destruction 131? I also emits gamma radiation, but this is mainly used for diagnostic imaging (scintigraphy) rather than cancer cell destruction. Gamma rays have high penetration and are less effective in localized cell killing compared to beta rays. D. Alpha particles → Not used in Thyroid Therapy Alpha particles are highly ionizing but have extremely short tissue penetration (~50-80 μm). They are used in certain cancer treatments (e.g., Radium-223 for bone metastases) but not in thyroid cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) More than targeted radiation volume. Ensuring Adequate Coverage: Tumor cells may extend beyond the visible tumor mass due to microscopic spread. To ensure complete eradication, a margin is added around the tumor to cover potential areas of subclinical disease. Accounting for Movement and Uncertainty: Organ motion (due to breathing, digestion, etc.) and patient positioning errors can lead to variations in tumor location. To compensate for this, the planned radiation volume includes a safety margin around the tumor. Standard Radiation Planning Protocols: The Planned Target Volume (PTV) consists of: Gross Tumor Volume (GTV): The visible, palpable, or image-detected tumor. Clinical Target Volume (CTV): Includes areas of possible microscopic disease. Planning Target Volume (PTV): Accounts for motion and setup errors, making it larger than the actual targeted tumor volume. Incorrect Options: A. Depends on 90% of tumor size The planned volume is not limited to 90% of the tumor size. It includes additional margins to account for microscopic spread and setup variations. B. Less than targeted radiation volume If the planned volume were smaller than the target, there would be a risk of missing parts of the tumor, leading to ineffective treatment. D.

Precise Tumor Shaping: Conformal radiotherapy aims to deliver radiation precisely to the tumor while sparing surrounding normal tissues. A Multileaf Collimator (MLC) consists of multiple independent metal leaves that can be adjusted to match the exact shape of the tumor. Customizable Beam Shaping: MLCs allow for dynamic shaping of radiation beams, conforming to complex tumor geometries. This helps in reducing radiation exposure to nearby organs, thereby minimizing side effects.

High Risk of Radiation Hazard: Radium-226 is a highly radioactive element with a long half-life (~1,600 years). It emits alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, making it difficult to handle safely. There is a risk of contamination and accidental exposure if the material leaks or breaks. Safer Alternatives Available: Modern radiation sources like Cobalt-60, Cesium-137, and Iridium-192 provide better control over radiation delivery with lower risks of accidental exposure. These alternatives are used in external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Historical Use and Discontinuation: Radium-226 was once widely used in brachytherapy, especially for cervical and prostate cancer treatment. Due to its high toxicity, long half-life, and disposal difficulties, it has been phased out in favor of safer isotopes. Incorrect Options: B.

PET scans use FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) to assess metabolic activity—necrotic tissue has low FDG uptake, while recurrent tumors show high uptake. This helps in accurate diagnosis and prevents unnecessary interventions. High Sensitivity and Specificity: PET is highly effective in detecting metabolic changes associated with necrotic tissue versus active tumor cells. Useful in Post-Radiotherapy Evaluation: After radiotherapy, distinguishing post-treatment effects from residual or recurrent malignancy is critical. PET plays a key role in this assessment. Incorrect Options: B. MRI → Partially Correct, but Less Specific MRI with contrast can show necrosis as an area of hypointensity, but it cannot reliably differentiate between necrosis and tumor recurrence. Advanced MRI techniques (e.g., perfusion MRI, MR spectroscopy) can help, but PET remains superior. C. Biopsy → Invasive and Not Always Necessary A biopsy can confirm necrosis but is invasive and carries risks (e.g., infection, bleeding). PET is non-invasive and provides a functional metabolic assessment, making it a preferred first-line approach. D. CT → Less Sensitive CT may show areas of low density due to necrosis, but it lacks metabolic information to differentiate it from a tumor.

The radiation dose is prescribed at Point A because it corresponds to the paracervical tissues where the uterine artery and ureter lie, which are critical structures affected by cervical cancer. Early-Stage Cervical Cancer (Stage I-IIA): These stages are localized and highly responsive to radiation. The goal is tumor eradication while sparing surrounding tissues. Recommended total dose: 80-85 Gy (External Beam Radiotherapy + Brachytherapy).

Tc-99m labeled WBC scintigraphy helps in detecting active disease, abscesses, and complications in Crohn’s disease, especially terminal ileitis. Incorrect Options: A. Ca colon Tc-99m labeled WBCs are not primarily used for detecting colon cancer. FDG-PET or CT scans are preferred for colon cancer staging. B. Intra-abdominal mass While Tc-99m labeled WBCs can detect infections/abscesses, they are not the primary imaging method for characterizing a mass. CT or MRI is preferred for evaluating intra-abdominal masses. D. Stricture Tc-99m WBC scintigraphy does not detect strictures effectively. MR enterography or contrast studies are better for stricture evaluation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Non-ionic dimers. Water-soluble radiological contrast agents contain iodine, which provides radiopacity. The iodine:particle ratio is determined by the number of iodine atoms per molecule and the osmolarity of the contrast agent. Non-ionic dimers have the highest iodine:particle ratio because: They contain two benzene rings with multiple iodine atoms per molecule. They are low-osmolar (causing less fluid shift and reduced adverse effects). Examples include Iodixanol and Iotrolan. Incorrect Options: A. Ionic Monomers These have a low iodine:particle ratio because each molecule contains only one benzene ring with iodine atoms. They are high-osmolar, causing more side effects like nephrotoxicity. Example: Diatrizoate (Hypaque), Iothalamate. B. Non-Ionic Monomers These have a higher iodine:particle ratio than ionic monomers, but still lower than non-ionic dimers. They are low-osmolar and better tolerated than ionic monomers. Example: Iohexol, Iopamidol, Ioversol. C. Ionic Dimers These have two benzene rings with iodine atoms, but because they are ionic, they have a lower iodine:particle ratio compared to non-ionic dimers. They are rarely used due to their higher osmolarity and side effects.",
