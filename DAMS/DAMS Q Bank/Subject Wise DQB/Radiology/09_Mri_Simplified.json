      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is not an ionizing radiation-based imaging modality. Instead of using X-rays, MRI relies on strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency waves to generate detailed images of internal structures. This makes it a safer option, particularly for repeated imaging or for populations vulnerable to radiation, such as pregnant women and children. MRI is especially useful for soft tissue evaluation, such as the brain, muscles, joints, and organs. Unlike ionizing radiation, MRI does not carry the risk of DNA damage or radiation-induced malignancies. Incorrect Options: B. X-Ray: X-rays use ionizing radiation to create images of bones and soft tissues. While the radiation dose is relatively low, prolonged or excessive exposure increases the risk of tissue damage and cancer. C. CT: Computed Tomography (CT) also relies on ionizing radiation, delivering higher doses than standard X-rays. It provides detailed cross-sectional images but carries an increased risk of radiation exposure, particularly with frequent scans. D. All are ionizing: This statement is incorrect because MRI does not use ionizing radiation, making it different from X-rays and CT scans.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice for a pregnant woman with an upper abdominal mass because it provides detailed soft tissue imaging without using ionizing radiation. This makes it safe for both the mother and fetus. MRI is particularly useful in evaluating abdominal organs, distinguishing between benign and malignant masses, and detecting conditions like liver tumors, pancreatic lesions, and retroperitoneal masses. Unlike CT and barium studies, MRI does not expose the developing fetus to radiation, making it the preferred imaging modality during pregnancy. Incorrect Options: A. Barium meal: A barium meal study involves fluoroscopy and ionizing radiation, which is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal exposure. Additionally, it is not the best modality for evaluating an upper abdominal mass, as it mainly assesses the gastrointestinal tract. C. CT scan: CT scanning uses ionizing radiation, which poses a risk to fetal development, particularly in early pregnancy. While CT can provide excellent cross-sectional imaging, it is avoided in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. MRI is preferred for similar diagnostic accuracy without radiation exposure. D. DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography): DSA is an invasive imaging technique primarily used for vascular studies and requires ionizing radiation. It is not the preferred choice for evaluating an abdominal mass in a pregnant woman, as MRI can provide similar vascular information with MR angiography (MRA) without radiation exposure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the first investigation of choice for a spinal cord tumor. MRI provides high-resolution, multiplanar imaging of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and surrounding soft tissues without the use of ionizing radiation. It is particularly valuable for distinguishing between intramedullary (within the spinal cord), extramedullary (outside the cord but within the dura), and extradural (outside the dura) tumors. MRI with contrast (gadolinium) enhances tumor visualization and helps in assessing its extent, involvement of adjacent structures, and potential spinal cord compression. This makes MRI the gold standard for diagnosing spinal cord tumors. Incorrect Options: A. Myelography: Myelography is an invasive procedure involving the injection of contrast into the spinal canal followed by X-ray or CT imaging. While it was historically used for spinal cord evaluation, it has been largely replaced by MRI due to its non-invasive nature and superior soft tissue contrast. Myelography is now reserved for cases where MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive. B. CT Scan: While CT provides good bone detail, it is not the best initial imaging for spinal cord tumors because it has limited soft tissue contrast compared to MRI. CT may be useful for detecting associated bone changes or when MRI is unavailable, but it does not provide the same level of detail for tumor characterization. D. Plain X-ray: X-rays are not useful for directly detecting spinal cord tumors since they only visualize bones. They may show indirect signs such as spinal canal widening, vertebral body erosion, or bone remodeling, but they do not provide detailed imaging of the spinal cord or tumor. MRI is far superior for direct tumor evaluation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice for traumatic paraplegia because it provides detailed visualization of the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, ligaments, and soft tissue structures. MRI is particularly useful in detecting spinal cord injuries, hemorrhage, edema, nerve compression, and ligamentous injuries, which are often missed on other imaging modalities. It helps in assessing the severity of spinal cord damage, guiding treatment decisions, and predicting neurological recovery. Since MRI does not use ionizing radiation, it is a safer option for repeated imaging in cases requiring follow-up. Incorrect Options: B. CT scan: CT is excellent for evaluating bony injuries such as fractures or dislocations of the vertebrae, but it does not provide detailed images of the spinal cord and soft tissues. While CT is often used in emergency settings to assess spinal fractures quickly, it does not replace MRI in evaluating spinal cord injury and soft tissue damage. C. X-ray: X-rays are useful for detecting spinal fractures and alignment abnormalities, but they cannot evaluate spinal cord damage, soft tissue injuries, or ligamentous disruptions, which are crucial in traumatic paraplegia. Thus, X-rays are not sufficient as the primary imaging modality for assessing spinal cord injuries. D. USC (Ultrasound Scan): Ultrasound has no role in diagnosing spinal cord injuries because it cannot penetrate bone to visualize the spinal canal or spinal cord. It may be useful for assessing soft tissue injuries in the surrounding area but is not appropriate for evaluating traumatic paraplegia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice for multiple sclerosis (MS) because it provides high-resolution imaging of the brain and spinal cord, allowing for the detection of demyelinating plaques, which are the hallmark of MS. MRI with contrast (gadolinium) helps differentiate active lesions from old, inactive ones. The characteristic findings in MS include periventricular, juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord plaques, often described as \"Dawson's fingers\" (lesions oriented along venous structures). MRI is essential for diagnosis, disease monitoring, and assessing treatment response. Incorrect Options: B. CT scan: CT scan is not sensitive enough to detect MS lesions, especially in the early stages. While it can show large plaques in advanced cases, it lacks the detailed soft tissue contrast needed to assess demyelination. C. X-ray: X-rays cannot visualize the brain or spinal cord and have no role in diagnosing multiple sclerosis. They may be used to rule out other conditions affecting bones or the spine but are not useful for MS diagnosis. D.

It also allows for functional assessment of blood flow and involvement of branch vessels. Additionally, MRI is valuable for follow-up imaging in chronic aortic dissection cases. However, despite its high accuracy, MRI is not always the first-line imaging choice in emergencies due to longer scan times and limited availability in acute settings. Incorrect Options: A. ECG (Electrocardiogram): ECG is useful for assessing cardiac function and ruling out myocardial infarction, which can mimic aortic dissection. However, ECG does not provide direct visualization of the aorta and cannot diagnose aortic dissection. B. CT Scan: Contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) is actually the first-line imaging modality in emergencies due to its speed, availability, and high sensitivity for aortic dissection.

While single X-ray exams have minimal radiation exposure, repeated imaging can contribute to cumulative radiation effects. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MRI of the sella turcica will identify the cause of Cushing's syndrome MRI of the sella turcica is useful in detecting pituitary adenomas, particularly in Cushing’s disease (ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors), but it does not always identify the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Small pituitary adenomas (<6 mm) may not be visible on MRI, leading to false-negative results. Additionally, Cushing’s syndrome can also be caused by adrenal tumors or ectopic ACTH secretion, which MRI of the sella turcica alone cannot confirm. Therefore, while MRI is helpful, it is not definitive in determining the exact cause of Cushing’s syndrome in all cases. Other tests, such as biochemical evaluation and petrosal sinus sampling, are often required. Incorrect Options: B. MRI of the adrenal glands may distinguish adrenal adenoma from carcinoma: MRI can help differentiate between benign adrenal adenomas and adrenal carcinomas based on features such as size, shape, and signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Adenomas typically have homogeneous appearance and signal loss on out-of-phase imaging, while carcinomas tend to be larger, heterogeneous, and may show necrosis. C. Adrenal CT scan distinguishes adrenal tumor from cortical hyperplasia: CT scan is the preferred imaging modality for adrenal evaluation. It helps distinguish between adrenal tumors and adrenal hyperplasia based on size, shape, and contrast enhancement characteristics. Adenomas are typically small (<4 cm), well-defined, and show rapid contrast washout, whereas hyperplasia presents as bilateral adrenal enlargement. D. Petrosal sinus sampling is the best way to distinguish the tumor from an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor: Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is the gold standard for differentiating pituitary-dependent Cushing’s disease from ectopic ACTH production (e.g., from lung cancer or neuroendocrine tumors). A higher ACTH gradient in the petrosal sinus compared to peripheral blood confirms pituitary origin, whereas a low or absent gradient suggests ectopic ACTH production.",

This field strength provides a balance between image quality, scan time, and patient safety. A 1.5T MRI machine offers high-resolution images with good signal-to-noise ratio and is widely used for neurological, musculoskeletal, and abdominal imaging. It is the most commonly available MRI strength in hospitals and imaging centers, making it the gold standard for routine clinical imaging. Incorrect Options: A. 0.5 Tesla: Low-field MRI scanners (> 0.5T) exist but are less commonly used due to their lower image resolution and longer scan times. They are mainly used in specific situations, such as for patients with implanted devices that are not compatible with higher-field MRIs.

MRI, particularly diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and MR spectroscopy, can detect early ischemic changes, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and brain edema with high accuracy. MRI helps assess the severity of brain injury, predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and guide treatment decisions in neonates affected by birth asphyxia. Incorrect Options: A. Routine radiology: Conventional X-rays have no role in predicting neurological damage in perinatal asphyxia. They are mainly used for assessing skeletal abnormalities or chest conditions but do not provide information about brain injury. B. CT (Computed Tomography): CT scans can detect gross structural abnormalities, hemorrhages, and brain edema, but they are less sensitive than MRI for early ischemic changes and subtle white matter injuries. Moreover, CT exposes the infant to ionizing radiation, making MRI a safer and more preferred option. D.

They are commonly seen as incidental findings on MRI and do not usually indicate significant pathology or clinical symptoms. Schmorl’s nodes are often asymptomatic and are considered part of the normal aging process or minor degenerative changes. While they may be associated with disc degeneration, they are not a direct cause of pain or nerve compression, making them clinically insignificant in most cases of intervertebral disc prolapse. Incorrect Options: A. Significant: Schmorl’s nodes are not considered significant because they do not directly contribute to nerve compression or spinal instability. Their presence alone does not indicate a severe spinal disorder. C. Good prognosis: While Schmorl’s nodes themselves are benign, they do not necessarily predict a better outcome in cases of intervertebral disc prolapse. Prognosis depends on the severity of disc herniation and nerve involvement rather than the presence of Schmorl’s nodes. D.

The posterior fossa is a compact area where tumors can cause early compression of vital structures, and MRI is superior in detecting tumor size, location, edema, and hydrocephalus. MRI with contrast helps differentiate tumor types, assess brainstem invasion, and plan surgical or radiation treatment. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can further help in identifying tumor characteristics and distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Incorrect Options: A. CT Scan: CT scans can detect large posterior fossa tumors and hydrocephalus, but they lack the soft tissue contrast needed to precisely evaluate tumor extent and brainstem involvement. Additionally, CT suffers from beam-hardening artifacts, which can reduce image clarity in the posterior fossa due to the surrounding skull bones. C. Angiography: Cerebral angiography is useful for vascular tumors or assessing tumor-related blood supply but is not the primary imaging choice for posterior fossa tumors. It is usually reserved for preoperative planning or cases involving highly vascular lesions like hemangioblastomas. D.

CMR is considered the gold standard for evaluating ventricular function because it is non-invasive, does not use ionizing radiation, and offers excellent soft tissue contrast. It can also assess myocardial fibrosis, scarring, and ischemia using specialized techniques like late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Incorrect Options: A. Multislice CT: Cardiac CT is useful for assessing coronary artery disease (CAD) but is not the most accurate method for ventricular function. While it can estimate ejection fraction, it exposes the patient to radiation and does not provide real-time functional imaging like MRI or echocardiography. B. Echocardiography: Echocardiography (both transthoracic and transesophageal) is widely used for assessing ventricular function due to its availability, real-time imaging, and cost-effectiveness. However, it is less accurate than MRI, especially in patients with poor acoustic windows or complex cardiac anatomy.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) White Matter Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in multiple sclerosis (MS) primarily shows lesions in the white matter of the central nervous system. MS is a demyelinating disease, meaning it primarily affects the myelin sheath surrounding the axons in white matter. The characteristic lesions, known as plaques, are commonly found in areas such as the periventricular white matter, corpus callosum, brainstem, and spinal cord. MRI with T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences best detects these lesions, and contrast enhancement (Gadolinium) highlights active inflammation. The \"Dawson’s fingers\" sign, where lesions radiate perpendicular to the ventricles, is a classic finding in MS. Incorrect Options: B. Grey Matter: While MS was traditionally considered a white matter disease, recent studies show that grey matter involvement can occur, especially in advanced stages. However, white matter remains the primary site of demyelination, and grey matter lesions are less visible on standard MRI. C. Thalamus: The thalamus is part of the deep grey matter and is not a typical primary site for MS lesions. While some atrophy of the thalamus may be seen in chronic MS cases, it is not the main target of demyelination. D. Basal Ganglia: Similar to the thalamus, the basal ganglia are part of the deep grey matter and are not a common location for MS lesions.

MRI is highly sensitive for detecting early ischemic changes before they become visible on X-ray. It provides detailed images of bone marrow edema, necrosis, and revascularization, which are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Contrast-enhanced MRI (with gadolinium) can also help assess the extent of vascular compromise and disease progression. Incorrect Options: A. Plain X-ray: While X-ray is the first-line imaging for Perthes' disease, it lacks sensitivity in early stages. Initial radiographs may appear normal, and it takes weeks to months for signs like femoral head flattening, fragmentation, and sclerosis to become evident. B. Ultrasonography (US): Ultrasound is not the preferred modality for diagnosing Perthes’ disease. It can detect joint effusion but cannot assess bone necrosis or structural changes of the femoral head accurately. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice for evaluating avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, which is a well-known complication of long-term steroid use. MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for detecting early-stage AVN, even before changes appear on X-rays or CT scans. It can identify bone marrow edema, ischemic changes, and subchondral fractures, which are critical for early diagnosis and management. T2-weighted and STIR sequences help detect early ischemic changes, while contrast-enhanced MRI can assess the extent of bone infarction. Incorrect Options: A. CT Scan: CT is useful for assessing advanced AVN when bony collapse has occurred, but it lacks sensitivity for early-stage disease. It also exposes the patient to radiation, making it less ideal than MRI. B. Bone Scan: A bone scan (nuclear imaging) can show increased uptake in AVN, but it is not as specific or detailed as MRI. It is less effective in detecting small or early lesions and cannot provide the detailed anatomical assessment needed for treatment planning. D. Plain X-ray: X-ray is often the first-line imaging, but early-stage AVN may not be visible. Radiographic changes like subchondral sclerosis, crescent sign, and femoral head collapse appear only in later stages, by which time significant damage may have occurred.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Meningioma Meningioma is the most likely diagnosis in a young female presenting with lower limb weakness, spasticity, and urinary hesitancy, along with an intradural enhancing mass in the mid-dorsal spinal region on MRI. Meningiomas are slow-growing, extra-axial tumors that arise from the arachnoid cap cells. They are more common in women due to hormonal influences (estrogen and progesterone receptors). On MRI, meningiomas typically appear as well-circumscribed, homogeneously enhancing intradural extramedullary masses with a characteristic dural tail sign. They often cause spinal cord compression, leading to the neurological symptoms described. Incorrect Options: A. Intradural Lipoma: Intradural lipomas are fat-containing tumors, often associated with spinal dysraphism (e.g., tethered cord). They appear hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI and suppress on fat-saturated sequences. However, they do not enhance with contrast, making them unlikely in this case. C. Dermoid Cyst: Dermoid cysts are congenital tumors containing fat, hair, and sebaceous material. They usually appear as heterogeneous, non-enhancing lesions with fat-fluid levels on MRI. Unlike meningiomas, dermoid cysts are not strongly enhancing and are more commonly located in the lumbosacral rather than the dorsal spine. D. Neuroepithelial Cyst: Neuroepithelial cysts, also called ependymal cysts, are benign, congenital lesions that contain cerebrospinal fluid-like fluid. They appear as well-defined, non-enhancing cystic lesions on MRI and do not cause strong mass effect or enhancement. This makes them an unlikely cause of the progressive neurological symptoms and enhancing mass seen in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) MRI with Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with contrast is the gold standard for diagnosing acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma). Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), typically arising from the Schwann cells of the vestibular division. The most sensitive imaging modality for detecting even small tumors is MRI with gadolinium contrast, which highlights the tumor and helps differentiate it from surrounding structures. MRI provides high-resolution images of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and the internal auditory canal (IAC), the most common locations for acoustic neuromas. The typical MRI finding is a well-defined, homogeneously enhancing mass in the CPA, often extending into the IAC. Incorrect Options: A. CT with Contrast: While CT with contrast can detect larger acoustic neuromas, it is less sensitive than MRI, especially for small lesions or early-stage tumors. CT is mainly useful for evaluating bony changes in the internal auditory canal but lacks the soft tissue resolution required for precise tumor delineation. C. CT without Contrast: A non-contrast CT scan is not effective for detecting acoustic neuromas. These tumors are soft tissue masses that do not show up well without contrast enhancement. Additionally, CT lacks the ability to assess small tumors in the IAC accurately. D. Angiography: Angiography is not used for diagnosing acoustic neuroma. It is typically used for vascular lesions, such as aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), rather than nerve sheath tumors. Acoustic neuromas are not highly vascular, so angiography provides no diagnostic benefit.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mammography Mammography is the gold standard for detecting ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the earliest form of breast cancer. DCIS is a non-invasive malignancy confined to the milk ducts and is often detected as microcalcifications on mammography. Mammography is highly sensitive to detecting calcifications, which appear as fine, clustered, or linear deposits, often in a segmental distribution. These findings help in early diagnosis, allowing timely intervention before DCIS progresses to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Digital mammography and tomosynthesis (3D mammography) further improve the detection and characterization of these lesions. Incorrect Options: B. MRI: MRI is more sensitive than mammography for detecting invasive breast cancer, but it is not the gold standard for DCIS. While contrast-enhanced MRI can identify non-calcified DCIS lesions, it may miss smaller calcifications and is not routinely used for screening. MRI is reserved for high-risk patients, evaluating disease extent, or when mammography findings are inconclusive. C. Ultrasound (USG): Ultrasound is not effective for detecting DCIS, as it primarily detects solid or cystic masses but is poor at identifying microcalcifications. It is more useful for evaluating palpable breast lumps and distinguishing solid from cystic lesions but lacks the sensitivity for early-stage DCIS. D. CT/PET: CT and PET scans are used for staging advanced breast cancer, not for detecting DCIS. They are not sensitive for detecting small, localized in situ lesions and are primarily used for metastatic disease assessment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) In an 80-year-old male with sudden-onset epilepsy and an MRI showing a ring-enhancing lesion in the frontal lobe, brain metastasis is the most likely diagnosis. Metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in elderly patients, often presenting with seizures, cognitive changes, or focal neurological deficits. Ring enhancement on MRI is characteristic of metastatic lesions, particularly when there is perilesional edema and multiple lesions. The frontal lobe is a common site for brain metastases, which often originate from lung, breast, renal, or melanoma cancers. Contrast-enhanced MRI helps distinguish metastases from primary brain tumors. Incorrect Options: A. Ependymoma: Ependymomas are rare in elderly patients and typically arise in the ventricles or spinal cord, not the frontal lobe. They are more common in children and young adults. These tumors usually show homogeneous rather than ring enhancement on MRI. B. Oligodendroglioma: Oligodendrogliomas occur more commonly in younger adults (30-50 years old) and often present with seizures. However, they typically show calcifications and heterogeneous enhancement rather than a classic ring-enhancing lesion. Also, they are slow-growing tumors, making a sudden onset of symptoms less likely. C. Astrocytoma: Low-grade astrocytomas (Grade I-II) do not usually enhance on MRI, while high-grade astrocytomas (e.g., glioblastoma) can show ring enhancement. However, glioblastomas often have necrosis, an irregular shape, and significant mass effect, which are more aggressive features than typical metastases. Additionally, glioblastomas are primary brain tumors, whereas metastases are secondary and more likely in elderly patients with a history of systemic cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Multiple System Atrophy-C (MSA-C) The typical MRI appearance in Multiple System Atrophy-Cerebellar type (MSA-C) includes characteristic findings such as the \"hot cross bun sign\" seen on T2-weighted MRI in the pons. This pattern results from degeneration of the pontocerebellar fibers and transverse pontine tracts, leading to a cross-like hyperintensity. MSA-C primarily affects the cerebellum, pons, and brainstem, causing ataxia, dysarthria, autonomic dysfunction, and parkinsonian features. MRI also shows cerebellar and pontine atrophy along with putaminal hypointensity due to iron deposition. These imaging findings help differentiate MSA-C from other neurodegenerative diseases. Incorrect Options: A. Hallervorden-Spatz Disease: Now called Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN), this disorder is characterized by iron accumulation in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, seen as the \"eye of the tiger sign\" on MRI (T2 hypointensity with central hyperintensity). This is different from the pontine atrophy and hot cross bun sign seen in MSA-C. C. Multiple System Atrophy-Parkinsonian type (MSA-P): While MSA-P and MSA-C are subtypes of Multiple System Atrophy, MSA-P is predominantly characterized by Parkinsonism rather than cerebellar signs. MRI in MSA-P typically shows putaminal atrophy and hypointensity, not the \"hot cross bun\" sign, which is more specific to MSA-C. D. Wilson’s Disease: Wilson’s disease, a disorder of copper metabolism, affects the basal ganglia, leading to MRI findings such as the \"face of the giant panda sign\" in the midbrain.

Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. The characteristic MRI appearance is due to high melanin content, which shortens T1 relaxation time, making the lesion hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2. The lesion also enhances with gadolinium contrast, aiding in differentiation from other ocular tumors. Incorrect Options: A. Metastases from Breast Cancer: Breast cancer is the most common cause of intraocular metastases, but these lesions typically appear hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, the opposite of what is seen in this case. Additionally, metastases tend to be multifocal and more commonly involve the choroid or retina. B. Metastases from Lung Cancer: Similar to breast cancer metastases, lung cancer metastases to the eye typically appear hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, rather than the classic melanoma pattern. While lung cancer is a frequent source of ocular metastases, it is less common than breast cancer in females. C. Choroidal Hemangioma: Choroidal hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors of the eye and show hyperintensity on both T1 and T2-weighted MRI, unlike melanoma.
