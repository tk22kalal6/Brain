      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyperparathyroidism Subperiosteal erosion is a characteristic radiological finding in hyperparathyroidism, particularly in the primary form due to excess secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases bone resorption by stimulating osteoclast activity, leading to cortical bone thinning and subperiosteal bone resorption, especially at the radial aspect of the middle phalanges of the hand (a hallmark feature). Other skeletal manifestations include salt-and-pepper skull appearance, brown tumors (osteitis fibrosa cystica), and generalized osteopenia. Incorrect Options: A. Scurvy – Incorrect because scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) primarily affects bone through defective collagen synthesis, leading to periosteal hemorrhages, fragile bones, and scorbutic rosary in ribs. However, it does not cause subperiosteal erosion. C. Hypoparathyroidism – Incorrect because it is associated with low PTH levels, which result in decreased bone resorption, leading to increased bone density rather than subperiosteal erosion. Radiologically, it may present with basal ganglia calcifications and dense bones (osteosclerosis) rather than bone resorption. D. Rickets – Incorrect because rickets (vitamin D deficiency) leads to defective mineralization of osteoid, causing bone softening and deformities like bowing of legs. It primarily affects growth plates (rachitic rosary, widened metaphyses) rather than subperiosteal erosion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ewing’s sarcoma. The \"onion peel\" appearance on radiographs is a characteristic feature of Ewing’s sarcoma, a highly malignant small round cell tumor of bone. This appearance results from layers of periosteal new bone formation due to repeated episodes of bone destruction and repair. Ewing’s sarcoma typically affects children and adolescents, with a predilection for the diaphysis of long bones such as the femur, tibia, and pelvis. The tumor's aggressive nature leads to rapid periosteal reactions, forming multiple concentric layers of bone deposition, resembling the layers of an onion on X-ray. Additional radiographic features may include moth-eaten bone destruction, cortical disruption, and soft tissue extension. Incorrect Options: A. Giant Cell Tumor (GCT): Incorrect. GCT usually occurs in the epiphysis of long bones and presents as a lytic, expansile lesion with a “soap bubble” appearance on radiographs. Unlike Ewing’s sarcoma, it lacks periosteal reactions and does not exhibit the \"onion peel\" pattern. C. Osteogenic Sarcoma (Osteosarcoma): Incorrect. Osteosarcoma typically shows a “sunburst” pattern due to aggressive bone formation and a Codman’s triangle, which results from periosteal lifting. This is different from the layered periosteal reaction seen in Ewing’s sarcoma. D. Multiple Myeloma: Incorrect. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy that causes “punched-out lytic lesions” or “raindrop skull” appearance rather than a periosteal reaction. It primarily affects the bone marrow and does not produce an onion-skin appearance on radiographs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rickets. Fraying at the ends of long bones is a characteristic radiographic feature of rickets, a disorder caused by vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency, or phosphate metabolism abnormalities. The deficient mineralization of the growth plate results in fraying, cupping, splaying, and widening of the metaphysis, particularly at sites of rapid growth such as the distal femur, proximal tibia, and distal radius. The earliest radiographic sign of rickets is the loss of the provisional zone of calcification, seen at the metaphysis. In healing rickets, a white line of healing appears as mineralization improves. Incorrect Options: B. Scurvy: Incorrect. Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) primarily affects collagen synthesis, leading to fragile bones and bleeding tendencies. Radiographic findings include Frankel’s line (dense zone of provisional calcification), Wimberger’s ring sign (scurvy scorbutic rosary), and Pelkan spurs (bony projections at metaphysis), but fraying is not a feature. C. Osteogenesis Imperfecta: Incorrect. This is a genetic disorder of collagen synthesis, leading to brittle bones and multiple fractures. X-rays typically show osteopenia, bowing of long bones, and multiple fractures, but fraying is not a characteristic feature. D. Congenital Syphilis: Incorrect. In congenital syphilis, characteristic radiographic findings include Wimberger’s sign (destruction of the medial part of the proximal tibia), periosteal reaction, and metaphyseal lucencies (saber shin deformity). It does not show fraying of the metaphysis like rickets.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bronchus (Lung Cancer). Osseous (bone) metastasis is most commonly seen in malignancies that have a high propensity for hematogenous spread. Lung cancer, especially bronchogenic carcinoma, is one of the most common primary tumors to metastasize to bones due to its rich vascular supply and aggressive nature. Bone metastases from lung cancer are often osteolytic, leading to pathological fractures, bone pain, and hypercalcemia. The common sites of bone metastasis include the vertebrae, pelvis, ribs, and proximal long bones. Other tumors frequently causing bone metastases include breast, prostate, kidney, and thyroid cancers. Incorrect Options: B. Colon Cancer: Incorrect. Colorectal cancer typically spreads to the liver (via the portal venous system) and lungs, rather than bones. Bone metastases from colorectal cancer are rare. C. Pancreatic Cancer: Incorrect. Pancreatic cancer primarily metastasizes to the liver, peritoneum, and lungs. Bone metastases are uncommon in pancreatic malignancies. D. Adrenal Cancer: Incorrect. Adrenal tumors, such as adrenocortical carcinoma, primarily spread to the lungs, liver, and peritoneum. Bone metastases are rare in adrenal cancers.",

Wimberger’s sign in scurvy refers to a bilateral, symmetric, well-defined ring of increased density surrounding the epiphyseal center due to subperiosteal hemorrhage and defective collagen synthesis. This sign is best seen in the lower end of the femur, which is a common site for scurvy-related changes in growing children. It indicates periosteal elevation and cortical thinning, commonly found in vitamin C deficiency. Incorrect Options: B. Lower end of radius: Incorrect. Though scurvy affects multiple long bones, Wimberger’s sign is most prominent in the femur, not the radius. The lower end of the radius may show metaphyseal irregularities, but it is not the primary site for this sign. C. Patella: Incorrect. The patella is less commonly affected in scurvy, and Wimberger’s sign is not observed here. D. Upper end of radius: Incorrect.

GCT is a locally aggressive tumor with well-defined but non-sclerotic margins, and it often extends into the subarticular bone. The soap bubble pattern arises due to a trabeculated, multiloculated bone destruction process. Incorrect Options: A. Osteoid Osteoma: Incorrect. Osteoid osteoma is a small, well-defined radiolucent lesion (nidus) surrounded by reactive sclerosis. It is usually seen in the cortex of long bones (e.g., femur, tibia), but it does not show a soap bubble appearance. B. Osteochondroma: Incorrect. Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that appears as a bony outgrowth (exostosis) with a cartilage cap. It does not present with a soap bubble pattern. D.

The hallmark radiological features include vertebral body destruction, intervertebral disc space narrowing, kyphotic deformity, and paravertebral abscess formation. Correct Radiological Features: A. Large paravertebral abscess → Correct Tuberculous infection often causes cold abscess formation in the paravertebral region, which may be large due to minimal inflammatory response. A classic finding is the “fusiform or balloon-shaped” abscess along the vertebral column. C. Marked collapse of vertebra → Correct Tuberculosis leads to progressive destruction of the vertebral bodies, often resulting in severe collapse (vertebral plana) and kyphotic deformity (gibbus formation). D. Decreased joint space → Correct Unlike pyogenic infections, tuberculosis causes gradual disc space narrowing due to slow destruction of the intervertebral disc and adjacent endplates.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Multiple myeloma. Multiple \"punched-out\" holes in the skull are a characteristic radiological finding in multiple myeloma, a malignant plasma cell disorder. These well-defined, round, lytic lesions occur due to bone resorption without reactive new bone formation. The lesions result from increased osteoclastic activity driven by myeloma cells, leading to bone pain, fractures, and hypercalcemia. This appearance is best seen on a skull X-ray and is sometimes referred to as a \"raindrop skull\" due to the scattered lytic defects. Incorrect Options: A. Hyperparathyroidism: Hyperparathyroidism causes subperiosteal bone resorption, commonly affecting the radial aspect of the phalanges. Skull X-rays may show a \"salt and pepper\" appearance rather than discrete punched-out lesions. C. Thalassemia Major: Thalassemia major leads to extramedullary hematopoiesis, causing bone marrow expansion and cortical thinning. The skull X-ray shows a \"hair-on-end\" or \"crew-cut\" appearance due to prominent vertical striations, not punched-out lesions. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Oblique. The best radiological view for diagnosing a scaphoid fracture is the oblique view, specifically the posteroanterior (PA) view with ulnar deviation. This position helps in elongating the scaphoid and reducing overlap with surrounding bones, improving fracture visibility. A true scaphoid view (PA wrist with ulnar deviation and sometimes an additional 30° cephalic tilt) is most sensitive for detecting subtle fractures. Incorrect Options: A. Anteroposterior (AP) View The AP view does not provide an optimal angle to visualize the scaphoid, as it often overlaps with other carpal bones, making fractures difficult to detect. B. Lateral View The lateral view is not ideal for detecting scaphoid fractures but is useful for assessing carpal alignment and dislocation. D. Any of the above Not all views are equally effective in diagnosing a scaphoid fracture. The oblique (scaphoid view) is the most reliable for detecting fractures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Peripheral field of differentiation. Osteosarcoma and myositis ossificans both present with ossification, but they can be differentiated radiologically based on the pattern of bone formation. Osteosarcoma: Shows central (medullary) ossification, meaning the tumor forms bone in the center and grows outward. It often appears as an aggressive lesion with a sunburst pattern, Codman’s triangle, and periosteal reaction. Myositis ossificans: Shows peripheral ossification, meaning bone formation occurs at the periphery while the center remains radiolucent (cartilaginous or fibrous). This helps distinguish it from osteosarcoma, which shows chaotic bone formation throughout. Incorrect Options: A. Location: Both conditions can occur in similar locations, such as the long bones, especially around the femur. However, osteosarcoma originates in bone, while myositis ossificans occurs in soft tissue. B. Absence of osteomyelitic changes: Neither condition typically shows osteomyelitic changes (e.g., sequestrum or involucrum), so this is not a key distinguishing factor. C. Shape of swelling: While osteosarcoma presents with an irregular, infiltrative swelling, and myositis ossificans appears more well-defined, this is not the primary distinguishing feature.",

The characteristic X-ray findings include widened joint spaces, skull and jaw changes, and premature osteoarthritis. Correct X-ray Findings in Acromegaly: B. Widened Joint Spaces Due to cartilage overgrowth, joint spaces initially widen before degenerative arthritis sets in. C. Obtuse Angle of Mandible and Lengthening of Mandible (Prognathism) Acromegaly causes mandibular overgrowth, resulting in a more obtuse gonial angle and prognathism (enlarged jaw). D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Transverse fracture of Atlas. Pantomography (Panoramic Radiography) is a specialized imaging technique primarily used in dentistry and maxillofacial imaging. It provides a wide, curved, two-dimensional view of the entire dental arch, jaws, and temporomandibular joints (TMJ) in a single image. However, it is not suitable for evaluating cervical spine fractures, such as a transverse fracture of the atlas (C1 vertebra). Atlas fractures require more detailed imaging techniques, such as lateral cervical spine X-ray, open-mouth odontoid view, or CT scan, which offer superior bone resolution and visualization of the C1-C2 complex. Since pantomography does not effectively capture the cervical vertebrae, it is not a preferred modality for diagnosing an atlas fracture. Incorrect Options: A. Dental Caries Pantomography is widely used in dental examinations for detecting dental caries (cavities), periodontal disease, and impacted teeth. It helps visualize the entire dental arch and is useful for screening multiple teeth at once. B. Dental Cyst Pantomography is useful for detecting dental cysts and other pathological lesions in the jawbones, as it provides a comprehensive view of the upper and lower jaw structures. C. TM Joint It is also used for evaluating temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, including joint degeneration, dislocation, and other abnormalities affecting jaw movement.",

This is characteristic of Osteopetrosis (Albers-Schönberg disease), a rare genetic disorder caused by defective osteoclast function, leading to impaired bone resorption and excessive bone mineralization. The bones appear dense and sclerotic on X-ray, but they are also brittle, making them prone to fractures. Classic radiological findings include diffuse bone sclerosis, “bone within a bone” appearance, and Erlenmeyer flask deformity of long bones. Incorrect Options: B. Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) is a collagen synthesis disorder, leading to osteopenia (reduced bone density), multiple fractures, and bowing of bones, rather than a marble bone appearance. C. Fluorosis Skeletal fluorosis causes diffuse bone sclerosis and hyperostosis, but it does not produce the characteristic \"marble bone\" appearance seen in osteopetrosis. Instead, it may show ligamentous calcifications and osteophyte formation. D. Achondroplasia Achondroplasia is a disorder of cartilage formation, leading to shortened long bones, bullet-shaped vertebrae, and narrowing of the spinal canal, but it does not cause a marble-like bone density.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Narrowing or absence of the normal zone of provisional calcification. In Rickets, there is defective mineralization of the growing bone due to vitamin D deficiency, calcium, or phosphate abnormalities. The most characteristic radiological sign of rickets is the loss or narrowing of the zone of provisional calcification at the metaphysis, which appears as a blurred, frayed, or widened metaphysis on X-ray. This occurs due to the failure of cartilage matrix mineralization. Other characteristic findings include metaphyseal cupping, splaying, and fraying. Incorrect Options: B. Fracture of the bone Rickets primarily causes bone softening and deformities (such as bowing of bones) rather than fractures. However, in severe cases, Looser's zones (pseudofractures) may be seen, but complete fractures are not a defining feature. C. Epiphysis smaller than normal and have characteristic thin pencil line cortex This description is more characteristic of Scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency) rather than Rickets. In scurvy, epiphyseal changes such as Wimberger’s sign (ringed epiphysis) are commonly seen. D. Bowing of the bone While bowing of bones (especially in weight-bearing bones like the tibia and femur) is a late feature of Rickets, it is not an initial radiological change.

However, thalassemia major does not typically cause bone infarcts; instead, it leads to marrow hyperplasia and expansion, cortical thinning, and pathologic fractures. Incorrect Options: A. Dysbaric osteonecrosis is commonly juxta-articular Dysbaric osteonecrosis (seen in divers and individuals exposed to decompression sickness) affects juxta-articular regions, particularly the femoral and humeral heads. B. Occur in Gaucher's disease Gaucher’s disease leads to bone infarcts due to infiltration of Gaucher cells, causing vascular occlusion and ischemia. It can result in Erlenmeyer flask deformity, osteonecrosis, and fractures. D. Are often diaphyseal in sickle cell disease Sickle cell disease causes vaso-occlusion and bone infarcts, particularly in the diaphysis of long bones. It can lead to \"bone within a bone\" appearance and H-shaped vertebrae. E. Are seen in acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis can cause fat embolism, leading to bone infarcts, especially in the femoral head and metaphyseal regions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Spondylolisthesis. The \"Beheaded Scottish Terrier Sign\" is a radiological finding seen in spondylolisthesis, particularly due to spondylolysis (a defect in the pars interarticularis). It is best visualized on an oblique lumbar spine X-ray. Normally, in an oblique view of the lumbar spine, the pars interarticularis forms the \"neck\" of a Scottish Terrier-like shape. In spondylolysis, the pars interarticularis defect creates a gap in the \"neck\", making the \"head\" appear separated from the body, giving the \"beheaded Scottish Terrier\" appearance. If spondylolysis progresses to spondylolisthesis, the vertebral body moves anteriorly, worsening the defect. Incorrect Options: A. Spondylosis Spondylosis refers to degenerative changes in the spine (such as osteophyte formation and disc degeneration). It does not cause a pars interarticularis defect or the beheaded Scottish Terrier sign. C. Fracture of the Transverse Process of the Lumbar Vertebra Transverse process fractures result from direct trauma or muscle avulsion and do not resemble the Scottish Terrier sign. D. Fracture of Rib Rib fractures are diagnosed using chest X-rays, and they do not involve the vertebral anatomy necessary to produce the Scottish Terrier appearance. E.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tc-Sestamibi Scan. The Technetium-99m Sestamibi (Tc-99m Sestamibi) scan is the investigation of choice for detecting parathyroid adenomas and hyperplasia in primary hyperparathyroidism. It works by using a radioactive tracer (Tc-99m Sestamibi), which is preferentially absorbed by hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. This allows for accurate localization of abnormal parathyroid glands before surgery (parathyroidectomy). It is non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific for identifying ectopic or multiple adenomas. Often combined with SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) for better anatomical localization. Incorrect Options: A. CT Scan CT scans are not the primary imaging modality for parathyroid pathology. However, 4D-CT is used in cases where Tc-99m Sestamibi scanning is inconclusive, especially in recurrent or ectopic parathyroid adenomas. B. Gallium Scan Gallium scans are primarily used for detecting infections, tumors, and lymphoma, but they are not specific for parathyroid pathology. C. Thallium Scan Thallium-201 scans were previously used for parathyroid imaging but have been largely replaced by Tc-99m Sestamibi due to better accuracy and imaging quality.",

Calcification of the meniscal cartilage, also known as chondrocalcinosis, is a characteristic feature of pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, CPPD). Pseudogout results from the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the articular cartilage, leading to calcification, particularly in the menisci of the knee, symphysis pubis, and triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist. Radiographic findings include linear calcifications within the cartilage (chondrocalcinosis), particularly in the knee, wrist, and pubic symphysis. Incorrect Options: A. Acromegaly Acromegaly can cause cartilage hypertrophy and joint space widening, but it does not typically cause meniscal cartilage calcification. B. Hyperparathyroidism Hyperparathyroidism can cause subperiosteal resorption, brown tumors, and osteitis fibrosa cystica, but it does not primarily cause meniscal calcification. However, it may lead to vascular and periarticular soft tissue calcifications. C.

Posterior iliac horns are bilateral, symmetrical, bony projections on the posterior aspect of the iliac bones, seen on pelvic X-rays. They are asymptomatic and help in the radiological diagnosis of NPS. Other features of Nail-Patella Syndrome include: - Nail abnormalities (hypoplastic, ridged, or absent nails). - Skeletal anomalies (elbow dysplasia, patellar hypoplasia). - Renal involvement (nephropathy, proteinuria). - Glaucoma or ocular defects. Incorrect Options: B. Marfan's Syndrome Marfan’s syndrome is a connective tissue disorder affecting the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). It causes tall stature, long limbs (arachnodactyly), lens dislocation, and aortic aneurysm, but does not cause posterior iliac horns. C.

Sometimes called \"hole-within-hole\" appearance. Common sites: Skull, mandible, ribs, vertebrae (\"vertebra plana\"), and long bones. Other clinical features: Painful or asymptomatic skull lesions. Can be solitary (Eosinophilic Granuloma) or part of systemic Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH). Incorrect Options: B. Multiple Myeloma Multiple Myeloma causes multiple \"punched-out\" lytic lesions in the skull but without beveled edges. These lesions are uniform, well-defined, and lack the asymmetry of LCH. C.

Caused by subperiosteal hemorrhage and periosteal reaction. (C) Zone of Demarcation Near Epiphysis Also known as the Wimberger’s Ring Sign, it appears as a well-defined white line around the epiphysis due to defective bone turnover. (D) Frenkel’s Line Also called the White Line of Frankel, it is a dense white line at the metaphysis due to defective bone resorption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Metaphyseal fractures (which is not typically seen in Osteogenesis Imperfecta). Metaphyseal fractures are more characteristic of Rickets or Child Abuse (battered baby syndrome). In OI, fractures commonly involve the diaphysis rather than the metaphysis. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) – Key Features: Osteogenesis Imperfecta is a genetic disorder of collagen (Type I collagen defect) leading to bone fragility, recurrent fractures, and connective tissue abnormalities. Incorrect Option: A. Diaphyseal fractures OI primarily leads to diaphyseal fractures (midshaft fractures of long bones) due to bone fragility and reduced cortical thickness. Recurrent fractures cause bone deformities like bowing of femur and tibia. C. Classified by Sillence Classification OI is classified using Sillence Classification, which includes Types I–IV (with additional subtypes described later). Type I – Mildest, blue sclera. Type II – Most severe, perinatal lethal. Type III – Severe, progressive deformities. Type IV – Moderate severity. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA/ DXA). Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis because it provides a precise and quantitative measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). Why DEXA is the best choice? Measures BMD at hip, lumbar spine, and forearm (most fracture-prone sites). Highly sensitive and reproducible. Used to calculate T-score and Z-score, which help in osteoporosis diagnosis. T-score ≤ -2.5 confirms osteoporosis as per WHO criteria. Incorrect Options: B. Single Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (SXA) Measures BMD but only in peripheral sites (forearm, heel). Less accurate and not widely used for osteoporosis diagnosis. C. Ultrasonography Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is used for screening but not for definitive diagnosis. Measures bone quality at heel or tibia, but lacks precision compared to DEXA. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Adamantinoma. Adamantinoma is a rare, low-grade malignant bone tumor that primarily affects the tibia, usually in young adults. It presents as a slowly progressive swelling and has a distinctive histopathological feature: epithelial islands within a fibrous stroma. This epithelial component is a hallmark of adamantinoma and is not seen in other bone tumors. Clinical Features: Most commonly affects the middle third of the tibia. Slowly growing, painless swelling over months to years. Typically affects young adults (20–40 years old). Radiological Features: Multiple, sharply demarcated radiolucent lesions. Areas of dense and sclerotic bone interspersed within the lesion. Cortical thinning and possible expansion of the bone. Histological Features: Islands of epithelial cells within a fibrous stroma. The presence of epithelial elements differentiates adamantinoma from other bone lesions. Incorrect Options B. Osteofibrous Dysplasia Similar in location (tibia) and radiological appearance, but: More common in children (<10 years old) rather than adults. Histology lacks epithelial islands, which are a hallmark of adamantinoma. Considered a benign lesion and does not progress to malignancy. C. Osteosarcoma Aggressive tumor with: Rapid growth, pain, and soft tissue invasion, unlike the slow progression of adamantinoma. X-ray features include: Codman’s triangle (periosteal elevation). Sunburst pattern (aggressive periosteal reaction). Histology shows malignant osteoid production, not epithelial islands. D. Fibrous Cortical Defect Benign, self-limiting lesion, usually seen in children and adolescents. Small, well-circumscribed radiolucent lesions found in the metaphysis, not in the diaphysis. No epithelial cells in histology, making it different from adamantinoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Carcinoma Prostate Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy associated with osteoblastic (bone-forming) metastases. Unlike most cancers that cause osteolytic (bone-destroying) lesions, prostate cancer typically induces new bone formation, leading to sclerotic (dense) bone lesions seen on imaging. These lesions can cause bone pain and pathological fractures but are distinct due to their increased bone density. Tumor cells release bone growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and endothelin-1, which stimulate osteoblast activity and new bone formation. The spine, pelvis, and proximal femur are common sites of metastases. X-ray and bone scans typically show diffuse or focal sclerotic lesions in affected bones. Incorrect Options: A. Carcinoma Lung → Usually Osteolytic Lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung carcinoma, usually causes osteolytic metastases, leading to destructive bone lesions. Small cell lung cancer, in rare cases, may cause mixed or sclerotic lesions, but it is not the typical presentation. B. Carcinoma Breast → Mixed (Osteolytic & Osteoblastic) Breast cancer metastases can be osteolytic, osteoblastic, or mixed. Lytic lesions occur more commonly due to parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which increases bone resorption. Some subtypes, like lobular carcinoma, may produce osteoblastic secondaries, but this is less common than osteolytic lesions. C. Carcinoma Urinary Bladder → Usually Osteolytic Bladder cancer primarily causes osteolytic bone metastases, leading to bone destruction rather than bone formation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Kidney (Renal Cell Carcinoma). Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the primary malignancies known to produce expansile, lytic osseous metastases. Unlike most other cancers that cause bone destruction in a non-expansile manner, RCC metastases tend to expand the bone while eroding it. These metastases can appear ballooned, lytic, and well-defined on radiographs, often resembling a \"blow-out\" lesion rather than a typical destructive or sclerotic metastasis. Highly vascular tumor that promotes bone destruction but also stimulates surrounding bone growth, leading to an expansile appearance. Metastases commonly involve vertebrae, pelvis, femur, and humerus, increasing the risk of pathological fractures. Radiographic features: Large, lytic, expansile lesions with a soap-bubble-like appearance. Incorrect Options: B. Bronchus (Lung Cancer) Lung cancer metastases are mostly osteolytic rather than expansile. They cause rapid bone destruction, leading to pathological fractures, but they do not expand the bone. Some small cell lung cancers can cause osteoblastic metastases, but expansile lesions are uncommon. C. Breast Cancer Breast cancer metastases are typically osteolytic, osteoblastic, or mixed, but they do not produce expansile lesions. Lytic lesions result from tumor-induced bone resorption, while osteoblastic lesions occur due to abnormal bone formation. Common sites of metastases: Spine, pelvis, ribs, and femur. D.

DIP joints in rheumatoid arthritis RA rarely affects the DIP joints, as it mainly involves MCP and PIP joints. When DIP joint involvement is seen, it is usually in psoriatic arthritis, not RA. Heberden’s nodes are not seen in RA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Radiolucent transverse metaphyseal bands The earliest radiographic manifestation of childhood leukemia is the presence of radiolucent transverse metaphyseal bands (also called \"leukemic lines\"). These appear as: Symmetric, transverse, radiolucent bands at the metaphysis of long bones. Most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. Thought to result from marrow infiltration and disruption of normal bone metabolism. These changes are highly suggestive of leukemia in a child presenting with musculoskeletal symptoms. Incorrect Options: B. Diffuse demineralization of bones Generalized osteopenia is a later finding in leukemia. It occurs due to bone marrow infiltration leading to increased osteoclastic activity and decreased bone formation. However, it is not the earliest sign. C. Osteoblastic lesions in skull Leukemia typically causes osteolytic (not osteoblastic) lesions in the skull. Osteoblastic lesions are more characteristic of osteosarcoma or metastatic prostate cancer, not leukemia. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Paget's Disease The most probable diagnosis in this 60-year-old man with sensorineural hearing loss and bony abnormalities is Paget’s disease of bone (Osteitis Deformans). The key supporting features in the case include: Normal serum calcium (S.Ca²+ = 9.5 mg/dL) → Paget’s disease typically has normal calcium levels in the absence of fractures. Markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP = 440 IU/L) → Reflects increased bone turnover, characteristic of Paget’s disease. Ivory vertebra → Represents diffuse bony sclerosis, commonly seen in Paget’s disease. Cotton-wool spots on skull X-ray → A classic finding in Paget’s disease due to disorganized bone remodeling. Sensorineural deafness → Occurs due to temporal bone involvement leading to cochlear nerve compression. Paget’s disease is a chronic disorder of bone remodeling characterized by excessive bone resorption and disorganized new bone formation, leading to structurally weak and abnormally enlarged bones. Incorrect Options: B. Osteosclerotic Metastasis Ivory vertebra can be seen in osteoblastic metastases (e.g., prostate, breast cancer). However, cotton-wool spots on the skull are not a feature of metastasis. Metastatic disease typically has multiple lytic or sclerotic lesions, not the characteristic mosaic bone pattern of Paget’s. C. Osteoporosis Osteoporosis leads to diffuse bone loss and fragility fractures, not bone sclerosis (ivory vertebra). Serum ALP is usually normal in osteoporosis unless there is a fracture. Cotton-wool skull appearance is not seen in osteoporosis. D. Fibrous Dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia is a developmental disorder of bone, presenting with ground-glass bone appearance, not ivory vertebra or cotton-wool skull. It does not significantly elevate alkaline phosphatase like Paget’s disease. Sensorineural deafness can occur in McCune-Albright syndrome, but it is associated with café-au-lait spots and endocrine abnormalities, which are absent in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyperparathyroidism \"Floating teeth\" refers to the radiographic appearance where teeth appear to be suspended in space without visible bone support. This is primarily due to severe bone resorption around the teeth, which is seen in Hyperparathyroidism. Mechanism in Hyperparathyroidism: Subperiosteal bone resorption (hallmark feature), leading to loss of cortical bone. Loss of lamina dura around teeth, creating the floating teeth appearance. Generalized osteopenia, leading to fragile bones. Other radiographic signs: Pepper pot skull / Salt and pepper skull (mottled appearance of the skull due to resorption). Subperiosteal resorption at the radial aspect of middle phalanx of 2nd and 3rd fingers. Brown tumors (osteoclast-rich bone lesions due to excessive PTH). Incorrect Options: B. Hypoparathyroidism – No Bone Resorption Hypoparathyroidism leads to increased bone density due to low PTH levels, not resorption. Common features include calcification of basal ganglia and hyperdense bones, but not floating teeth. C. Rickets – Causes Metaphyseal Changes, Not Floating Teeth Rickets leads to defective mineralization of bone, causing widened growth plates and bowing of long bones, but it does not cause loss of alveolar bone around teeth. Characteristic radiographic findings include \"fraying, cupping, and splaying\" of metaphyses. D. Scurvy – Causes Subperiosteal Bleeding, Not Bone Resorption Scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency) leads to bleeding and weakened bone structure, but not direct resorption.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ground Glass Appearance The characteristic radiological feature of fibrous dysplasia is the \"ground glass appearance\" of the affected bone. This occurs due to the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and disorganized trabeculae, leading to a homogeneous hazy appearance on X-ray. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder that can involve a single bone (monostotic) or multiple bones (polyostotic). The ground glass appearance is seen due to poorly mineralized woven bone, which gives a uniform hazy density. Other radiological features include: Bone expansion with endosteal scalloping. No periosteal reaction (distinguishing it from other lytic lesions). Shepherd’s crook deformity in the femur due to bowing. Incorrect Options: A. Thickened Bone Matrix Fibrous dysplasia does not cause thickening of the bone matrix. Instead, it replaces the normal bone with fibrous tissue, making the bone appear less dense rather than thickened. Thickened bone matrix is more characteristic of conditions like Paget’s disease or osteopetrosis. B. Cortical Erosion Fibrous dysplasia does not cause significant cortical erosion. Instead, the cortex remains intact but may appear thinned or scalloped due to expansion of the lesion. Cortical erosion is more commonly seen in aggressive bone tumors or infections like osteomyelitis. D. Bone Enlargement Although fibrous dysplasia can cause bone expansion, it is due to the replacement of bone with fibrous tissue, not true hypertrophy or overgrowth of the bone. The key radiological hallmark remains the ground glass appearance, while bone enlargement is a secondary effect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Blowout Fracture The \"tear drop sign\" is a radiological finding seen on Waters view (Occipitomental view) of the skull, most commonly associated with blowout fractures of the orbit. A blowout fracture typically occurs due to blunt trauma to the orbit, leading to a fracture of the orbital floor (maxillary sinus roof). The tear drop sign appears as a soft tissue opacity hanging into the maxillary sinus, representing herniated orbital contents (fat, muscle, or soft tissue). This is often associated with diplopia, enophthalmos, and infraorbital nerve damage (causing numbness over the cheek and upper lip). Incorrect Options: B. Maxillary Mucocele A maxillary mucocele presents as a homogeneous radiopaque mass within the maxillary sinus but does not cause a tear drop appearance. It results from chronic obstruction of the sinus ostium, leading to mucus accumulation. C. Nasolacrimal Duct Blockage Nasolacrimal duct obstruction typically leads to dilatation of the lacrimal sac (dacryocystocele), visible in imaging of the medial orbit, not as a tear drop sign in the maxillary sinus. D. Fibrous Dysplasia Fibrous dysplasia affects the bony structure, leading to ground glass opacity rather than the displacement of orbital contents. It is not associated with blowout fractures or soft tissue herniation into the sinus",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Children Symptomatic spinal injury without radiological evidence (SCIWORA - Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormality) is most commonly seen in children. In children, the spinal column is more flexible and elastic, while the spinal cord is relatively less elastic. This makes the spinal cord vulnerable to injury even without visible fractures or dislocations on X-rays or CT scans. The underdeveloped musculature and ligamentous structures in children contribute to this phenomenon. MRI is the preferred imaging modality for detecting soft tissue and spinal cord injuries in such cases. Incorrect Options: B. Elderly In elderly individuals, spinal injuries are often associated with degenerative changes, osteoporosis, and fractures, which are usually detectable on radiographs. SCIWORA is rare in older adults due to decreased flexibility of the spine. C. Teenagers While teenagers can experience spinal injuries, their spinal column is more mature and less flexible compared to children, making SCIWORA less common. Fractures and dislocations are more likely to be seen on imaging in this age group. D. Young Adults Young adults usually sustain high-impact spinal trauma (e.g., from motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries), which more often leads to detectable fractures or dislocations. SCIWORA is uncommon in this group.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Osteomalacia Looser’s zones, also known as pseudofractures or Milkman’s fractures, are characteristically seen in osteomalacia. Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disorder caused by defective mineralization of bone matrix, often due to vitamin D deficiency. Looser’s zones are bilateral, symmetrical, and transverse radiolucent lines that appear in areas of mechanical stress, such as the pubic rami, ribs, scapula, medial femur, and ulna. These lesions do not extend completely through the bone and are often associated with bone pain and weakness. Incorrect Options: B. Paget’s Disease Paget’s disease is characterized by excessive bone remodeling, leading to thickened, deformed, and structurally weak bones. The characteristic radiological findings in Paget’s disease include cotton wool appearance of the skull, osteoporosis circumscripta, and blade of grass sign, but Looser’s zones are not a common feature. C. Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder of collagen synthesis, leading to brittle bones and multiple fractures. While OI can present with fractures, Looser’s zones (pseudofractures) are not a characteristic finding. Classic radiological findings of OI include wormian bones in the skull and bowing of long bones. D. All of the Above Since Looser’s zones are characteristic of osteomalacia and not a feature of Paget’s disease or osteogenesis imperfecta, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Neuroenteric Cyst A neuroenteric cyst is a cystic mass in the posterior mediastinum that arises from foregut remnants due to abnormal development of mesodermal and endodermal structures during embryogenesis. Strong association with vertebral anomalies Around 40% of cases show anterior fusion anomalies of the cervical and thoracic spine. This includes hemivertebrae, butterfly vertebrae, and vertebral body fusion defects. Commonly found in infants and children Located in the posterior mediastinum, often near the spinal canal Symptoms may include respiratory distress, dysphagia, or neurological deficits (if spinal involvement is present). Since this combination of vertebral anomalies and a posterior mediastinal mass is highly characteristic of neuroenteric cysts, this is the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Options: B. Meningomyelocele – No Posterior Mediastinal Mass Meningomyelocele is a neural tube defect with herniation of meninges and spinal cord. It occurs in the lumbosacral region, not the posterior mediastinum. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most likely diagnosis in this middle-aged female with severe bone pain, multiple lytic lesions, fractures, and subperiosteal resorption is hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) results in excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to increased bone resorption and characteristic skeletal changes. Radiological features include: Multiple lytic lesions (brown tumors due to osteoclastic activity) in the pelvis, ribs, and femur. Fractures, especially in weight-bearing bones. Subperiosteal resorption of the radial aspect of metacarpals, which is a hallmark of hyperparathyroidism. Salt and pepper appearance of the skull (due to trabecular resorption). Rugger-jersey spine (sclerosis of vertebral endplates). This condition is commonly associated with parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia and may lead to osteitis fibrosa cystica in severe cases. Incorrect Options: A. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism can cause osteopenia and osteoporosis but does not cause multiple lytic lesions or subperiosteal resorption. Bone pain is not a prominent feature, and fractures are usually due to chronic bone loss rather than direct resorption. C. Renal Osteodystrophy Renal osteodystrophy is seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and involves secondary hyperparathyroidism. It can cause subperiosteal resorption, but multiple lytic lesions (brown tumors) are less common. It also presents with osteomalacia-like features, soft tissue calcifications, and rugger-jersey spine, but no mention of CKD is provided in the history. D. Osteomalacia Osteomalacia is due to vitamin D deficiency or defective mineralization and presents with bone pain, fractures, and Looser's zones (pseudofractures). It does not cause subperiosteal resorption or multiple lytic lesions, which are characteristic of hyperparathyroidism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Periosteal Reaction The sun-ray appearance in osteosarcoma is due to an aggressive periosteal reaction caused by the rapid growth of malignant bone-forming cells. As the tumor expands, it stimulates the periosteum to produce spiculated bone formations, which radiate outward in a sunburst pattern. This spiculated periosteal reaction occurs because the tumor invades and lifts the periosteum, leading to the deposition of perpendicular bony spicules. This feature is highly suggestive of osteosarcoma, a highly aggressive bone tumor, typically affecting the metaphysis of long bones (e.g., distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus) in adolescents and young adults. Incorrect Options: A. Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) leads to bone infarction, but it does not cause a sun-ray appearance. Instead, it shows patchy sclerosis, subchondral collapse (crescent sign), and joint space narrowing. C. Calcification along the muscle spindles Muscle spindle calcifications occur in conditions like myositis ossificans, but they do not produce a radiating sunburst periosteal pattern. Myositis ossificans appears as a well-demarcated, ossified mass with a zonal pattern of calcification. D. Calcification along the vessels Vascular calcifications occur in conditions like Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis or chronic kidney disease, but they appear as linear or circular calcifications along arteries, not as spiculated bone formation.",
