      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CT Scan. CT scan is considered the best diagnostic modality for pancreatic cancer, especially when the tumor is located in the head of the pancreas. It provides detailed cross-sectional images that help in accurately identifying the tumor, assessing its size, extent, and its relation to adjacent structures. CT is particularly valuable because it can detect small lesions, evaluate vascular involvement, and identify any distant metastases, which is crucial for staging and treatment planning. Incorrect Options: (A) Ultrasound: Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique and is often used as an initial screening tool. However, its effectiveness in diagnosing pancreatic head tumors is limited due to interference from bowel gas and the deep retroperitoneal location of the pancreas. This makes ultrasound less sensitive and specific compared to CT. (B) ERCP: ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) is primarily used to visualize the pancreatic duct and biliary tree and for therapeutic interventions like stenting. Although it can provide useful ductal details, it is invasive and carries a risk of complications such as pancreatitis. Its role is more in treatment than in the initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. (D) Angiography: Angiography is an invasive procedure used mainly to assess vascular involvement in cases where detailed vascular mapping is necessary, often preoperatively. It is not the primary diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer due to its invasiveness and lower sensitivity for detecting the primary tumor compared to CT",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Subdural hematoma increase in density on serial CT scans over weeks. This statement is not true because, in head injury, an acute subdural hematoma initially appears as a crescent-shaped hyperdense (bright) collection on CT scans. Over time—weeks—it undergoes liquefaction and degradation, causing its density to decrease (becoming isodense and eventually hypodense) relative to the brain parenchyma. Incorrect Options: (B) Extra dural hematomas are usually lens shaped: This is true. Epidural (extra dural) hematomas typically have a biconvex or lens-shaped appearance on CT, due to the accumulation of blood between the skull and the dura, and they are limited by the sutures of the skull. (C) Acute subdural hematoma appears as crescent shadow of increased density: This is correct. An acute subdural hematoma is classically seen as a crescent-shaped hyperdense area on CT, as the blood collects between the dura and the brain surface, conforming to the curvature of the brain. (D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as areas of increased density in basilar cisterns: This statement is true. In cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the blood in the subarachnoid space appears as areas of increased density, particularly in regions like the basilar cisterns, which are well visualized on CT scans.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Achalasia cardia. In achalasia cardia, there is a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax, along with a loss of esophageal peristalsis. This results in a characteristic tapered narrowing at the distal esophagus, which on a barium swallow study creates a \"bird beak\" appearance. The smooth, symmetric taper resembles a bird's beak, making it a classic radiographic sign of achalasia. Incorrect Options: (B) Reflux oesophagitis: This condition generally leads to inflammation, erosions, or ulcerations of the esophageal lining rather than a smooth, tapered narrowing. It does not produce the bird beak appearance seen in achalasia. (C) Carcinoma oesophagus: Esophageal cancer typically presents with irregular, asymmetric narrowing or mass lesions rather than a smooth, tapering appearance. The narrowing due to carcinoma is usually more abrupt and irregular compared to the bird beak sign. (D) Hiatus hernia: A hiatus hernia involves the displacement of part of the stomach into the thorax through the esophageal hiatus. It does not cause the characteristic tapering of the distal esophagus; instead, it alters the normal anatomical positioning of the gastroesophageal junction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Plain CT scan. A plain CT scan, especially a high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest, is considered the gold standard for diagnosing minimal bronchiectasis. It is highly sensitive in detecting subtle bronchial wall abnormalities, mild dilatation, and the characteristic features of bronchiectasis (such as the lack of tapering and the \"signet ring\" sign). Because minimal bronchiectasis can be very subtle, HRCT without contrast is preferred as it provides excellent spatial resolution to delineate the bronchial anatomy without the potential artifacts or unnecessary radiation exposure from contrast agents. Incorrect Options: (A) Bronchography: Although bronchography was historically used to diagnose bronchiectasis, it is an invasive procedure that has largely been replaced by HRCT. It is less commonly performed today due to its invasiveness and the superior diagnostic capability of modern CT scans. (C) X-ray chest: A plain chest X-ray lacks the sensitivity and detail required to identify minimal bronchiectasis. It may show indirect signs in advanced cases, but early or subtle bronchiectatic changes are often missed on plain radiographs. (D) CT scan with contrast: While CT with contrast can be useful for evaluating vascular structures and other thoracic pathology, contrast is not necessary for visualizing the bronchial tree in cases of bronchiectasis. In fact, contrast can sometimes obscure the fine details of the bronchial walls, making a plain CT scan (especially HRCT) the preferred choice for diagnosing minimal bronchiectasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Optic nerve. On plain CT scans, particularly when bone windows are used, the optic nerve can be visualized as it courses through the optic canal. The surrounding bony structures of the orbit and skull help delineate its course, making it more readily identifiable on a CT scan compared to other cranial nerves. Incorrect Options: (B) Trigeminal nerve: The trigeminal nerve is a relatively large nerve, but its finer branches and soft tissue components are not well visualized on a plain CT scan. MRI is more suited to delineate its course through the cranial foramina and its intracranial path. (C) Facial nerve: The facial nerve runs through a complex course within the temporal bone. Its fine structure is difficult to appreciate on plain CT scans because it is surrounded by bony and soft tissue structures that can obscure its details. (D) Hypoglossal nerve: The hypoglossal nerve is also a small nerve that courses through the hypoglossal canal. Its soft tissue contrast is insufficient on plain CT scans, making it challenging to identify without the enhanced contrast provided by MRI.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyperdense biconvex lesion. In an acute extradural (epidural) hematoma, blood accumulates between the skull and the dura mater. On a CT scan, this blood appears hyperdense (bright) because of its high protein and iron content, and it typically forms a biconvex, lens-shaped collection that does not cross suture lines due to the tight adherence of the dura at the sutures. Incorrect Options: (A) Hypodense biconvex lesion: This is incorrect because an acute epidural hematoma is not hypodense; acute blood is hyperdense on CT. (C) Concavo convex hyperdense lesion: Although this option mentions a hyperdense lesion, the shape described (concavo convex) is more characteristic of a subdural hematoma, which is typically crescent-shaped and spreads over the brain surface. (D) Low attenuated biconvex lesion: This option is also incorrect because \"low attenuated\" implies the lesion is hypodense or less dense than expected, which does not match the appearance of an acute epidural hematoma.",

Ductal dilatation is more characteristic of chronic pancreatitis or conditions causing obstructive changes, rather than the acute inflammatory process. Incorrect Options: (B) Fuzzy outline of pancreas: In acute pancreatitis, the inflammatory process causes edema and peripancreatic inflammation, leading to a blurred or fuzzy outline of the pancreas on CT scans.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pancreas. CT scanning is particularly well-suited for imaging the pancreas due to its retroperitoneal location and the high spatial resolution and contrast differentiation that CT provides. The pancreas is often obscured on ultrasound by overlying bowel gas, making CT the modality of choice for evaluating pancreatic parenchymal diseases, inflammatory conditions (like acute pancreatitis), neoplasms, and complications associated with pancreatic pathology. Incorrect Options: (A) Liver: Although CT is excellent for evaluating liver lesions and parenchymal disease, the liver is more readily and effectively screened with a combination of ultrasound, MRI, and CT. It is not uniquely suited for CT imaging compared to the pancreas. (B) Gallbladder: The gallbladder is best assessed using ultrasound, which is highly sensitive for detecting gallstones, wall thickening, and cholecystitis. CT is used in complex cases but is not the primary modality for gallbladder evaluation. (D) Kidneys: CT is valuable for kidney imaging, especially for renal masses and trauma evaluation; however, ultrasound also plays an important role in initial assessment. The kidneys benefit from CT imaging, but their evaluation does not rely on CT to the same critical extent as the pancreas does.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) MRI. MRI is considered the best imaging modality for diagnosing intraosseous skeletal tumors due to its superior soft tissue contrast and excellent ability to evaluate bone marrow. It can accurately delineate the extent of marrow involvement, detect subtle changes in the bone structure, and assess any soft tissue extension of the tumor. This high sensitivity and specificity make MRI the gold standard for characterizing intraosseous lesions. Incorrect Options: (A) Plain X-ray: While plain X-rays are often the first imaging study performed for bone lesions, they have limited sensitivity in detecting early marrow changes or subtle intraosseous tumor involvement. X-rays may miss early or small lesions and cannot provide detailed soft tissue contrast. (C) CT scan: CT scans offer excellent spatial resolution and are very good at evaluating cortical bone and calcifications. However, they are less sensitive than MRI in detecting changes within the bone marrow and characterizing soft tissue involvement, which are critical for an accurate diagnosis of intraosseous tumors. (D) CT with scintiscan: CT combined with scintigraphy (or a CT scintiscan) can detect areas of increased metabolic activity but lacks the detailed soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This modality is useful for evaluating the metabolic activity of lesions but is less specific for detailed tumor characterization compared to MRI.",

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive lung disease that predominantly affects women of reproductive age, typically between 20 and 40 years old. It is not characteristically seen in postmenopausal women. The disease is marked by the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells, which can lead to cystic lung destruction and lymphatic abnormalities. Incorrect Options: (B) Recurrent chylous pleural effusions: In LAM, abnormal lymphatic drainage can lead to the accumulation of chyle (lymphatic fluid) in the pleural space, causing recurrent chylous effusions. This is a recognized feature of the disease. (C) Ascites: LAM can also affect abdominal lymphatics, resulting in ascites due to the leakage of lymphatic fluid into the peritoneal cavity.

Calcifications appear as hyperdense (bright) areas on CT images, which allows for their clear identification and assessment of their extent and pattern. Incorrect Options: (B) MRI: MRI is excellent for soft tissue contrast but is less sensitive to calcifications. Calcifications often appear as signal voids on MRI, which can be confused with other phenomena like blood flow or artifacts, making them less distinct compared to CT. (C) Ultrasound: Ultrasound is generally not used for intracranial imaging in adults due to the interference of the skull. While it may be used in neonates with open fontanelles, it is not the modality of choice for detecting calcifications in intracranial lesions. (D) Contrast study: A contrast study (whether CT or MRI with contrast) is used to enhance vascular structures or highlight lesion borders, but it does not specifically improve the detection of calcifications.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CT Angiography. CT Angiography (CTA) is the investigation of choice for diagnosing pulmonary embolism due to its high sensitivity and specificity in visualizing the pulmonary arterial tree. It allows for rapid, detailed imaging of the pulmonary vasculature to directly identify emboli, and it is widely available in emergency settings, making it the preferred method for acute PE diagnosis. Incorrect Options: (A) ECG: While an ECG may show non-specific changes (such as S1Q3T3 pattern, right axis deviation, or signs of right heart strain) in cases of pulmonary embolism, it is not diagnostic of PE. It serves more as an adjunct tool to raise suspicion rather than to confirm the diagnosis. (B) Perfusion scan: A perfusion scan (ventilation/perfusion scan) is a useful imaging technique, especially in patients with contraindications to contrast agents. However, its interpretation can be challenging and may yield non-diagnostic or indeterminate results. It is less commonly used as the first-line diagnostic tool compared to CT Angiography. (D) Plain X-ray: A plain chest X-ray is generally not sensitive for pulmonary embolism. It may be normal or show only non-specific findings, such as small infarcts or atelectasis, and thus cannot reliably confirm or exclude the diagnosis.",

CT scan not only confirms the diagnosis but also plays a crucial role in guiding clinical management and predicting patient prognosis. Incorrect Options: (B) Ultrasound: While ultrasound is often used as an initial imaging modality, especially to evaluate for biliary causes of pancreatitis, it is limited by interference from overlying bowel gas and a variable ability to visualize the pancreas clearly. Therefore, it is less reliable for assessing the full extent of pancreatic inflammation and complications. (C) MRI: MRI offers excellent soft tissue contrast and can provide detailed images of the pancreas without ionizing radiation. However, its availability, longer scanning times, and higher cost make it less practical as the first-line investigation in the acute setting of pancreatitis compared to CT scan.

It offers rapid acquisition of images with high spatial resolution, allowing for detailed visualization of the aortic wall, the intimal flap, and the true and false lumens. This makes CT angiography extremely useful in both the acute diagnosis and surgical planning of aortic dissection. Incorrect Options: (A) USC: Ultrasound (US) is generally not the investigation of choice for aortic dissection because it is operator-dependent and has limited ability to visualize the entire aorta, especially in the thoracic region. It is often used as an initial screening tool but lacks the comprehensive detail provided by CT. (C) MRI: While MRI is excellent for imaging the aorta and can clearly delineate the dissection, its use is limited in the acute setting due to longer acquisition times and reduced availability in emergency scenarios. It is typically reserved for patients with contraindications to CT contrast or for follow-up evaluations. (D) Digital segmental angiography: Digital angiography is invasive and carries higher risks. Although it was once considered a gold standard, it has been largely replaced by non-invasive methods such as CT angiography, which provides equally reliable diagnostic information with less risk and discomfort to the patient.",

In cases of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a non-contrast CT scan of the head is the investigation of choice because it rapidly and reliably detects blood in the subarachnoid space, particularly within the first 72 hours of hemorrhage. The CT scan is widely available, fast, and highly sensitive for acute blood, which appears as hyperdense (bright) areas in the basal cisterns and along the brain sulci. Incorrect Options: (A) MRI: Although MRI can detect subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially using specialized sequences, it is less practical in the acute setting due to longer acquisition times and lower sensitivity for hyperacute bleeding compared to CT. It is generally reserved for cases where CT findings are equivocal. (B) Enhanced MRI: Enhanced MRI, like standard MRI, is not the first-line imaging modality for acute SAH. The addition of contrast does not significantly improve the detection of acute blood, and the procedure is more time-consuming, making it less suitable for emergency diagnosis. (D) Angiography: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an invasive procedure primarily used to localize aneurysms or other vascular malformations after an SAH has been confirmed.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tuberculosis. In this 25-year-old man with a 2-month history of fever, cough, expectoration, and breathlessness, the CT findings are highly suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. The presence of bilateral upper lobe fibrotic lesions is typical for post-primary (reactivation) TB, which often affects the upper lobes due to higher oxygen tension. Additionally, the mediastinal lymphadenopathy with necrotic centers and peripheral rim enhancement is a classic radiological sign of tubercular lymphadenitis. Incorrect Options: (A) Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis usually presents with bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; however, the nodes in sarcoidosis are typically non-necrotic and show homogeneous enhancement, lacking the necrosis and rim enhancement seen in TB. Moreover, sarcoidosis does not commonly cause upper lobe fibrotic lesions in a young patient with these clinical symptoms. (C) Lymphoma: Lymphoma may present with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but the lymph nodes are generally bulky, homogeneous, and rarely necrotic with peripheral rim enhancement. The pattern of upper lobe fibrotic lesions is not typical of lymphoma, making it a less likely diagnosis in this clinical setting. (D) Silicosis: Silicosis is an occupational lung disease characterized by multiple small nodules, predominantly in the upper lobes, and may feature calcified (often \"eggshell\") lymph nodes. However, silicosis does not produce necrotic lymph nodes with rim enhancement, and the clinical presentation of fever and productive cough over two months is not characteristic of silicosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Computed tomography (CT). CT scanning is highly sensitive in detecting early renal tuberculosis. It can identify subtle parenchymal changes, such as focal calyceal irregularities, papillary necrosis, and early cortical scarring, which may be missed by other imaging modalities. CT also provides excellent spatial resolution and cross-sectional images that help delineate both intrarenal lesions and any perirenal or lymphatic involvement, making it the investigation of choice for early detection. Incorrect Options: (A) Intravenous urography (IVU): IVU is traditionally used to evaluate the morphology of the collecting system in renal tuberculosis, but it is less sensitive in the early stages of the disease. It primarily demonstrates changes in the calyceal outline and strictures, which occur later in the disease process. (C) Ultrasound: Ultrasound is useful for assessing kidney size and gross parenchymal abnormalities, but its ability to detect the fine details of early tubercular changes is limited. It may miss subtle parenchymal lesions and early calcifications compared to CT. (D) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Although MRI offers excellent soft tissue contrast, it is not as widely used as CT for the early diagnosis of renal tuberculosis due to higher cost, longer acquisition times, and less sensitivity in detecting small calcifications and subtle parenchymal changes.

Option (A) Chest X-ray: Chest X-rays use a very low dose of ionizing radiation and are designed for quick imaging of the chest. Their radiation dose is minimal compared to CT scanning.

Option (B) Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastomas are primarily pediatric tumors located in the cerebellum.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Non contrast CT scan of the abdomen. Non contrast CT (often referred to as CT KUB) is the gold standard for diagnosing ureteric stones because it has very high sensitivity and specificity. It can detect even small or radiolucent stones that may not be visible on plain X-ray and provides detailed images of the entire urinary tract, helping to assess the exact size, location, and any secondary complications such as hydronephrosis. Additionally, the absence of contrast avoids potential masking of the stones and eliminates the risk of contrast-related side effects. Option (A) X-ray KUB region: X-ray KUB is less sensitive because it only detects radio-opaque stones and many stones (especially uric acid stones) may be radiolucent, making them difficult to detect. Its overall diagnostic accuracy is inferior to CT. Option (B) Ultrasonogram: Ultrasound is radiation-free and useful in certain populations; however, its sensitivity is lower for ureteric stones, particularly in the mid-ureter due to interference from bowel gas and its operator dependency, resulting in a higher chance of missing small or less obvious stones. Option (D) Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen: While CT with contrast can provide excellent anatomical detail, the use of contrast can obscure the presence of stones by blending with the enhanced tissues. It is generally not preferred for stone detection as non contrast CT provides better visualization of calcifications without the interference of contrast enhancement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) High resolution CT scan. High resolution CT (HRCT) is the gold standard for detecting and characterizing interstitial lung disease because it provides detailed images of the lung parenchyma, allowing visualization of fine interstitial changes, such as ground-glass opacities, reticulations, and honeycombing. Its superior spatial resolution and ability to evaluate subtle lung abnormalities make it invaluable for both early detection and accurate characterization of the disease. Option (A) MRI: MRI is not preferred for interstitial lung disease because it lacks the spatial resolution required to detect the fine details of lung parenchymal changes, and its role in lung imaging is limited compared to HRCT. Option (B) Chest X-ray: While a chest X-ray is commonly used as an initial screening tool for lung disease, it is less sensitive and cannot adequately characterize the complex patterns seen in interstitial lung disease.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pulmonary arteriography. This investigation is considered the most definitive method for diagnosing pulmonary embolism because it directly visualizes the pulmonary arterial tree. By injecting contrast material into the pulmonary arteries, it provides detailed images that can reveal filling defects corresponding to emboli, thereby confirming the diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. Option (B) Radioisotope perfusion pulmonary scintigraphy: This test is commonly used as a screening tool and is less invasive, but it is not as definitive as pulmonary arteriography. While it can indicate areas of mismatched perfusion suggesting embolism, it does not directly visualize the emboli, making it less conclusive for a definitive diagnosis. Option (C) EKG: An EKG may show signs such as right heart strain or an S1Q3T3 pattern in cases of pulmonary embolism, but these findings are non-specific and can be seen in other conditions. It does not provide direct evidence of emboli in the pulmonary arteries, and thus is not definitive for diagnosis. Option (D) Venography: Venography is typically used to evaluate the deep veins of the lower extremities for thrombosis, which can be a source of emboli.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Periampullary carcinoma. Periampullary carcinoma refers to malignancies arising near the ampulla of Vater, including cancers of the pancreas (head), distal bile duct, duodenum, and ampulla of Vater itself. A key radiological finding in periampullary carcinoma is the \"double duct sign\", which refers to simultaneous dilation of the common bile duct (CBD) and the main pancreatic duct due to obstruction at the ampulla. The patient's symptoms of progressive obstructive jaundice and significant weight loss over two months suggest a malignant cause rather than a benign obstruction (such as a stone). In periampullary carcinoma, the pancreas itself may appear normal on imaging, as the tumor arises from the ampulla and not the pancreatic parenchyma. Incorrect Options: (A) Choledocholithiasis – Choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the CBD) can cause obstructive jaundice, but: It usually presents with intermittent jaundice and colicky abdominal pain, often accompanied by fever and chills if complicated by cholangitis. It typically does not cause dilation of the pancreatic duct, as stones usually obstruct only the bile duct. CT may show a hyperdense stone in the CBD, but weight loss is not a common feature. (B) Carcinoma of the Gallbladder – Gallbladder cancer can invade the biliary system and cause jaundice, but: It is usually associated with a mass in the gallbladder fossa, often infiltrating the liver. It does not typically cause pancreatic duct dilation. It often presents later with liver metastases and lymph node involvement. (C) Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin Tumor) Hilar cholangiocarcinoma affects the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts, leading to: Intrahepatic bile duct dilation without CBD dilation to the lower end. No pancreatic duct involvement. CT would typically show a hilar mass without distal ductal dilation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI). Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) is a severe traumatic brain injury that occurs due to shearing forces during rapid acceleration or deceleration, such as in a road traffic accident. This leads to widespread axonal damage, primarily affecting the white matter tracts of the brain. Key CT findings in DAI: Multiple small (spotty) hemorrhages in the white matter, especially in the corpus callosum, brainstem, and deep gray matter structures. Full basal cisterns, meaning there is no significant brainstem compression, but diffuse swelling may be present. Often, DAI is better visualized on MRI, as CT may miss non-hemorrhagic lesions. Clinical Features: Immediate and prolonged loss of consciousness (often leading to coma). Poor recovery with persistent neurological deficits. Minimal or absent mass effect on imaging despite severe clinical presentation. Incorrect Options: (A) Brain Contusion Brain contusions are localized hemorrhagic injuries due to direct impact and occur most commonly in the frontal and temporal lobes. CT typically shows patchy hemorrhagic areas with surrounding edema. Unlike DAI, contusions usually have more mass effect and may be associated with skull fractures. (C) Subdural Hematoma A subdural hematoma (SDH) results from rupture of bridging veins and leads to: A crescent-shaped hemorrhage along the convexity of the brain. It often causes midline shift and compressed basal cisterns (which are not seen in this case). It may cause a lucid interval, which is not characteristic of DAI. (D) Multiple Infarcts Multiple infarcts suggest vascular causes such as embolism or vasculitis. Infarcts typically appear as hypodense (low attenuation) areas on CT rather than hemorrhagic lesions. They would follow a vascular distribution rather than the diffuse pattern seen in DAI.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CT Scan. Computed Tomography (CT) is the best investigation for temporal bone fractures because it provides high-resolution images of bony structures. Temporal bone fractures are usually caused by high-impact head trauma, such as from road traffic accidents, falls, or assaults. Why CT is the best choice? High-resolution imaging of bone – CT, particularly high-resolution CT (HRCT), provides detailed views of the fine bony anatomy of the temporal bone. Detects subtle fractures – Even small, non-displaced fractures can be seen on CT, which may be missed on X-ray. Identifies complications – Temporal bone fractures can involve the middle ear, inner ear, mastoid air cells, and the facial nerve canal, which CT can assess effectively. Quick and widely available – Ideal for trauma settings where rapid diagnosis is crucial. Incorrect Options: (B) MRI MRI is excellent for soft tissue evaluation, such as nerve damage, brain injury, and fluid collection. However, it is not good for visualizing fractures since bones do not produce a strong MRI signal. MRI may be useful for assessing associated complications (e.g., facial nerve injury, cerebrospinal fluid leaks) but not for diagnosing the fracture itself. (C) X-ray X-rays are not sensitive enough to detect fine fractures of the temporal bone. Overlapping skull bones can obscure fractures, making diagnosis difficult. X-rays have largely been replaced by CT for evaluating temporal bone injuries. (D) Ultrasound Ultrasound is useful for soft tissue injuries, but it cannot penetrate bone to assess fractures. Not suitable for deep structures like the middle or inner ear. It has no role in diagnosing temporal bone fractures.",

Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a benign cystic tumor that often presents as a spongy mass with a characteristic \"sunburst\" pattern of central calcification on CT imaging. The \"sunburst\" appearance refers to the central stellate calcifications that radiate outward, which is highly suggestive of serous cystadenoma. This tumor is composed of multiple small cysts and has a honeycomb-like structure, distinguishing it from other pancreatic neoplasms. Incorrect Options: (A) Mucinous cystadenoma/carcinoma Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) are usually large, unilocular or multilocular cystic masses with thick walls and internal septations. They do not show the characteristic central \"sunburst\" calcification seen in serous cystadenomas. Instead, MCNs may have peripheral calcifications and are typically found in the body or tail of the pancreas. (C) Somatostatinoma Somatostatinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas or duodenum.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA). Multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) is the gold standard and the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE), especially in high-risk cases. It provides detailed visualization of pulmonary arteries and can directly detect filling defects caused by emboli. MDCTA is rapid, widely available, and non-invasive, making it the first-line investigation for suspected PE. Incorrect Options: (B) Catheter angiography Pulmonary catheter angiography was previously the gold standard but is now rarely used due to its invasive nature and the availability of MDCTA, which provides similar diagnostic accuracy with lower risk. (C) D-dimer D-dimer is a blood test that detects fibrin degradation products, which are elevated in conditions involving thrombosis. While a negative D-dimer test can rule out PE in low-risk patients, it is not diagnostic in high-risk cases because it can be elevated due to many other conditions (e.g., infections, malignancies, trauma). (D) Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan A V/Q scan can suggest PE by showing mismatched perfusion defects (normal ventilation but abnormal perfusion). However, it is less sensitive and specific than MDCTA and is usually reserved for patients with contraindications to contrast agents (e.g., kidney disease or allergy).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anaphylactoid reactions. Radiocontrast reactions are mostly anaphylactoid, meaning they mimic anaphylaxis but are not mediated by IgE antibodies. Unlike true IgE-mediated allergic reactions, which require prior sensitization, anaphylactoid reactions can occur on first exposure to contrast agents. These reactions result from direct activation of mast cells and basophils, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, causing symptoms like flushing, urticaria, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Modern low-osmolar and iso-osmolar contrast media have significantly reduced the risk of severe anaphylactoid reactions, but premedication with steroids and antihistamines is often recommended for high-risk patients. Incorrect Options: (B) IgE-Mediated Reactions IgE-mediated allergic reactions require prior sensitization and involve the classic Type I hypersensitivity response (e.g., food allergies, insect stings). Radiocontrast reactions do not involve IgE antibodies, so they are not true allergic reactions. (C) Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions Delayed hypersensitivity reactions (Type IV hypersensitivity) involve T-cell activation and typically occur hours to days after exposure. They manifest as skin rashes, contact dermatitis, or nephrotoxicity, but they are not the primary mechanism behind most radiocontrast reactions. (D) Immune Complex Mediated Reactions Immune complex-mediated reactions (Type III hypersensitivity) involve antigen-antibody complexes, which cause inflammation in tissues (e.g., serum sickness, lupus nephritis). Radiocontrast reactions do not involve immune complex formation.",

A vascular ring is a congenital anomaly where abnormal development of the aortic arch and its branches creates a complete or partial ring around the trachea and esophagus, leading to airway compression and swallowing difficulties. CT angiography (CTA) is the investigation of choice because it provides high-resolution 3D images of vascular structures, airway compression, and associated anomalies. It is quick, widely available, and non-invasive, making it the preferred modality in symptomatic patients. Incorrect Options: (A) PET (Positron Emission Tomography) PET scans are primarily used for metabolic imaging, such as detecting malignancies or infections. Vascular rings are structural anomalies, and PET does not provide sufficient anatomical detail for diagnosis. (C) MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI can provide excellent soft tissue contrast and vascular imaging (MR angiography), but it is time-consuming, expensive, and requires sedation in young children. While it can be used in some cases, CT is faster and preferred for initial evaluation. (D) Catheter-Directed Angiography Angiography is invasive and rarely needed for diagnosing vascular rings.

Slip ring technology is an essential advancement in Computed Tomography (CT) scanners, allowing continuous rotation of the X-ray tube and detectors around the patient without the need for cables to rewind.

The slip ring transmits power and data signals between stationary and rotating parts of the scanner, eliminating the need for start-stop motion seen in early CT designs. Incorrect Options: (B) MRI MRI uses radiofrequency (RF) pulses and powerful magnets to generate images. It does not involve X-ray tubes or rotating components like CT, so slip ring technology is not needed. (C) USG (Ultrasound) Ultrasound imaging relies on high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs. There is no rotating X-ray tube or need for continuous electrical transmission, making slip rings unnecessary.

Since acute hemorrhage appears hyperdense (bright white) on NCCT, contrast is not needed for initial assessment. Incorrect Options: (A) CECT head (Contrast-Enhanced CT) CECT is not the first-line for acute head injury because contrast can obscure acute hemorrhages. It is mainly used for tumors, infections, or vascular lesions (like aneurysms or AV malformations) rather than trauma. (C) MRI head MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting diffuse axonal injury (DAI), brainstem injuries, and small contusions, but it is not preferred in acute trauma due to its longer scan time and limited availability in emergency settings. MRI is not ideal for detecting acute hemorrhages and skull fractures compared to NCCT. (D) Ultrasound Ultrasound is not used for evaluating head injuries in adults as the skull blocks ultrasound waves. It is only useful in neonates (through the open fontanelles) to assess intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography). HRCT is considered the gold standard for diagnosing bronchiectasis because it provides detailed imaging of the airways and can accurately detect the characteristic findings such as: Bronchial dilation (broncho-arterial ratio >1) Lack of bronchial tapering Bronchial wall thickening Cystic changes and mucus plugging HRCT is non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific, making it the preferred imaging modality for confirming bronchiectasis. Incorrect Options: (B) Bronchoscopy and biopsy Bronchoscopy is useful for identifying underlying causes of bronchiectasis (e.g., foreign body, tumors, or infections) but cannot provide a definitive diagnosis based on imaging findings. A biopsy is not necessary to diagnose bronchiectasis. (C) MRI MRI is not the first-line for bronchiectasis because it has lower spatial resolution than HRCT for evaluating the bronchial tree. MRI is more useful for vascular and soft tissue abnormalities, not for detailed airway imaging.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) FDG-18 PET CT (Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography). FDG-18 PET CT is the best non-invasive investigation to assess myocardial viability because it detects metabolically active but dysfunctional myocardium (hibernating myocardium) that has the potential for recovery after revascularization. FDG-18 PET uses glucose metabolism as a marker for viability since viable myocardial cells still take up glucose despite being dysfunctional. It can differentiate between viable, stunned, hibernating, and non-viable myocardium, making it the most accurate test for viability assessment. Incorrect Options: (A) Echocardiogram Echocardiography (Dobutamine Stress Echo) can assess myocardial contractile reserve, which helps in viability assessment, but it is less sensitive than FDG PET. It mainly evaluates wall motion abnormalities but cannot differentiate viable from non-viable tissue with high accuracy. (C) MIBI scintigraphy Technetium-99m Sestamibi (MIBI) scan assesses myocardial perfusion, not metabolism. It is useful for detecting ischemia but less accurate for assessing myocardial viability compared to PET. (D) Thallium scintigraphy Thallium-201 scan is another nuclear imaging technique for myocardial perfusion, but it has lower resolution than FDG PET. While it can indicate viability based on redistribution patterns, FDG PET is more sensitive and specific for assessing viable myocardium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) CECT (Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography). CECT is the best radiological investigation for detecting insulinoma, a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that secretes insulin. CECT provides high-resolution imaging of the pancreas, allowing for precise localization of the tumor. Insulinomas are typically small (less than 2 cm) and hypervascular, which makes them easily identifiable in the arterial phase of contrast-enhanced imaging. CECT helps assess tumor size, location, vascularity, and potential metastases. Incorrect Options: (A) PET FDG-PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography) is useful for detecting high-grade neuroendocrine tumors, but insulinomas are often well-differentiated and slow-growing, making them less FDG-avid. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT is useful for metastatic insulinomas but not the first-line imaging for initial diagnosis. (C) MRI MRI is useful for soft tissue contrast, but it is less sensitive than CECT for detecting small pancreatic tumors. It can be used if CECT is inconclusive, especially in patients with renal impairment (to avoid contrast nephropathy). (D) Radionuclide Scan Radionuclide imaging (e.g., Octreotide Scan / Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy) is used for neuroendocrine tumors with somatostatin receptors, but most insulinomas do not express these receptors strongly, making it less useful for primary diagnosis. It is more useful for detecting metastases in malignant insulinomas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by Clostridioides difficile infection, leading to inflammation of the colon. The characteristic CT finding associated with it is the “accordion sign” or “thumbprinting”, which occurs due to marked colonic wall thickening and the presence of submucosal edema or hemorrhage. The accordion sign appears when oral contrast material is trapped between the thickened folds of the colon, resembling an accordion. Other CT findings include diffuse colonic wall thickening, pericolonic fat stranding, and possible toxic megacolon in severe cases. Incorrect Options: (B) Crohn's disease Crohn's disease shows asymmetric thickening of the bowel wall with a cobblestone appearance, skip lesions, and strictures rather than the uniform thickening seen in pseudomembranous colitis. It commonly affects the ileum and colon but does not present with the accordion sign. (C) Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis causes continuous, diffuse mucosal inflammation, beginning in the rectum and spreading proximally. CT findings include lead pipe colon (loss of haustration) and mucosal enhancement, but not the accordion sign seen in pseudomembranous colitis. (D) Intussusception Intussusception appears as the \"target sign\" or \"sausage-shaped mass\" on CT due to the telescoping of bowel loops. It does not cause the accordion sign characteristic of pseudomembranous colitis",

Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas in various organs, including the brain, skin, kidneys, and heart. It commonly presents with: Seizures (often drug-resistant or intractable) Intellectual disability Skin manifestations (ash leaf spots, shagreen patches, facial angiofibromas) Characteristic CT findings in Tuberous Sclerosis: Subependymal nodules (along the walls of the lateral ventricles) Cortical tubers (leading to seizures) Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), which can cause obstructive hydrocephalus These findings strongly support tuberous sclerosis as the most probable diagnosis. Incorrect Options: (A) Sturge-Weber Syndrome Sturge-Weber syndrome is characterized by a port-wine stain on the face and leptomeningeal angiomatosis. CT scan shows tram-track calcifications in the affected hemisphere, but subependymal nodules (seen in TS) are not a feature. (B) Neurofibromatosis Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) primarily presents with optic gliomas, café-au-lait spots, and neurofibromas. NF2 presents with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which are best seen on MRI, not CT.
