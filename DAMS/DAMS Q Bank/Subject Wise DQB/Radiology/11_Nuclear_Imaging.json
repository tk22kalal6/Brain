      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Quantity of radionuclide disintegrating per second The Curie (Ci) is a unit of radioactivity that measures the rate of radioactive decay of a substance. Specifically, 1 Curie (Ci) is defined as 3.7 × 1010 disintegrations per second, which corresponds to the decay rate of 1 gram of radium-226. It is a measure of the amount of radioactive material present, not the radiation dose absorbed by a person. Incorrect Options: (A) Exposure: Exposure refers to the amount of ionizing radiation in the air and is measured in Roentgens (R), not Curie. It quantifies the ability of radiation to ionize air molecules, rather than the decay rate of a radioactive substance. (B) Absorbed Dose: The absorbed dose is the amount of energy deposited by radiation per unit mass of tissue and is measured in Gray (Gy) or Rad. Unlike the Curie, which measures radioactivity, Gray or Rad measures the biological impact of radiation exposure. (C) Degree of Potential Danger to Health: The biological risk of radiation exposure is assessed using Sievert (Sv) or Rem, which account for radiation type and its effect on tissues. Curie does not indicate the health risk; rather, higher Curie values only mean higher radioactivity, not necessarily greater biological harm.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Malignant Melanoma Malignant melanoma is considered one of the least sensitive tumors to radiation therapy. This is because melanoma cells have efficient DNA repair mechanisms, a low proportion of cells in the radiosensitive G2/M phase, and a high capacity for repopulation after radiation exposure. As a result, radiotherapy is not the primary treatment modality for melanoma. Instead, surgical excision is the preferred approach, with immunotherapy and targeted therapy playing key roles in advanced cases. However, in certain scenarios, such as brain metastases, melanoma may be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Incorrect Options: (A) Bronchogenic Carcinoma: • Lung cancers, including bronchogenic carcinoma, are moderately sensitive to radiation. • Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly radiosensitive, while non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has variable sensitivity to radiation but still responds better than melanoma. • Radiation therapy is commonly used as primary treatment for inoperable cases and for palliative therapy in advanced disease. (B) Adenocarcinoma of Colon: • Colorectal adenocarcinoma is moderately radioresponsive, but not as sensitive as lung cancer. • Radiation therapy is used in rectal cancer before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) to shrink tumors and improve surgical outcomes. • It is less commonly used in colon cancer, where surgery and chemotherapy are the mainstays of treatment. (D) Osteogenic Sarcoma: • Osteosarcoma is generally considered radioresistant, but it is still more responsive to radiation than malignant melanoma. • It has a high capacity for DNA repair, making conventional radiotherapy less effective, but high-dose radiation (such as proton therapy) may be beneficial in some cases. • Surgery (limb-sparing or amputation) and chemotherapy remain the primary treatments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Artificial Radioisotope Cobalt-60 (Co-60) is an artificial radioisotope, meaning it does not occur naturally and is instead produced in nuclear reactors. It is created by bombarding stable cobalt-59 (Co-59) with neutrons, typically in a nuclear reactor. This neutron activation transforms Co-59 into Co-60, which is radioactive. Cobalt-60 emits gamma rays and is widely used in radiotherapy for cancer treatment (external beam radiotherapy), sterilization of medical equipment, and industrial radiography. Incorrect Options: (A) Naturally Occurring Radioisotope: Incorrect because cobalt-60 does not occur naturally in significant amounts. Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes include uranium-238, thorium-232, and radon-222, but Co-60 is produced artificially. (C) Product of Plutonium: Incorrect as cobalt-60 is not derived from plutonium. Plutonium isotopes, such as plutonium-239 (Pu-239), are used in nuclear reactors and weapons but do not contribute to cobalt-60 production. (D) Product of Uranium: Incorrect because uranium decay does not produce cobalt-60. While uranium-235 (U-235) is used in nuclear fission reactors, Co-60 is made by neutron irradiation of cobalt-59, not by uranium decay.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Osteogenic Sarcoma Radium paint exposure is associated with an increased risk of osteogenic sarcoma (bone cancer). This is because radium, a radioactive element, behaves similarly to calcium in the body and gets deposited in the bones when ingested or inhaled. Over time, the continuous emission of alpha particles from radium leads to radiation-induced damage to bone cells, resulting in osteogenic sarcoma. This condition was notably observed in the \"Radium Girls\", workers who applied radium-based luminous paint to watch dials and later developed bone cancers due to prolonged exposure. Incorrect Options: (A) Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Incorrect because radium exposure primarily affects the bones, not the skin or mucosal surfaces where squamous cell carcinoma typically arises. Squamous cell carcinoma is more commonly associated with chronic sun exposure, chemical carcinogens, and radiation affecting the skin. (C) Rodent Ulcer: Incorrect because rodent ulcer refers to an aggressive form of basal cell carcinoma, which is linked to chronic sun exposure rather than radium exposure. While radium exposure can cause radiation burns, it does not specifically lead to rodent ulcers. (D) Adenocarcinoma of Stomach: Incorrect because radium paint does not directly cause stomach cancer. Although ingestion of radium can lead to radiation damage in the digestive tract, stomach adenocarcinoma is more commonly linked to Helicobacter pylori infection, dietary factors, and smoking.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Protons and Neutrons The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons, collectively known as nucleons. Protons are positively charged, while neutrons have no charge. These particles are held together by the strong nuclear force, which is one of the fundamental forces in nature. The number of protons determines the atomic number, which defines the element, while the sum of protons and neutrons determines the atomic mass. Neutrons help stabilize the nucleus by reducing electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons. Incorrect Options: (A) Electrons: Incorrect because electrons are found outside the nucleus in specific energy levels or orbitals. Electrons are negatively charged particles and play a crucial role in chemical bonding and reactions, but they do not contribute to the mass of the nucleus. (B) Only Protons: Incorrect because while protons are present in the nucleus, neutrons are also essential for nuclear stability. If the nucleus contained only protons, the repulsive forces between them would cause the nucleus to break apart. Neutrons help counteract this repulsion and provide stability. (C) Electrons and Protons: Incorrect because electrons are not part of the nucleus; they orbit around the nucleus in electron shells. The nucleus is solely composed of protons and neutrons, while electrons remain in motion around it.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Number Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same atomic number (number of protons) but different atomic masses (due to a different number of neutrons). Since the atomic number is defined by the number of protons, all isotopes of an element have the same atomic number. However, their atomic weight (mass number) varies because of differences in the number of neutrons. For example: Carbon-12 (12C) and Carbon-14 (14C) are both isotopes of carbon. They both have 6 protons (same atomic number) but differ in the number of neutrons (Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons). Incorrect Options: (B) Weight: Incorrect because isotopes have different atomic weights (mass numbers) due to variations in the number of neutrons. Example: Hydrogen isotopes—Protium (1H), Deuterium (2H), and Tritium (3H)—all have the same atomic number (1) but different atomic masses (1, 2, and 3 respectively). (C) Both weight and number: Incorrect because isotopes have the same atomic number but different atomic masses. If isotopes had both the same atomic number and atomic weight, they would not be considered isotopes but rather identical atoms of the same element. (D) Both weight and number: Incorrect for the same reason as option (C). Isotopes by definition have varying mass numbers due to differences in the number of neutrons.",

The atomic weight is approximately equal to the total mass of the nucleus, as protons and neutrons are the two primary contributors to an atom’s mass. Electrons have a negligible mass compared to protons and neutrons and do not significantly contribute to the atomic weight.

The atomic number represents only the number of protons, while the atomic weight includes both protons and neutrons. (C) Protons and Electrons: Incorrect because electrons have almost no mass compared to protons and neutrons, so they do not significantly contribute to the atomic weight.

It was historically used for myelography but was later discontinued due to its long retention in the body and potential complications like arachnoiditis. Unlike water-soluble contrast agents, oil-based contrast does not mix well with bodily fluids and remains in the spinal canal for an extended period, which can lead to serious inflammatory reactions. Incorrect Options: (A) Metrizamide: Incorrect because Metrizamide is a water-soluble, non-ionic contrast agent used for imaging procedures such as myelography and CT scans. It dissolves in water, allowing for better clearance from the body and reduced risk of long-term complications compared to oil-based dyes. (B) Iohexol: Incorrect because Iohexol is another water-soluble, non-ionic contrast medium commonly used in CT scans, angiography, and myelography. It has low toxicity and is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, making it safer for imaging studies. (C) Conray 420: Incorrect because Conray 420 (Iothalamate meglumine) is a water-soluble, ionic contrast agent used in radiographic procedures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 5.2 years Cobalt-60 (Co-60) has a half-life of approximately 5.27 years. This means that it takes about 5.2 years for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample of Co-60 to decay. Co-60 is widely used in radiotherapy, industrial radiography, and sterilization of medical equipment due to its high-energy gamma radiation. Its relatively short half-life makes it effective for medical and industrial applications while ensuring a manageable decay period. Incorrect Options: (A) 2.6 years: Incorrect because Co-60 has a longer half-life than 2.6 years. A shorter half-life would require more frequent replenishment in radiation therapy and industrial applications, making it less practical. (C) 8 years: Incorrect because Co-60 decays faster than 8 years. If its half-life were 8 years, it would take longer to lose its radioactivity, altering its effectiveness in various applications. (D) 3200 years: Incorrect because a half-life of 3200 years is characteristic of long-lived radionuclides like Uranium-238, not Co-60. A very long half-life would mean Co-60 remains radioactive for millennia, making it less suitable for controlled use in radiation therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cobalt Cobalt-60 (Co-60) is a major source of gamma rays. It is a radioactive isotope that emits high-energy gamma radiation during its decay process. Co-60 is widely used in radiotherapy, industrial radiography, and sterilization of medical equipment due to its powerful and penetrating gamma radiation. The gamma rays from Co-60 are highly energetic and are effectively used for treating deep-seated tumors in radiation therapy. Incorrect Options: (A) Radium: Incorrect because although Radium-226 is a radioactive element that emits alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, it is not a primary source of gamma rays like Co-60. Radium was historically used in cancer treatment but has largely been replaced by safer, more controllable sources like Co-60. (C) Cesium: Incorrect because Cesium-137 emits gamma radiation, but it is primarily used in industrial applications such as gauging and measuring devices, rather than as a major gamma source in medical treatments like Co-60. (D) Xenon: Incorrect because Xenon is a noble gas and does not naturally emit gamma radiation. Some isotopes of xenon can be radioactive, but they are not significant sources of gamma rays for medical or industrial use.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gamma radiation Cobalt-60 (Co-60) primarily emits gamma radiation, making it widely used in radiotherapy, industrial radiography, and sterilization. Co-60 is an artificial radioisotope produced by neutron activation of stable Cobalt-59 in a nuclear reactor. It undergoes beta decay, transforming into Nickel-60 (Ni-60), which then emits high-energy gamma rays (1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV). The penetrating ability of gamma radiation makes Co-60 highly effective for radiotherapy (cancer treatment) and industrial applications like non-destructive testing. Incorrect Options: (B) Beta radiation: Incorrect because Co-60 does emit beta particles, but the primary radiation used for therapeutic and industrial purposes is gamma radiation. The beta particles are of lower energy and have limited penetration. (C) Alpha and Beta radiation: Incorrect because Co-60 does not emit alpha particles. Alpha radiation is produced by heavy elements like uranium and radium, not cobalt-60. (D) Alpha and Gamma radiation: Incorrect because Co-60 does not emit alpha particles. While it does emit gamma radiation, alpha radiation is not a characteristic emission of this isotope.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Perfusion defect with normal ventilation • In pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan typically shows a perfusion defect with normal ventilation. • Pulmonary thromboembolism occurs when a blood clot blocks a pulmonary artery, leading to decreased blood flow (perfusion defect). • However, the airways remain open, so ventilation remains normal over the affected lung region. • This mismatch between normal ventilation and impaired perfusion is a classic finding of PTE and is described as a \"mismatched defect\" on a V/Q scan. Incorrect Options: (A) Ventilation defect with normal perfusion: Incorrect because ventilation defects are typically seen in airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rather than PTE. In PTE, perfusion is affected, not ventilation. (C) Perfusion defect with ventilation defect: Incorrect because while both ventilation and perfusion can be impaired in conditions like pneumonia or lung collapse, pulmonary embolism typically affects only perfusion with normal ventilation. (D) Normal perfusion and ventilation: Incorrect because a normal V/Q scan essentially rules out significant PTE. If there is a thromboembolism, a perfusion defect should be present.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Arachnoiditis The most serious complication of a myelogram is arachnoiditis, which is inflammation of the arachnoid mater, one of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. • Arachnoiditis can be caused by irritation from contrast media, infection, or trauma during the procedure. • It may lead to chronic pain, neurological deficits, and even permanent disability in severe cases. • Symptoms include severe back pain, leg weakness, numbness, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. • Although rare, this is the most serious long-term complication of myelography. Incorrect Options: (A) Allergy: Incorrect because while allergic reactions to contrast media can occur, they are typically manageable with antihistamines or steroids and are not as serious as arachnoiditis. Severe anaphylaxis is rare with modern non-ionic contrast agents. (B) Transient Neurological Deficit: Incorrect because temporary neurological symptoms like tingling, weakness, or dizziness can happen due to irritation from the contrast agent, but these usually resolve within a short period. It is not as severe or long-lasting as arachnoiditis. (C) Headache: Incorrect because headaches are a common but minor complication, usually caused by CSF leakage after lumbar puncture. They are temporary and improve with hydration and bed rest, unlike arachnoiditis, which can cause permanent neurological damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Relation of transducer to blood flow In color Doppler imaging, the color displayed depends on the direction and velocity of blood flow relative to the transducer. Red color typically indicates blood flow towards the transducer, while blue color indicates flow away from it. The color does not represent oxygenation but rather the shift in frequency (Doppler effect) caused by the moving blood cells. The angle of insonation (angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow) significantly affects the Doppler shift, thereby altering the color representation. Incorrect Options: (A) Strength of returning echo: Incorrect because the strength (amplitude) of the returning echo determines brightness in grayscale ultrasound but does not influence color in Doppler imaging. Doppler effect is based on frequency shift, not amplitude. (C) Frequency of Doppler used: Incorrect because while different Doppler frequencies affect resolution and penetration depth, they do not directly determine the color displayed. Color Doppler is based on relative motion of blood, not the absolute frequency of the transducer. (D) Type of Doppler machine used: Incorrect because although different machines may have variations in color mapping, the principle remains the same: color representation depends on the direction of blood flow relative to the transducer.",

(C) 1901: Incorrect because by 1901, radioactivity had already been discovered and studied by Becquerel and the Curies. However, 1901 is notable for Wilhelm Roentgen, who received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of X-rays in 1895, which are related to but distinct from radioactivity.

In fluoroscopy, calcified plaques in the aorta show a side-to-side movement with each heartbeat. This occurs because the aorta expands laterally (sideways) during systole due to the pulse pressure wave. This characteristic movement helps differentiate aortic calcifications from other vascular or soft tissue calcifications. Incorrect Options: (B) Up and down movement: Incorrect because the aorta does not significantly move in an up-and-down direction with each heartbeat. The pulsatile nature of blood flow causes lateral expansion, not vertical displacement. (C) Combined movement: Incorrect because while some minor movement in multiple directions might be present due to overall cardiac motion, the dominant movement is side-to-side due to the force of blood flow and arterial compliance. (D) None: Incorrect because fluoroscopy does show characteristic movement of calcified plaques in the aorta, making it a useful diagnostic tool for aortic calcification. Conclusion:",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 8 days The half-life of Iodine-131 (I-131) is 8 days. This means that every 8 days, the radioactive material decays to half of its previous amount. I-131 is a commonly used radioisotope in medical applications, especially for the treatment of thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Its beta and gamma emissions make it effective for both diagnostic imaging and therapeutic purposes. The 8-day half-life allows it to remain active long enough to be therapeutically useful while eventually decaying to safer levels. Incorrect Options: (A) 8 hours Incorrect because I-131 has a much longer half-life (8 days), whereas an 8-hour half-life would be too short for effective clinical use. (B) 2 days Incorrect since I-131 persists much longer in the body, allowing for sustained therapeutic effects. A 2-day half-life would limit its usefulness in treatment. (C) 5.2 days Incorrect as the half-life of I-131 is longer than 5.2 days. This value may be confused with other isotopes, but I-131 specifically has an 8-day half-life. (E) 12 days Incorrect because I-131 decays faster than 12 days, reducing to half in 8 days. A longer half-life would alter its dosing and radiation safety protocols.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tc-99m Pyrophosphate Scan The Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) Pyrophosphate scan is used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by detecting areas of myocardial necrosis. In an infarcted area, calcium is deposited in the damaged heart muscle, and Tc-99m pyrophosphate binds to these calcium deposits, creating a hot spot on the scan. This technique is particularly useful in detecting recent infarctions (within 1 week) and in cases where electrocardiograms (ECG) and cardiac enzymes are inconclusive. It helps differentiate ischemic but viable myocardium from necrotic tissue. Incorrect Options: (A) Thallium-201 Scan Incorrect because Thallium-201 is a perfusion agent, not a necrosis marker. It is used to evaluate myocardial blood flow and viability rather than identifying infarcted tissue. In AMI, the affected area appears as a cold spot (decreased uptake), not a hot spot. (C) Strontium-90 Scan Incorrect because Strontium-90 is not used for myocardial imaging. It is a radioactive isotope associated with radiation therapy rather than diagnostic imaging for myocardial infarction. (D) Iodine-127 Scan Incorrect because Iodine-127 is not used in cardiac imaging. Iodine-based isotopes are mainly utilized for thyroid imaging and therapy, not myocardial infarction detection",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lead Radiation protection shields are primarily made of lead (C) because of its high density and atomic number, which make it highly effective at absorbing and attenuating radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma rays. The dense structure of lead allows it to absorb and scatter high-energy radiation, preventing it from penetrating and reaching sensitive areas. This is why lead is widely used in medical imaging, nuclear power plants, and other radiation-sensitive environments. Additionally, lead is cost-effective and can be easily molded into various shielding structures, such as aprons, walls, and containers, making it the preferred choice for radiation protection. Incorrect Options: Copper (A): While copper is a good conductor of electricity and heat, it is not as effective as lead in blocking radiation. Its atomic number (29) and density are lower than lead, meaning it does not provide sufficient attenuation for high-energy radiation like X-rays and gamma rays. Copper is sometimes used in electromagnetic shielding but not for radiation protection. Silver (B): Silver has a relatively high atomic number (47) and good conductivity, but it is not commonly used for radiation shielding because it is expensive and less effective than lead in attenuating radiation. While silver can reflect some types of radiation, it does not provide adequate absorption for high-energy radiation. Tin (D): Tin has a lower atomic number (50) than lead (82) and is less dense, making it less effective in blocking radiation. While tin is used in some radiation shielding applications, such as lead-tin alloys, it does not provide the same level of protection as pure lead. Tin is more commonly used for soldering and coating materials rather than primary radiation shielding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aorta because the right border of the heart in a chest X-ray is primarily formed by structures located on the right side of the heart, including the superior vena cava (SVC), right atrium, and inferior vena cava (IVC). The aorta, however, is primarily located centrally and to the left, forming part of the left border of the heart rather than the right. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are visible in chest X-rays, but they do not contribute to the right heart border. Incorrect Options: Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) (A): The IVC is a major vein returning blood from the lower body to the right atrium. In a chest X-ray, the IVC contributes to the lower right border of the heart as it approaches and enters the right atrium. Superior Vena Cava (SVC) (B): The SVC carries blood from the upper body to the right atrium. It contributes to the upper portion of the right heart border on a chest X-ray, appearing as a vertical structure above the right atrium. Right Atrium (C): The right atrium is the main chamber forming the middle and lower part of the right heart border. Since it is the largest right-sided chamber, it plays a crucial role in defining the right outline of the heart in an X-ray.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Erythema because the first visible sign after radiation therapy (radiation Rx) is typically skin redness or erythema. This occurs due to inflammation and increased blood flow to the affected area as a response to radiation-induced damage to the skin and underlying tissues. Erythema usually appears within hours to days after exposure, depending on the dose and duration of radiation. It is a common early reaction and serves as an indication that the skin has been affected by radiation. The severity of erythema can vary from mild redness to more intense irritation, and it may progress to more severe skin reactions with continued radiation exposure. Incorrect Options: Necrosis (B): Necrosis, or tissue death, is a late effect of radiation exposure rather than an immediate response. It occurs when radiation causes severe damage to cells, leading to irreversible destruction and loss of tissue. Necrosis typically develops after prolonged or high-dose radiation exposure, often weeks to months later. Burns (C): Radiation burns, also known as moist desquamation, occur at higher radiation doses and are a later reaction rather than the first sign. These burns can result in blistering, peeling, and significant skin damage, but they do not appear as the first sign of radiation exposure. Instead, erythema precedes radiation burns. Deep Ulcer (D): Deep ulcers are a late-stage complication of radiation-induced skin damage, often occurring after repeated radiation therapy sessions or excessive exposure. They result from chronic tissue injury, impaired healing, and poor blood supply to the affected area. Since ulcers develop after prolonged radiation damage, they are not the first sign of radiation therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anaplastic carcinoma because tumors with high mitotic activity and poor differentiation tend to be more radiosensitive. Anaplastic carcinoma consists of undifferentiated cells that divide rapidly, making them more susceptible to radiation-induced DNA damage. Radiation therapy is most effective against cells that are actively dividing, and since anaplastic carcinoma lacks structural organization and differentiation, its cells are highly proliferative and thus more responsive to radiation treatment. Incorrect Options: Poorly Differentiated Carcinoma (A): While poorly differentiated carcinomas are more radiosensitive than well-differentiated tumors, they are generally not as responsive as anaplastic carcinomas. Poor differentiation means that the tumor cells retain some structural features but still divide at a relatively high rate, making them moderately responsive to radiation therapy. Well Differentiated Carcinoma (C): Well-differentiated tumors are the least responsive to radiation because their cells closely resemble normal cells and divide at a much slower rate. Radiation is less effective against these tumors since they have a lower mitotic index and better repair mechanisms for DNA damage. B and C (D): This option is incorrect because, while anaplastic carcinoma (B) is highly responsive to radiation, well-differentiated carcinoma (C) is not. Since the two have opposite responses to radiation therapy, grouping them together makes this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Seminoma because seminomas are highly radiosensitive tumors. Seminomas are a type of germ cell tumor that tends to remain localized for a longer period and respond well to radiation therapy. Their cells are relatively uniform, and they have a slower rate of metastasis compared to other testicular cancers, making them an ideal target for radiation treatment. Radiation therapy is often used after orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicle) to eliminate any remaining cancer cells, particularly in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Due to their radiosensitivity, seminomas have excellent treatment outcomes with radiation, with high cure rates. Incorrect Options: Teratoma (A): Teratomas are generally resistant to radiation therapy. They are composed of differentiated cells derived from multiple germ layers, making them less responsive to radiation. Instead, surgical removal is the primary treatment for teratomas, and in some cases, chemotherapy is used if they become malignant. Embryonal Cell Carcinoma (C): Although embryonal carcinoma is an aggressive form of testicular cancer, it is more responsive to chemotherapy than radiation therapy. Embryonal carcinoma tends to metastasize early, requiring systemic treatment rather than localized radiation. None of the Above (D): This option is incorrect because seminoma (B) does respond well to radiation, making \"none of the above\" an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Nervous tissue because nervous tissue, particularly neurons, is the least radiosensitive tissue in the human body. This is due to the fact that neurons are highly specialized, non-dividing (post-mitotic) cells. Radiation primarily affects cells that are actively dividing, as it induces DNA damage that disrupts cell replication. Since neurons do not undergo regular mitosis, they are highly resistant to radiation damage. However, while mature neurons are radioresistant, developing neural tissues and glial cells (which provide support to neurons) are more sensitive. Incorrect Options: Bone (B): Bone tissue has varying levels of radiosensitivity depending on its activity. Growing bone, such as that found in children, is more sensitive because it contains actively dividing cells in the bone marrow and growth plates. However, mature bone tissue is relatively radioresistant, though not as much as nervous tissue. Kidney (C): The kidney is moderately radiosensitive. The renal tubules and glomeruli do not regenerate well after radiation-induced damage, making the kidney susceptible to radiation-induced nephropathy. However, it is not as resistant as nervous tissue. Thyroid (D): The thyroid gland is highly radiosensitive, especially in younger individuals. Radiation exposure can cause thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism or thyroid cancer, due to the active division of thyroid follicular cells. This makes it one of the more radiation-sensitive organs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 20%. Cold thyroid nodules are non-functioning nodules that do not take up radioactive iodine on a thyroid scan. These nodules are concerning because they may harbor malignancy. Studies have shown that approximately 15-20% of cold nodules are malignant, most commonly papillary thyroid carcinoma followed by follicular carcinoma. The majority of cold nodules, however, are benign, including colloid nodules, thyroid cysts, or adenomas. The evaluation of cold nodules typically involves further assessment with ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) to determine malignancy risk. Incorrect Options: B. 30% – Incorrect: While cold nodules have a higher malignancy risk than hot nodules (which are usually benign), the likelihood of malignancy is not as high as 30%. Most studies report a risk closer to 20%, making this option an overestimation. C. 40% – Incorrect: A 40% malignancy rate is too high based on current epidemiological data. Although certain high-risk features on ultrasound (such as microcalcifications, irregular margins, or increased vascularity) may indicate a higher risk, the general probability remains closer to 20% for all cold nodules. D. 72% – Incorrect: This percentage is significantly exaggerated. The vast majority of cold nodules are benign, and malignancy occurs in only a minority of cases.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tc stannous pyrophosphate. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) stannous pyrophosphate is used in acute myocardial infarct scintigraphy because it selectively accumulates in necrotic myocardial tissue. After an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), calcium deposits and damaged myocardial cells facilitate the uptake of this tracer, making infarcted areas visible on a scan. This imaging modality is particularly useful within the first few days (12-72 hours) after infarction, as the uptake decreases with healing. Tc-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy is non-invasive and highly specific for detecting myocardial necrosis, distinguishing new infarcts from old ones. Incorrect Options: A. Thallium – Incorrect: Thallium-201 is used primarily for myocardial perfusion imaging, not infarct detection. It helps assess myocardial ischemia and viability but does not effectively highlight acute necrotic tissue like Tc-99m pyrophosphate does. B. Gallium – Incorrect: Gallium-67 is mainly used for infection and inflammation imaging, including detecting conditions like sarcoidosis or chronic infections. It does not have significant utility in detecting acute myocardial infarction. C. Neodymium – Incorrect: Neodymium is not used in nuclear medicine imaging for myocardial infarction. It is a rare earth element with applications in lasers and magnets rather than medical imaging.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Uranium. Uranium has the longest half-life among the given options, with Uranium-238 (U-238) having a half-life of about 4.47 billion years, and Uranium-235 (U-235) having a half-life of about 704 million years. This makes uranium one of the most stable radioactive elements, persisting in the environment for billions of years. Uranium is commonly found in the Earth's crust and is widely used in nuclear reactors and weapons due to its ability to undergo fission. Its long half-life also makes it useful in radiometric dating, helping scientists estimate the age of rocks and the Earth itself. Incorrect Options: A. Radon – Incorrect: Radon-222, the most stable isotope of radon, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. Radon is a radioactive gas that originates from the decay of uranium and is a known health hazard due to its link to lung cancer when accumulated in enclosed spaces. B. Radium – Incorrect: Radium-226, the most common isotope of radium, has a half-life of about 1,600 years. While this is significantly longer than radon, it is still much shorter than uranium’s half-life. Radium was historically used in luminous paints but was later found to be highly dangerous due to its intense radioactivity. D. Cesium – Incorrect: Cesium-137, a common radioactive isotope of cesium, has a half-life of 30 years, making it useful in medical and industrial applications, including radiation therapy and nuclear accident monitoring. However, this is still much shorter than uranium’s billions of years of half-life.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pineal calcification. Pineal gland calcification is the most common cause of intracranial calcification and is considered a normal physiological finding in many adults. It is seen in about 40-70% of adults on imaging, often appearing as a small, midline, round calcified structure on CT scans. The pineal gland tends to calcify with age due to the deposition of calcium and phosphorus. While usually benign, excessive or asymmetrical calcification may sometimes be associated with pathological conditions like pineal tumors or metabolic disorders. Incorrect Options: B. Intracranial aneurysm – Incorrect: While aneurysms may occasionally show focal calcification, they are not the most common cause of intracranial calcifications. Aneurysmal calcifications are typically seen in atherosclerotic cerebral arteries, but this is much less frequent compared to pineal calcifications. C. Meningioma – Incorrect: Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors that frequently exhibit calcification, particularly in older patients. However, they are not the most common cause of intracranial calcification overall, as their incidence is significantly lower than physiological pineal calcification. D. Tuberculoma – Incorrect: Tuberculomas, which occur in CNS tuberculosis, can present with \"target\" or nodular calcifications on imaging. However, they are more commonly seen in tuberculosis-endemic regions and are far less frequent than pineal calcifications in the general population.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 0.5 mm. A lead apron with a thickness of 0.5 mm is the standard for radiation protection in medical and industrial settings. This thickness provides an optimal balance between protection and wearability, effectively reducing radiation exposure by approximately 90-99% for scatter radiation from diagnostic X-rays. It is commonly used in radiology, fluoroscopy, and interventional procedures where staff are frequently exposed to ionizing radiation. The 0.5 mm lead equivalent is recommended by various radiation safety guidelines, including those from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). Incorrect Options: A. 1 mm – Incorrect: While a 1 mm lead apron would provide better protection, it is too heavy for practical use, making it uncomfortable for prolonged wear. It is rarely used except in high-radiation environments like nuclear medicine or research labs. B. 3 mm – Incorrect: A 3 mm lead apron is excessively thick and impractical for use in standard radiation protection. Such thickness is not necessary for routine medical applications and would make mobility difficult. D. 7 mm – Incorrect: A 7 mm lead apron would be extremely heavy and is not used in any clinical setting. Radiation shielding of this thickness is typically found in fixed structural barriers (such as walls in radiology suites) rather than in wearable protective gear.",

Gallium scans are particularly useful in identifying deep-seated infections, such as osteomyelitis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis, where conventional imaging may be inconclusive. Incorrect Options: B. Technetium – Incorrect: Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is a widely used radioisotope in nuclear imaging, but it does not selectively concentrate in abscesses. Some Tc-99m-labeled compounds, like Tc-99m HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, can be used for infection imaging, but Ga-67 remains more specific for abscess detection. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gamma rays. Radioactive cobalt, specifically Cobalt-60 (Co-60), emits high-energy gamma rays, which are used in various applications such as radiation therapy, industrial radiography, and sterilization of medical equipment. Co-60 undergoes beta decay, transforming into Nickel-60 (Ni-60), which then releases gamma radiation with energies of 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV. These penetrating gamma rays are highly effective in cancer treatment (cobalt therapy) and in non-destructive testing for industrial purposes. Incorrect Options: B. Beta rays – Incorrect: While Co-60 does emit beta particles (electrons) during its decay process, these are not its primary radiation of interest. The beta radiation is quickly absorbed within the source material itself, while the gamma rays are the ones used in medical and industrial applications due to their deep tissue penetration. C. Alpha rays – Incorrect: Cobalt-60 does not emit alpha particles. Alpha radiation is typically emitted by heavy elements like uranium and radium, but cobalt is not one of them. Alpha particles have low penetration power and are not characteristic of Co-60 decay. D. Neutrons – Incorrect: Cobalt-60 does not emit neutrons during its decay. Neutron radiation is typically produced in nuclear fission reactions or neutron sources like Californium-252. Co-60 is a gamma emitter, not a neutron emitter.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Thallium. Thallium-201 (Tl-201) is a widely used isotope for myocardial perfusion imaging to assess coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial ischemia, and infarction. It mimics potassium in the body and is actively taken up by myocardial cells via the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, allowing it to reflect regional myocardial blood flow. Areas with normal perfusion show adequate uptake of Tl-201, whereas areas with ischemia or infarction show reduced or absent uptake. Stress and rest imaging protocols help differentiate between reversible ischemia (viable myocardium) and infarcted tissue (non-viable myocardium). Thallium-201 is particularly useful for assessing myocardial viability in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. Incorrect Options: A. Technetium – Incorrect: Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is commonly used in myocardial perfusion scans, but not as Tc-99m alone. Instead, Tc-99m labeled compounds such as Tc-99m Sestamibi and Tc-99m Tetrofosmin are widely used today due to their better image quality and lower radiation exposure. However, since the question asks for an isotope, Thallium-201 is the better choice. C. Stannous pyrophosphate – Incorrect: Tc-99m Stannous Pyrophosphate is used in imaging acute myocardial infarction, not for myocardial perfusion imaging. It accumulates in necrotic myocardial tissue, making it useful for detecting recent infarcts, but it does not assess myocardial blood flow like Tl-201 does. D.

Iridium-192 (Ir-192) has largely replaced radium-226 (Ra-226) in brachytherapy due to its safer handling, controlled radiation emission, and effectiveness in treating various cancers, including cervical, prostate, and breast cancer. Ir-192 is a gamma-ray emitter with a half-life of 74 days, making it well-suited for high-dose-rate (HDR) and low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. It provides a strong therapeutic dose while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. Unlike radium, which poses a significant radiation hazard due to its long half-life (1,600 years) and high-energy emissions, Ir-192 is safer and more practical in modern radiation oncology. Incorrect Options: A. Cesium – Incorrect: Cesium-137 (Cs-137) has been used in brachytherapy as a replacement for radium, but it is less commonly used than Iridium-192. It has a longer half-life (30 years) and emits gamma radiation, but its widespread use has declined due to handling difficulties and radiation safety concerns. C. Gold – Incorrect: Gold-198 (Au-198) is used in permanent seed implantation for prostate and liver cancer, but it has not replaced radium as widely as Iridium-192. It has a short half-life (2.7 days) and is used mainly in localized, low-dose radiation treatments. D. Californium – Incorrect: Californium-252 (Cf-252) is primarily used as a neutron source for neutron radiotherapy and industrial applications, rather than as a direct replacement for radium in brachytherapy.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 6 hours. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) has a half-life of 6 hours, making it an ideal radioisotope for diagnostic imaging in nuclear medicine. This relatively short half-life allows for high-quality imaging while ensuring that radiation exposure to the patient is minimized. Tc-99m emits gamma rays (140 keV), which are well-suited for detection by gamma cameras, producing detailed images with good resolution. Its rapid decay also means that patients experience less radiation burden compared to longer-lived isotopes, making it a preferred choice for procedures such as bone scans, myocardial perfusion imaging, renal scans, and brain perfusion studies. Incorrect Options: A. 2 hours – Incorrect: A 2-hour half-life would be too short for practical imaging, as the isotope would decay too quickly, reducing the time available for imaging procedures and limiting its diagnostic utility. C. 12 hours – Incorrect: A 12-hour half-life would prolong radiation exposure unnecessarily and reduce the efficiency of imaging. Tc-99m’s 6-hour half-life is optimal because it provides enough time for imaging while ensuring rapid elimination from the body. D. 24 hours – Incorrect: A 24-hour half-life would result in prolonged radiation exposure to the patient, increasing the radiation dose without added diagnostic benefit.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) DTPA scan. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) scan is a nuclear medicine study that evaluates renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In a patient with acute renal failure (ARF) and a normal ultrasound, a DTPA scan helps differentiate between pre-renal, renal (intrinsic), and post-renal causes. It is particularly useful in assessing renal function, perfusion abnormalities, and obstruction, which may not be apparent on ultrasound. This non-invasive test provides functional data that other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound or CT, cannot. Incorrect Options: A. Renal angiography – Incorrect: Renal angiography is primarily used for evaluating renal vascular conditions like renal artery stenosis or thrombosis, rather than for assessing general renal function in ARF. It is invasive and not the first-line investigation unless a vascular cause is strongly suspected. B. Retrograde pyelography – Incorrect: Retrograde pyelography is useful in detecting ureteric obstructions, but it is an invasive procedure requiring cystoscopy and contrast administration. Since the ultrasound is normal (indicating no obvious obstruction), a DTPA scan is more appropriate to assess renal function before considering invasive tests. C. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) – Incorrect: IVP involves contrast injection to visualize the urinary tract, but it is not ideal in ARF because contrast agents can worsen kidney function in already compromised kidneys. Additionally, it provides anatomical details rather than functional assessment, making it less useful than a DTPA scan in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 18 MV photons. Photon beams are highly penetrating electromagnetic waves used in radiation therapy. The penetration depth of a photon beam increases with its energy. An 18 megavolt (MV) photon beam has greater penetration depth compared to lower-energy photon beams, making it ideal for treating deep-seated tumors such as those in the pelvis, abdomen, or deep within the thorax. The higher energy allows the beam to travel deeper into the body while sparing surrounding healthy tissues by delivering the highest dose at a deeper level rather than at the skin surface. Incorrect Options: A. Electron beam – Incorrect: Electron beams have limited penetration and are primarily used for superficial tumors, such as skin cancers and chest wall recurrences. The depth of penetration depends on the electron energy, but electrons are less penetrating than high-energy photon beams and are not suitable for deep-seated tumors. B. 8 MV photons – Incorrect: While 8 MV photon beams are more penetrating than electron beams, they are less penetrating than 18 MV photons. Lower-energy photons are often used for moderately deep tumors, but for tumors located at greater depths, higher-energy beams like 18 MV photons are preferred. D. Proton beam – Incorrect: Proton beams have unique properties due to the Bragg peak phenomenon, where they deposit most of their energy at a specific depth and then stop, minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. However, in terms of overall penetration depth, high-energy photon beams like 18 MV photons penetrate deeper and do not have the same sharp dose fall-off as proton beams.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Technetium-99m linked to Methylene Diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP). 99mTc-MDP is the most widely used radiopharmaceutical for skeletal imaging due to its high affinity for bone tissue, especially areas of high osteoblastic activity. MDP is a phosphate compound that binds to hydroxyapatite in bone, allowing it to highlight metabolic bone activity, fractures, infections, and metastatic disease. When labeled with Technetium-99m (99mTc), it provides excellent imaging quality due to its 6-hour half-life and 140 keV gamma-ray emission, making it ideal for detection by gamma cameras. The high bone uptake and rapid blood clearance of 99mTc-MDP contribute to its superior contrast and sensitivity for skeletal imaging. Incorrect Options: A. Gallium-67 (67Ga) – Incorrect: Gallium-67 is primarily used for imaging infections, inflammation, and tumors, rather than for skeletal imaging. While it can be used in cases of osteomyelitis or malignancies, it lacks the specificity and sensitivity of 99mTc-MDP for bone scans. B. Technetium-Sulfur Colloid (99mTc-Sc) – Incorrect: 99mTc-Sulfur Colloid is used for imaging the reticuloendothelial system (RES), particularly in liver, spleen, and bone marrow scans, but it is not useful for skeletal imaging. It does not have the necessary bone uptake properties that 99mTc-MDP provides. C. Technetium-99m (99mTc) – Incorrect: 99mTc alone is not a radiopharmaceutical. It serves as a radioactive tracer that needs to be bound to a carrier molecule, such as MDP, to target a specific organ system. Unbound 99mTc does not localize to the bones effectively, making it unsuitable for skeletal imaging.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Organ imaging. The gamma camera is a critical tool in nuclear medicine used for organ imaging by detecting gamma radiation emitted from radiopharmaceuticals introduced into the patient’s body. It works based on the scintillation principle, where gamma rays interact with a sodium iodide (NaI) crystal, producing flashes of light that are converted into electrical signals. These signals are then processed to create functional images of organs, allowing assessment of conditions like bone metastases, cardiac perfusion, thyroid disorders, renal function, and lung perfusion. The gamma camera provides dynamic and static imaging, making it a key modality in nuclear medicine for diagnosing and monitoring various diseases. Incorrect Options: B. Measuring the radioactivity – Incorrect: Gamma cameras are not designed to measure absolute radioactivity levels. While they detect gamma radiation from radiopharmaceuticals, instruments like dose calibrators or Geiger-Muller counters are used for quantifying radioactivity. C. Monitoring the surface contamination – Incorrect: Surface contamination monitoring requires devices like Geiger counters or scintillation detectors, which are specifically designed to detect and measure contamination levels. A gamma camera is not portable and does not serve this purpose. D. RIA (Radioimmunoassay) – Incorrect: Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is a laboratory technique used to measure hormone or protein levels using radioactively labeled antigens or antibodies. It does not involve imaging and does not require a gamma camera. Instead, it is performed using gamma counters to measure radioactivity in samples.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Nuclear imaging, particularly Technetium-99m sulfur colloid (99mTc-Sc) scintigraphy, is highly accurate in diagnosing focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). This is because FNH contains Kupffer cells, which take up 99mTc sulfur colloid, leading to increased radiotracer uptake in the lesion compared to surrounding liver tissue. This characteristic uptake pattern allows for high specificity in distinguishing FNH from other hepatic lesions. Additionally, hepatic scintigraphy using 99mTc-labeled heat-damaged red blood cells (99mTc-RBC scan) can help differentiate FNH from hepatic adenomas, as FNH typically demonstrates enhanced uptake due to its vascular nature. Incorrect Options: A. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) – Incorrect: HCC does not reliably take up 99mTc sulfur colloid, as these tumors usually lack Kupffer cells. Instead, HCC is better diagnosed with contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, or PET scans, which can highlight its characteristic arterial enhancement and washout pattern. B. Hepatic adenoma – Incorrect: Hepatic adenomas do not contain Kupffer cells, so they do not take up 99mTc sulfur colloid, making nuclear imaging ineffective for diagnosing them. MRI with hepatobiliary contrast agents is the preferred imaging modality for hepatic adenomas. D. Cholangiocarcinoma – Incorrect: Cholangiocarcinoma is a biliary tract malignancy that lacks significant uptake of 99mTc sulfur colloid. It is best diagnosed using MRI with MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) or PET/CT, as these modalities provide better visualization of the bile ducts and tumor involvement.",

Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is the most commonly used material in vertebroplasty, a minimally invasive procedure performed to treat vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), often caused by osteoporosis, trauma, or malignancy. PMMA is a biocompatible bone cement that provides immediate mechanical support to the fractured vertebra, helping to restore vertebral stability and reduce pain. It has high compressive strength, ensuring durability, and its exothermic polymerization process helps in additional stabilization of the bone. PMMA is radiopaque due to the addition of barium sulfate or tungsten, allowing visualization under fluoroscopy during the procedure. Incorrect Options: B.

Isoethyl methacrylate – Incorrect: Isoethyl methacrylate is not a standard material for vertebroplasty. Unlike PMMA, it does not possess the necessary biocompatibility and mechanical properties to provide adequate vertebral support. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lung cancer. Radon exposure is a well-established risk factor for lung cancer, particularly in individuals exposed to high levels over prolonged periods. Radon is a radioactive, odorless, and colorless gas that arises naturally from the decay of uranium in soil, rock, and water. When inhaled, radon decay products emit alpha radiation, which damages lung tissue and increases the risk of mutations leading to lung cancer. Studies have shown that radon exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and poses a significant occupational hazard for miners and individuals living in homes with poor ventilation where radon accumulates. Incorrect Options: B. Cervical cancer – Incorrect: Cervical cancer is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), not radon exposure. Other risk factors include smoking, multiple sexual partners, and a weakened immune system. There is no established link between radon and cervical cancer. C. Oral cavity cancer – Incorrect: Oral cancer is mainly linked to tobacco use (both smoking and chewing), excessive alcohol consumption, and HPV infection, rather than radon exposure. Radon gas affects the lungs, not the oral mucosa. D. Bladder cancer – Incorrect: Bladder cancer is primarily associated with smoking, exposure to industrial chemicals (like aromatic amines), and chronic bladder inflammation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rubidium-82. Rubidium-82 (Rb-82) is the preferred isotope for myocardial perfusion imaging using PET (Positron Emission Tomography). It is a potassium analog, meaning it behaves similarly to potassium in the body, allowing it to be actively taken up by myocardial cells through Na+/K+ ATPase pumps. Since myocardial blood flow is directly proportional to Rb-82 uptake, areas with reduced perfusion (ischemia or infarction) show decreased uptake, making it highly effective for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). Rb-82 is produced from a Strontium-82/Rubidium-82 generator, making it readily available for rapid, high-resolution perfusion imaging in PET scans. Incorrect Options: B. FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) – Incorrect: FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose, F-18 FDG) is used in cardiac PET imaging for metabolic assessment, not for perfusion studies. It is primarily used to assess myocardial viability, especially in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, by detecting glucose metabolism in viable but dysfunctional myocardial tissue. However, it does not directly evaluate myocardial blood flow like Rb-82 does. C. Thymidine – Incorrect: Thymidine (labeled with C-11 or F-18) is used in PET imaging for tumor proliferation studies, particularly in oncology, rather than cardiac imaging.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 110 minutes. Fluorine-18 (F-18) is a positron-emitting radioisotope commonly used in PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging, particularly with Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) for metabolic imaging of tumors, brain function, and myocardial viability. F-18 has a half-life of approximately 110 minutes, meaning it takes this amount of time for half of its radioactivity to decay. This half-life is ideal for clinical PET imaging, as it allows enough time for synthesis, transport, and imaging while still ensuring rapid decay to minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Incorrect Options: B. 90 minutes – Incorrect: While close, F-18's actual half-life is 110 minutes, not 90 minutes. This distinction is important in nuclear medicine, where precise timing is crucial for imaging protocols. C. 6 hours – Incorrect: 6 hours is the half-life of Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), a commonly used isotope in SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging, but not in PET. Tc-99m is used for imaging the skeleton, heart, and other organs but has no relation to F-18. D. 13 days – Incorrect: A half-life of 13 days is too long for a PET tracer. In comparison, Iodine-131 (I-131), which is used in thyroid treatments, has a half-life of around 8 days. PET tracers require short-lived isotopes like F-18 for practical use in diagnostic imaging.",
