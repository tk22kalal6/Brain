      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sturge-Weber Syndrome 'Tram line' calcifications on a skull X-ray are a characteristic radiological finding of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS), a neurocutaneous disorder caused by somatic activating mutations in the GNAQ gene. It is a congenital but non-heritable condition characterized by leptomeningeal angiomatosis, which leads to vascular malformations in the brain. These malformations result in intracranial calcifications, often appearing as parallel curvilinear lines along the cerebral cortex on imaging—hence the term 'tram line' calcifications. The calcifications are most commonly seen in the occipital and parietal regions and can be associated with seizures, developmental delay, and a facial port-wine stain (Nevus Flammeus) in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Incorrect Options: (A) Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection: Congenital CMV infection can cause periventricular calcifications, but these are typically punctate and scattered rather than forming a tram-line pattern. CMV is a major cause of congenital infections, leading to sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, and developmental delay. (B) Congenital Toxoplasmosis: Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with intracranial calcifications, but these are usually diffuse and randomly distributed throughout the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia. Other classic manifestations include hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and hepatosplenomegaly. (C) Craniopharyngioma: Craniopharyngiomas are tumors of the sellar/suprasellar region and often present with calcifications on imaging, but these are typically amorphous or nodular rather than tram-line in appearance. They may cause symptoms related to mass effect, such as visual disturbances and endocrine dysfunction due to compression of the pituitary gland.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Decalcification of the Inner Table Meningiomas are extra-axial, slow-growing tumors arising from the arachnoid cap cells of the meninges. They are typically associated with hyperostosis (localized thickening) of the adjacent skull bone rather than decalcification of the inner table. The tumor induces a reactive bony response, which can lead to sclerosis or hyperostosis rather than bone loss. Decalcification of the inner table is not a recognized feature of meningiomas, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Lamellar Calcification: Meningiomas frequently demonstrate intratumoral calcifications, which may appear lamellar (layered), punctate, or even extensive on imaging. These calcifications are seen in approximately 20-30% of cases and are best visualized on CT scans. (B) Enlarged Foramen Spinosum: The foramen spinosum transmits the middle meningeal artery, which can become enlarged due to increased vascular demand from a meningioma. The tumor recruits blood supply from the external carotid artery, leading to arterial remodeling and enlargement of the foramen spinosum, a recognized radiological feature of meningiomas. (C) Increased Meningeal Vascular Markings: Meningiomas are highly vascular tumors that derive their blood supply from the meningeal arteries. This increased blood flow results in prominent vascular markings on skull X-rays and CT scans, often described as \"sunburst\" or \"spoke-wheel\" patterns due to enlarged feeding vessels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 2 Internal Carotids and 1 Vertebral Four-vessel angiography is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize the cerebral vasculature. Traditionally, it involves catheterization of the two internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and at least one vertebral artery (VA) to assess both the anterior and posterior circulations of the brain. The internal carotid arteries supply the anterior circulation, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, while the vertebral arteries contribute to the posterior circulation, including the brainstem, cerebellum, and occipital lobes. In some cases, imaging one vertebral artery is sufficient, as the two vertebral arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which supplies the posterior brain. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2 internal carotids and 1 vertebral. Incorrect Options: (A) 2 External Carotids and 2 Vertebral: The external carotid arteries (ECAs) primarily supply the face, scalp, and meninges, not the brain parenchyma. While they may play a role in collateral circulation, they are not routinely catheterized in standard four-vessel angiography, making this option incorrect. (B) 2 Internal Carotids and 2 Vertebral: While imaging both vertebral arteries provides a more detailed view of the posterior circulation, in many cases, imaging one vertebral artery is sufficient because they join to form the basilar artery. Therefore, though technically accurate in some protocols, this is not the standard approach when only three vessel catheterizations suffice. (D) 2 External Carotids and 1 Vertebral: As previously mentioned, the external carotid arteries do not supply the intracranial structures directly. Imaging them is not a part of standard four-vessel angiography, and using only one vertebral artery without the internal carotids would provide an incomplete assessment of cerebral circulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the Above Time sector imaging, a type of ultrasound imaging, is preferred in infants because it offers several advantages. Ultrasound is non-invasive, portable, and does not expose the infant to ionizing radiation, making it an ideal imaging modality for neonates and infants. Child Will Be More Cooperative: Since infants are less likely to stay still for prolonged imaging procedures like CT or MRI, ultrasound offers a quick and efficient method for imaging without requiring sedation, making it more convenient for both the child and the medical team. Close to Fontanelles: In neonates, the anterior fontanelle remains open, providing a natural acoustic window for cranial ultrasound. This allows clear visualization of brain structures without interference from the bony skull, which would otherwise obstruct sound waves in older children and adults. Less Expensive: Compared to MRI and CT, ultrasound is more cost-effective, widely available, and does not require large infrastructure or contrast agents, making it an economically favorable choice for routine imaging in infants. Since all of the options contribute to the advantages of time sector imaging in infants, the correct answer is (D) All of the Above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Open Fontanelles Time sector scanning, a type of cranial ultrasound, is preferred in neonates primarily due to the presence of open fontanelles, which provide a natural acoustic window for imaging the brain. In neonates, the anterior fontanelle remains open, allowing ultrasound waves to pass through and provide clear visualization of intracranial structures without interference from the bony skull. This makes it a non-invasive, safe, and highly effective method for detecting conditions like intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and congenital brain abnormalities. Once the fontanelles close (usually by 12-18 months), ultrasound imaging of the brain becomes significantly limited, and other imaging modalities like MRI or CT are required. Incorrect Options: (B) Inexpensive: While ultrasound is more cost-effective compared to CT and MRI, the primary reason for its use in neonates is the availability of an acoustic window (open fontanelles), not just cost considerations. The ability to obtain clear images is the most practical reason. (C) Children More Cooperative: Neonates are easier to handle compared to older children, but this is not the key reason for choosing ultrasound over other modalities. If fontanelles were closed, cooperation alone would not make ultrasound useful for brain imaging. (D) Better Resolution: Ultrasound provides sufficient resolution for neonatal brain imaging, but it is not superior to MRI or CT in terms of overall image quality. However, due to its ability to scan through the fontanelles, it remains the best practical choice in neonates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CT Scan The investigation of choice for acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a non-contrast CT (NCCT) scan due to its rapid availability, high sensitivity, and ability to detect acute hemorrhage within the first 24 hours. CT scans can identify hyperdense (bright) blood in the subarachnoid spaces, including the basal cisterns, sylvian fissures, and interhemispheric fissure, which is characteristic of SAH. Sensitivity is highest within the first 6 hours (>95%) and gradually decreases over time as blood gets reabsorbed. The speed and accuracy of CT make it the first-line diagnostic test for suspected SAH, particularly in emergency settings when patients present with sudden onset severe headache (\"thunderclap headache\"), altered consciousness, or neurological deficits. Incorrect Options: (A) Enhanced MRI: MRI with contrast (enhanced MRI) is not the first-line investigation for SAH because it takes longer to perform, is less sensitive in detecting acute hemorrhage, and requires patient stability, which is often compromised in critically ill patients. Contrast-enhanced MRI is more useful for evaluating vascular malformations and tumors rather than acute bleeding. (B) MRI: Non-contrast MRI, especially FLAIR and SWI sequences, can detect subarachnoid blood but is less sensitive than CT in the acute phase. MRI is typically used when SAH is suspected but the CT scan is negative, especially in cases where symptoms persist. It is more useful for detecting chronic or small-volume hemorrhages rather than acute bleeds. (D) Angiography: Cerebral angiography (DSA - Digital Subtraction Angiography) is the gold standard for detecting the underlying cause of SAH, such as aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), but it is not the initial investigation. It is typically performed after SAH is confirmed on CT to identify the bleeding source and guide intervention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypoparathyroidism Basal ganglia calcifications are commonly seen in hypoparathyroidism, primarily due to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which lead to abnormal calcium deposition in the brain. The basal ganglia, particularly the globus pallidus, is a frequent site of calcification in such metabolic disorders. These calcifications may be asymptomatic or associated with neurological symptoms like movement disorders, cognitive impairment, or seizures. Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, post-surgical hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism are all known to cause this phenomenon. Incorrect Options: (A) Hypothyroidism: While hypothyroidism can cause neurological symptoms such as cognitive decline, depression, and myxedema, it is not a recognized cause of basal ganglia calcifications. It may lead to other metabolic abnormalities but does not directly result in intracranial calcium deposition. (C) Hypopituitarism: Hypopituitarism leads to multiple hormonal deficiencies affecting growth, metabolism, and adrenal function, but it does not cause basal ganglia calcifications. Instead, it may be associated with sellar region abnormalities on imaging, such as an enlarged or empty sella turcica. (D) Hypoaldosteronism: Hypoaldosteronism primarily affects electrolyte balance, leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension, but it does not cause basal ganglia calcifications.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the Above Increased intracranial tension (ICT) in children leads to various radiographic and clinical signs, which result from raised pressure inside the skull affecting bone growth and sutural expansion. The following features are seen on X-ray and clinical examination: Separation of the Sutures: Raised intracranial pressure causes the cranial sutures to widen, which can be seen on skull X-ray. This is especially prominent in infants whose sutures have not yet fused. Tense Anterior Fontanelle: In neonates and infants, the anterior fontanelle remains open for the first 12-18 months. Increased intracranial pressure results in a bulging and tense anterior fontanelle, which is an important clinical sign of raised ICT. Silver Beaten Appearance of the Bones: Chronically raised ICT leads to erosion of the inner table of the skull, causing a characteristic \"silver beaten\" or \"copper beaten\" appearance on X-ray. This occurs due to pressure exerted by the growing brain on the developing skull, leading to prominent gyral impressions (digitations) on the inner calvarium. It is commonly seen in conditions like hydrocephalus, brain tumors, and craniosynostosis. Since all the above features are associated with increased ICT, the correct answer is (D) All of the Above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the Above Intracranial calcifications are commonly seen on skull X-rays and can be due to physiological or pathological causes. These calcifications may occur in various intracranial structures, including the pineal gland, dura mater, and parenchyma (due to infections like cysticercosis). Pineal Calcifications: The pineal gland often undergoes physiological calcification with age, usually after the second decade of life. While normal in adults, early or excessive calcification may indicate underlying pathology, such as tumors (pineocytomas, pineoblastomas) or metabolic disorders. Dural Calcifications: Calcifications in the dura mater can be associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, meningiomas, or idiopathic age-related changes. Dural calcifications are commonly seen in the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and convexity dura. Cysticercosis: Neurocysticercosis, caused by the parasitic infection Taenia solium, is a leading cause of pathological intracranial calcifications, especially in endemic regions. It typically appears as multiple, punctate, or ring-like calcifications, representing dead or degenerated cysts in the brain parenchyma. These calcifications are best visualized on CT, but they can also be seen on skull X-rays in advanced cases. Since all of the above can present as intracranial calcifications on X-rays, the correct answer is (D) All of the Above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Thalassemia The \"hair-on-end\" appearance on skull X-rays is a characteristic radiographic finding seen in conditions with severe chronic hemolytic anemia, particularly thalassemia major. This appearance results from excessive bone marrow hyperplasia, which occurs due to increased erythropoiesis as the body attempts to compensate for chronic anemia. The excessive marrow expansion leads to widening of the diploic spaces in the skull and the formation of vertical trabeculae, giving the X-ray the appearance of hair standing on end. This is a classic sign seen in β-thalassemia major, where ineffective erythropoiesis and increased hemolysis drive marrow expansion. Incorrect Options: (A) Sickle Cell Anemia: Sickle cell anemia can also cause bone marrow expansion, but it less commonly leads to a prominent \"hair-on-end\" appearance on X-ray. Instead, sickle cell disease primarily causes bone infarctions, osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis), and H-shaped vertebrae rather than significant skull changes. However, in severe cases, a mild \"hair-on-end\" appearance can be seen. (C) Megaloblastic Anemia: Megaloblastic anemia, caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, leads to ineffective hematopoiesis, but it does not result in significant marrow expansion like thalassemia. The typical skeletal changes seen in marrow expansion disorders are absent in megaloblastic anemia. (D) Hemochromatosis: Hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload, primarily affecting the liver, pancreas, heart, and joints, but it does not cause the \"hair-on-end\" appearance on skull X-rays. The condition is more associated with organ damage due to iron deposition rather than marrow hyperplasia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 3-7 days Biparietal diameter (BPD) is one of the most reliable ultrasound (USG) measurements used to estimate fetal gestational age and maturity. When performed in the second trimester (between 14-26 weeks), BPD provides an accuracy of ±3 to 7 days in estimating gestational age. This high level of accuracy is due to the steady and predictable growth of the fetal head during this period. As the pregnancy progresses, fetal growth variations increase, making later measurements less precise. BPD is measured from the outer edge of the proximal skull to the inner edge of the distal skull, ideally at the level of the thalami and cavum septi pellucidi, ensuring a symmetrical view of both hemispheres. When combined with other fetal parameters like femur length (FL) and abdominal circumference (AC), it enhances the accuracy of fetal age estimation. Incorrect Options: (B) 7-10 days: Although BPD is accurate within ±7 days, it is more precise in early pregnancy and does not typically extend to ±10 days unless measured later in gestation. Other fetal biometric parameters become necessary to improve accuracy beyond the second trimester. (C) 10-15 days: By the third trimester, fetal growth rates vary significantly due to genetic and maternal factors, reducing the reliability of BPD alone. Accuracy drops to ±10-15 days when estimating gestational age beyond 28 weeks. However, this is not the case in the second trimester when BPD is most reliable. (D) 14-20 days: A margin of error of 14-20 days applies more to third-trimester growth scans rather than second-trimester BPD measurements. This is because factors like placental function, fetal growth restriction, and genetic differences impact measurements later in pregnancy. (E) 3-4 weeks: A 3-4 week variation is too wide for BPD accuracy. Such an error margin applies to third-trimester ultrasound estimations where fetal size varies significantly. This level of inaccuracy is not applicable to second-trimester BPD-based dating.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the Above The \"doughnut sign\" on a brain scan typically refers to a ring-enhancing lesion seen on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. This pattern occurs due to central necrosis surrounded by an enhancing rim, which represents active inflammation, tumor, or vascular proliferation. The most common causes of such lesions include: Brain Abscess: A bacterial or fungal abscess forms a necrotic core with a surrounding inflammatory capsule, leading to ring enhancement. Abscesses often show restricted diffusion on DWI MRI, helping differentiate them from tumors. Metastases: Metastatic brain tumors, especially from lung, breast, and melanoma, often present as multiple ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema. They may be located at the gray-white junction, a common site for metastatic spread. Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM): This aggressive primary brain tumor frequently exhibits necrosis with irregular ring enhancement. Unlike abscesses, GBM shows heterogeneous enhancement, crossing the midline (butterfly glioma), and has infiltrative margins rather than a well-defined capsule. Since all these conditions can produce a ring-enhancing lesion with a \"doughnut sign\", the correct answer is (D) All of the Above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) In cerebral angiography, premature filling of veins occurs when arterial blood directly enters the venous system without passing through the normal capillary network. This is a hallmark feature of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a congenital vascular anomaly characterized by a tangle of abnormal arteries and veins connected by a nidus. In AVMs, arterial blood is shunted directly into veins, causing: Early opacification of draining veins on angiography, even during the arterial phase. High-flow vascular malformations that can lead to hemorrhage, ischemia, or seizures. Absence of a normal capillary phase, differentiating AVMs from other vascular pathologies. Thus, premature venous filling in cerebral angiography is a classic finding of AVM, making (C) Arteriovenous Malformation the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Trauma: Trauma can lead to vascular injuries, such as carotid-cavernous fistulas or pseudoaneurysms, which may cause abnormal vascular filling patterns. However, these usually result in arteriovenous shunting at the injury site, rather than early venous filling in a typical AVM pattern. (B) Brain Tumor: Brain tumors can cause vascular changes, such as increased neovascularization, leading to abnormal angiographic findings like irregular tumor blush or vessel displacement. However, they do not typically cause early venous filling, as there is no direct arteriovenous communication. (D) Arterial Occlusion: In arterial occlusion (e.g., stroke), there is delayed or absent filling of downstream vessels, not premature venous filling. If collateral circulation develops, it may result in prolonged contrast retention, but it does not mimic the rapid AV shunting seen in AVMs.",

The characteristic calcifications occur due to progressive cortical atrophy and leptomeningeal vascular malformations, which lead to dystrophic intracranial calcifications along the gyri. These calcifications appear as parallel curvilinear densities on CT scans, resembling tram tracks. Sturge-Weber syndrome is associated with: Port-wine stain (facial capillary malformation) in the V1/V2 dermatome distribution. Leptomeningeal angiomas, leading to cortical ischemia and subsequent calcifications. Seizures, developmental delay, and hemiparesis, which result from progressive brain involvement. Thus, tram-track calcifications are a radiological hallmark of SWS, making (A) Sturge-Weber syndrome the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (B) Toxoplasmosis: Congenital toxoplasmosis can lead to diffuse intracranial calcifications, but these are typically scattered and punctate, not the tram-track pattern seen in SWS. The classic triad includes intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, and chorioretinitis. (C) Tuberous Sclerosis: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is associated with subependymal calcified nodules and cortical tubers, not tram-track calcifications.

Key features of multiple myeloma on imaging include: \"Punched-out\" lytic lesions without surrounding reactive sclerosis. Common sites: Skull, spine, ribs, pelvis, and long bones. Diffuse osteopenia or osteoporosis, increasing fracture risk. No periosteal reaction or cortical thickening, differentiating it from other lytic bone diseases. Since these punched-out lesions are highly characteristic of multiple myeloma, the correct answer is (C) Multiple Myeloma. Incorrect Options: (A) Paget's Disease: Paget’s disease is a disorder of abnormal bone remodeling, which leads to a mosaic pattern of bone formation, rather than punched-out lesions. Radiologically, it presents as: • Osteolytic phase: Blade-of-grass or flame-shaped lesions. • Mixed phase: Cotton wool appearance in the skull. • Osteosclerotic phase: Thickened, disorganized bone.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lumbar Puncture Lumbar puncture (LP) is contraindicated in cases of brain tumor, particularly when there is increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Performing an LP in such cases can lead to a sudden pressure gradient between the intracranial and spinal compartments, potentially causing brain herniation, which can be fatal. This is especially dangerous in tumors causing midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. For brain tumors, imaging modalities like CT scan and MRI are the primary diagnostic tools, while LP is generally avoided unless there is suspicion of meningeal involvement (e.g., leptomeningeal metastases or CNS lymphoma) and imaging has ruled out mass effect. Incorrect Options: (A) CT Scan: CT scan is commonly used for the initial evaluation of brain tumors, especially in emergency settings. It helps in detecting: Mass effect and midline shift Hydrocephalus due to obstructive tumors Hemorrhage or calcifications (e.g., oligodendrogliomas) However, MRI is superior for tumor characterization, but CT remains useful, particularly when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated. (B) MRI: MRI with contrast is the gold standard for brain tumor evaluation. It provides detailed soft tissue contrast, allowing for precise tumor localization and characterization. Features seen on MRI include: T1 and T2 signal variations based on tumor composition Contrast enhancement, indicating blood-brain barrier disruption Edema and mass effect assessment Advanced MRI techniques such as MR spectroscopy, perfusion MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging help in distinguishing tumors from other lesions like abscesses or demyelinating diseases. (C) X-ray Skull: While X-ray skull is rarely used in modern neuro-oncology, it can sometimes show: Calcifications in tumors like craniopharyngiomas, oligodendrogliomas, or meningiomas. Hyperostosis associated with meningiomas. Lytic lesions in metastases or multiple myeloma. Although not a primary diagnostic tool, X-ray may still provide clues in certain cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Femoral Artery In cerebral angiography, contrast dye is most commonly injected through the femoral artery using the Seldinger technique. The femoral artery is the preferred access site due to: • Large vessel caliber, making catheter insertion easier. • Direct access to the aortic arch, allowing smooth catheter navigation to the carotid and vertebral arteries. • Lower risk of complications compared to other access sites. • Better patient comfort and ease of post-procedure hemostasis with manual compression. • Cerebral angiography is used for diagnosing vascular abnormalities, including aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and stenosis. It provides detailed imaging of the cerebral vasculature by injecting contrast and capturing real-time images via fluoroscopy. Incorrect Options: (B) Brachial Artery: • The brachial artery can be used as an alternative access site but is less preferred due to: • Smaller vessel size, making catheter manipulation more challenging. • Higher risk of arterial spasm and thrombosis. • More discomfort for the patient and difficulty in achieving hemostasis post-procedure. (C) Axillary Artery: • The axillary artery is rarely used because: • It has a tortuous course, making catheter navigation to the brain more complex. • There is a higher risk of complications, including nerve injury and difficulty in bleeding control. (D) Radial Artery: • While the radial artery is commonly used in coronary angiography, it is not typically used in cerebral angiography because: • It is a small-caliber artery, limiting catheter size. • Longer catheter navigation is required to reach the cerebral vessels. • Higher chance of radial artery spasm and occlusion, especially in smaller patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lateral View The lateral X-ray view is the best for visualizing the sella turcica, a saddle-shaped depression in the sphenoid bone that houses the pituitary gland.

Identification of bony erosion or remodeling in cases of tumors or raised intracranial pressure. In a lateral skull X-ray, the sella turcica appears as a well-defined, concave structure, allowing easy assessment of its anteroposterior and vertical dimensions. Incorrect Options: (A) AP Views: Anteroposterior (AP) views of the skull do not provide a clear visualization of the sella turcica because it is overlapped by other skull structures. AP views are more useful for assessing facial bones, frontal sinuses, and general skull fractures. (B) Oblique View: The oblique view does not provide a direct or optimal visualization of the sella turcica. It is mainly used for assessing mandibular fractures and temporal bone structures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Craniopharyngioma Craniopharyngioma is the most common calcifying brain tumor in children. It arises from Rathke’s pouch remnants and is commonly located in the suprasellar region. Features supporting its identification include: • High prevalence of calcifications seen in up to 90% of cases on imaging (CT scan). • Mixed cystic and solid components, often appearing as a partially calcified suprasellar mass. • Slow-growing nature, leading to gradual onset of endocrine dysfunction (growth retardation, diabetes insipidus) due to pituitary involvement. • Compression of the optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopia. • Craniopharyngiomas are best diagnosed using CT (to detect calcifications) and MRI (for soft tissue characterization). Incorrect Options: (A) Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in children but rarely calcify. They are typically located in the cerebellum (posterior fossa) and often cause obstructive hydrocephalus. Unlike craniopharyngiomas, they enhance strongly on contrast imaging and may show dissemination via CSF. (C) Glioma: Gliomas (including pilocytic astrocytomas and diffuse gliomas) can calcify, but calcifications are less common compared to craniopharyngiomas. Pilocytic astrocytomas, particularly those in the optic pathway, can show some calcifications, but overall gliomas are not the most common calcifying tumors in children. (D) Meningioma: Meningiomas are rare in children and typically occur in adults. While they can show calcifications, they are more common in the elderly and have a dural-based attachment, distinguishing them from craniopharyngiomas.",

This view is obtained by: • Positioning the patient with the forehead and nose against the X-ray plate. • Tilting the X-ray beam 15–20 degrees caudally (downward). This technique enhances visualization of the: • Supraorbital fissure, which is located between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. • Orbital rims, frontal sinuses, and ethmoid air cells. • Superior orbital fissure syndrome, which may be associated with trauma or tumors affecting cranial nerves passing through the fissure. Incorrect Options: (A) Towne’s View: The Towne’s view is primarily used for visualizing the occipital bone, posterior cranial fossa, and foramen magnum. It is not the best view for the supraorbital fissure, as it does not provide optimal angulation for its assessment. (C) AP View: A standard Anteroposterior (AP) view does not provide sufficient detail for the supraorbital fissure, as overlapping skull structures can obscure the fissure. AP views are better suited for evaluating general skull fractures and gross abnormalities.

Incorrect Options: (A) Germ Cell Tumors: Germ cell tumors (GCTs), particularly germinomas and yolk sac tumors, often spread via CSF dissemination. These tumors commonly arise in midline locations (pineal and suprasellar regions) and may lead to leptomeningeal spread. (B) Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastomas are highly malignant and known for CSF dissemination, which can cause \"drop metastases\" in the spinal cord.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gadolinium-enhanced MRI Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the investigation of choice for diagnosing vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) due to its superior soft tissue contrast and ability to detect small tumors. Vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors of the Schwann cells, arising from the vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve. MRI with gadolinium contrast provides: • High-resolution imaging of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and internal auditory canal (IAC), where these tumors are commonly located. • Early detection of small tumors, even those confined to the IAC. • Differentiation of tumor from surrounding structures such as the brainstem and cochlear nerve. • Assessment of tumor extent, brainstem compression, and hydrocephalus, if present. Thus, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the gold standard for confirming vestibular schwannoma. Incorrect Options: (A) Contrast-enhanced CT scan: CT scans can detect larger vestibular schwannomas but are less sensitive than MRI, particularly for small tumors confined to the internal auditory canal. CT may help identify bony changes in the IAC but lacks the soft tissue resolution required for definitive diagnosis. (C) SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography): SPECT is primarily used for functional imaging (e.g., in epilepsy or tumor metabolism studies). It is not a standard imaging modality for vestibular schwannoma and lacks the spatial resolution needed for early tumor detection. (D) PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography): PET scans are useful in detecting metabolic activity in malignant tumors but vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors with low metabolic activity. PET is not required for diagnosis or management of vestibular schwannoma.",

This is a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic vascular disease that causes segmental stenosis and dilation of the arterial wall, leading to the characteristic string-of-beads pattern on imaging. Key features of FMD: • Commonly affects the renal and internal carotid arteries. • More common in young and middle-aged women. • Leads to cerebrovascular symptoms, including transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), strokes, and headaches. • Angiography shows alternating areas of stenosis and dilation, resembling a \"beaded\" pattern. This unique angiographic appearance is diagnostic for fibromuscular dysplasia. Incorrect Options: (A) Takayasu’s Disease: • Takayasu’s arteritis is a large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and its major branches. • Angiographic findings include occlusions, stenosis, and aneurysms, but not a beaded appearance. • Common in young women, particularly in Asia. (B) Non-specific Aortoarteritis: • A general term often referring to Takayasu’s arteritis, with similar findings of arterial narrowing, stenosis, and occlusions. • Does not produce the characteristic \"beaded\" appearance seen in FMD. (D) Rendu-Osler-Weber Disease (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia - HHT): • A genetic disorder causing vascular malformations, including telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). • Does not cause the segmental narrowing and dilation seen in FMD. • Angiographic findings in HHT include AVMs rather than the \"pile of plates\" appearance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Injury to bridging veins A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura mater (the outer protective covering of the brain) and the arachnoid mater. This condition most commonly results from the tearing of bridging veins that traverse this space. These veins are susceptible to injury, especially during rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head, such as in falls, motor vehicle accidents, or assaults. When these veins tear, blood accumulates in the subdural space, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain damage. Incorrect Options: (A) Rupture of intracranial aneurysm: The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm typically leads to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, where blood accumulates between the arachnoid mater and pia mater. This condition presents differently from a subdural hematoma and is associated with sudden, severe headaches and rapid neurological decline. (B) Rupture of cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM): A ruptured cerebral AVM can cause bleeding within the brain tissue (intracerebral hemorrhage) or into the subarachnoid space, but it is not a common cause of subdural hematomas. AVMs are abnormal tangles of blood vessels connecting arteries and veins, which can disrupt normal blood flow and lead to hemorrhage upon rupture. (D) Hemophilia: Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder characterized by the inability of blood to clot properly, leading to excessive bleeding. While individuals with hemophilia are at a higher risk for various types of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhages, hemophilia itself does not directly cause subdural hematomas. However, if a person with hemophilia experiences head trauma, they are at an increased risk of developing a subdural hematoma due to their impaired clotting ability.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aneurysm A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refers to bleeding into the space between the brain and the tissues covering it, known as the subarachnoid space. The most common cause of spontaneous (non-traumatic) SAH is the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. An aneurysm is a weakened, balloon-like bulge in a blood vessel wall that can burst, leading to bleeding in the subarachnoid space. Approximately 85% of non-traumatic SAH cases are attributed to ruptured brain aneurysms. Incorrect Options: (A) Arteriovenous malformation (AVM): An AVM is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels connecting arteries and veins, which can rupture and cause bleeding. While AVMs can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage, they are a less common cause compared to aneurysm rupture. (B) Cavernous angioma: Also known as cavernous malformations, these are clusters of abnormal, dilated blood vessels. They are less likely to cause subarachnoid hemorrhage and more commonly result in intracerebral hemorrhage when they bleed. (D) Hypertension: Chronic high blood pressure is a significant risk factor for various types of intracerebral hemorrhages, particularly those occurring within the brain tissue itself.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Transfemoral route The transfemoral route is the most commonly used approach for performing cerebral angiography. In this procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area and navigated through the vascular system to the cerebral arteries. This approach is favored due to the femoral artery's large size and straight path to the aorta, facilitating easier catheterization and reducing the risk of complications. Incorrect Options: (B) Transaxillary route: Accessing the cerebral arteries via the axillary artery (located near the armpit) is less common. This route presents challenges due to the artery's smaller size and more tortuous path, increasing the complexity of the procedure and potential risks. (C) Direct carotid puncture: Directly puncturing the carotid artery in the neck was an early method for cerebral angiography but has largely been abandoned due to higher complication rates and patient discomfort. Modern techniques favor less invasive approaches. (D) Transbrachial route: The brachial artery, located in the arm, can be used for cerebral angiography but is less preferred. This route involves navigating through smaller and more tortuous vessels, which can increase procedural difficulty and risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) PET scan Differentiating between recurrent brain tumors and radiation-induced necrosis is a significant clinical challenge, as both conditions can present similarly on conventional imaging modalities. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans, particularly those utilizing amino acid tracers like 11C-methionine (MET), have demonstrated superior accuracy in distinguishing these entities. MET-PET leverages the increased amino acid transport in tumor cells compared to necrotic tissue, allowing for more precise differentiation. Studies have reported that MET-PET provides valuable diagnostic information in this context. Incorrect Options: (A) MRI: While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent anatomical detail, its ability to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis is limited, as both can appear similar on standard MRI sequences. (B) Contrast-enhanced MRI: Although adding contrast enhancement to MRI can highlight areas of blood-brain barrier disruption, it does not reliably distinguish between active tumor tissue and necrotic tissue resulting from radiation therapy. (D) CT scan: Computed Tomography (CT) scans are generally less sensitive than MRI in detecting brain abnormalities and are not effective in differentiating between tumor recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis.",

They typically originate in the sellar or suprasellar region, making them a prevalent diagnosis in pediatric patients with such imaging findings. Incorrect Options: (A) Pituitary adenoma: Pituitary adenomas are uncommon in children and typically present as solid masses within the sella turcica. They rarely extend into the suprasellar region or exhibit mixed cystic and solid components, making them an unlikely cause in this scenario. (C) Optic chiasmal glioma: Optic chiasmal gliomas are more commonly seen in younger children and are often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. These tumors usually present as solid masses centered on the optic chiasm and do not typically exhibit mixed cystic and solid characteristics. (D) Germinoma: Germinomas are rare intracranial germ cell tumors that can occur in the suprasellar region.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Reversal of blood flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery Subclavian steal syndrome occurs when there is significant stenosis or occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery, leading to a reversal of blood flow in the vertebral artery on the same side (ipsilateral) as the blockage. This reversal allows blood to bypass the obstructed subclavian artery segment, supplying the affected arm but potentially compromising cerebral circulation. Incorrect Options: (B) Reversal of blood flow in the contralateral carotid artery: The carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain, are typically not involved in the flow reversal associated with subclavian steal syndrome. Therefore, reversal of blood flow in the contralateral carotid artery is not characteristic of this condition. (C) Reversal of blood flow in the contralateral vertebral artery: In subclavian steal syndrome, the reversal of blood flow occurs in the vertebral artery on the same side as the subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion, not on the opposite side. Thus, contralateral vertebral artery flow reversal is not observed in this syndrome. (D) Bilateral reversal of blood flow in the vertebral arteries: Subclavian steal syndrome typically affects only one side, resulting in unilateral reversal of blood flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery. Bilateral reversal of blood flow in both vertebral arteries is not characteristic of this condition.",

In EEG (electroencephalography) recording, it is essential to prevent electrical noise and interference from external sources like power lines, radio signals, and electronic devices. By surrounding the EEG cabin with a continuous sheet of conductive material, the Faraday cage shields the delicate brainwave signals from electromagnetic disturbances, ensuring accurate readings. This principle is widely used in laboratories, MRI rooms, and sensitive electronic testing environments. Incorrect Options: (A) Maxwell cage: James Clerk Maxwell was a physicist known for his work on electromagnetism, but there is no such concept as a \"Maxwell cage\" in physics. This term is incorrect as Maxwell’s equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact but do not refer to electromagnetic shielding. (C) Edison's cage: Thomas Edison was a renowned inventor, but he did not develop a shielding technique for electromagnetic interference. The concept of shielding an EEG cabin using conductive material is not related to his work, making this answer incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Meningioma Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors arising from the meninges, the protective layers covering the brain and spinal cord. A characteristic imaging feature of meningiomas is dural enhancement with a tail, seen on contrast-enhanced MRI. This \"dural tail sign\" appears as a linear enhancement extending along the dura adjacent to the tumor. It represents reactive changes in the dura rather than direct tumor infiltration. Meningiomas are usually slow-growing, well-circumscribed, and often calcified. They commonly present with symptoms related to compression of adjacent brain structures rather than direct invasion. Incorrect Options: (A) Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastomas are highly malignant pediatric brain tumors that originate in the cerebellum. They are usually intra-axial (within the brain parenchyma) and do not exhibit dural enhancement with a tail. Instead, they are associated with hydrocephalus and CSF dissemination, making this an incorrect choice. (C) Glioma: Gliomas, including astrocytomas and glioblastomas, are primary brain tumors that arise within the brain parenchyma. These tumors do not originate from the meninges and therefore do not show the dural tail sign. Instead, they present with infiltrative growth patterns and irregular contrast enhancement. (D) Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma): Acoustic neuromas are benign tumors arising from the Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). They are found in the cerebellopontine angle and show homogeneous contrast enhancement but do not typically exhibit dural enhancement with a tail.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ballooning of sella Ballooning of the sella is not a direct sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICT). It is typically associated with pituitary disorders, such as a pituitary adenoma or empty sella syndrome, rather than a general increase in intracranial pressure. In cases of pituitary adenomas, the sella turcica expands due to the tumor's growth. In empty sella syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fills the sella, causing its enlargement. Since ballooning of the sella is not primarily linked to raised ICT, it is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Copper beaten appearance: This refers to multiple impressions on the inner table of the skull, resembling hammered copper. It occurs due to chronic raised intracranial pressure, which leads to pressure-induced remodeling of the skull bones. This is a well-recognized sign of increased ICT, making it an incorrect choice. (B) Erosion of dorsum sella: Chronic raised intracranial pressure can cause bony resorption of the dorsum sellae, the back portion of the sella turcica. This occurs due to persistent pressure changes in the intracranial cavity, commonly seen in conditions like hydrocephalus and intracranial tumors. Since it is associated with increased ICT, this option is incorrect. (D) Sutural diastasis: Sutural diastasis refers to the widening of cranial sutures, seen in cases of significantly increased ICT, especially in infants and young children with open fontanelles. It results from increased intracranial pressure pushing apart the sutures. Since it is a clear sign of raised ICT, this is an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) The Bare Orbit Sign is a radiological feature commonly associated with Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1). It occurs due to sphenoid wing dysplasia, which leads to the absence or hypoplasia of the greater sphenoid wing. As a result, the orbit appears “bare” or expanded on imaging, creating the characteristic bare orbit sign. This sign is often seen in conjunction with pulsating exophthalmos, as the brain pulsations transmit directly into the orbit due to the absent bone. NF1 is a genetic disorder affecting neural crest-derived tissues, leading to multiple cutaneous neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules. Incorrect Options: (B) Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2): Unlike NF1, NF2 primarily involves bilateral vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal tumors. Sphenoid wing dysplasia and the bare orbit sign are not typical features of NF2, making this an incorrect option. (C) Sturge-Weber Syndrome: Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder associated with port-wine stains, leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and tram-track calcifications on brain imaging. It does not cause sphenoid wing dysplasia or the bare orbit sign, so this is an incorrect choice. (D) Tuberous Sclerosis: Tuberous sclerosis is characterized by cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and giant cell astrocytomas. It does not involve sphenoid bone dysplasia or orbital abnormalities, so it is not associated with the bare orbit sign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ependymoma Ependymoma is not a feature of tuberous sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The most common central nervous system (CNS) findings in tuberous sclerosis include subependymal nodules, cortical tubers, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Ependymomas, on the other hand, arise from ependymal cells lining the ventricles and are not associated with tuberous sclerosis, making this the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Subependymal Nodules: These are calcified hamartomatous lesions that occur along the walls of the ventricles in tuberous sclerosis. They are one of the key radiological features seen on CT and MRI and can later develop into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). (B) Tubers: Cortical and subcortical tubers are hallmark features of tuberous sclerosis. These disorganized areas of cortical development contribute to the epilepsy and neurodevelopmental delays seen in affected individuals. (C) Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA): Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytomas (SEGAs) develop near the foramen of Monro and can cause hydrocephalus due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Wilson's Disease Wilson's disease is the most likely diagnosis in a 14-year-old with abnormal movements and MRI findings of bilateral striatum, thalami, midbrain, centrum semiovale, and asymmetrical diffuse white matter involvement. Wilson’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective copper metabolism due to mutations in the ATP7B gene, leading to copper accumulation in the liver, brain (especially basal ganglia), and other organs. Neurologically, Wilson’s disease primarily affects the basal ganglia, particularly the putamen and caudate nucleus, leading to movement disorders such as dystonia, tremors, chorea, and Parkinsonism-like symptoms. MRI in Wilson's disease typically shows hyperintensities in the basal ganglia, midbrain (the \"face of the giant panda\" sign), thalami, and brainstem, along with diffuse white matter changes. Incorrect Options: (B) Hallervorden-Spatz Disease (Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration - PKAN): This rare neurodegenerative disorder is associated with iron accumulation in the basal ganglia, particularly in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, leading to movement disorders. MRI typically shows the “eye of the tiger” sign, which is characterized by a central hyperintensity with surrounding hypointensity in the globus pallidus on T2-weighted images. Involvement of the thalami, midbrain, and diffuse white matter changes are not characteristic of Hallervorden-Spatz disease, making it less likely in this case. (C) Nigrostriatal Degeneration: This term broadly refers to disorders affecting the dopaminergic pathways of the nigrostriatal system, as seen in Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, nigrostriatal degeneration does not typically present in childhood or adolescence and does not involve diffuse white matter changes on MRI. (D) Parkinsonism: While Parkinsonism can present with basal ganglia involvement, it is extremely rare in children and is not associated with asymmetrical diffuse white matter involvement or thalami and midbrain abnormalities on MRI. Juvenile parkinsonism is usually due to genetic mutations (e.g., PARK2, PARK7) and does not match the MRI findings described in this case.",

Germinomas are the most common intracranial germ cell tumors, frequently occurring in the pineal and suprasellar regions. Their location explains the Parinaud’s syndrome (dorsal midbrain syndrome) due to compression of the tectal plate, leading to upward gaze palsy, loss of light reflex with preserved accommodation (light-near dissociation), nystagmus, and convergence issues. Imaging Characteristics: CT Scan: Typically appears homogenous and hyperdense MRI: Isointense on T1, Isointense on T2, with intense contrast enhancement Location: Pineal region and suprasellar region involvement is characteristic. Incorrect Options: (A) Teratoma: Teratomas are also germ cell tumors but typically contain fat, calcifications, and cystic components, leading to heterogeneous rather than homogeneous imaging findings. They do not usually enhance intensely with contrast like germinomas. (C) Dermoid Cyst: Dermoid cysts are congenital lesions that often contain fat, calcifications, and sometimes hair or sebaceous material on imaging. On MRI, they typically show hyperintensity on T1 due to fat content and are not homogenous like a germinoma. (D) Choroid Plexus Carcinoma: This is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the choroid plexus and is more commonly seen in infants.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Moyamoya Disease Moyamoya disease is characterized by a \"puff of smoke\" appearance on cerebral angiography due to progressive stenosis of the distal internal carotid arteries and the formation of an extensive network of small collateral vessels. The name Moyamoya, meaning \"hazy puff of smoke\" in Japanese, describes this characteristic angiographic pattern. Pathophysiology: Moyamoya disease leads to progressive occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), mainly at its bifurcation into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). In response to ischemia, an abnormal network of tiny collateral vessels develops at the base of the brain. These fragile collateral vessels give the angiographic appearance of wispy smoke-like projections. Clinical Features: It commonly presents with ischemic strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in children. In adults, it can also present with intracranial hemorrhages due to fragile collaterals. Symptoms include weakness, speech difficulties, seizures, and cognitive impairment. Incorrect Options: (A) ACA Aneurysm: Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysms typically present as saccular or fusiform dilations rather than a diffuse \"puff of smoke\" pattern. Ruptured ACA aneurysms often cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but do not produce the characteristic collateral vessel network seen in Moyamoya disease. (B) Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: This condition results from infection or thrombosis in the cavernous sinus, leading to cranial nerve palsies, orbital swelling, and proptosis. Angiography shows venous congestion or thrombosis, but not the characteristic collateral network of Moyamoya disease. (D) Vein of Galen Malformation: This is a congenital arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the vein of Galen, leading to high-flow arteriovenous shunting. Angiography shows a large, dilated vein of Galen with direct arteriovenous shunts, rather than a diffuse collateral network.",

Expansion of the contrast-filled space suggests a lesion within the dura but outside the spinal cord (intradural extramedullary tumor). These tumors displace the spinal cord without infiltrating it, leading to widening of the contrast-filled subarachnoid space on imaging. Meningiomas and Schwannomas are the most common intradural extramedullary tumors and are often well-demarcated, slow-growing lesions. Incorrect Options: (A) Intramedullary Tumor: These tumors are within the spinal cord parenchyma and cause narrowing rather than expansion of the contrast-filled space. Common examples include ependymomas and astrocytomas. (C) Spinal Dysraphism: Spinal dysraphism refers to congenital spinal cord defects, such as spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome. Myelography might show an abnormal cord position or filling defects, but it does not typically cause an expansion of the contrast-filled space.
