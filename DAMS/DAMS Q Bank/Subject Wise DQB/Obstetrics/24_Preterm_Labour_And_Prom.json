      "solution": "Correct Answer: (C) Perform sterile speculum examination The first step in the management of a primipara with sudden onset vaginal discharge at 32 weeks of pregnancy is to perform a sterile speculum examination. This is done to assess the nature of the discharge, rule out amniotic fluid leakage (such as in cases of premature rupture of membranes), and identify any possible signs of infection or other underlying causes of the discharge. A speculum examination is essential to gather information about the cervix, whether there are any signs of preterm labor, and to confirm the status of the membranes (intact or ruptured). This examination is the most appropriate and least invasive initial step before deciding on further interventions. Option A: Start broad spectrum antibiotics – Incorrect While antibiotics may be necessary if there is a confirmed infection (such as chorioamnionitis or a suspected intra-amniotic infection), it is premature to start broad-spectrum antibiotics without understanding the cause of the vaginal discharge. The first step is to assess the discharge and check for signs of infection or membrane rupture. Antibiotics should only be administered if infection is suspected after performing a speculum examination or if clinical signs suggest an infection. Option B: Start corticosteroid – Incorrect Corticosteroids, such as betamethasone, are used in cases of preterm labor to promote fetal lung maturity. However, this is not the first intervention for a patient presenting with vaginal discharge without any other signs of preterm labor, such as contractions or cervical changes. The first step is to evaluate the cause of the discharge through a speculum examination. Corticosteroids should be administered if preterm labor is confirmed or strongly suspected, but not as a first step without further evaluation. Option D: Perform sterile vaginal examination – Incorrect While a sterile vaginal examination can provide important information about cervical dilation, effacement, and presentation, it is not the first step in this case. A speculum examination is preferred because it allows the clinician to visually inspect the vaginal canal, cervix, and discharge in a non-invasive manner and also helps to check if the membranes have ruptured. Performing a vaginal examination too early could introduce infection or irritate the cervix, especially if there is concern about ruptured membranes.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 12 mg betamethasone injection In a G2P1 female at 35 weeks experiencing uterine contractions but no fetal distress and intact membranes, the appropriate intervention is to administer 12 mg betamethasone (a corticosteroid) to promote fetal lung maturity. Corticosteroids like betamethasone are recommended between 24-34 weeks for preterm labor to accelerate fetal lung development. However, it can still be given up to 36+6 weeks if preterm labor is imminent, as it can still provide benefit in improving neonatal outcomes such as reducing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. This patient is at 35 weeks, so corticosteroids would be appropriate in this scenario to enhance fetal lung development in case of an early delivery. Option B: Vaginal swab culture – Incorrect A vaginal swab culture might be indicated in specific cases where there is concern for an infection, such as in suspected chorioamnionitis or to assess for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization, but it is not indicated as an immediate intervention in this scenario of preterm labor without signs of infection. The patient is presenting with contractions but no fetal distress or ruptured membranes. Antibiotic therapy in the absence of a confirmed infection or GBS indication is not recommended in this setting. Thus, a vaginal swab culture is unnecessary at this moment. Option C: Tocolytic therapy – Incorrect Tocolytic therapy (e.g., magnesium sulfate, terbutaline) is typically used to delay preterm labor and improve outcomes by buying time for steroid administration and transfer to a facility with appropriate neonatal care. However, beyond 34 weeks, tocolysis is not routinely given unless there are clear indications for delaying labor for a specific reason (e.g., the need to transfer the patient). Since this patient is 35 weeks pregnant, tocolytic therapy is generally not recommended, as the benefits of delaying labor are limited at this stage. Option D: Cervical cerclage – Incorrect Cervical cerclage is a procedure used to reinforce the cervix in cases of cervical insufficiency (e.g., when there is a risk of spontaneous preterm birth due to cervical shortening or dilation before 24 weeks). It is not indicated for preterm labor that occurs after 24 weeks and certainly not at 35 weeks when the cervix may already be naturally changing in preparation for labor. In fact, performing cerclage at this stage can increase the risk of infection or injury and is not recommended for managing preterm labor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is alkaline The nitrazine test is used to detect premature rupture of membranes (PROM) by measuring the pH of vaginal secretions. Amniotic fluid is alkaline (pH 7.0-7.5), and when nitrazine paper is introduced to amniotic fluid, it changes color from yellow to blue, indicating the presence of alkaline amniotic fluid. However, blood in the vaginal area can interfere with this test because it is also alkaline (pH 7.35-7.45). As a result, blood can cause the nitrazine paper to turn blue, potentially leading to a false positive result for PROM. This is why blood in the vaginal environment can interfere with the accuracy of the nitrazine test. Option A: It is acid – Incorrect Blood is not acidic. It has a slightly alkaline pH, typically ranging from 7.35 to 7.45, which is in the neutral to slightly alkaline range. Therefore, blood would not cause the nitrazine paper to remain yellow, which would be indicative of an acidic environment like vaginal discharge. This makes option A incorrect. Option C: It contains increased amounts of sodium chloride – Incorrect While blood contains electrolytes, including sodium chloride, the alkaline nature of blood is primarily due to the bicarbonate buffer system and not the amount of sodium chloride. Even though sodium chloride may slightly affect the pH of the vaginal secretions, it is the alkaline pH of blood that directly interferes with the nitrazine test. This makes option C incorrect because the key factor here is pH, not sodium chloride concentration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Nifedipine Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is commonly used to manage preterm labor by inhibiting uterine contractions. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles of the uterus through its calcium-blocking action, reducing the frequency and intensity of contractions. Nifedipine is favored for its safety profile and fewer side effects compared to other tocolytic drugs. Common side effects are generally mild and may include flushing and headache, but it is generally considered well-tolerated, especially when used in a short-term context. It is an effective tocolytic with relatively fewer risks to both the mother and fetus compared to other options. Option A: Ritodrine – Incorrect Ritodrine is a beta-adrenergic agonist used as a tocolytic to reduce uterine contractions in preterm labor. However, it is associated with a number of serious side effects, such as tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and elevated blood glucose levels. Due to its side effect profile, ritodrine is less commonly used today for managing preterm labor, as it carries more risks to both the mother and fetus compared to nifedipine. This makes ritodrine less favorable in practice, especially when there are safer alternatives available. Option C: Magnesium sulfate – Incorrect Magnesium sulfate is another commonly used tocolytic agent, particularly when trying to delay labor for neonatal neuroprotection (such as reducing the risk of cerebral palsy in preterm infants). While magnesium sulfate is effective, its side effects can include hypotension, respiratory depression, and hypermagnesemia, which can be dangerous in certain cases. Additionally, magnesium sulfate is not as effective as nifedipine for routine tocolysis in managing preterm labor, especially when considering side effect profiles. Its use is generally more specialized and requires careful monitoring. Option D: Progesterone – Incorrect Progesterone is not a tocolytic agent. While progesterone (often in the form of micronized progesterone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate) is used to prevent preterm labor by maintaining uterine quiescence, it is not used to actively stop contractions once preterm labor has already started. Progesterone works as a prophylactic agent to reduce the risk of preterm labor, not to treat active labor. Therefore, it is not a first-line treatment for reducing uterine contractions once preterm labor is underway.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) General anesthesia In the case of umbilical cord prolapse with rupture of membranes, an urgent cesarean section is necessary to prevent cord compression and fetal hypoxia. Given the emergency nature of the situation, general anesthesia is the most appropriate anesthetic technique. This is because general anesthesia provides rapid onset and is the quickest option in urgent situations, where time is of the essence. The patient may not have sufficient time to be adequately prepared for spinal or epidural anesthesia, and general anesthesia ensures that the procedure can begin immediately, minimizing potential risks to both the mother and fetus. Option A: Paracervical block – Incorrect A paracervical block is a local anesthetic technique used primarily during labor to provide pain relief in the first stage of labor. However, it is not suitable for cesarean section procedures because it does not provide sufficient anesthesia for abdominal surgery. Furthermore, a paracervical block is not effective for relieving pain associated with surgical incisions in the abdominal wall, and its use in an emergency cesarean section could delay the procedure, which is critical in the case of cord prolapse. Option B: Spinal block – Incorrect While a spinal block is commonly used in cesarean sections and provides rapid and complete anesthesia for the lower abdomen, it requires time for placement, and the patient needs to be in a specific position. In an emergency situation like cord prolapse, where rapid delivery is needed, spinal anesthesia might not be the most appropriate choice, as it may delay the procedure compared to general anesthesia. Moreover, achieving an adequate spinal block in an urgent setting could be challenging due to the mother's discomfort or stress, and a rapid general anesthetic induction is preferred in these cases. Option C: Epidural block – Incorrect An epidural block is often used for pain relief during labor and delivery, but it is not suitable for an urgent cesarean section due to the time required to achieve adequate anesthesia. The placement of an epidural catheter can take longer than spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia, making it less ideal in an emergency situation where rapid delivery is necessary. In addition, an epidural does not provide as complete anesthesia as general anesthesia for an abdominal surgery like a cesarean section.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) This patient with premature rupture of membranes (PROM) has a physical examinaon consistent with an intrauterine infection or chorioamnionitis. Chorioamnionitis can be diagnosed clinically by the presence of maternal fever, tachycardia, and uterine tenderness. Leukocyte counts are a nonspeci?c indicator of infection because they can be elevated with labor and the use of corticosteroids. When chorioamnionitis is diagnosed, fetal and maternal morbidity increases and delivery is indicated regardless of the fetus’s gestational age. In the case described, antibiotics need to be administered to avoid neonatal sepsis. Ampicillin is the drug of choice to treat group B streptococcal infection. Since the fetal heart rate is reactive, there is no indication for caesarean section. Augmentation with Pitocin should be instituted as indicated. There is no role for tocolysis in the setting of chorioamnionitis, since delivery is the goal. There is also no role for the administration of steroids, since delivery is imminent. In addition, steroids are indicated at 32 weeks gestational age or less only with PROM",

Therefore, treatment is aimed at delaying delivery to allow continued fetal growth and maturity. The administration of tocolytic therapy to treat the preterm contractions is indicated. In addition, from 24 to 34 weeks, management also includes the administration of steroids, such as betamethasone, to promote fetal lung maturity. Respiratory distress syndrome is a sequela of preterm neonates and occurs less often in infants given betamethasone in utero. MgSO4 is given before 32 weeks for neuro protection. It is advantageous to obtain a neonatology consult on any patient who appears to be in preterm labor so the parents know what to expect if they give birth to preterm infants.

Fetal fibronectin is a glycoprotein found at the interface of the chorion and decidua. It normally is absent from cervical-vaginal secretions after 22 weeks of gestation. A positive fFN test (presence of fFN in vaginal secretions) indicates disruption of this maternal-fetal interface and correlates with a high risk of delivery within the next 7–14 days. A negative fFN test is highly reassuring and has a high negative predictive value, meaning preterm labor is unlikely in the near future.

The mechanism likely involves the production of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes (such as proteases and phospholipases) that can weaken fetal membranes and stimulate uterine contractions. BV increases the risk of ascending infection, which can trigger an inflammatory response in the uterus, ultimately leading to early cervical changes and uterine contractions that cause preterm labor.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Administer tocolytics and corticosteroids In a woman presenting at 32 weeks of gestation with painful contractions and cervical dilation of 3 cm, the clinical picture is consistent with preterm labor. At this gestational age, the goal of initial management is to delay delivery long enough to enhance fetal maturity and reduce neonatal complications. Tocolytics (e.g., nifedipine, indomethacin, or terbutaline) are used to suppress uterine contractions temporarily, typically for 48 hours. This delay provides a crucial window during which antenatal corticosteroids (like betamethasone or dexamethasone) can be administered to accelerate fetal lung maturation, significantly reducing the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The combination of tocolytics and corticosteroids represents the best initial step in managing preterm labor at 32 weeks, assuming no contraindications to delaying labor",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Non reassuring FHR A non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern indicates potential fetal compromise, such as hypoxia or acidosis. In this situation, the priority is expedited delivery, not prolongation of pregnancy. Tocolysis is absolutely contraindicated in this setting because delaying labor may worsen fetal outcomes and increase the risk of fetal demise. Tocolytic agents suppress uterine contractions but do not address the underlying cause of fetal distress. Therefore, administering tocolytics in the context of a non-reassuring FHR could result in catastrophic outcomes by postponing necessary delivery. This is a classic absolute contraindication to tocolysis, as fetal well-being takes precedence over attempts to prolong gestation",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 6mg four times 12 hrs apart In cases of preterm labor, antenatal corticosteroids are administered to promote fetal lung maturity and reduce the risk of complications such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Dexamethasone is one of the two standard corticosteroids used for this purpose (the other being betamethasone). The recommended regimen for dexamethasone is 6 mg intramuscularly every 12 hours for a total of 4 doses (i.e., 6 mg × 4 doses = 24 mg over 48 hours). This dosing schedule ensures sufficient corticosteroid exposure to accelerate the production of surfactant in the fetal lungs, significantly improving neonatal outcomes in preterm birth. This regimen is well-studied, endorsed by major obstetric guidelines, and is the standard of care in many healthcare settings.",
