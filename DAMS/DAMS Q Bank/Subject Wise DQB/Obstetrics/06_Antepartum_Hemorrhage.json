      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Risk Factors for Placenta Previa Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. Several maternal, obstetric, and environmental factors increase the risk of this condition. Maternal Risk Factors 1. Advanced Maternal Age: • Women aged ?35 years are at higher risk due to increased uterine scarring and vascular changes. 2. High Parity: • Multiple pregnancies (grand multiparity) are associated with increased uterine scarring and structural changes. 3. Prior Placenta Previa: • A history of placenta previa increases the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. 4. Smoking: • Smoking is associated with abnormal placental implantation and an increased risk of previa. 5. Cocaine Use: • Cocaine use during pregnancy has been linked to placental abnormalities, including previa. Obstetric Risk Factors 1. Previous Cesarean Delivery: • The risk of placenta previa increases with the number of prior cesarean deliveries due to uterine scarring: • 1 cesarean: 1–4% risk. • ?3 cesareans: Up to 10% risk. 2. Uterine Surgery or Scarring: • History of procedures like: • Dilation and Curettage (D&C). • Myomectomy. • Endometrial ablation. • These procedures increase the likelihood of abnormal placental implantation. 3. Multiple Gestation: • Twins or higher-order pregnancies increase placental mass, raising the risk of abnormal implantation. 4. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART): • In vitro fertilization (IVF) and other ART methods are associated with an increased risk of placenta previa. 5. Short Interpregnancy Interval: • A short interval between pregnancies may not allow sufficient healing of the endometrium, increasing the risk.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Macafee and Johnson regimen. The Macafee and Johnson regimen is a systematic approach used in the expectant management of placenta previa to prolong pregnancy and minimize maternal and fetal complications. The goal is to achieve fetal maturity while reducing the risk of hemorrhage and preterm birth. This regimen includes: 1. Hospitalization: Immediate admission after diagnosis, particularly if bleeding occurs. 2. Bed Rest: To reduce physical activity that may provoke bleeding. 3. Blood Transfusion and Cross-Matching: Preparedness for managing hemorrhage. 4. Fetal Monitoring: Regular assessments to ensure fetal well-being. 5. Delivery Planning: Cesarean section at 36–37 weeks or earlier if complications arise. This regimen has significantly improved outcomes in pregnancies complicated by placenta previa. Reasons Why Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Liley’s Method: • Incorrect because Liley’s method is used for managing fetal hemolytic disease caused by Rh incompatibility. It involves monitoring amniotic fluid bilirubin levels to assess the severity of fetal anemia. This method is unrelated to the management of placenta previa. B) Crede’s Method: • Incorrect because Crede’s method is a manual technique used to assist with the delivery of the placenta during the third stage of labor. It involves controlled uterine compression to facilitate the separation and expulsion of the placenta. D) Brandt-Andrews Method: • Incorrect because the Brandt-Andrews maneuver is a technique used for controlled delivery of the placenta during the third stage of labor to prevent uterine inversion. This is not relevant to placenta previa management.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Conduct of expectant treatment: Bed rest with bathroom and toilet privileges. Investigations— like hemoglobin estimation, blood grouping and urine for protein are done. Periodic inspection of the vulval pads and fetal surveillance with USG at interval of 2–3 weeks . Supplementary hematinics should be given and the blood loss is replaced by adequate cross matched blood transfusion, if the patient is anemic. When the patient is allowed out of the bed (2-3 days after the bleeding stops), a gentle speculum (Cusco’s) examination is made to exclude local cervical and vaginal lesions for bleeding. However, their presence does not negate placenta previa. Use of tocolysis (magnesium sulfate) can be done if vaginal bleeding is associated with uterine contractions. Use of cervical cerclage to reduce bleeding and to prolong pregnancy is not helpful (RCOG 2005). Rh immunoglobin should be given to all Rh negative (unsensitized) women.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mother is hemodynamically stable. Why Option C is Correct: Conservative management of placenta previa involves delaying delivery to allow for fetal maturity while minimizing risks to the mother and baby. This approach is appropriate when the mother is hemodynamically stable, as it indicates no significant bleeding or maternal compromise. Stability allows close monitoring of both the mother and fetus in a controlled hospital setting until delivery is necessary. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Evidence of Fetal Distress • Incorrect because fetal distress (e.g., abnormal fetal heart rate patterns) requires immediate intervention to prevent fetal demise. Conservative management is contraindicated in this situation as the priority becomes immediate delivery, typically via cesarean section. B) Fetal Malformation • Incorrect because significant fetal malformations incompatible with life or leading to poor prognosis (e.g., anencephaly) may negate the benefits of prolonging pregnancy. In such cases, conservative management is often not indicated. D) Women in Labor • Incorrect because active labor in a woman with placenta previa increases the risk of severe hemorrhage due to placental detachment. Immediate delivery, usually via cesarean section, is required to ensure maternal and fetal safety.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Transverse lie. Transverse lie is not an absolute indication for the immediate termination of pregnancy in antepartum hemorrhage (APH). While it complicates delivery, it can often be managed without immediate termination if the mother and fetus are stable. The decision to deliver depends on gestational age, fetal well-being, and maternal condition. • In cases of transverse lie, external cephalic version (if the patient is eligible) or cesarean section may be planned, but it does not necessarily warrant urgent termination unless accompanied by other complications (e.g., fetal distress, maternal instability). Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) 37 Weeks • Incorrect because reaching 37 weeks of gestation (term) is an indication for termination in APH. At this point, the risks of continuing the pregnancy outweigh the benefits, and delivery is recommended to prevent maternal or fetal complications. B) IUD (Intrauterine Death) • Incorrect because intrauterine fetal death is an indication for termination. Continuing the pregnancy after fetal demise increases the risk of maternal complications such as coagulopathy (DIC) and infection. D) Continuous Bleeding • Incorrect because continuous bleeding in APH indicates ongoing maternal hemorrhage, which necessitates immediate termination of pregnancy to stabilize the mother and prevent life-threatening complications like hypovolemic shock.",

Grade 0 (Asymptomatic Abruption): • No clinical symptoms. • Diagnosis is made retrospectively after delivery through examination of the placenta. 2. Grade 1 (Mild Abruption): • Vaginal bleeding with mild uterine tenderness or irritability. • No maternal or fetal compromise. 3. Grade 2 (Moderate Abruption): • Vaginal bleeding and significant uterine tenderness. • Fetal distress may be present. • Maternal vital signs may indicate early shock. 4. Grade 3 (Severe Abruption): • Extensive vaginal bleeding or concealed hemorrhage. • Uterine rigidity, painful contractions. • Fetal death and maternal shock are common. • Complications such as DIC and hypovolemic shock are more likely. Why Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Johnson • Incorrect: The Johnson formula is used for estimating fetal weight based on symphysiofundal height, not for placental abruption grading.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) History of bleeding with increased uterine tone is suggestive of abruption The correct diagnosis in this case is Abruptio placenta (Option D). Here's why: Bleeding per vaginum: Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, can be a sign of placental abruption or placenta previa. Loss of fetal movement: This is a concerning sign, often indicating that the fetus is in distress, possibly due to reduced placental blood flow, which occurs in placental abruption. Contracted uterus with increased uterine tone: A rigid, contracted uterus with increased tone can be indicative of a placental abruption, as the uterus may be trying to expel the detached placenta, leading to uterine contractions and hypertonus. Absent fetal heart sounds: The absence of fetal heart tones strongly suggests fetal death, which can occur in placental abruption due to the loss of placental function. Why other options are less likely: A. Placenta previa: Placenta previa typically presents with painless bleeding, not associated with a contracted, hypertonic uterus or fetal heart sound absence. It also doesn't typically cause fetal death unless there's a significant delay in management. B. Hydramnios: This refers to an excess of amniotic fluid, which can cause complications but is not associated with bleeding, loss of fetal movement, or the hypertonic uterine contractions seen here. C. Premature labor: Although premature labor can present with contractions and bleeding, it wouldn't typically present with absent fetal heart tones unless there is another underlying cause like abruption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mortality rate of 20% with undiagnosed case. Here's why: Vasa previa is a condition where fetal blood vessels cross or run near the internal cervical os, often within the membranes, and is at risk of rupture during labor, leading to fetal hemorrhage. Let's go through the options: A. Incidence is 1 : 1500: This is true. Vasa previa occurs in about 1 in 1,500 pregnancies, which makes it a relatively rare but serious condition. B. Mortality rate of 20% with undiagnosed case: This is false. The mortality rate associated with undiagnosed vasa previa is actually much higher, often cited as around 60-100%. This is because undiagnosed vasa previa can lead to severe fetal hemorrhage during labor, resulting in high fetal mortality. C. Associated with low-lying placenta: This is true. Vasa previa is often associated with a low-lying placenta, or with conditions like velamentous cord insertion, where the fetal blood vessels are more vulnerable to rupture. D. Cesarean section is indicated: This is true. If vasa previa is diagnosed, a planned cesarean section is generally indicated to avoid the risk of vessel rupture during labor and to ensure the safety of the fetus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Kleihauer test. The Kleihauer-Betke test is specifically used to differentiate between maternal and fetal blood cells. It detects fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in maternal blood. The test works by using an acid-elution method to selectively stain fetal red blood cells, which are more resistant to acid than maternal cells. This allows for the identification and quantification of fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation. This test is often used when there is a concern about fetal-maternal hemorrhage, such as after trauma or bleeding during pregnancy, to assess the amount of fetal blood that has mixed with maternal blood. Other options: A. Apt test: The Apt test is used to differentiate between maternal and fetal blood in cases of suspected amniotic fluid leakage or vaginal bleeding. It is specifically used to distinguish fetal blood from maternal blood in the case of vaginal bleeding by identifying the presence of fetal hemoglobin. However, it is less commonly used compared to the Kleihauer-Betke test for differentiating fetal and maternal blood in general. C. Bubble test: The Bubble test is used to check for a fistula between the airways and the digestive tract (for example, in the diagnosis of tracheoesophageal fistula) and is not related to differentiating maternal and fetal blood cells. D. Lilly’s test: Lilly’s test is used to determine the presence of fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation, but it is not as commonly used or as specific as the Kleihauer-Betke test. It is more historical in nature and not commonly performed today.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Emergency CS. A 29-year-old G3P2 female at 32 weeks of gestation presents with vaginal bleeding, but without pain, and a fetal heart rate of 100 bpm. The primary concern here is the possibility of placental abruption (a condition where the placenta detaches prematurely from the uterine wall), especially because the bleeding is occurring without pain. Key Points: Vaginal bleeding in the second or third trimester without pain can be a sign of placenta previa (where the placenta covers or is near the cervix) or placental abruption. In placental abruption, there can be bleeding, fetal distress (the fetal heart rate of 100 bpm is concerning as it is on the lower end), and hypotension (her BP is 100/70, which could be a sign of shock or blood loss). Emergency cesarean section (CS) is indicated if there are signs of fetal distress and placental abruption is suspected, as placental abruption can lead to fetal compromise, hemorrhage, and can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby. Why the other options are less appropriate: A. Conservative management: Conservative management is not appropriate in this case, as the patient has vaginal bleeding and fetal distress. Conservative management could only be considered if there were no signs of fetal distress and the bleeding was not severe. C. Steroids followed by induction of labor: Steroids are typically given if there’s concern for preterm delivery to help mature the fetal lungs, but induction of labor is not ideal here because fetal distress is present. Induction could further compromise the fetus in case of placental abruption. D. Steroids followed by CS: While steroids may be given for fetal lung maturation in preterm labor, the priority here is immediate delivery by cesarean section due to the risk of placental abruption and fetal compromise, making this option suboptimal in comparison to direct emergency CS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) TVS (Transvaginal Sonography). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) is the initial and most accurate imaging technique for detecting an abnormally located placenta, especially in cases of suspected placenta previa (where the placenta covers or is near the cervix). TVS provides clear, detailed imaging of the cervix and lower uterine segment, which is essential for diagnosing placenta previa and determining its proximity to the cervical os. Why the other options are less appropriate: B. TAS (Transabdominal Sonography): While transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) is commonly used to assess fetal growth and general pregnancy status, it is less precise for diagnosing placenta previa or abnormal placental location, particularly in the lower uterine segment, compared to TVS. C. Doppler: Doppler ultrasound is used to assess blood flow, including in the umbilical cord and placental vessels, but it does not directly detect abnormal placental location. It is more useful in evaluating placental insufficiency or fetal well-being. D. MRI: MRI can be used in some complicated cases for further evaluation of placental abnormalities (such as placenta accreta, where the placenta invades the uterine wall), but it is not the first-line imaging method for detecting abnormally located placentas. It is more commonly used for detailed anatomy or when other imaging results are unclear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) i.e. Abruption = 1 in 200 deliveries Placenta previa=1 in 300-400 deliveries Vasa previa=1 in 2000-3000 deliveries Placenta previa=1 in 533 deliveries 1. Abruptio Placenta (Placental Abruption) Definition: Placental abruption is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. It typically occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy. Clinical Features: Vaginal bleeding (may be concealed or visible). Abdominal pain (usually sudden and severe). Uterine tenderness and rigidity due to contractions. Fetal distress (reduced fetal heart rate, decreased fetal movement). Shock (in severe cases, due to blood loss). Risk Factors: Trauma (e.g., accidents). Hypertension (pre-eclampsia). Smoking or substance abuse. Previous placental abruption. Advanced maternal age. Multiple pregnancies (twins or more). Management: Depends on the severity of the condition and gestational age. For mild cases, conservative management with close monitoring might be enough. Severe cases require an emergency cesarean section to prevent fetal and maternal complications. Complications: Fetal death. Maternal hemorrhage and shock. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 2. Placenta Previa Definition: Placenta previa occurs when the placenta is located in the lower segment of the uterus, partially or completely covering the cervix. Clinical Features: Painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. No abdominal pain, unlike placental abruption. Fetal presentation issues (e.g., breech or transverse lie). Risk Factors: Previous cesarean section. Advanced maternal age. Multiple pregnancies. Uterine scarring (from previous surgery or infections). Management: Cesarean section is the preferred method of delivery, especially if the placenta is covering the cervix completely. If the placenta is low-lying but not covering the cervix, vaginal delivery might be attempted if there is no active bleeding. Steroids are often given if preterm delivery is anticipated. Complications: Massive bleeding during labor and delivery. Premature delivery due to bleeding or intervention. Fetal hypoxia or distress. 3. Vasa Previa Definition: Vasa previa is a rare condition where fetal blood vessels run across or near the internal cervical os, often associated with velamentous cord insertion (when the umbilical cord inserts into the membranes rather than the placenta). Clinical Features: Painless vaginal bleeding (often during labor or rupture of membranes). Fetal distress (due to rupture of blood vessels, leading to fetal hemorrhage). The condition can lead to fetal exsanguination if blood vessels rupture. Risk Factors: Velamentous cord insertion. Multiple gestation (twins or more). Low-lying placenta. Management: Emergency cesarean section is required to prevent fetal death due to massive hemorrhage. Prenatal diagnosis is crucial (usually via color Doppler ultrasound). Complications: Fetal death due to rupture of vessels. Premature delivery if diagnosed early. 4. Placenta Accreta Definition: Placenta accreta occurs when the placenta attaches too deeply into the uterine wall, without proper separation after delivery. It can be classified into three categories based on the depth of invasion: Placenta accreta: Placenta invades the myometrium (muscle layer). Placenta increta: Placenta invades deeper into the myometrium. Placenta percreta: Placenta penetrates through the uterine wall. Clinical Features: No significant vaginal bleeding before delivery. Severe bleeding after delivery due to difficulty in detaching the placenta. Risk of uterine rupture and hemorrhage. Risk Factors: Previous cesarean section (especially if multiple). Previous uterine surgeries. Advanced maternal age. Multiple pregnancies. Management: Pre-surgical planning is necessary. Often requires a cesarean section followed by hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) in severe cases to control bleeding and prevent maternal mortality. In some cases, if the placenta is only mildly adherent, conservative management may be attempted with careful monitoring. Complications: Severe postpartum hemorrhage. Need for hysterectomy. Increased risk of maternal mortality if not properly managed.",

When fetal vessels cross the internal os (vasa previa), rupture of membranes may be accompanied by rupture of a fetal vessel leading to fetal exsanguination.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Prior cesarean delivery and placenta previa, especially an anteriorly located placenta, increase your risk of placenta accreta, increta, and percreta. Placenta accreta, increta, or percreta are treated with hysterectomy. Advancing maternal age, multiparity, prior cesarean delivery, and smoking are associated with previa. Painless bleeding is the most common symptom, and is rarely fatal. Vaginal examination to evaluate for placenta previa is never permissible unless the woman is in the operating room prepared for immediate cesarean delivery, because even the most gentle examination can cause torrential hemorrhage. These “double setup” examinations are rarely necessary because ultrasound is usually readily available to make the diagnosis of placenta previa. Cesarean delivery is necessary in practically all cases of previa",

Intravenous hydration is appropriate because dehydration can be a cause of premature contractions and uterine irritability. Urinary infections can be associated with uterine contractions, and therefore a urinalysis and urine culture should be obtained. Infection caused by group B streptococci can be associated with preterm labor, so a culture to detect this organism should be obtained. Before performing a digital examination on this patient to determine her cervical status, an ultrasound should be performed to rule out placenta previa in light of the history of vaginal bleeding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Abruptio placentae Varities of abruptio: A) Revealed variety: Following separation of the placenta , the blood insinuates between the membranes and the decidua. Ultimately, the blood comes out of the cervical canal to be visible externally B) Concealed variety: Blood collected behind placenta> Enters myometrium> Uterus appears bluish /wine coloured ,k/a Couvelaire uterus . Not an Indication for Hysterectomy. Couvelaire uterus (also called uteroplacental apoplexy) is a rare but serious condition that occurs when there is massive bleeding into the myometrium (the muscular layer of the uterus) due to placental abruption. It is a form of complicated placental abruption where blood accumulates between the uterine wall and the placenta or into the muscle of the uterus itself, causing the uterus to appear blue or purple (hence the term \"couvelaire\"). Key Features of Couvelaire Uterus: Cause: It is most commonly a complication of placental abruption, where the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall, leading to bleeding. In severe cases, the blood can infiltrate the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus) causing a couvelaire uterus. This condition can occur with both concealed and overt placental abruption. Clinical Presentation: Vaginal bleeding (can be substantial depending on the severity of abruption). Uterine tenderness and rigidity due to blood accumulation in the uterus. Shock and signs of hypovolemic shock (low blood pressure, tachycardia, pallor, etc.) due to massive blood loss. Fetal distress or fetal death due to compromised placental blood flow and hemorrhage. Pain: The condition can cause severe abdominal pain due to uterine contractions and bleeding. Pathophysiology: In couvelaire uterus, blood from a ruptured placental site or detached placenta infiltrates the uterine muscle (myometrium), leading to hemorrhagic infarction of the uterine tissue. The uterus becomes distended and appears purple, blue, or black on inspection due to the accumulation of blood. This may compromise uterine contractility and increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Diagnosis: Clinical evaluation: The diagnosis is often suspected based on the clinical presentation of placental abruption with associated severe bleeding and signs of shock. Ultrasound may show retroplacental hematoma (blood collection behind the placenta), but the definitive diagnosis is often made after delivery. Visual inspection of the uterus after delivery during a cesarean section or vaginal delivery can reveal a couvelaire uterus (bluish or purple appearance of the uterine wall).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The initial hemorrhage is usually painless and rarely fatal. A. Its incidence decreases with maternal age: This statement is false. The incidence of placenta previa actually increases with maternal age, especially in women over 35. Older women are more likely to have previous cesarean sections, which is a risk factor for placenta previa. Therefore, the incidence does not decrease with maternal age. B. Its incidence is unaffected by parity: This statement is false. The incidence of placenta previa actually increases with parity (number of previous pregnancies). Women who have had multiple pregnancies are at a higher risk of developing placenta previa due to changes in the shape and size of the uterus, as well as scarring from previous cesarean sections or other uterine surgeries. C. The initial hemorrhage is usually painless and rarely fatal: This statement is true. One of the hallmark signs of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. The bleeding occurs because the placenta is implanted near or over the cervix, and as the cervix begins to dilate, blood vessels can rupture without causing pain. Although the bleeding can be profuse, it is rarely fatal with proper management. However, it can lead to complications like preterm birth and fetal distress if not managed carefully. D. Management no longer includes a double setup: This statement is false. Double setup refers to the practice of preparing both the operating room and the labor room when dealing with placenta previa, especially when performing a vaginal examination. The concept behind double setup is to ensure that, if the placenta previa is diagnosed, an immediate cesarean section can be performed if necessary. While practices may vary and evolve, double setup is still often recommended in situations where there is significant bleeding or the diagnosis is unclear, especially in high-risk pregnancies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Placental abruption. Here’s the reasoning for the diagnosis: This 22-year-old G1P0 woman at 36 weeks of pregnancy presents with severe abdominal pain, profuse vaginal bleeding, and signs of hypovolemic shock (BP 90/50 mm Hg, pulse rate 120 beats per minute). She is unstable, and her abdomen is described as rigid, which are all concerning signs. The situation, combined with her clinical presentation, suggests placental abruption. Why placental abruption is the most likely diagnosis: Placental abruption occurs when the placenta prematurely detaches from the uterine wall, leading to bleeding and compromised blood flow to the fetus. This condition can result in severe abdominal pain, profuse vaginal bleeding, and rigid abdomen due to uterine contractions and blood accumulation behind the placenta. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's vital signs (low BP, high pulse rate) and blood loss (at least 500 mL reported) suggest she is losing significant blood volume. Placental abruption can cause heavy bleeding, leading to shock. Pain and fetal compromise: The patient is in significant pain and unable to answer questions, likely due to the severe discomfort caused by the condition. The fetus may also be in distress due to compromised placental function. Risk factors for placental abruption include hypertension (as seen in this patient with a previous BP reading of 180/100 mm Hg), which is a known risk factor for this condition. Previous pregnancies, trauma, or substance abuse could also contribute, but this patient’s presentation is classic for an abruptio placenta. Why the other options are less likely: A. Placenta previa: Placenta previa presents with painless vaginal bleeding (not painful) and is typically diagnosed with ultrasound before the third trimester. It does not usually cause rigid abdomen or severe pain as seen in this case. Placenta previa is more likely to present as painless bleeding as the cervix dilates, unlike the painful, abdominally rigid presentation here. B. Vasa previa: This condition involves fetal blood vessels crossing the cervix and is often associated with fetal distress or fetal hemorrhage. While vasa previa may cause vaginal bleeding, it is not typically associated with abdominal pain or rigidity. Moreover, vasa previa is a rare condition and would usually be diagnosed prenatally with ultrasound. C. Cervical tear after intercourse: While cervical tears can occur after intercourse and cause vaginal bleeding, they do not lead to the significant abdominal pain, rigid abdomen, or hypovolemic shock seen in this patient. Cervical tears are typically diagnosed through a pelvic exam and would not explain the overall clinical presentation in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Admit and stabilize the patient. This 34-year-old G2P1 woman at 31 weeks gestation with known placenta previa is presenting with vaginal bleeding. The fetal heart rate is normal at 140 bpm, with accelerations and no decelerations, and there are no signs of uterine contractions (no activity on the external tocometer). Given this clinical picture, the best next step is to admit and stabilize the patient. Why \"Admit and stabilize\" is the best next step: Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta is located near or over the cervical opening, which can lead to vaginal bleeding, particularly in the third trimester. In this case, the patient has normal vital signs, no fetal distress, and no uterine contractions, which suggests that the bleeding may not be immediately life-threatening. Therefore, it’s important to admit the patient to the hospital for observation and stabilization. Stabilization would include: Monitoring vital signs. Monitoring fetal heart rate and uterine activity. Assessing blood loss and considering fluid resuscitation or blood transfusions if necessary. Steroid administration if preterm delivery is suspected (to accelerate fetal lung maturity). Avoiding vaginal exams to prevent further trauma to the cervix or placenta. Why the other options are less appropriate: A. Administer intramuscular terbutaline: Terbutaline is a tocolytic agent that is used to inhibit uterine contractions in cases of preterm labor. However, in this patient, there are no uterine contractions as indicated by the tocometer, so there is no need to administer terbutaline. Moreover, tocolytics are generally avoided in the context of placenta previa, as they can increase the risk of bleeding. B. Administer methylergonovine: Methylergonovine is an oxytocic used to control postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. It is not indicated in the current scenario because the patient is not postpartum and has placenta previa, not a condition related to uterine atony. Administering methylergonovine could worsen bleeding by increasing uterine tone and contraction in the presence of a low-lying placenta. D. Perform cesarean delivery: Cesarean section would only be indicated if the patient becomes unstable, if there are signs of fetal distress, or if there is significant bleeding that cannot be controlled. Currently, the patient is stable, with normal fetal heart rate, no contractions, and no immediate life-threatening situation. Therefore, an emergency cesarean section is not indicated at this point. The priority is to monitor and stabilize the patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Planned cesarean section at 34-37 weeks The appropriate management for vasa previa diagnosed before labor is a planned cesarean section at 34-37 weeks of gestation. Vasa previa is a dangerous condition where fetal blood vessels cross or run near the cervix, and labor can lead to the rupture of these vessels, causing fetal hemorrhage. A planned cesarean section at this gestational age allows for the safe delivery of the baby before the onset of labor, reducing the risk of vessel rupture. The timing of the cesarean section between 34-37 weeks is ideal because it balances fetal lung maturity with the risk of complications like premature birth. This timing also ensures that the baby is delivered before labor begins, which could increase the risk of hemorrhage.",

Uterine rupture is a serious obstetric emergency that occurs when there is a tear in the uterine wall, typically along a scar from a previous cesarean section. As the rupture occurs, there is an interruption in blood flow to the fetus, which leads to fetal distress. This is characterized by abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, such as variable decelerations or bradycardia. The fetus may experience hypoxia and acidosis, which are signs of distress. Fetal distress is often the earliest and most identifiable clinical sign of uterine rupture, prompting immediate intervention such as emergency cesarean section.",

Placental abruption is the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta from the uterine wall, leading to bleeding and potentially compromising fetal oxygenation. Hypertension—either chronic or due to preeclampsia—causes vascular damage to the uteroplacental interface, leading to decidual hemorrhage, which in turn results in placental separation. Preeclampsia, characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, contributes to vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction, both of which heighten the risk of abruption. These conditions are recognized as the strongest and most common risk factors for placental abruption, especially when poorly controlled.",

Placental abruption leads to impaired placental perfusion and uteroplacental insufficiency, which in turn reduces the oxygen available to the fetus during uterine contractions. This results in a gradual slowing of the fetal heart rate that begins after the start of the contraction and returns to baseline after the contraction ends—a hallmark of late deceleration. It reflects fetal hypoxia, and persistent late decelerations are considered non-reassuring and an indicator of potential fetal compromise, warranting urgent evaluation and intervention",

Uterine rupture is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency in which the integrity of the uterine wall is compromised, often resulting in the expulsion of the fetus into the abdominal cavity. It most commonly occurs in women with a prior uterine scar (e.g., from cesarean section or myomectomy), but can also occur spontaneously in rare cases. Loss of fetal station (i.e., the fetus moving back up the birth canal after engagement) is a classic and specific clinical sign of uterine rupture.
