      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) labetalol or hydralazine administered intravenously as a first-line agent for acute therapy of severe hypertension. Nimodipine, diazoxide, and ketanserin are best avoided. If labetalol alone is ineffective, we suggest switching to hydralazine. Alternatively, intravenous nicardipine or oral nifedipine can be used. The following drugs are not used in pregnancy for hypertension due to potential fetal harm: 1. ACE inhibitors (e.g., Enalapril, Ramipril). 2. ARBs (e.g., Losartan, Valsartan). 3. Direct renin inhibitors (e.g., Aliskiren). 4. Certain diuretics and beta-blockers (e.g., Atenolol). 5. Sodium nitroprusside. 6. Diazoxide These drugs are replaced with safer alternatives like labetalol, methyldopa, nifedipine, and hydralazine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In patients with gestational hypertension , ther are high chances(15-25%) of progressing to pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is heralded by the development of proteinuria. Protein/creatinine ratio= >0.30 indicates pre-eclampsia Diagnostic Criteria 1. Proteinuria Thresholds: • ?300 mg/24-hour urine collection: Gold standard for diagnosing proteinuria in preeclampsia. • Spot Urine Protein-to-Creatinine Ratio (PCR) ?0.3: A convenient and reliable alternative to 24-hour urine collection. • Dipstick Urine Test: • ?2+ on a random urine sample: Suggests proteinuria, but less reliable compared to quantitative methods. Proteinuria is not mandatory for the diagnosis of preeclampsia if other severe features are present, such as: • Severe hypertension (?160/110 mmHg). • Thrombocytopenia (platelets 1.1 mg/dL). • Pulmonary edema. • Persistent cerebral or visual disturbances. 2. Timing: • Proteinuria must occur after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman with new-onset hypertension. 3. Exclusion of Other Causes: • Ensure proteinuria is not due to underlying renal disease, urinary tract infection, or other pre-existing conditions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Recurrence rate is upto 7% Recurrence rate of HELLP syndrome The recurrence risk of HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) in subsequent pregnancies is approximately 5-7%. This means that while the majority of women who experience HELLP syndrome in one pregnancy do not develop it in subsequent pregnancies, there remains a small but significant risk of recurrence. Low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) started before 16 weeks gestation is recommended for women at high risk of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome is based on laboratory findings: 1. Hemolysis: • Abnormal peripheral blood smear: Schistocytes or fragmented red blood cells. • Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >600 IU/L. • Low haptoglobin levels. 2. Elevated Liver Enzymes: • Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >70 IU/L. • Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may also be elevated. 3. Low Platelet Count: • Platelet count <100,000/µL.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The answer to the question should have been Labetatol. But since it is not given in options we will go with alpha methyldopa. Methyldopa is used for chronic hypertension in pregnancy and mild pre-eclampsia but is not used in severe pre-eclampsia because of delayed onset of action. Preeclampsia Management: 1. Labetalol: • First-line for moderate to severe hypertension in pregnancy. • A combined alpha- and beta-blocker that is safe for both the mother and fetus. 2. Nifedipine: • A calcium channel blocker that is another effective first-line agent. • Often used for acute management of severe hypertension. 3. Hydralazine: • Reserved for acute management of severe hypertension in preeclampsia. • Administered intravenously in hypertensive emergencies. 4. Magnesium Sulfate: • Not an antihypertensive but is the drug of choice for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia and treatment of eclampsia. Since labetalol is not in options hence answer is methyldopa Alpha-Methyldopa is the drug for treating mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy and mild to moderate preeclampsia. It is a centrally acting antihypertensive that lowers blood pressure by reducing sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system, making it safe and effective for use during pregnancy. It has been extensively studied and has a long history of safety for both the mother and fetus.",

Her BP is controlled on Treatment ,i,e. she is being managed expectantly. In such patients pregnancy should be terminated at 37 weeks Why Delivery at 37 Weeks is Ideal 1. Maternal Safety: • Preeclampsia is a progressive condition that can lead to severe complications such as eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, placental abruption, and maternal organ failure. • Delivering at 37 weeks minimizes these risks without significantly increasing the risk of neonatal complications. 2. Fetal Maturity: • By 37 weeks, the fetus is considered term, with fully developed lungs and a lower risk of neonatal complications like respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). • The risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or stillbirth increases as preeclampsia progresses, making delivery the safest option at this point. 3. Guidelines: • The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and other international guidelines recommend delivery at 37 weeks for women with mild preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. • For women with severe preeclampsia, delivery is recommended earlier, depending on the severity and gestational age. When to Deliver Before 37 Weeks Early delivery (<37 weeks) is indicated in cases of severe preeclampsia with maternal or fetal complications: • Maternal Indications: • Severe hypertension unresponsive to treatment. • Neurological symptoms (e.g., severe headache, visual disturbances). • HELLP syndrome. • Pulmonary edema or acute kidney injury. • Fetal Indications: • Severe IUGR. • Non-reassuring fetal heart patterns. • Oligohydramnios or abnormal Doppler studies. In such cases, antenatal corticosteroids (e.g., betamethasone) are given to promote fetal lung maturity if delivery occurs before 34 weeks.",

IUGR and Severe Preeclampsia Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) is not a diagnostic criterion for severe preeclampsia, but it is often associated with the condition due to placental insufficiency. While IUGR indicates potential fetal compromise, the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia is based on maternal signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings rather than fetal growth parameters. Criteria for Severe Preeclampsia According to guidelines (e.g., ACOG), severe preeclampsia is defined by the presence of any one of the following: 1. Severe Hypertension: • Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ?160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ?110 mmHg, measured twice at least 4 hours apart. 2. Thrombocytopenia: • Platelet count 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of baseline creatinine in the absence of other renal disease. 4. Liver Dysfunction: • Elevated liver enzymes (e.g., AST or ALT levels ?2 times the upper normal limit) or severe right upper quadrant/epigastric pain unresponsive to medication. 5. Pulmonary Edema: • Presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs. 6. Neurological Symptoms: • Persistent severe headache, visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, scotomata), or eclampsia. Role of IUGR in Preeclampsia • IUGR is a complication of placental insufficiency caused by preeclampsia. • While it signals fetal compromise and the severity of placental dysfunction, it is not a defining criterion for diagnosing severe preeclampsia. • IUGR in preeclampsia is an indication for closer fetal monitoring and may influence the timing of delivery.",

New-Onset Proteinuria • Proteinuria develops after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman who did not previously have proteinuria. • Defined as: • ?300 mg/24-hour urine collection. • Protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) ?0.3. • ?2+ on urine dipstick (less reliable). 2. Sudden Worsening of Pre-Existing Proteinuria • If proteinuria was present before 20 weeks (due to chronic kidney disease or pre-existing hypertension), a sudden and significant increase in proteinuria indicates superimposed preeclampsia. 3. Severe Hypertension • New or worsening hypertension: • Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ?160 mmHg. • Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ?110 mmHg. • Persistent even after appropriate treatment. 4. New Signs of End-Organ Damage • Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 1.1 mg/dL. • Doubling of serum creatinine from baseline. • Liver Dysfunction: • Elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT ?2 times the upper limit of normal). • Severe right upper quadrant or epigastric pain. • Neurological Symptoms: • Persistent severe headache or visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, scotomata). • Pulmonary Edema: • Signs of fluid accumulation in the lungs.",

Stabilize the Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABC Approach) • Airway: • Ensure the airway is patent to prevent aspiration and maintain oxygenation. • Position the patient in the left lateral position to reduce the risk of aspiration and improve venous return. • Breathing: • Administer oxygen via mask if oxygen saturation is low (12/min), and urine output (>30 mL/hour). 3. Control Severe Hypertension • Use antihypertensive medications to reduce blood pressure and prevent complications like stroke: • Labetalol: 20 mg IV bolus, repeated every 10–20 minutes (up to 300 mg total). • Hydralazine: 5–10 mg IV bolus every 20 minutes as needed. • Nifedipine: 10–20 mg orally every 20–30 minutes. 4. Plan for Delivery • Delivery is the definitive treatment for eclampsia and preeclampsia. • Once the patient is stabilized, assess maternal and fetal conditions to determine the safest mode and timing of delivery. • If the fetus is viable and the maternal condition allows, vaginal delivery is preferred. • Cesarean section is indicated if rapid delivery is needed or vaginal delivery is contraindicated.",

Monitoring Parameters To ensure magnesium levels stay within the therapeutic range, regular clinical and laboratory monitoring is essential: 1. Clinical Signs: • Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs): The first clinical indicator of magnesium toxicity is the loss of reflexes. • Respiratory rate: Should remain >12 breaths/min. • Urine output: >30 mL/hour is necessary to prevent magnesium accumulation. 2. Serum Magnesium Levels: • Periodic measurement of serum magnesium is performed in cases of clinical toxicity is suspected. Management of Toxicity If magnesium toxicity occurs: 1. Stop magnesium sulfate infusion immediately. 2. Administer calcium gluconate (10 mL of 10% solution IV over 10 minutes) as the antidote.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ischemic trophoblast, which is a characteristic finding in preeclampsia, increases production of anti-angiogenic proteins (sEng, sFlt1) and reduces production of angiogenic proteins (VEGF, PlGF) Two types of uterine artery Doppler waveform analysis techniques have emerged for prediction of preeclampsia, as well as other disorders associated with impaired placentation (eg, fetal growth restriction, pregnancy loss): (1) presence or absence of diastolic notching (unilateral, bilateral) of the uterine arcuate vessels and (2) flow waveform ratios (eg, high resistance or pulsatility index, systolic/diastolic ratio American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for taking a detailed medical history to assess a patient's risks for developing preeclampsia but not using laboratory and imaging screening tests (including uterine artery Doppler velocimetry and serum biomarkers such as pro- and anti-angiogenic factors) Predictive Tests for Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Predictive tests aim to identify women at high risk for developing preeclampsia early in pregnancy, allowing for preventive measures such as low-dose aspirin to be initiated. 1. Biochemical Tests a) Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) • What It Measures: Proangiogenic protein produced by the placenta. • Significance: Low levels of PlGF are associated with impaired placentation, a hallmark of preeclampsia. • When Used: Between 11–14 weeks or in the second trimester to assess risk. • Role: High negative predictive value for ruling out preeclampsia. b) Soluble fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1 (sFlt-1) • What It Measures: Antiangiogenic factor that binds PlGF and VEGF. • Significance: Elevated sFlt-1 levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction and preeclampsia. • Role: Used in combination with PlGF to calculate the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. c) sFlt-1/PlGF Ratio • What It Indicates: Imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. • Significance: • Low Ratio: Rules out preeclampsia. • High Ratio: Indicates a higher risk of developing preeclampsia. • Timing: Effective in the second and third trimesters to predict short-term risk. 2. Biophysical Tests a) Uterine Artery Doppler • What It Measures: Resistance to blood flow in uterine arteries. • Significance: • Increased pulsatility index (PI) or the presence of diastolic notching suggests impaired placental perfusion and increased risk of preeclampsia. • Timing: Most effective when performed between 11–14 weeks of gestation. • Combination: More predictive when combined with biochemical markers. 3. Combined Screening (Most Predictive) • First-Trimester Screening: • Combines maternal risk factors (e.g., history of preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, BMI) with: • Biochemical Markers (PlGF). • Biophysical Markers (Uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index). • Results are integrated using algorithms to calculate a woman’s overall risk of developing preeclampsia.",

It acts as a membrane stabilizer and neuroprotector. It reduces motor endplate sensitivity to acetylcholine. Magnesium also blocks neuronal calcium influx. Hence prevent convulsion during labor. Impending eclampsia refers to a condition where a pregnant woman with severe preeclampsia shows signs and symptoms suggestive of an imminent seizure. Early recognition and prompt management are crucial to prevent progression to eclampsia. Clinical Features of Impending Eclampsia • Severe, persistent headache unresponsive to medication. • Visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, scotomata, photophobia). • Epigastric pain or right upper quadrant pain (indicative of liver involvement). • Nausea, vomiting, or restlessness. Stepwise Management 1. Admit the Patient • Immediate inpatient care in a high-dependency or intensive care unit (if available). • Continuous maternal and fetal monitoring. 2. Seizure Prophylaxis with Magnesium Sulfate • Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent seizures. • Loading Dose: 4g IV over 15–20 minutes and 10 gm I/m • Maintenance Dose 5gm I/m for at least 24 hours after stabilization or delivery. • Monitor for toxicity: • Deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). • Respiratory rate >12/min. • Urine output >30 mL/hour. • Antidote for toxicity: Calcium gluconate (10 mL of 10% solution IV). 3. Control Severe Hypertension • Antihypertensive therapy is critical to prevent maternal complications such as stroke or placental abruption. • Labetalol: • IV bolus: 20 mg, repeat every 10–20 minutes if needed. • Oral: 200–400 mg every 12 hours for ongoing control. • Nifedipine: • Oral: 10–20 mg every 20 minutes (up to 3 doses). • Hydralazine: • IV: 5–10 mg every 20 minutes as needed. 4. Plan for Delivery (Definitive Treatment) • Delivery is the only definitive treatment for preeclampsia and impending eclampsia. • Timing: • Stabilize maternal condition first, unless immediate delivery is needed for severe maternal or fetal indications. • Aim for delivery within 24–48 hours. • Mode of Delivery: • Vaginal delivery is preferred if the cervix is favorable and maternal and fetal conditions allow. • Cesarean delivery is indicated for obstetric reasons or maternal/fetal instability.",

Magnesium sulfate is given for prophylaxis against recurrent seizure. Magnesium sulfate has been shown in randomized control trials to be better than phenytoin or diazepam at preventing seizures. Low-dose aspirin and calcium supplementation have not been shown to be beneficial in preventing preeclampsia. Women with eclampsia should be stabilized quickly; magnesium sulfate should be started to prevent further seizures; and antihypertensives should be used to control blood pressure. The patient should be delivered in a timely fashion, and the method of delivery should depend on factors such as gestational age, fetal presentation, and cervical examination. Antihypertensive therapy is usually initiated for systolic blood pressure greater than 160 or diastolic blood pressure greater than 110",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Induction of labor HELLP syndrome is a subtype of preeclampsia with severe features. Patients with HELLP syndrome should be delivered promptly. As maternal and fetal status allow, one can defer delivery in patients with HELLP syndrome for 24 to 48 hours to administer betamethasone. In contrast, patients with preeclampsia with severe features can be expectantly managed until 34 weeks. The patient’s BPs are not severely elevated, so she does not need IV hydralazine or oral nifedipine Delivery is the definitive treatment for HELLP syndrome and should be initiated after maternal stabilization. Timing of Delivery • At 34 weeks, delivery is typically indicated immediately after stabilization: • HELLP syndrome at this stage is associated with worsening maternal and fetal risks if pregnancy continues. • Antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity are not usually necessary after 34 weeks Mode of Delivery • Vaginal Delivery: • Preferred if the cervix is favorable, and maternal and fetal conditions are stable. • Induction of labor can be attempted if it is expected to proceed quickly. • Cesarean Delivery: • Indicated for: • Non-reassuring fetal status. • Severe maternal complications. • Unfavorable cervix or failure to progress.",

Symptoms: • Intermittent nausea and itching are hallmark symptoms of ICP. • Itching, especially on the palms and soles, is the most common symptom and occurs without a rash. 2. Laboratory Findings: • Total Bilirubin: Elevated to 2.1 mg/dL, which is consistent with mild cholestasis. • Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Elevated at 206 U/L, a common finding in pregnancy due to placental ALP production. • AST (30 U/L) and ALT (26 U/L): Normal or mildly elevated, which is typical of ICP. Severe transaminitis is uncommon in this condition. 3. Timing: • ICP commonly presents in the third trimester (?30 weeks), aligning with this case. 4. Rule Out Other Options: • AFLP (Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy): • More likely to present with severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and profound liver dysfunction (markedly elevated AST/ALT and hypoglycemia). • Total bilirubin is often higher than 5 mg/dL. • HELLP Syndrome: • Associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT >70 U/L), and thrombocytopenia. • The patient lacks hypertension, proteinuria, and severe transaminitis. • Normal Pregnancy: • Mild ALP elevation can occur in normal pregnancy, but elevated bilirubin (2.1 mg/dL) and itching are not normal findings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypertension is diagnosed in pregnancy when the resting blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or greater. The paent may have a history of chronic hypertension. Gestational hypertension is diagnosed if the patient develops hypertension without proteinuria during the pregnancy. Preeclampsia is diagnosed when the hypertension is associated with proteinuria of greater than 300 mg in a 24 hour collection or persistent 2+ proteinuria in random urine sampling. The treatment for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is delivery. Select preterm patients may be managed conservatively at home or in the hospital depending upon the severity of the hypertension. BPP testing is useful when following the patient conservatively. Although bed rest may transiently improve elevated blood pressure, a patient at full term should be delivered. Based on the severity of this patient’s blood pressure and the 4+ proteinuria, she has severe preeclamsia and she should be delivered. Since this patient’s fetus is breech, cesarean delivery rather than induction of labor is the next best step in her management. Diuretics should not be used in the management of preeclampsia, as they deplete the maternal intravascular volume and may compromise placental perfusion",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gestational Hypertensive patients have only increased blood pressures without proteinuria or other features of preeclampsia. Up to 1/3 of those who are thought to have gestational hypertension are later found to have preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria; less commonly, there is absence of proteinuria but evidence of vasospastic disease via other end organ manifestations. Although not a criterion, nondependent oedema is also usually present. An elevated blood pressure is diagnosed with a systolic blood pressure at or >140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure at or >90 mm Hg. Two elevated BPs, measured 4 hours apart (BP taken in the seated position), are needed for the formal diagnosis of preeclampsia, although at term, presumptive diagnoses with persistent hypertension over a shorter interval often guides management. Proteinuria is usually based on timed urine collection, defined as equal to or greater than 300 mg of protein in 24 hours, although a P/Cr ratio ?0.3 is accurate",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acute fay liver of pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy. Estimates of its incidence range from 1 in 7000 to 1 in 15,000 pregnancies. This disorder is usually fatal for both mother and baby. Recently, it has been suggested that recessively inherited mitochondrial abnormalities of fatty acid oxidation predispose a woman to fay liver in pregnancy. This disorder usually manifests itself late in pregnancy and is more common in nulliparous women. Typically, a patient will present with a several-day or -week history of general malaise, anorexia, nausea, emesis, and jaundice. Liver enzymes are usually not elevated above 500. Indications of liver failure are present, manifested by elevated PT/PTT, bilirubin, and ammonia levels. In addition, there is marked hypoglycemia. Low fibrinogen and platelet levels occur secondary to a consumptive coagulopathy. In cases of viral hepatitis, serum transaminase levels are usually much higher and marked hypoglycemia or elevated serum ammonia levels would not be seen. Sometimes the HELLP syndrome can inially be di?cult to differentiate from acute fatty liver, but in this case the patient has a normal blood pressure. In addition, hepatic failure is not characteristic of severe preeclampsia. Hyperemesis gravidarum is characterized by nausea and vomiting unresponsive to simple therapy. It usually occurs early in the ?rst trimester and resolves by about 16 weeks. In some cases, there can be a transient hepatic dysfunction. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is characterized by pruritus and/or icterus. Some women develop cholestasis in the third trimester secondary to estrogen-induced changes. There is an accumulation of serum bile salts, which causes pruritus. Liver enzymes are seldom elevated above 250 U/L",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Drug of Choice for Hypertension in Preeclampsia The drug of choice for managing hypertension in preeclampsia is Labetalol, as it is safe, effective, and well-tolerated during pregnancy. Why Labetalol is Preferred 1. Mechanism: • A combined alpha- and beta-blocker, Labetalol lowers blood pressure by reducing both peripheral vascular resistance and heart rate. 2. Rapid Onset: • Effective in acute control of severe hypertension. 3. Safety: • Minimal adverse effects on uteroplacental blood flow, making it safe for the fetus. Contraindications 1. Asthma or Bronchospasm: • Risk of beta-2 blockade exacerbating symptoms. 2. Heart Block or Severe Bradycardia: • Due to beta-blocking effects. 3. Decompensated Heart Failure: • Risk of worsening cardiac function. Other Antihypertensive Options 1. Nifedipine • Type: Calcium channel blocker. • Use: Second-line option or combined with labetalol for additional control. • Form: • Immediate-release for acute control (10–20 mg orally). • Sustained-release for chronic management. 2. Hydralazine • Type: Vasodilator. • Use: Acute severe hypertension (SBP ?160 or DBP ?110 mmHg). • Limitations: • Risk of reflex tachycardia. • Associated with maternal hypotension and fetal distress. 3. Methyldopa • Use: First-line for chronic hypertension in pregnancy, but less effective in acute preeclampsia. • Limitations: Slow onset of action, not suitable for emergencies.",

It is a combined alpha- and beta-blocker, which reduces systemic vascular resistance without significantly decreasing heart rate or cardiac output. Labetalol can be administered intravenously, making it ideal for rapid blood pressure control in acute settings. This is especially critical in severe preeclampsia to prevent complications such as stroke, placental abruption, and eclampsia.

By sequestering these pro-angiogenic factors, sFlt-1 disrupts normal placental vascular development and induces widespread endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of preeclampsia. This imbalance contributes to hypertension, proteinuria, and organ damage, as the maternal vasculature becomes increasingly constricted and leaky. Elevated levels of sFlt-1 in maternal circulation are also used as biomarkers for diagnosis and risk stratification in preeclampsia.",

FHR abnormalities such as persistent late decelerations, minimal variability, or prolonged bradycardia suggest fetal hypoxia or acidosis, indicating that the fetus may not tolerate labor. In such cases, attempting induction of labor could delay necessary intervention and further jeopardize fetal well-being. Cesarean section is the fastest and safest way to deliver the fetus in this setting, minimizing the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, fetal status is a critical factor in determining the mode and urgency of delivery in preeclamptic patients.",

It assesses the resistance to blood flow in the uterine arteries, which are responsible for supplying blood to the placenta. In patients at risk for preeclampsia, abnormal Doppler findings—such as increased resistance (elevated pulsatility index or PI) and notching in the early part of pregnancy—are associated with poor placental perfusion, which is a key factor in the development of preeclampsia. Early detection using uterine artery Doppler allows for closer monitoring and potential interventions, such as aspirin therapy, which can help prevent the development of the disease in high-risk individuals",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Monitor Mg level routinely It is not necessary to monitor the magnesium level routinely in patients receiving magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for eclampsia. While magnesium levels can be measured if there is clinical concern for toxicity (e.g., altered mental status, reduced reflexes, respiratory depression), routine monitoring of magnesium levels is not required for every patient. Clinical signs and symptoms, including urine output, deep tendon reflexes, and respiratory rate, are more reliable and practical for assessing magnesium toxicity in this setting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Continue with 5 g MgSO? IM in alternate buttock Explanation: • Pritchard regimen: o Loading dose: 4 g MgSO? IV (20% solution, over 5 min) + 10 g MgSO? IM (50% solution, 5 g in each buttock). o Maintenance dose: 5 g MgSO? IM every 4 hours in alternate buttocks × 24 hours (after last seizure or after delivery, whichever is later). • Prerequisites before giving each maintenance dose: 1. Respiratory rate ? 12/min 2. Urine output ? 35 mL/hour (? 100 mL in last 4 hours) 3. Deep tendon reflexes present • In this case: o RR = 18 (? acceptable) o UO = 40 mL/hour (? above 30mL/hour) o Reflexes = present (?) ? All criteria met ? proceed with next IM dose. • Antidote (calcium gluconate) is used only if toxicity signs present (absent reflexes, RR <12, oliguria).",
