      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pre-eclampsia Pre-eclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, is more commonly associated with primiparous (first-time) pregnancies rather than multiparous pregnancies. While multiparous women can still develop pre-eclampsia, the risk is generally lower compared to first-time mothers unless there are additional risk factors such as advanced maternal age, preexisting hypertension, or diabetes. This makes pre-eclampsia the exception among the conditions listed as being predisposed by multiparous pregnancy. Why Other Options Are Incorrect (A) Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH): PPH is a well-known risk in multiparous pregnancies due to uterine atony, which is more common in women who have had multiple pregnancies. The repeated stretching of the uterus can reduce its contractile ability, leading to an increased risk of hemorrhage after delivery. (C) Anemia: Anemia is a frequent complication in multiparous women due to the cumulative nutritional demands of multiple pregnancies and inadequate recovery time between pregnancies. Iron deficiency is particularly common, especially in women with insufficient dietary intake or postpartum bleeding. (D) Malpresentation: Multiparous pregnancies are associated with a higher risk of malpresentation, such as breech or transverse lie, due to laxity of the uterine and abdominal muscles from previous pregnancies. This can lead to improper fetal positioning as the pregnancy progresse",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 90 seconds The optimal interval between uterine incision and delivery of the fetal head during a cesarean section is approximately 90 seconds. This timing minimizes the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby. Prolonged intervals may increase the risk of fetal hypoxia, as the fetus relies on placental oxygenation until delivery. A delay beyond 90 seconds could lead to uteroplacental insufficiency, particularly in cases where uterine contractions or maternal hemodynamic factors compromise blood flow. Additionally, maternal surgical risks such as increased bleeding and uterine trauma may arise if delivery is unnecessarily prolonged. Thus, a swift yet controlled extraction of the fetus is ideal. Anesthesia: Regional (spinal/epidural) is preferred, with a T4 dermatome level required for adequate anesthesia. • Incision: Pfannenstiel for the skin and low transverse for the uterus are the most common. • Antibiotics: Administer cefazolin within 60 minutes before incision to prevent infection, adjusted for allergies or prolonged procedures.",

Pregnant women with symptomatic bacteriuria have a significantly higher risk of developing pyelonephritis compared to the general population due to the physiological changes of pregnancy, such as ureteral dilation, urinary stasis, and immune modulation. If bacteriuria is left untreated or not effectively managed, the risk of progression to pyelonephritis is approximately 25% in such cases. Pyelonephritis during pregnancy can lead to complications such as preterm labor, low birth weight, and maternal sepsis, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cephalosporin Cephalosporins are considered the antibiotic of choice for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. These antibiotics are generally safe for use during pregnancy and have a broad spectrum of activity against common UTI pathogens such as Escherichia coli. Cephalosporins are well-tolerated and effectively treat UTIs while minimizing the risk of harm to the developing fetus. They do not cross the placenta in significant amounts and are less likely to cause teratogenic effects compared to other classes of antibiotics. For these reasons, they are preferred during pregnancy. Why Other Options Are Incorrect (B) Quinolones: Quinolones (fluoroquinolones), such as ciprofloxacin, are contraindicated during pregnancy because they are associated with potential fetal harm, including cartilage damage and tendon toxicity. These medications can cross the placenta and may affect fetal development, making them unsuitable for treating UTIs in pregnant women. (C) Aminoglycosides: Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, are also generally avoided during pregnancy due to their potential to cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in the fetus. Although they may be used in life-threatening infections when other options are unavailable, their use is carefully restricted in pregnant women. (D) Tetracyclines: Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) are contraindicated during pregnancy because they can cause permanent discoloration of the teeth in the developing fetus, as well as possible effects on bone growth. They also cross the placenta and pose a risk of teratogenicity, making them unsuitable for treating UTIs during pregnancy.",

Key Interventions Early HIV Testing • All pregnant women are tested for HIV during their antenatal visits using rapid HIV diagnostic tests. • Partner testing is encouraged for a comprehensive approach. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) • For HIV-positive mothers: • Lifelong triple-drug ART (TLD regimen): Tenofovir (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC), and Dolutegravir (DTG). • Started as early as possible in pregnancy, regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage. • For newborns: • Nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis for all HIV-exposed infants: • 4-6 weeks of NVP if the mother’s viral load is controlled. • Extended NVP for up to 12 weeks if the mother’s viral suppression is inadequate or breastfeeding continues. Vaginal delivery is preferred mode and CS done for obstetric Indications. Avoid invasive procedures, ARM, instrumental delivery. Infant Feeding • Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months is recommended, followed by complementary feeding while continuing ART. • Avoid mixed feeding as it increases the risk of HIV transmission.",
