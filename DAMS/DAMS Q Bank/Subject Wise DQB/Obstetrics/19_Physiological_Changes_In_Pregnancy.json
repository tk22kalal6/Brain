      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) During pregnancy, the body undergoes significant changes in the coagulation system to prepare for childbirth. Most clotting factors increase to promote a hypercoagulable state, reducing the risk of hemorrhage during delivery. However, Factor XI does not follow this trend and may actually decrease during pregnancy. During pregnancy, a woman’s body undergoes significant hematological changes to support fetal development and prepare for childbirth. Key adaptations include: 1. Blood Volume Expansion • Plasma Volume: Increases by approximately 40-50%, peaking around the second trimester. • Red Blood Cell (RBC) Mass: Rises by about 20-30%, stimulated by elevated erythropoietin levels. • Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Despite the increase in RBC mass, the proportionate rise in plasma volume leads to hemodilution, resulting in decreased hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit values, a condition termed “physiologic anemia of pregnancy.” 2. White Blood Cells (WBCs) • Leukocyte Count: Generally increases, with a notable rise in neutrophils. • Lymphocytes: May decrease in the first and second trimesters, returning to pre-pregnancy levels in the third trimester. • Immature Cells: Occasional presence of myelocytes and metamyelocytes in peripheral blood smears. 3. Platelets • Platelet Count: May remain stable or experience a mild decline, often staying within the normal range. • Platelet Function: Enhanced reactivity contributes to the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. 4. Coagulation System • Procoagulant Factors: Increased levels of factors VII, VIII, X, and fibrinogen enhance clotting potential. • Fibrinolytic Activity: Decreased, contributing to a prothrombotic state that reduces hemorrhage risk during delivery but elevates the risk of thromboembolic events. 5. Iron Metabolism • Iron Requirements: Elevated to support increased RBC production and fetal needs. • Iron Deficiency Risk: Without adequate supplementation, pregnant women may develop iron deficiency anemia, characterized by fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance. 6. Immune Modulation • Immune Adaptation: Pregnancy induces changes in immune function to tolerate the fetus, including alterations in leukocyte populations and cytokine profiles",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Highest during pregnancy and fall during lactation Prolactin is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland, playing a crucial role in breast development and milk production. During pregnancy, prolactin levels increase significantly to prepare the mammary glands for lactation. After childbirth, although prolactin levels decrease from their peak, they remain elevated to support ongoing milk production during breastfeeding. Therefore, prolactin levels are highest during pregnancy and decrease during lactation, making option B correct. Regulation of Prolactin Secretion: • Dopamine Inhibition: Dopamine, released from the hypothalamus, inhibits prolactin secretion under non-pregnant conditions. • Estrogen Stimulation: During pregnancy, elevated estrogen levels enhance prolactin production by increasing the number of prolactin-secreting cells in the pituitary gland. Postpartum Changes: • Initiation of Lactation: After childbirth, the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels, combined with sustained prolactin secretion, initiates milk production. • Maintenance of Milk Production: Nipple stimulation during breastfeeding promotes further prolactin release, maintaining milk supply through a positive feedback mechanism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Johnson’s formula is a clinical method used to estimate fetal weight based on symphysis-fundal height (SFH) and the station of the fetal head. The formula is: Estimated Fetal Weight (grams) = (SFH in cm - N) × 155 Where: • SFH: Symphysis-fundal height in centimeters. • N: A constant that varies with the station of the fetal head: • N = 13: When the presenting part is not engaged (station -3 to -1). • N = 12: When the presenting part is at 0 station (engaged). • N = 11: When the presenting part is below the ischial spines (station +1 to +3). Given Data: • SFH: 35 cm • Station: -2 (presenting part not engaged) Calculation: 1. Determine N: For station -2, N = 13. 2. Apply Johnson’s Formula: Estimated Fetal Weight = (SFH - N) × 155 = (35 cm - 13) × 155 = 22 × 155 = 3,410 grams = 3.41 kg",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chadwick’s Sign is a clinical indicator characterized by a bluish-violet discoloration of the vaginal mucosa, resulting from increased blood flow and venous congestion in the pelvic region during early pregnancy. This change can be observed as early as 6 to 8 weeks after conception. Cervix: While increased vascularity during pregnancy affects the cervix, leading to a bluish discoloration, Chadwick’s Sign specifically refers to changes in the vaginal mucosa. Probable signs are objective findings that strongly suggest pregnancy but are not conclusive. These include: • Goodell’s Sign: Softening of the cervix due to increased vascularization, typically occurring around the 6th to 8th week of gestation. • Hegar’s Sign: Softening of the lower uterine segment, observed between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy. • Enlarged Uterus: Detectable during a pelvic examination, indicating growth to accommodate the developing fetus. Osiander’s Sign: • Definition: Increased pulsation felt through the lateral fornices of the vagina. • Timing: Typically detectable around the 8th week of gestation. • Significance: This heightened pulsation results from increased vascularity and blood flow to the pelvic organs, supporting the developing pregnancy. Palmer’s Sign: • Definition: Regular, rhythmic uterine contractions elicited during bimanual examination. • Timing: Can be observed by 8 weeks of pregnancy. • Significance: These contractions, resembling systole and diastole of the heart, indicate uterine muscle activity in response to pregnancy. Piskacek’s Sign: • Definition: Asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus due to lateral implantation of the embryo, leading to a palpable bulge at the site of implantation. • Timing: Notable during the early weeks of pregnancy, often around the 8th week. • Significance: This asymmetry arises because the area where the embryo implants grows more rapidly, causing one side of the uterus to be more prominent.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypothyroidism Theca lutein cysts are functional ovarian cysts that develop due to elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). They are commonly associated with conditions that cause increased hCG levels. Explanation for Each Option: A) Twin Pregnancy In twin pregnancies, hCG levels are typically higher than in singleton pregnancies. This elevation can stimulate the ovaries, leading to the development of theca lutein cysts. B) Molar Pregnancy Molar pregnancies, a type of gestational trophoblastic disease, are characterized by abnormally high hCG levels. This significant increase in hCG can lead to the formation of theca lutein cysts. C) Chronic Renal Failure Although rare, chronic renal failure can be associated with theca lutein cysts. In such cases, reduced clearance of hCG due to impaired kidney function may result in elevated hCG levels, potentially leading to the development of these cysts. D) Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is not typically associated with elevated hCG levels. Therefore, it does not usually lead to the development of theca lutein cysts. While there have been rare case reports linking primary hypothyroidism to theca lutein cysts, these instances are uncommon and not representative of the typical clinical presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Increased Peripheral Vascular Resistance During pregnancy, peripheral vascular resistance decreases due to hormonal influences, particularly progesterone, which causes vasodilation. This reduction facilitates increased blood flow to support the developing fetus. Therefore, option D is correct, as peripheral vascular resistance does not increase during pregnancy. Beyond the previously discussed changes—such as increased stroke volume, cardiac output, and intravascular volume, along with decreased peripheral vascular resistance—additional cardiac alterations include: 1. Increased Heart Rate: • The maternal heart rate typically rises by 10 to 20 beats per minute during pregnancy, contributing to the enhanced cardiac output necessary for adequate uteroplacental circulation. 2. Cardiac Remodeling: • Pregnancy induces structural changes in the heart, including mild hypertrophy and chamber dilation, to accommodate the increased blood volume and output. These modifications are generally reversible postpartum. 3. Blood Pressure Changes: • Despite the rise in cardiac output, systemic blood pressure often decreases during the first and second trimesters due to reduced peripheral vascular resistance. Blood pressure typically returns to pre-pregnancy levels in the third trimester. 4. Positional Effects on Cardiac Function: • The enlarging uterus can compress the inferior vena cava when a pregnant individual lies supine, potentially reducing venous return to the heart. This compression may lead to decreased cardiac output and hypotension, known as supine hypotensive syndrome. 5. Heart Sounds and Murmurs: • Increased blood flow and changes in cardiac structure can lead to the accentuation of normal heart sounds and the appearance of systolic murmurs during pregnancy. These findings are typically benign and resolve after delivery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Corpus Luteum During the first two months of pregnancy, the corpus luteum plays a crucial role in producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Formed from the remnants of the ovarian follicle after ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes these hormones to maintain the uterine lining and support early pregnancy. Its function is vital until the placenta matures enough to take over hormone production, typically after 8 weeks Progesterone, often referred to as the “pregnancy hormone,” plays a pivotal role in maintaining and supporting pregnancy through various mechanisms: 1. Maintenance of the Uterine Lining: Progesterone ensures the endometrium remains thick and receptive, providing a nourishing environment for the implanted embryo. This maintenance is crucial for the embryo’s continued development and the prevention of menstrual shedding. ? 2. Prevention of Uterine Contractions: By decreasing the contractility of uterine smooth muscle, progesterone helps prevent premature labor, reducing the risk of preterm birth. 3. Modulation of the Immune Response: Progesterone modulates the maternal immune system to tolerate the genetically distinct fetus, thereby preventing rejection and supporting a healthy pregnancy. 4. Preparation for Lactation: While inhibiting milk production during pregnancy, progesterone prepares breast tissue for lactation. After delivery, the drop in progesterone levels triggers the onset of milk production.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Right Axis Deviation on ECG Right axis deviation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is considered abnormal during pregnancy and may indicate underlying pathology such as pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart disease, or a right ventricular strain. In normal pregnancy, the heart is displaced upward and to the left due to the enlarging uterus, often resulting in left axis deviation or a neutral axis. Right axis deviation, however, is not a typical finding and warrants further investigation to rule out cardiovascular or pulmonary complications. Why the other options are incorrect: A) Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette An enlarged cardiac silhouette is a normal physiological finding in pregnancy due to increased blood volume, cardiac output, and mild cardiac hypertrophy. The upward displacement of the diaphragm by the gravid uterus can also contribute to this appearance on chest X-rays. This change reflects the heart’s adaptation to the increased circulatory demands of pregnancy. B) Increased Split S1 An increased splitting of the first heart sound (S1) is a common finding during pregnancy. It is caused by the increased blood flow through the heart and changes in valve closure times due to the hyperdynamic circulation. This is considered a normal adaptation and is not a sign of pathology. D) Early Systolic Murmur A soft early systolic murmur is frequently heard in pregnant women and is considered physiological. It results from the increased blood flow (hyperdynamic circulation) and turbulence in the heart. This murmur is usually low-grade (Grade I or II) and resolves after delivery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increase in blood viscosity During pregnancy, blood viscosity decreases, not increases, due to a significant rise in plasma volume compared to red blood cell mass. This “hemodilution” lowers the hematocrit levels, leading to a decrease in blood viscosity. This adaptation ensures smoother blood flow, particularly in the uteroplacental circulation, to meet the oxygen and nutrient demands of the fetus. An increase in blood viscosity would impede this process and is not a normal finding in pregnancy. Why the other options are incorrect: A) Fall in Serum Iron Concentration Serum iron concentration decreases during pregnancy due to an increased demand for iron to support fetal growth, expansion of maternal red blood cell mass, and placental development. Without adequate supplementation, this often results in iron deficiency anemia. B) Increase in Serum Iron Binding Capacity Serum iron-binding capacity increases during pregnancy as a result of elevated transferrin production by the liver. This adaptation facilitates iron transport and utilization to meet the heightened demand for erythropoiesis and fetal development. D) Increase in Blood Oxygen Carrying Capacity Despite the hemodilution of pregnancy, there is an overall increase in blood oxygen-carrying capacity due to the rise in red blood cell mass and hemoglobin production. This compensates for the increased metabolic needs of both the mother and fetus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Secreted by cytotrophoblast Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is not secreted by the cytotrophoblast. Instead, it is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast, a specialized layer of the placenta responsible for hormone secretion. The syncytiotrophoblast synthesizes hCG, which plays a critical role in maintaining pregnancy, particularly by supporting the corpus luteum during the early stages. Therefore, option A is false. Why the other options are correct: B) Acts on the same receptor as LH hCG shares a similar structure with luteinizing hormone (LH) and binds to the LH receptor. This allows it to mimic LH action, including the stimulation of the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone, which is essential for sustaining early pregnancy. C) It has luteotrophic action hCG exerts a luteotrophic effect, meaning it stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone. This action is critical during the first trimester, ensuring the maintenance of the endometrium and the pregnancy until the placenta takes over progesterone production. D) It is a glycoprotein hCG is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two subunits: alpha and beta.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Radioimmunoassay (RIA) Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is the most sensitive and specific test for estimating human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). It works by using radiolabeled antibodies to detect even very low concentrations of hCG in serum or plasma. RIA is highly reliable and capable of detecting minute levels of hCG, making it ideal for early pregnancy detection and monitoring hCG levels in conditions like trophoblastic diseases and ectopic pregnancies. Its high sensitivity and specificity make it the gold standard for hCG estimation. Why the other options are incorrect: B) ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) ELISA is widely used for hCG estimation and offers good sensitivity and specificity. It is easier to perform, cost-effective, and does not involve radioactive materials, unlike RIA. However, ELISA is slightly less sensitive than RIA, which makes RIA the preferred choice when extremely low hCG levels need to be detected, such as in early pregnancy or after treatment of trophoblastic diseases. C) Radio Receptor Assay (RRA) Radio receptor assay measures hormone levels by assessing their binding to specific receptors. While it can be used for hCG estimation, it is less commonly employed because it lacks the precision and sensitivity of RIA and ELISA. Additionally, it is not widely available or practical for routine clinical use. D) Bioassay Bioassays involve observing biological effects in a live animal or tissue sample in response to hCG. They were historically used but are now obsolete due to their lack of specificity, reliability, and ethical concerns compared to modern immunoassays like RIA and ELISA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Blood flow through skin decreases During pregnancy, blood flow through the skin increases, not decreases. This increased flow is part of the thermoregulatory changes that occur in pregnancy to dissipate the extra heat produced by the mother and the growing fetus. This adaptation results in improved heat exchange and contributes to the characteristic “pregnancy glow.” A decrease in skin blood flow would be abnormal during pregnancy, making B the correct answer. Why the other options are correct: A) Uterine blood flow at term is 750 ml/min By term, uterine blood flow increases significantly to support the placenta and fetus, reaching approximately 750 ml/min, which accounts for about 10% of maternal cardiac output. This increased flow is critical for nutrient and oxygen exchange between mother and fetus. C) Renal blood flow increases by 80% Renal blood flow increases by up to 80% during pregnancy, peaking during the second trimester. This change supports the increased metabolic demands, waste elimination for both mother and fetus, and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance. D) Pulmonary blood flow increases Pulmonary blood flow increases during pregnancy due to elevated cardiac output and reduced pulmonary vascular resistance. This ensures efficient oxygenation of blood to meet the increased oxygen demands of pregnancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Prolactin Prolactin is a single-chain polypeptide hormone that does not have alpha and beta subunits. It is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland and functions primarily in lactation by promoting mammary gland development and milk production. Unlike glycoprotein hormones like FSH, hCG, or insulin, prolactin does not require subunits for its structure or activity, making option C the correct answer. Why the other options are incorrect: A) FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) FSH is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two subunits: an alpha subunit, which is common to other glycoprotein hormones (like LH, TSH, and hCG), and a beta subunit, which provides its unique biological specificity. These subunits are essential for its function in regulating ovarian follicle development in females and spermatogenesis in males. B) hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) hCG is also a glycoprotein hormone with distinct alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is identical to that of FSH, LH, and TSH, while the beta subunit gives hCG its unique functional identity, including its role in maintaining the corpus luteum and supporting early pregnancy. D) Insulin Insulin is not a glycoprotein hormone but is composed of two peptide chains (A and B chains) connected by disulfide bonds. While it does not have alpha and beta subunits, its structure involves separate chains that are critical for its function in glucose metabolism. Some key points about hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin): 1. Structure • hCG is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two subunits: • Alpha subunit: Common to FSH, LH, and TSH. • Beta subunit: Unique to hCG, providing its specific biological function and used for pregnancy detection in tests. 2. Source of Secretion • hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta shortly after implantation. • It is detectable in blood and urine within 8-10 days after ovulation. 3. Functions • Maintains the corpus luteum during early pregnancy, ensuring continued production of progesterone and estrogen until the placenta takes over this role. • Stimulates the fetal testes to produce testosterone in male fetuses. • Plays a role in immune tolerance by modulating maternal immune responses. 4. Clinical Use • Pregnancy Detection: • hCG is the basis for most pregnancy tests (urine and serum). • Serum hCG levels can confirm pregnancy earlier than urine tests. • Monitoring Pregnancy: • hCG levels double approximately every 48-72 hours in early pregnancy. • Abnormal hCG levels can indicate issues: • Low hCG: Possible miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. • High hCG: Could suggest multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancy, or gestational trophoblastic disease. • Tumor Marker: • Elevated hCG is associated with certain cancers like choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors, and some non-pregnancy-related tumors. 5. Levels During Pregnancy • Peaks around 8-11 weeks of gestation and then declines to lower levels for the remainder of pregnancy. 6. Role in Pathological Conditions • Molar Pregnancy: Markedly elevated hCG levels. • Ectopic Pregnancy: Lower or slowly rising hCG levels. • Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD): Extremely high and persistent hCG levels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 12th week The fetal pancreas begins secreting insulin by approximately the 12th week of gestation. Insulin plays a key role in regulating glucose metabolism and ensuring proper fetal growth. While the fetal pancreas starts developing as early as the 5th week of gestation, insulin secretion starts later, when the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans become functional. This hormone is crucial for glucose homeostasis, and its production is influenced by maternal glucose levels, as maternal insulin does not cross the placenta. Fetal Thyroid Hormones (T3 and T4) • Timing: • Thyroid gland begins development by 8–10 weeks. Fetal DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) is a precursor steroid hormone primarily produced by the fetal adrenal glands. It plays a vital role in the synthesis of estrogens by the placenta during pregnancy. Fetal DHEAS is transported to the placenta, where it is converted into estradiol, estrone, and estriol. • Estriol (E3) is a major estrogen synthesized from DHEAS and serves as an important marker of fetal well-being. • Hormone production starts around 12 weeks. • Source: Fetal thyroid gland. • Function: Critical for brain development and overall growth.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most likely etiology of this patient’s right-sided groin pain is A. Round ligament pain. Round ligament pain is a common condition during pregnancy, particularly in the second trimester. It occurs as the uterus expands, causing the round ligaments that support it to stretch and sometimes spasm. The pain is typically sharp, localized, and worsens with movement or exercise, much like the patient describes. The fact that the pain improves with a heating pad further supports this diagnosis, as round ligament pain often resolves with rest or gentle heat application. Incorrect Answers: B. Appendicitis: While appendicitis could cause right-sided abdominal pain, it typically presents with more severe, constant pain that worsens over time. This is often accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting, none of which are present in this case. The absence of systemic symptoms and the fact that the pain is positional and related to movement make appendicitis less likely. C. Preterm labor: Preterm labor is usually associated with uterine contractions, which are not described in this case. Preterm labor may also present with lower abdominal discomfort, but it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, fluid leakage, or regular contractions. The lack of these associated symptoms, as well as the relief from heating pads, makes preterm labor unlikely. D. Kidney stone: Kidney stones typically cause severe, colicky pain, often radiating to the back or flank. The pain is usually episodic and may be associated with hematuria or difficulty urinating. This patient's pain is localized to the groin and is associated with movement, which is not characteristic of kidney stones. E. Urinary tract infection (UTI): A UTI typically presents with symptoms such as dysuria (painful urination), increased frequency of urination, or lower abdominal discomfort. This patient does not report any urinary symptoms, making a UTI unlikely in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters, trace glucosuria (sugar in the urine) is commonly observed and often physiologic (normal). This occurs due to: • Increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during pregnancy • Slightly reduced renal threshold for glucose reabsorption • Because of these changes, small amounts of glucose may appear in the urine even when blood glucose levels are normal. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Diabetes: While glucosuria can occur in diabetes, trace levels alone—especially without other signs (e.g., high blood glucose, symptoms of diabetes)—are not diagnostic of diabetes in pregnancy. B. Urine infection: Glucosuria is not a typical sign of a urinary tract infection. UTIs more commonly show positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and possibly bacteria or white blood cells on microscopy. D. Kidney disease: Glucosuria can occur in proximal tubule dysfunction (e.g., Fanconi syndrome), but this is rare and would usually be accompanied by other abnormalities like proteinuria, aminoaciduria, or phosphaturia.",

TBG is a protein that binds thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in the bloodstream. As TBG levels increase, more thyroid hormones are bound, leading to an initial drop in free (active) T3 and T4. In response, the thyroid gland increases production of T3 and T4 to maintain normal free hormone levels. Consequently, total T3 and T4 levels become elevated, but free T3 and T4 remain relatively stable. This adaptation ensures adequate thyroid hormone availability for both the mother and the developing fetus. The increase in TBG is a normal and expected physiological change during pregnancy to support increased metabolic demands.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Compression of the in inferior vena cava Supine hypotensive syndrome, also known as aortocaval compression syndrome, occurs when a pregnant woman (usually after 20 weeks, most commonly near term) lies flat on her back. In this position, the heavy gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, the large vein that returns blood from the lower body to the heart. Compression of the inferior vena cava reduces venous return (preload) to the heart, leading to a significant decrease in cardiac output and resulting in hypotension. Symptoms can include dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, pallor, and even syncope. The condition is quickly relieved by turning the woman onto her left side, which shifts the uterus off the vena cava and restores normal blood flow. This makes compression of the inferior vena cava the immediate physiological cause of supine hypotensive syndrome.",

Progesterone acts directly on the central respiratory centers in the brainstem, increasing their sensitivity to carbon dioxide. As a result, the mother breathes more deeply (increased tidal volume) and slightly more rapidly, leading to a mild hyperventilation. This hyperventilation causes an increased elimination of CO?, leading to respiratory alkalosis (decrease in arterial CO? levels). To compensate for this alkalosis, the kidneys excrete more bicarbonate, maintaining near-normal blood pH. Thus, increased progesterone stimulation of the respiratory center is the primary physiological mechanism responsible for compensated respiratory alkalosis in pregnancy.",

Progesterone causes smooth muscle relaxation throughout the body, including the urinary tract, leading to ureteral dilation (hydroureter) and decreased peristalsis of the ureters. Additionally, the enlarging uterus can physically compress the ureters, especially on the right side, further promoting urinary stasis.
