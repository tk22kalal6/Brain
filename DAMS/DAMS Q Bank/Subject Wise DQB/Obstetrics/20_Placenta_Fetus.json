      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) During the first half, the hemoglobin is of fetal type (α-2, γ-2) but from 24 weeks onwards, adult type of hemoglobin (α-2, β-2) appears and At term about 75–80% of the total hemoglobin is of fetal type (HbF). Between 5 and 8 weeks, the embryo manufactures some additional hemoglobin: Hb Gower 1 (ξ- and ε-chains), Hb Gower 2 (α- and ε-chains) and Hb Portland (ξ- and γ-chains). Between 6–12 months after birth, the fetal hemoglobin is completely replaced by adult haemoglobin (Ref dutta textbook of obstetrics/8th edition/47)",

It feels spongy and weighs about 500 gm, the proportion to the weight of the baby being roughly 1 : 6 at term and occupies about 30% of the uterine wall.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Placental circulation, which is essential for the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste between the mother and the developing embryo, is typically established by 17 days after ovulation. By this time, the trophoblast has differentiated into the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast, and the lacunar networks (interconnected spaces filled with maternal blood) have formed within the syncytiotrophoblast. These lacunae integrate with maternal capillaries, leading to the establishment of the uteroplacental circulation. This circulation is critical for supporting the rapidly growing embryo by providing oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CIRCUMVALLATE PLACENTA -The fetal surface is divided into a central depressed zone surrounded by a thickened white ring which is usually complete. The placenta of such type is due to the smaller chorionic plate than the basal plate.The ring is situated at varying distances from the margin of the placenta. The ring is composed of a double fold of amnion and chorion with degenerated decidua (vera) and fibrin in between (2) Vessels radiate from the cord insertion as far as the ring and then disappear from view (3) The peripheral zone outside the ring is thicker and the edge is elevated and rounded PLACENTA MEMBRANECEA: The placenta is unduly large and thin. The placenta not only develops from the chorion frondosum but also from the chorion laeve so that the whole of the ovum is practically covered by the placenta SUCCENTURIATE PLACENTA- One (usual) or more small lobes of placenta, size of a cotyledon, may be placed at varying distances from the main placental margin. A leash of vessels connecting the main to the small lobe traverse through the membranes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 21 days Fetal circulation becomes first intact and functional, separated from maternal circulation, by 21 days of development. By this time, the primitive heart tube, which begins forming around day 18, starts beating and pumping blood through a rudimentary circulatory system. The fetal circulatory system is distinct from the maternal system, as the two are connected only via the placenta. The placenta facilitates the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products without mixing maternal and fetal blood. The establishment of this independent fetal circulation by day 21 is crucial for supporting the embryo’s rapid growth and development. Why the other options are incorrect: A) 8 days At 8 days, implantation is still in progress, and the embryo is in the blastocyst stage. The circulatory system has not yet formed, and there is no functioning heart or blood flow at this stage. B) 12 days By 12 days, lacunar spaces in the syncytiotrophoblast begin filling with maternal blood, but the embryonic circulatory system is not yet functional. The primitive streak and other early structures are forming, but circulation is not established. C) 17 days Around 17 days, the cardiogenic region is developing, and the heart tube begins forming, but it is not yet functional. Blood circulation starts only when the heart begins to beat, which occurs around day 21.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Umbilical vein In utero, oxygenated blood from the placenta reaches the fetal heart via the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein carries oxygen-rich and nutrient-laden blood from the placenta directly to the fetus. It traverses the umbilical cord and enters the fetal abdomen, where it connects to the ductus venosus. The ductus venosus allows the blood to bypass the liver and flow into the inferior vena cava, eventually reaching the fetal heart. This route is critical for delivering oxygenated blood to the fetal circulation and supporting fetal development. Why the other options are incorrect: A) Umbilical arteries This is incorrect because the umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood and waste products from the fetus to the placenta for removal and reoxygenation. They do not deliver oxygenated blood to the fetal heart. C) Ductus venosus While the ductus venosus is a key structure in the pathway of oxygenated blood, it is not the vessel that directly carries blood from the placenta. Instead, it is a conduit that channels blood from the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, bypassing the liver. D) Ductus arteriosus The ductus arteriosus is part of the fetal circulatory shunt system, connecting the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta to bypass the non-functional fetal lungs. It does not transport oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetal heart.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In the first trimester placental growth is more rapid than that of the fetus.But by approximately 17 post menstrual weeks, placental and fetal weights are approximately equal key characteristics of the placenta: 1. Weight: • The placenta weighs approximately 500–700 grams at term (about 1/6th of the weight of the fetus). 2. Thickness: • The placenta is about 2.5 cm thick at its center, thinning toward the edges. The thickness increases as the pregnancy progresses. 3. Diameter: • The placenta is disc-shaped with a diameter of about 15–20 cm at full term. 4. Surface: • Maternal side (basal plate): Rough, reddish, and attached to the uterine wall. It shows cotyledons (lobules). • Fetal side (chorionic plate): Smooth and shiny, covered by the amnion and showing the umbilical cord insertion. 5. Shape: • The placenta is generally disc-shaped, but variations (such as bilobed or circumvallate placenta) can occur. 6. Blood Flow: • At term, the placenta receives about 500–700 mL of maternal blood per minute, ensuring sufficient nutrient and oxygen supply to the fetus. 7. Lifespan: • The placenta is a temporary organ that develops early in pregnancy (around 2–3 weeks post-fertilization) and is expelled after delivery as the “afterbirth.” 8. Functional Units: • The placenta is divided into 15–20 cotyledons (functional lobules), each containing chorionic villi immersed in maternal blood.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) PGE2 PGE2 (Prostaglandin E2) is the prostaglandin predominantly present in the fetal membranes (amnion and chorion). It plays a critical role in pregnancy and labor by promoting cervical ripening, myometrial contractions, and membrane rupture during labor. PGE2 is synthesized in large amounts by the amnion and chorion in response to various signals leading to the initiation of labor. Its ability to stimulate uterine contractions and facilitate the dilation of the cervix makes it central to the processes of parturition (childbirth). Why the other options are incorrect: A) PGE1 PGE1 is less significant in fetal membranes. While it has roles in vasodilation and other physiological processes, it is not the predominant prostaglandin in the fetal membranes. Its presence is minimal compared to PGE2. C) PGF2 PGF2 (Prostaglandin F2-alpha) is more involved in promoting uterine contractions and luteolysis, but it is not the main prostaglandin in the fetal membranes. Its synthesis and action are more associated with the myometrium rather than the amnion or chorion. D) PGI2 PGI2 (Prostacyclin) is primarily a vasodilator and platelet aggregation inhibitor.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vasa previa Vasa previa is a rare but serious obstetric condition where fetal blood vessels traverse the fetal membranes across the internal cervical os, unprotected by the umbilical cord or placental tissue. These exposed vessels are susceptible to rupture when the membranes rupture during labor, leading to significant fetal blood loss. If not promptly managed, this can result in rapid fetal exsanguination and potentially fatal outcomes. Early diagnosis through prenatal ultrasound and planned cesarean delivery are crucial to prevent complications associated with vasa previa. ? Why the other options are incorrect: B) Decidua basalis The decidua basalis is the maternal portion of the placenta where the embryo implants. It does not involve abnormal cord insertion or exposed fetal vessels; therefore, it is not associated with fetal blood loss due to cord insertion anomalies. C) Battledore placenta Also known as marginal cord insertion, battledore placenta occurs when the umbilical cord attaches at the edge of the placenta. While this is an abnormal insertion, it typically does not lead to fetal blood loss. However, it may be associated with other complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction or preterm labor. ? D) Succenturiate placenta A succenturiate placenta has one or more accessory lobes connected to the main placenta by blood vessels. While these connecting vessels can be vulnerable, especially if they traverse the membranes, the condition itself does not inherently involve abnormal cord insertion leading to fetal blood loss. However, if vessels connecting the lobes cross the cervical os, it can result in vasa previa. ?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above The human placenta exhibits several key characteristics that can be described as discoidal, hemochorial, and deciduate. • Discoidal: The human placenta is classified as discoidal because it has a disc-like shape. This means that the chorionic villi are concentrated in a circular region, forming a disc, which facilitates efficient maternal-fetal exchange. ? • Hemochorial: In a hemochorial placenta, the chorionic villi are in direct contact with maternal blood. This intimate association allows for effective exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between the mother and fetus. ? • Deciduate: The term deciduate refers to the shedding of the uterine lining, or decidua, during childbirth. In humans, the placenta is firmly attached to the uterine wall, and during delivery, both the placenta and the decidual lining are expelled, classifying it as deciduate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 16th week During early pregnancy, the uterine cavity is partially occupied by the developing gestational sac, creating a space between the decidua capsularis (the decidua overlying the implanted embryo) and the decidua parietalis (the decidua lining the rest of the uterine cavity). As the fetus grows, the gestational sac expands, causing the decidua capsularis to come into contact with the decidua parietalis. By approximately the 16th week of gestation, these two layers fuse, leading to the obliteration of the decidual space and effectively eliminating the uterine cavity. By the 14th week, the decidua capsularis is approaching the decidua parietalis, but complete fusion has typically not occurred. The decidual space may be significantly reduced but is not entirely obliterated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Human Placental Lactogen (hPL) Human Placental Lactogen (hPL), also known as human chorionic somatomammotropin, is a hormone produced exclusively by the placenta during pregnancy. It plays a crucial role in regulating maternal metabolism to facilitate fetal growth. hPL modulates maternal glucose metabolism, ensuring a steady supply of glucose to the developing fetus. Additionally, it promotes mammary gland development in preparation for lactation. The unique production of hPL by the placenta distinguishes it from other hormones that may have multiple sources. ? Why the other options are incorrect: A) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) While hCG is predominantly produced by the placenta during pregnancy, it is not exclusive to the placenta. hCG can also be secreted by certain tumors, such as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and some germ cell tumors, making its production not entirely exclusive to the placenta. ? B) Estrogen Estrogen is a hormone with multiple sources in the body. During pregnancy, the placenta becomes a significant producer of estrogen to support gestational processes. However, estrogen is also synthesized by the ovaries, adrenal glands, and, in smaller amounts, by adipose tissue, indicating that its production is not exclusive to the placenta. ? D) Prolactin Prolactin is primarily produced by the anterior pituitary gland and plays a key role in lactation. Although the decidua (part of the uterine lining during pregnancy) can produce prolactin, the placenta itself does not secrete this hormone. Therefore, prolactin is not produced by the placenta, let alone exclusively.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) refers to a condition where a fetus is smaller than expected for its gestational age, often due to inadequate nutrient and oxygen supply. In cases of IUGR, the placenta is typically smaller or exhibits abnormalities that impair its function, rather than being enlarged. Therefore, a large placenta is not characteristic of IUGR, making option A the correct answer. Why the other options are incorrect: B) Syphilis Syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, can lead to placental abnormalities. In congenital syphilis, the placenta often becomes enlarged and thickened due to inflammation and villous edema. This enlargement is a response to the infection and can impact placental function. C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral infection that can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy. Congenital CMV infection is associated with an enlarged placenta, resulting from viral-induced placental inflammation and villous edema. This enlargement can affect nutrient and oxygen exchange between mother and fetus. D) Rubella Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection that can cause serious complications if contracted during pregnancy. Congenital rubella syndrome can lead to an enlarged placenta, attributed to chronic villitis and increased vascularity. The placental enlargement reflects the body’s response to the infection and can influence fetal development. Placentomegaly refers to an abnormally enlarged placenta, typically defined as a thickness exceeding 4 cm at any stage of pregnancy. This condition can arise from various maternal and fetal factors, including: • Maternal Diabetes Mellitus: Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to placental enlargement. • Maternal Anemia: Severe anemia may result in placental hypertrophy as a compensatory mechanism to enhance oxygen delivery to the fetus. • Fetal Hydrops: This condition, characterized by excessive fluid accumulation in fetal compartments, is often associated with placentomegaly. • Intrauterine Infections: Infections such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and toxoplasmosis can lead to placental enlargement due to inflammatory responses. • Umbilical Vein Obstruction: Obstruction can cause increased placental size. • Fetal High Output Failure: Conditions leading to increased fetal cardiac output can result in placentomegaly. • Fetal Malformations: Certain congenital anomalies, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and sacrococcygeal teratoma, are linked to placental enlargement. • Chromosomal Anomalies: Triploidy, especially with an extra set from paternal origin, can be associated with placentomegaly. • Placental Abnormalities: Conditions like placental chorioangioma, intraplacental hemorrhage, hydatidiform mole, partial mole, and placental mesenchymal dysplasia can lead to an enlarged placenta.",

This condition is strongly associated with vasa previa, a serious obstetric complication where fetal blood vessels run across or very near the internal cervical os beneath the presenting part.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Circumvallate placenta Circumvallate placenta is a placental abnormality characterized by the presence of a thickened ring at the periphery of the placenta formed by a double layer of amnion and chorion, which folds back over the edge of the placenta. This extra ring of tissue occurs due to abnormal chorionic plate development and leads to a smaller chorionic plate compared to the basal plate. The exposed edge of the placenta can lead to complications such as placental abruption, bleeding, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm delivery. The raised, thickened ring appears as a margin surrounding the fetal surface of the placenta and can be seen on ultrasound or gross examination after delivery. Because of the increased risk of separation of the placenta from the uterine wall (abruption), this condition can compromise fetal blood supply and pose danger to both the fetus and mother",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hcg (Human chorionic gonadotropin) hCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, is the hormone primarily responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum during early pregnancy. It is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the developing embryo shortly after implantation. The corpus luteum, which forms from the ruptured follicle after ovulation, normally secretes progesterone to maintain the endometrial lining for implantation. However, without continued stimulation, the corpus luteum would degenerate. hCG mimics luteinizing hormone (LH) and binds to LH receptors on the corpus luteum, signaling it to continue producing progesterone until the placenta is developed enough (around 10–12 weeks of pregnancy) to take over progesterone production. Without hCG, the corpus luteum would regress, leading to a fall in progesterone and loss of the pregnancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Human placental lactogen Human placental lactogen (hPL), also known as human chorionic somatomammotropin, is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta and plays a key role in metabolic adaptation during pregnancy. One of its primary functions is to induce insulin resistance in the mother. This ensures that more glucose remains in the maternal bloodstream, making it readily available for transfer to the growing fetus. hPL decreases maternal sensitivity to insulin and promotes lipolysis, providing free fatty acids as an alternative energy source for the mother. This insulin resistance peaks in the third trimester and can sometimes lead to gestational diabetes in susceptible women. hPL is the major hormonal contributor to insulin resistance in pregnancy.",
