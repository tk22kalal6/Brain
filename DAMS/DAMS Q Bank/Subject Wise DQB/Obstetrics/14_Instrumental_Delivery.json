      "solution": "Correct Answer: (C) Intracranial hemorrhage Intracranial hemorrhage is not more common with vacuum-assisted delivery compared to forceps delivery. Both vacuum-assisted and forceps-assisted deliveries carry a risk of intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in preterm infants or in cases of prolonged or difficult delivery. However, forceps delivery has a slightly higher association with direct trauma to the skull and intracranial structures, making intracranial hemorrhage more likely in forceps-assisted deliveries than in vacuum-assisted ones. Vacuum extraction is less invasive in terms of direct mechanical force applied to the skull, reducing the relative risk of this complication. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cephalhematoma: Cephalhematoma, a collection of blood between the skull and periosteum, is more commonly associated with vacuum-assisted delivery than forceps delivery. The suction applied by the vacuum extractor can cause localized bleeding under the scalp. Cephalhematomas are typically self-limiting but can lead to complications like jaundice due to increased bilirubin levels. (B) Subgaleal hematoma: Subgaleal hematoma, a potentially life-threatening complication, occurs more frequently with vacuum-assisted delivery. It involves bleeding in the subgaleal space (between the scalp and skull periosteum) and can lead to significant blood loss in neonates. The risk is increased with prolonged suction application or multiple vacuum attempts. (D) Transient lateral rectus palsy: Transient lateral rectus palsy, a type of cranial nerve palsy, is more commonly associated with forceps delivery but is rarely reported in vacuum-assisted deliveries. However, it is not considered a hallmark complication of vacuum extraction. When it does occur in vacuum-assisted deliveries, it is usually due to compression or traction forces applied to the cranial nerves during the extraction process.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (D) Applied 3 cm anterior to posterior fontanel The correct placement of the vacuum cup during vacuum extraction is 3 cm anterior to the posterior fontanel. This corresponds to the flexion point on the fetal skull, located on the sagittal suture. Proper placement at this point ensures optimal traction, maintaining fetal head flexion during delivery. This position minimizes trauma to the fetal scalp and reduces the likelihood of complications like cephalhematoma or subgaleal hemorrhage. Correct placement is critical for the success and safety of the procedure. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Can be used in non-dilated cervix: Vacuum extraction cannot be used in a non-dilated cervix. A fully dilated cervix (10 cm) is essential for vacuum-assisted delivery. Attempting to apply the vacuum cup through an undilated cervix risks maternal tissue injury, ineffective delivery, and severe complications for the fetus, such as head trauma. (B) Used in face presentation: Vacuum extraction is contraindicated in face presentation. This presentation prevents the proper placement of the vacuum cup on the flexion point, leading to inadequate traction and an increased risk of fetal injury. Face presentations often require cesarean delivery if vaginal delivery is deemed unsafe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (C) Cephalohematoma Cephalohematoma is the most common complication associated with vacuum extraction. It results from the rupture of blood vessels between the periosteum and the skull, leading to a localized collection of blood. This condition is more frequent in vacuum-assisted deliveries due to the suction force applied to the fetal scalp. While cephalohematoma is typically self-limiting and resolves over weeks, it can sometimes lead to complications such as hyperbilirubinemia from the breakdown of red blood cells. Proper vacuum placement and minimizing the number of pulls can reduce the incidence of this complication. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Fetal facial nerve palsy: Fetal facial nerve palsy is more commonly associated with forceps delivery, where direct pressure on the facial nerve can lead to temporary or permanent nerve damage. While rare, facial nerve palsy can occasionally occur with vacuum extraction if excessive pressure or misplacement of the cup affects the cranial nerves. However, it is not the most common complication. (B) Maternal perineal laceration: Maternal perineal lacerations can occur during any assisted vaginal delivery, including vacuum extraction, due to the stretching and tearing of perineal tissues. However, these lacerations are generally less severe with vacuum extraction compared to forceps delivery, making this a less common complication associated specifically with vacuum use. (D) Fetal skull fracture: Fetal skull fractures are a rare complication of vacuum extraction, usually occurring only with improper technique, excessive traction, or prolonged attempts. They are more likely to be associated with forceps-assisted deliveries or traumatic circumstances. When using a vacuum device correctly, the risk of skull fracture is minimal.",
