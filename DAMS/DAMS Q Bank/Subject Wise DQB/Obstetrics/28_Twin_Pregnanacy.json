      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most common lie of the fetuses is longitudinal (90%) but malpresentations are quite common. The combination of presentation of the fetuses are—(1) both vertex (50%), (2) first vertex and second breech (30%), (3) first breech and second vertex (10%), (4) both breech (10%), (5) first vertex and second transverse and so on, but rarest one, being both transverse when the possibility of conjoined twins should be ruled out. Mode of Delivery in Vertex + Non-Vertex First Twin: Vertex + Transverse or Breech: If the first twin is in the vertex position, vaginal delivery is often attempted for the first twin. For the second twin, the mode of delivery depends on the presentation: If transverse, external cephalic version (ECV) may be attempted to turn the second twin into a vertex or breech position. If breech, assisted breech delivery may be considered, but cesarean delivery is also a common choice, particularly if complications arise. Factors Influencing Decision: Gestational age: Preterm twins may require cesarean delivery due to higher risks. Fetal size and weight: Discrepancy between the twins' sizes may influence the delivery plan. Expertise of the obstetrician: Vaginal breech delivery requires specialized skills. Careful monitoring, individual assessment, and team preparedness are crucial in managing twin deliveries, especially when non-vertex presentations are involved.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) “Twin peak” sign. In dichorionic diamniotic twin gestations, the chorion and amnion for each twin reflect away from the fused placenta to form the intertwin membrane. A potential space exists in the intertwin membrane, which is filled by proliferating placental villi giving rise to the twin peak sign. Twin peak sign appears as a triangle with the base at the chorionic surface and the apex in the intertwin membrane. Key Sonographic Markers: Lambda Sign (Twin Peak Sign): Indicates dichorionicity. This triangular projection of tissue at the junction of the amnion and chorion is best seen at 10-14 weeks. T-Sign: Indicates monochorionicity. This is the absence of a lambda sign, where the amniotic membrane meets the placenta at a 90-degree angle, forming a \"T\" shape. Identifying chorionicity during the optimal timeframe (10-14 weeks) ensures better monitoring and management of twin pregnancies, helping to minimize risks and complications.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/21280061.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) >8 days Monochorionic monoamniotic twins occur when the embryo divides after 8 days post-fertilization. This late division results in both twins sharing a single chorion (the outer membrane that surrounds the fetus) and a single amniotic sac. Since the division happens after the formation of the chorion but before the amniotic sacs are completely formed, both fetuses share the same amniotic fluid. These twins are at a higher risk for complications, such as cord entanglement, due to the shared space in the amniotic sac. Option A: Before 24 hours – Incorrect If the division occurs before 24 hours (also known as a very early division), it results in two separate embryos with their own chorion and amniotic sac, leading to dichorionic diamniotic twins. This type of twinning has a lower risk of complications as each twin has its own sac and placenta. Option B: 1-4 days – Incorrect Division occurring between 1-4 days after fertilization leads to monochorionic diamniotic twins. In this case, both twins share a single placenta (chorion) but each has its own amniotic sac. Although these twins share a placenta, they do not face the same risks as monochorionic monoamniotic twins, such as cord entanglement, because they are still separated by individual sacs. Option C: 4-8 days – Incorrect Division occurring between 4-8 days leads to monochorionic diamniotic twins as well, similar to option B. Each twin has its own amniotic sac but shares a placenta. The risks of complications are lower compared to the monochorionic monoamniotic type, though still higher than dichorionic diamniotic twins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fertilization of 2 ova released at the same time, by sperms released at intercourse on 2 different occasions Superfecundation occurs when two ova are released during the same menstrual cycle, but they are fertilized by sperm from different instances of intercourse, typically on different days. This rare phenomenon can occur when a woman has sexual intercourse with different men (heteropaternal superfecundation) or with the same partner, but sperm from separate encounters fertilize two eggs. The fertilization of two different eggs by sperm from separate acts of intercourse is the key characteristic of superfecundation. Option B: Fertilization of 2 ova released at the same time by sperms released at a single intercourse – Incorrect This situation describes a normal case of multiple fertilization, but not superfecundation. In this case, two eggs are released simultaneously and fertilized by sperm from a single act of intercourse, leading to twins. This is not considered superfecundation because both eggs are fertilized by sperm from the same instance of intercourse. Option C: Both – Incorrect This option is incorrect because superfecundation specifically refers to the fertilization of two eggs by sperm from separate acts of intercourse. Fertilization of two eggs by sperm from a single intercourse (as described in option B) does not fit the definition of superfecundation. Option D: None – Incorrect This option is incorrect because superfecundation is a recognized phenomenon and is accurately described in option A.",

Preeclampsia (25%)(including PIH) is increased three times over singleton pregnancy. Exposure to superabundance of chorionic villi is the possible explanation Hydramnios (10%) is more common in monozygotic twins and usually involves the second sac. It is perhaps due to increased renal perfusion with consequent increased urinary output which may accompany the hypervolemia in the larger twin. Antepartum hemorrhage may occur with slight increased frequency. The increased incidence of placenta previa is due to the bigger size of the placenta encroaching on to the lower segment Malpresentation is quite common in twins compared to singleton pregnancies Preterm labor (50%) frequently occurs and the mean gestational period for twins is 37 weeks Hence answer for above question is D",

At this stage, the fetal structures are clearly visible, and it is easier to identify and reduce the number of fetuses with minimal risk to the mother and remaining fetuses. This is also the time when detailed ultrasound scans and genetic screening tests are typically performed, providing an opportunity to make informed decisions. Important Points About Embryo Reduction: Purpose: Used to decrease the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy, improving the chances of a successful outcome and reducing maternal and fetal risks such as preterm labor, growth restrictions, or complications like twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Optimal Timing: Ideally performed at 11-13 weeks, as this allows for thorough evaluation and reduces risks to the ongoing pregnancy. Procedure: Typically done via transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound guidance, using potassium chloride (KCl) injection to stop the heartbeat of the selected embryo(s). Risks: Potential complications include miscarriage, infection, and psychological distress for the parents. Ethical Considerations: The procedure should be approached with sensitivity and thorough counseling, ensuring the parents understand the medical and ethical implications. Performing embryo reduction at the right time and under careful guidance improves outcomes for the mother and the remaining fetus(es), balancing medical necessity with ethical considerations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cord entanglement Cord entanglement is a complication specific to monoamniotic twins, where both twins share a single amniotic sac. Due to the shared space, their umbilical cords are at risk of becoming entangled, which can lead to a variety of complications, including restricted blood flow, fetal distress, and even stillbirth. This is a significant concern in monoamniotic pregnancies, and careful monitoring through ultrasound is essential to assess fetal well-being. The risk of cord entanglement is not present in other types of multiple pregnancies, making it a hallmark complication of monoamniotic twins. Option A: TTTS (Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome) – Incorrect TTTS is a condition seen in monochorionic diamniotic twins, where both twins share a single placenta. It involves uneven blood flow between the twins, leading to one twin receiving too much blood and the other receiving too little. While TTTS is a serious complication of monochorionic pregnancies, it does not occur in monoamniotic twins, as these twins share both a chorion and an amniotic sac, and TTTS is specific to the placental sharing. Option C: TRAP (Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion) – Incorrect TRAP is a rare complication seen in monochorionic twin pregnancies where one twin (the \"pump\" twin) has a normal circulatory system, and the other (the \"acardiac\" twin) has a malformed circulatory system. This occurs due to abnormal vascular connections in the shared placenta. However, it is not a complication specific to monoamniotic twins. TRAP is more commonly associated with monochorionic pregnancies with abnormal placental anastomoses. Option D: Acardiac twin – Incorrect An acardiac twin occurs in monochorionic pregnancies with abnormal placental blood vessel connections, often seen in cases of TRAP syndrome. The acardiac twin is severely malformed, lacking a heart and most organs, but still receives blood flow from the pump twin. This is not specific to monoamniotic twins and is a complication that arises due to abnormal placental circulation in monochorionic twins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) DNA fingerprinting The most definitive proof of monozygosity (i.e., identical twins) is through DNA fingerprinting, which involves comparing the genetic material of the twins using techniques like the DNA microprobe technique. Since monozygotic twins originate from a single fertilized egg that splits, they have identical genetic material. DNA fingerprinting allows for the most accurate confirmation of this genetic identity. By comparing their DNA, it is possible to conclusively determine whether the twins are genetically identical, thus confirming monozygosity. Option B: Intervening membrane layers – Incorrect The intervening membrane layers (whether the twins have a shared or separate amniotic sac and chorion) can suggest whether the twins are monozygotic or dizygotic but cannot provide absolute proof of monozygosity. For example, monochorionic monoamniotic twins share both the chorion and amniotic sac, suggesting they are monozygotic, but this is not a definitive test. Variations in the number and type of membranes cannot fully rule out dizygotic twins, so this is not the best method for proving monozygosity. Option C: Sex of the babies – Incorrect The sex of the babies can be a clue but does not provide absolute proof of monozygosity. Monozygotic twins are always of the same sex, but dizygotic twins can be of the same or different sexes. While it is true that if the twins are of different sexes, they must be dizygotic, identical twins of the same sex could still be monozygotic or dizygotic. Therefore, sex alone is insufficient to confirm monozygosity. Option D: Reciprocal skin grafting – Incorrect Reciprocal skin grafting involves transplanting skin between the two individuals to test for rejection. In theory, identical twins might accept skin grafts from each other, but this is an impractical and outdated method for confirming monozygosity. While it can provide some insight, it is not a reliable or definitive technique compared to DNA testing, which is precise and universally accepted.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 10-14 weeks The best time to detect chorionicity (whether the twins share a placenta or not) by ultrasound is between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. During this period, ultrasound is most accurate for identifying whether the twins are monochorionic (sharing one placenta) or dichorionic (each having a separate placenta). By 11-14 weeks, the twin peak sign (a triangular projection of tissue between the two sacs in dichorionic twins) is visible, which helps in determining chorionicity. This window allows for optimal clarity in distinguishing between the types of twin pregnancies before the placental structures become more complex and harder to differentiate. Option A: 8-12 weeks – Incorrect While chorionicity can be suspected around 8-12 weeks, it is not as definitively detected at this early stage as it is between 10-14 weeks. The placental structures are still developing and may not be clearly distinguishable in early scans. Moreover, the twin peak sign (which is crucial for confirming dichorionicity) may not be visible at this time, making 10-14 weeks the optimal window. Option C: 14-18 weeks – Incorrect Although 14-18 weeks is still a suitable period to detect chorionicity, it is not considered the best time for an initial determination. By this stage, the placental structures are more developed, but they may be harder to distinguish clearly compared to the earlier period of 10-14 weeks. Moreover, the accuracy of identifying specific markers like the twin peak sign diminishes as the pregnancy progresses. Option D: 16-24 weeks – Incorrect By 16-24 weeks, the placenta is fully developed, and it can become more challenging to differentiate the chorionicity with the same level of accuracy as in the earlier period. At this stage, there are fewer visible markers to reliably determine whether the twins are monochorionic or dichorionic, making it a less ideal timeframe for this specific detection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (C) 25% with the larger twin as index Twin discordance refers to a significant difference in the size or growth of the twin fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. For the condition to be termed discordant growth, the difference in size between the twins should be at least 25%, with the larger twin being used as the index. The larger twin is used as a reference to measure the difference, and if the smaller twin is at least 25% smaller in terms of weight or size, the pregnancy is considered discordant. This significant size disparity is often associated with complications such as fetal growth restriction (FGR) or unequal placental blood flow in monochorionic twins. Option A: 15% with the larger twin as index – Incorrect A 15% difference between the twins is too small to be considered discordant growth. This threshold is not sufficient to define significant growth discrepancy and is often used in other contexts but not for discordance. A 25% difference is generally required to diagnose discordant growth. Option B: 15% with the smaller twin as index – Incorrect The 15% difference remains too small to be considered discordant growth, and using the smaller twin as the index does not align with standard definitions. The larger twin is always considered the reference point, as it helps in highlighting the degree of growth disparity more accurately. Therefore, this option is not correct. Option D: 25% with the smaller twin as index – Incorrect Although a 25% difference is correct for defining discordant growth, the reference should be the larger twin, not the smaller twin. Using the smaller twin as the index is not standard practice, as it may underestimate the actual disparity in growth between the two fetuses.",

This leads to the formation of a single placenta but two amnions. Dichorionic–diamniotic twins result from cleavage of the fertilized ovum during the first 2 to 3 days. Cleavage at this stage occurs before cells are differentiated to form the trophoblast. As a result, two placentas (chorions) and two amnions develop. Embryo cleavage between days 8 and 13 again occurs after differentiation of the trophoblast but also after formation of the amnion. This results in a monochorionic and monoamniotic gestation.

If the neonates are of the same sex, blood typing of cord blood samples may be helpful.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MCDA Monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) is the most common type of monozygotic (identical) twin pregnancy, accounting for approximately 70–75% of such cases. In monozygotic twinning, the timing of the zygote's split after fertilization determines the chorionicity and amnionicity. If the division occurs between days 4 and 8 post-fertilization—after the chorion has formed but before the amnion develops—the result is an MCDA pregnancy. These twins share a single placenta (monochorionic) but have separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic). MCDA twins are at increased risk for complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), but the presence of separate amniotic sacs provides some protective benefit compared to more severe forms like MCMA. Due to its frequency and clinical relevance, MCDA is considered the most typical presentation in monozygotic twinning.",

In contrast, twin pregnancies are not associated with an increased risk of macrosomia. Instead, they are much more likely to result in low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and prematurity due to the limited intrauterine space and shared placental resources. Twins usually have lower individual birth weights, and the focus in twin gestations is often on preventing growth restriction rather than monitoring for large-for-gestational-age fetuses. Macrosomia is not characteristic of twin pregnancies, making it the correct \"except\" choice.",

It appears as a triangular projection of placental tissue at the base of the intertwin membrane, forming a lambda (?)-shaped appearance where the membrane meets the placenta. This sign indicates that two separate chorions are present, meaning the pregnancy is dichorionic (most often DCDA). In contrast, monochorionic twins share a placenta, and the intertwin membrane appears thinner and inserts at a sharp angle—forming the T-sign. Identifying chorionicity early in pregnancy is critical, as monochorionic twins have higher risks such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome and require closer monitoring.",

In this type of twin pregnancy, both fetuses share both a single placenta (monochorionic) and a single amniotic sac (monoamniotic). As the fetuses move within the shared amniotic fluid, their umbilical cords are at high risk of becoming entangled, which can lead to cord compression, reduced blood flow, and fetal distress. This is a life-threatening situation and is the primary concern in managing MCMA pregnancies. The risk of cord entanglement is significant because the lack of separate amniotic sacs means the fetuses are unable to move freely without interacting with each other, increasing the likelihood of cord accidents.",

The risk of fetal compromise and delivery complications (such as cord compression or fetal distress) is significantly higher when the second twin is in the breech presentation, especially in a monoamniotic setting where the twins share a single amniotic sac.

Normally, if the embryo divides within the first few days after fertilization (before day 4), it leads to dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins. If division occurs between days 4 and 8, it results in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins. However, when division occurs after day 12, the embryo does not fully separate, leading to conjoined twins.
