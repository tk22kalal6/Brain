      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Middle layer of the myometrium. The middle layer of the myometrium, also known as the “living ligature of the uterus,” plays a critical role in preventing hemorrhage after childbirth. This layer consists of interwoven smooth muscle fibers arranged in a circular pattern around blood vessels. During uterine contraction, these fibers compress the blood vessels, effectively acting as a physiological ligature to minimize blood loss during and after delivery. Normal Blood Loss • Vaginal Delivery: • Average blood loss is 500 mL or less. • Cesarean Delivery: • Average blood loss is 1000 mL or less. Primary PPH is within 24 hrs of delivery Secondary PPH is haemorrhage beyond 24 hrs up to 12 weeks postpartum Types of PPH: 1. Tonal: Uterine atony (most common cause). 2. Trauma: Lacerations, uterine rupture, or hematomas. 3. Tissue: Retained placental fragments or membranes. 4. Thrombin: Coagulopathies or clotting disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH). Postpartum hemorrhage is the most common cause of maternal death after delivery, accounting for a significant proportion of maternal mortality worldwide. PPH is defined as blood loss exceeding 500 mL after vaginal delivery or 1000 mL after cesarean delivery. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, where the uterus fails to contract effectively, leading to excessive bleeding. Delayed recognition and management can lead to hypovolemic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), organ failure, and death. Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE) • A rare, catastrophic obstetric emergency caused by amniotic fluid, fetal cells, or debris entering the maternal circulation, triggering a severe inflammatory and anaphylactoid reaction. • 1 in 40,000 deliveries. • High maternal mortality (up to 20–60%). Uterine inversion A rare obstetric emergency where the uterus turns inside out, typically after delivery. Clinical Presentation: • Severe abdominal pain. • Hemorrhagic shock. • Visible mass at or outside the vaginal introitus in complete/prolapsed inversion. • Absent uterine fundus on abdominal palpation. Causes: • Excessive cord traction. • Uterine atony. • Abnormal placental adherence (e.g., placenta accreta). • Fundal pressure during the third stage of labor. Peripartum Cardiomyopathy • A rare, life-threatening form of heart failure that occurs during the last month of pregnancy or up to 5 months postpartum, without an identifiable cause. Risk Factors: • Advanced maternal age. • Multiparity. • Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (e.g., preeclampsia). • Twin pregnancy. • Obesity. Clinical Presentation: • Symptoms of heart failure: • Dyspnea (on exertion or at rest). • Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. • Fatigue. • Peripheral edema.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Uterine massage. Uterine massage is not recommended by the WHO as a routine preventive measure for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Instead, it is used as a therapeutic intervention if uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract effectively) is detected or suspected. For prevention of PPH, WHO emphasizes the use of uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin) and active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL). Components of Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) by WHO The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. The components of AMTSL include the following steps: 1. Administration of Uterotonics • What: A uterotonic is administered immediately after delivery of the baby. • Preferred Drug: Oxytocin (10 IU) given intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). • Alternatives: • Misoprostol (600 µg orally) if oxytocin is not available. • Ergometrine or oxytocin-ergometrine combination (with caution in hypertensive patients). • Why: Promotes uterine contractions, reduces uterine atony, and minimizes blood loss. 2. Controlled Cord Traction (CCT) • What: The umbilical cord is gently pulled while supporting the uterus to deliver the placenta. • Steps: • Wait for signs of placental separation (e.g., cord lengthening, gush of blood). • Apply gentle downward traction on the cord with one hand while supporting the uterus with the other hand. • Why: Facilitates placental delivery, reduces the risk of retained placenta, and minimizes excessive bleeding. 3. Uterine Tone Assessment • What: After placental delivery, the uterus is palpated to ensure it is firm and contracted. • How: • Perform intermittent uterine massage if the uterus feels soft or boggy (indicating uterine atony). • Why: A firm, contracted uterus prevents excessive bleeding. Prompt intervention (e.g., additional uterotonics or massage) can address uterine atony. 4. Definition of Delayed Cord Clamping: • The umbilical cord is clamped 1–3 minutes after birth (or when it stops pulsating), unless there are contraindications such as severe neonatal compromise requiring immediate resuscitation. 2. Benefits of Delayed Cord Clamping: • Newborn: • Increases neonatal blood volume (by up to 30%). • Improves iron stores and reduces the risk of anemia in the first year of life. • Mother: • Does not increase maternal bleeding or interfere with AMTSL. 3. Integration with AMTSL: • DCC can be practiced alongside AMTSL: • Administer uterotonics immediately after birth. • Wait for 1–3 minutes before performing controlled cord traction (CCT). • Ensure proper coordination between cord clamping and other steps of AMTSL. Additional Notes by WHO: • Routine uterine massage after delivery of the placenta is not recommended as a preventive measure unless uterine atony is suspected. • Ensure close monitoring of the mother for any signs of bleeding or hemodynamic instability during the immediate postpartum period.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hemorrhagic shock. Why Hemorrhagic Shock is the Correct Answer: The most common cause of death in patients with uterine inversion is hemorrhagic shock due to massive postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Uterine inversion often leads to severe bleeding from the uterine vessels at the placental site because the uterus cannot contract effectively in its inverted state. If not managed promptly, this blood loss can result in hypovolemia, hemodynamic instability, and death. Incorrect: A) Neurogenic Shock • Incorrect because neurogenic shock is rare in uterine inversion. While the inversion may cause significant pain and vagal stimulation, leading to transient bradycardia or hypotension, it is not the primary cause of death. Uterine inversion is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency where the uterus turns inside out, typically following delivery. It requires immediate recognition and prompt management to prevent severe complications. Causes and Risk Factors • Excessive fundal pressure during the third stage of labor. • Excessive cord traction without placental separation. • Uterine atony. • Placenta accreta or adherent placenta. • Short umbilical cord. • Multiparity. • Prolonged or precipitous labor. Clinical Presentation • Sudden onset of: • Severe abdominal pain. • Shock: Disproportionate to blood loss (neurogenic and/or hemorrhagic shock). • Vaginal bleeding (postpartum hemorrhage). • A mass protruding from the vagina (in complete or prolapsed inversion). • Uterine fundus absent on abdominal palpation. Diagnosis • Clinical examination: • Abdominal exam: Absent uterine fundus. • Vaginal exam: Mass protruding through the cervix or vagina. • Ultrasound: May help confirm the diagnosis if clinical findings are unclear. Complications • Hemorrhagic shock: Most common cause of maternal death. • Neurogenic shock: Due to vagal stimulation from traction on the uterus. • Infection: If the condition is not promptly managed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Insert IV cannula and start fluid. The first step in the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is to stabilize the patient by ensuring adequate IV access and initiating fluid resuscitation. PPH can lead to hypovolemia and shock, and addressing the patient’s circulatory status is critical before proceeding with definitive interventions. IV fluids help maintain intravascular volume while further diagnostic and therapeutic measures are initiated. Clinical Approach to PPH Management: 1. Stabilize the Patient: • Insert two large-bore IV cannulas. • Start fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (e.g., Ringer’s lactate or normal saline) and, if needed, blood products. 2. Assess the Uterus: • Palpate the uterus to check if it is firm or boggy. • A boggy uterus suggests uterine atony and uterine massage should begin while a firm uterus with bleeding suggests trauma or retained tissue. 3. Treat the Cause: • Uterine atony: Administer uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin, misoprostol). • Retained products: Perform uterine evacuation. • Trauma: Repair tears or lacerations. • Coagulopathy: Manage underlying clotting disorders. 4. Continuous Monitoring: • Monitor vital signs, blood loss, and urine output.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Half-life: 3–5 minutes. • Rapid onset with IV administration; effects diminish quickly after discontinuation. • Metabolized in the liver and kidneys. Mechanism of Action • Oxytocin receptors on uterine smooth muscle are stimulated, causing rhythmic uterine contractions. • Enhances intracellular calcium release in myocytes, facilitating contraction. • In postpartum care, it compresses uterine blood vessels, reducing hemorrhage. Indications 1. Labor Induction: • Used to initiate labor when medically indicated (e.g., prolonged pregnancy, preeclampsia, fetal compromise). 2. Labor Augmentation: • Enhances contractions if labor is progressing too slowly due to inadequate uterine activity. 3. Prevention and Treatment of Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH): • Administered immediately after delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent uterine atony. 4. Incomplete or Missed Abortion: • Helps expel retained products of conception. Adverse Effects • Maternal: • Hyperstimulation of the uterus leading to uterine rupture or fetal distress. • Hypotension (especially with rapid IV administration). • Water intoxication and hyponatremia (due to its antidiuretic effect at high doses). • Fetal: • Bradycardia or hypoxia due to uteroplacental insufficiency caused by excessive uterine contractions (tachysystole). Contraindications • Absolute: • significant Cephalopelvic disproportion. • Malpresentation (e.g., transverse lie, breech unless vaginal delivery is planned). • Placenta previa. • Uterine rupture or history of classical cesarean section. • Relative: • Overdistended uterus (e.g., polyhydramnios, multiple pregnancy).",

Ergometrine (Methylergometrine) • Mechanism: Acts on alpha-adrenergic and serotonin receptors to promote uterine contraction. • Dosage: • 0.2 mg IM or slow IV (can be repeated after 15 minutes if needed). • Contraindications: • Hypertension, preeclampsia, and heart disease (due to vasoconstrictive effects). • Adverse Effects: • Hypertension, nausea, vomiting. 4. Carboprost (15-Methyl Prostaglandin F2?) • Mechanism: A prostaglandin analog that promotes uterine contraction. • Dosage: • 250 µg IM, repeated every 15–90 minutes as needed (maximum 2 mg). • Adverse Effects: • Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bronchospasm, hypertension. • Contraindications: • Asthma, active cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. Second-Line Drugs (When Uterotonics Fail) 1. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) • Mechanism: An antifibrinolytic that stabilizes clots by inhibiting plasminogen activation. • Dosage: • 1 g IV over 10 minutes, repeated in 30 minutes if bleeding continues. • WHO Recommendation: • Should be administered within 3 hours of delivery. • Adverse Effects: • Rare: Nausea, diarrhea, thromboembolism. 2. Recombinant Factor VIIa • Mechanism: Promotes coagulation cascade to control bleeding. • Indications: • For severe PPH unresponsive to standard treatments. • Adverse Effects: • Risk of thromboembolic events. Combination Therapy In severe cases, combinations of uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin + misoprostol) may be used to achieve better results.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) B-Lynch Sutures for Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) The B-Lynch suture is a surgical technique used to control severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) caused by uterine atony, when medical management (e.g., uterotonics) and less invasive methods fail. It is a uterine compression suture designed to mechanically compress the uterus, promoting hemostasis while preserving fertility. Indications • Severe postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. • Failed medical management, including uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin, misoprostol). Contraindications • Non-functional uterus (e.g., ruptured uterus, extensive trauma). • Coagulopathy or other bleeding disorders requiring more aggressive surgical interventions. B-Lynch Suture: • Most commonly used compression suture. • Requires exteriorization of the uterus and is easier to apply after a cesarean delivery. • Best for generalized uterine atony. 2. Hayman Suture: • Does not require uterine exteriorization or incision, making it ideal for situations where these steps are not feasible. • Simpler to apply but may be less effective for severe bleeding. 3. Cho Square Sutures: • Targets specific bleeding areas, making it ideal for placenta previa or lower uterine segment bleeding. • More complex to apply, requiring surgical expertise and precision. Fertility Preservation: • All compression sutures aim to avoid hysterectomy and preserve fertility, but long-term complications like synechiae or adhesions may still occur.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Shock Index (SI) The Shock Index (SI) is a simple clinical tool used to assess the severity of shock and hemodynamic stability in patients. It is calculated as the ratio of heart rate (HR) to systolic blood pressure (SBP) Normal Values • A normal shock index is 0.5–0.7. • Values greater than 0.9 are concerning and suggest significant hemodynamic instability. Modified Shock Index (MSI) The Modified Shock Index (MSI) is a variation of the traditional Shock Index (SI) that incorporates diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or Mean arterial pressure instead of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to provide a more comprehensive assessment of hemodynamic status. ? Normal Values • The normal range for MSI is 0.5–1.0. • MSI > 1.3 is a marker of significant hemodynamic instability. Why Modified Shock Index is Useful 1. Accounts for Diastolic Blood Pressure: • Incorporating DBP or MAP reflects changes in peripheral vascular resistance and provides a better picture of tissue perfusion. 2. More Sensitive in Detecting Shock: • MSI has been found to be more predictive of outcomes in certain conditions compared to the traditional Shock Index, particularly in: • Sepsis. • Obstetric emergencies (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage). • Trauma. 3. Better Prognostic Value: • High MSI values correlate more strongly with poor outcomes, including mortality and the need for intensive care or massive transfusion protocols. Clinical Applications 1. Obstetrics • In conditions like postpartum hemorrhage and ectopic pregnancy, MSI can be an early warning tool for hypovolemia or shock before overt hypotension develops. 2. Trauma • MSI has been shown to predict the need for massive transfusion and surgical interventions in trauma patients more effectively than SI. 3. Critical Care • Useful in septic shock and other critical conditions to assess the severity of hemodynamic instability and guide resuscitation efforts. Interpretation of MSI MSI Value Clinical Interpretation 0.5–1.0 Normal 1.0–1.3 Early hypovolemia or compensatory shock >1.3 Severe hemodynamic instability and hypoperfusion Advantages • Improved Sensitivity: • Reflects both cardiac output and vascular resistance. • Early Warning: • Detects shock earlier than SI in certain conditions. • Ease of Use: • Uses readily available clinical parameters (HR and DBP/MAP). Limitations • Dependent on Accurate Blood Pressure Measurements: • Errors in measuring diastolic BP can affect MSI accuracy. • Not Widely Validated: • Though promising, MSI is not yet as universally adopted as the traditional SI.",

When non-surgical methods (e.g., manual repositioning and uterine relaxation techniques) fail to correct the inversion, surgical intervention is necessary. Surgical Procedures for Uterine Inversion 1. Huntington Procedure • Indication: Failure of manual repositioning and in cases of acute uterine inversion. • Technique: 1. Laparotomy is performed to access the abdominal cavity. 2. The inverted uterus is identified as a cup-shaped structure at the level of the cervix. 3. Traction is applied using Allis clamps on the uterine fundus, gently pulling it upward. 4. The uterus is progressively pushed through the cervical ring until it is restored to its normal position. • Outcome: High success rate with minimal trauma. 2. Haultain Procedure • Indication: Chronic uterine inversion or failure of the Huntington procedure due to a constricted cervical ring. • Technique: 1. Laparotomy is performed to access the inverted uterus. 2. The posterior cervical ring is incised longitudinally to release the constriction. 3. The uterus is manually or surgically repositioned back to its normal position. 4. The cervical incision is repaired after repositioning. • Advantages: Effective in severe or chronic cases. • Disadvantages: Requires precision to avoid damage to surrounding structures and proper repair of the cervix. 3. O’Sullivan Hydrostatic Technique • Though primarily non-surgical, this method may require surgical assistance in certain cases. • Uses warm saline or sterile fluid introduced into the vagina to generate hydrostatic pressure to reposition the uterus. • If unsuccessful, laparotomy and one of the above techniques are performed. 4. Modified Spinelli or Kustner Technique • Indication: Chronic uterine inversion that is unresponsive to other surgical interventions. • Technique: • Spinelli: Anterior cervical incision is made to release the constricted cervix. • Kustner: Posterior cervical incision is made. • The uterus is then repositioned and the cervical incision is repaired.",

Key Points 1. Fundal Placental Implantation: • The placenta is attached to the fundus of the uterus, which is the uppermost part of the uterine cavity. • Excessive traction on the umbilical cord during delivery of the placenta, combined with poor uterine tone (uterine atony), can lead to the fundus inverting into the uterine cavity. 2. Other Contributing Placental Factors: • Adherent Placenta: • Conditions like placenta accreta, where the placenta abnormally adheres to the myometrium, increase the risk of uterine inversion if excessive force is applied during placental separation. • Mismanagement of the Third Stage of Labor: • Excessive cord traction without proper uterine support can cause inversion, especially with fundal or adherent placental attachment. 3. Role of Uterine Atony: • Uterine atony exacerbates the risk of inversion, as the uterine muscles fail to contract and maintain structural integrity.",

Management involves prompt identification, appropriate interventions, and prevention of complications. 1. Initial Assessment • Clinical Examination: • Confirm absence of placental delivery. • Assess for uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and signs of shock. • Types of Retained Placenta: 1. Trapped placenta: Detached but trapped behind a closed cervix. 2. Adherent placenta: Abnormally attached to the uterine wall. 3. Placenta accreta spectrum: Invades the myometrium (accreta, increta, or percreta). 2. Immediate Management A. Stabilize the Patient • Resuscitation: • Insert a large-bore IV cannula and begin fluid resuscitation. • Administer oxygen if needed. • Monitor: • Vital signs, blood loss, and signs of PPH or shock. When patient is not actively bleeding begin with these B. Non-Surgical Interventions 1. Controlled Cord Traction (CCT): • Attempt gentle traction on the umbilical cord while supporting the uterus with the other hand. • Only if the placenta is detached. 2. Uterine Massage: • Massage the fundus to encourage uterine contractions. C. Surgical Interventions If the placenta is not expelled despite non-surgical measures: 1. Manual Removal of Placenta: • Indication: When the placenta is adherent or trapped. • Performed under adequate anesthesia (regional or general). • Procedure: • Insert a gloved hand into the uterine cavity. • Separate the placenta manually from the uterine wall using a sweeping motion. • Ensure complete removal to prevent retained products. 2. Management of Placenta Accreta Spectrum: • Placenta accreta/increta/percreta requires specialist management: • In severe cases, hysterectomy may be needed to control bleeding. 3. Post-Procedure Management • Inspect the Uterus: • Ensure no retained fragments are present. • Check uterine tone and administer additional uterotonics if necessary. • Prophylactic Antibiotics: • Administer antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) to prevent postpartum infection. • Monitor for Complications: • Hemorrhage, uterine rupture, or infection (endometritis). 4. Prevention • Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL): • Use uterotonics after delivery. • Perform controlled cord traction. • Regularly assess uterine tone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Placenta Accreta: Key Points 1. Definition: • A condition where the placenta abnormally attaches to the myometrium due to defective decidua basalis. 2. Types: • Placenta Accreta: Chorionic villi attach to the myometrium without invasion. • Placenta Increta: Chorionic villi invade the myometrium. • Placenta Percreta: Chorionic villi penetrate through the myometrium and may invade surrounding structures (e.g., bladder). 3. Risk Factors: • Previous cesarean delivery (major risk factor). • Placenta previa. • Uterine surgeries (e.g., myomectomy). • Advanced maternal age. • Multiparity. 4. Clinical Features: • Antenatal diagnosis: • Abnormal placental attachment seen on ultrasound (color Doppler). • Peripartum presentation: • Difficulty in placental delivery. • Severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). 5. Complications: • Massive hemorrhage. • Uterine rupture. • Need for hysterectomy. • Maternal morbidity and mortality. 6. Management: • Planned delivery at 34–36 weeks in high-risk cases. • Multidisciplinary approach with obstetrician, anesthesiologist, and blood bank support. • Hysterectomy is often required for placenta increta or percreta. • Conservative management may include leaving the placenta in situ with close monitoring. 7. Prognosis: • Depends on early diagnosis and management. • High risk of maternal morbidity and mortality if undiagnosed or mismanaged.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Succenturiate placenta. A succenturiate placenta is a variant where one or more accessory lobes of placental tissue are connected to the main placental mass by blood vessels. If these accessory lobes are not completely delivered after childbirth, they can lead to retained placental tissue, which is a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. The patient’s boggy uterus and sonographic findings of retained placental tissue support this diagnosis. Incomplete removal of placental tissue leads to continued uterine bleeding due to the retained trophoblastic tissue, which prevents uterine contraction and hemostasis. A. Fenestrated placenta is a rare anomaly in which the placenta has an area of tissue missing, usually near the central region. This would not typically result in retained placental tissue, and is not a cause of postpartum hemorrhage in the same manner as a succenturiate placenta. The patient’s bleeding and retained tissue seen on sonogram make this diagnosis unlikely. C. Vasa previa occurs when fetal blood vessels run across or near the internal cervical os, and this condition is typically diagnosed prenatally via ultrasound. It can cause bleeding during labor or delivery, but not in the immediate postpartum period as described here. The patient's situation does not suggest fetal vessel rupture or bleeding associated with vasa previa. D. Placenta previa involves the abnormal positioning of the placenta over or near the cervix, often resulting in antepartum or intrapartum bleeding. However, placenta previa is not typically associated with retained placental tissue after delivery, nor would it explain the sonographic findings of placental tissue after the placenta has been delivered. Additionally, placenta previa would usually have been diagnosed earlier in the pregnancy, leading to specific management plans during delivery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Manual exploration followed by curettage of the uterine cavity. In this case, the patient has persistent vaginal bleeding despite uterine massage and administration of Prostaglandin F2 (which is used to stimulate uterine contraction to control bleeding), and the uterine fundus is firm, ruling out uterine atony as the cause of bleeding. Given the history of rapid delivery and manual extraction of the placenta, the most likely cause of continued bleeding is retained products of conception (RPOC), such as placental tissue or fragments, in the uterine cavity. The best next step is to perform manual exploration of the uterine cavity, followed by curettage to remove any remaining placental tissue. This procedure can prevent further bleeding by ensuring that all tissue is evacuated and the uterus is cleared. Incorrect Responses: A. Methylergonovine 0.2 mg intramuscularly Methylergonovine is an effective agent used to treat uterine atony by promoting uterine contraction. However, this patient's bleeding is not due to uterine atony since her uterine fundus is firm after massage and Prostaglandin administration. Methylergonovine is contraindicated in this scenario as it may increase the risk of uterine spasm or even cause harm if there is a retained placenta, and it does not address the potential underlying cause of the bleeding. B. Hypogastric artery ligation Hypogastric artery ligation is a surgical procedure used in cases of severe, unmanageable pelvic hemorrhage (such as from uterine rupture or severe trauma). This patient does not have any signs of catastrophic bleeding or hemodynamic instability that would necessitate this intervention. The bleeding seems to be from retained placental tissue, which can typically be managed with less invasive procedures like manual exploration and curettage. D. Embolization Embolization is a procedure used to control life-threatening bleeding by blocking the blood vessels supplying the uterus, often used in cases of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony or trauma. However, this patient’s bleeding appears to be from retained products of conception, which is typically managed by manual exploration and curettage, not embolization. Embolization is a more invasive procedure and would not be the first-line treatment in this scenario.",

Obstetric Interventions • Induction or augmentation of labor (e.g., oxytocin use). • Instrumental delivery (e.g., vacuum or forceps). • Cesarean delivery. 3. Placental Abnormalities • Placenta previa. • Placenta accreta/increta/percreta. • Abruptio placentae. 4. Coagulation Disorders • Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). • Thrombocytopenia. • Pre-existing coagulopathies (e.g., von Willebrand disease). 5. Other Risk Factors • Maternal Factors: • Obesity. • Anemia. • Hypertensive disorders (e.g., preeclampsia). • Medications: • Use of magnesium sulfate (reduces uterine contractility).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The described mass is a vaginal hematoma. Aer delivery, the symptoms of severe pain and urinary retention should lead to a vaginal examination and the discovery of ?uctuant tumor. Small vulvar hematomas discovered after leaving the delivery room may be treated expectantly. If severe pain occurs or if the hematoma continues to expand, the best treatment is incision and evacuation of the blood clots with ligation of the bleeding vessels if they can be identified. Often no sites of active bleeding are found, in this case the defect is closed and the vagina packed for 12 to 24 hours. Laparotomy may be indicated if the hematoma extends into the broad ligament. Embolization of the vaginal branch of the internal pudendal artery, uterine artery, and internal pudendal artery can be performed if bleeding is intractable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Management of Uterine Inversion Uterine inversion is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency that requires immediate intervention. 1. Initial Management • Resuscitation: • Insert large-bore IV cannulas, start fluid resuscitation, and administer oxygen. • Monitor vital signs to address hypovolemic shock. • Stop Uterotonics: • Discontinue oxytocin or other uterotonics as they may exacerbate inversion. 2. Repositioning of the Uterus Non-Surgical Methods: 1. Johnson Maneuver (Manual Repositioning): • Apply steady upward pressure with a closed fist on the inverted uterine fundus through the vagina. • Simultaneously push the cervix upward with the other hand. 2. O’Sullivan Technique (Hydrostatic Repositioning): • Infuse warm saline or Ringer’s lactate into the vagina to create hydrostatic pressure that pushes the uterus back into place. Surgical Methods (if non-surgical methods fail): 1. Huntington Procedure: • Abdominal surgery where traction is applied to the inverted uterus using clamps to reposition it. 2. Haultain Procedure: • Laparotomy with incision of the constricted cervical ring to allow the uterus to be repositioned. 3. Post-Repositioning Care • Uterotonics: • Administer oxytocin or other uterotonics to contract the uterus and prevent re-inversion. • Antibiotics: • To reduce the risk of infection. • Monitor for Complications: • Hemorrhage, uterine rupture, or recurrence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sheehan Syndrome: Key Points 1. Definition: • A rare condition caused by postpartum pituitary necrosis due to severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and subsequent hypovolemic shock. 2. Pathophysiology: • Reduced blood flow to the pituitary during PPH leads to ischemia and necrosis, impairing hormone production. 3. Clinical Features: • Early symptoms: • Failure to lactate (low prolactin levels). • Persistent fatigue. • Late symptoms: • Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (low gonadotropins). • Hypothyroidism (low TSH). • Adrenal insufficiency (low ACTH causing hypotension, fatigue, and weight loss). 4. Diagnosis: • Hormonal tests: Low levels of pituitary hormones (prolactin, FSH, LH, TSH, ACTH). • MRI: Shows pituitary gland atrophy. 5. Management: • Hormone replacement therapy: • Glucocorticoids (for adrenal insufficiency). • Thyroid hormones (levothyroxine). • Estrogen/progesterone (for gonadal function). • Lifelong treatment is typically required. 6. Prognosis: • Good with proper hormone replacement therapy but requires long-term follow-up.",
