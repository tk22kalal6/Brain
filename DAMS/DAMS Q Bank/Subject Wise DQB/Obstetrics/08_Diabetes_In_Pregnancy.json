      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Macrosomia Late hyperglycemia in pregnancy is commonly associated with macrosomia, which refers to a fetus that is significantly larger than average for gestational age. When hyperglycemia occurs late in pregnancy, typically due to gestational diabetes that is poorly controlled, the excess glucose in the maternal blood crosses the placenta and stimulates excessive fetal insulin production. Insulin acts as a growth factor, leading to increased fetal fat deposition and growth, resulting in macrosomia. This condition can increase the risk of delivery complications, such as shoulder dystocia, and may require interventions like cesarean delivery. Incorrect Responses: B. IUGR (Intrauterine Growth Restriction): IUGR refers to a condition in which the fetus is smaller than expected for gestational age. It is typically caused by placental insufficiency or maternal factors such as hypertension, poor nutrition, or vascular diseases. Late hyperglycemia in pregnancy, especially when related to gestational diabetes, is more likely to cause macrosomia, not IUGR, because the excess maternal glucose promotes excessive fetal growth. IUGR is more commonly seen in conditions like chronic hypertension or preeclampsia, where placental blood flow is restricted. C. Post maturity: Post maturity refers to a pregnancy that extends beyond 42 weeks, and is typically associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, meconium aspiration, and fetal distress. While hyperglycemia can impact the pregnancy and the fetus, post maturity is not directly linked to late hyperglycemia or gestational diabetes. Instead, post maturity is more often related to prolonged gestation, where the placenta's ability to support the fetus diminishes, leading to a risk of macrosomia or IUGR depending on placental function. D. Congenital malformation: Congenital malformations can be caused by various factors, including maternal diabetes, but typically early-onset hyperglycemia (especially in the first trimester) is more strongly associated with an increased risk of birth defects, such as heart defects or neural tube defects. Late hyperglycemia (which occurs later in pregnancy) is less commonly associated with congenital anomalies. By the time hyperglycemia develops late in pregnancy, the major fetal organs have already formed, making the risk of congenital malformations less prominent compared to earlier stages.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Malformations Gestational diabetes is a condition that occurs during pregnancy when the body is unable to produce enough insulin to regulate blood glucose levels effectively. This condition is commonly associated with several risks and complications, but malformations are not typically one of them. In contrast to pre-existing diabetes (type 1 or type 2), where high blood glucose levels can lead to birth defects, gestational diabetes usually develops later in pregnancy, after the major fetal organs have already formed. The primary concern with gestational diabetes is not birth defects but rather macrosomia (large birth weight), preterm birth, hypoglycemia after birth, and other complications related to fetal overgrowth. Incorrect Responses: A. Previous macrosomic baby: A history of delivering a macrosomic baby (a baby with an excessive birth weight, usually over 4000 grams) is a well-established risk factor for developing gestational diabetes in future pregnancies. The excess maternal glucose in gestational diabetes causes fetal hyperinsulinism, leading to macrosomia. If a woman has had a macrosomic baby previously, she is at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes in subsequent pregnancies. B. Obesity: Obesity is one of the strongest risk factors for developing gestational diabetes. Women who are obese before pregnancy or gain excessive weight during pregnancy are more likely to experience insulin resistance, which can lead to gestational diabetes. The body's inability to use insulin effectively increases blood sugar levels, resulting in gestational diabetes. Therefore, obesity is directly associated with this condition. D. Polyhydramnios: Polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) is a common finding in gestational diabetes. The increased fetal urination, which results from fetal hyperglycemia and increased urine production, contributes to polyhydramnios. The fetus in gestational diabetes is more likely to have elevated blood sugar levels, which leads to increased amniotic fluid volume. Thus, polyhydramnios is an associated condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Neural tube defect The most common congenital malformation in the infant of a diabetic mother is a neural tube defect (NTD), specifically spina bifida. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes in the mother, particularly pre-existing diabetes (type 1 and type 2), significantly increases the risk of birth defects, especially those affecting the nervous system. High maternal blood glucose levels can interfere with the normal development of the fetal neural tube during the early stages of pregnancy, leading to spina bifida or anencephaly (a severe form of NTD). Since spina bifida is one of the most common NTDs, it is considered the most frequent malformation in infants born to diabetic mothers. Incorrect Responses: B. Hydrocephalus: Hydrocephalus, the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, is not as common as neural tube defects in infants of diabetic mothers. While hydrocephalus can be associated with some conditions like infections or chromosomal abnormalities, it is not the primary congenital malformation caused by maternal diabetes. Neural tube defects (like spina bifida) are much more commonly seen in these infants. C. Anencephaly: Anencephaly is another severe neural tube defect, but it is less common than spina bifida. It occurs when the upper part of the neural tube fails to close, leading to the absence of major portions of the brain and skull. While anencephaly can occur in infants of diabetic mothers, it is relatively rare compared to spina bifida, which is why spina bifida is considered the most common neural tube defect in these cases. D. Sacral agenesis: Sacral agenesis (or caudal regression syndrome) is a rare congenital abnormality where the lower spine and sacrum fail to develop properly. It has been linked to maternal diabetes, but it is less common than neural tube defects like spina bifida. Though it is a significant malformation in infants of diabetic mothers, it is not the most frequent one. Therefore, it is not the correct answer when compared to neural tube defects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Transposition of great arteries Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a cardiac anomaly that is commonly associated with infants of diabetic mothers. This congenital condition occurs when the positions of the pulmonary artery and aorta are reversed, leading to improper circulation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart. Maternal diabetes significantly increases the risk of various congenital heart defects, with TGA being one of the most notable. High maternal blood sugar levels in early pregnancy can interfere with the normal development of the heart, contributing to this life-threatening condition in the infant. Incorrect Responses: A. Coarctation of aorta: Coarctation of the aorta, the narrowing of a section of the aorta, is a congenital heart defect that can occur in infants of diabetic mothers. However, it is not as strongly associated with maternal diabetes as transposition of the great arteries. Coarctation is seen more frequently in infants of mothers with conditions like Turner syndrome rather than in the general population of infants born to diabetic mothers. Although the defect can occur in diabetic pregnancies, TGA is more commonly seen. B. Fallot’s tetralogy: Fallot's tetralogy, a condition involving four heart defects (ventricular septal defect, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary stenosis, and overriding aorta), is a congenital heart anomaly that is more commonly linked to genetic conditions or syndromes (such as DiGeorge syndrome). While maternal diabetes can increase the risk of certain congenital heart defects, it is not as strongly associated with Fallot’s tetralogy as it is with transposition of the great arteries. C. Ebstein’s anomaly: Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital heart defect affecting the tricuspid valve. It can lead to regurgitation and enlargement of the right atrium. While Ebstein's anomaly has been reported in infants of diabetic mothers, it is less common than other congenital heart defects like transposition of the great arteries. The link between maternal diabetes and Ebstein’s anomaly is not as well-established compared to TGA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hyperglycemia in newborn Hyperglycemia in newborn is not typically a direct complication of diabetes in pregnancy. While infants of diabetic mothers may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) shortly after birth due to the excess insulin production in response to maternal hyperglycemia, newborn hyperglycemia is less common. Hyperglycemia in the newborn would generally suggest another underlying condition like neonatal diabetes or an infection, not a primary consequence of maternal diabetes during pregnancy. Incorrect Responses: A. Macrosomia: Macrosomia (large birth weight) is a well-known complication of diabetes in pregnancy. The elevated maternal blood glucose levels lead to increased fetal insulin production, which in turn stimulates fetal growth. This results in larger-than-normal babies, often weighing more than 4 kg (8 pounds 13 ounces), a condition commonly referred to as macrosomia. This is a direct effect of poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy. B. Shoulder dystocia: Shoulder dystocia is a common complication of macrosomia, and it occurs when the baby’s shoulders become impacted during delivery, preventing the baby from being born smoothly. Diabetes in pregnancy is a significant risk factor for macrosomia, which in turn increases the likelihood of shoulder dystocia during labor and delivery. Thus, shoulder dystocia is a known complication of diabetes in pregnancy. D. Caudal regression: Caudal regression syndrome is a rare birth defect associated with maternal diabetes, especially poorly controlled maternal diabetes during pregnancy. It involves abnormal development of the lower spine, leading to conditions like sacral agenesis (absence of parts of the lower spine). While it is a rare condition, it is still a known complication of diabetes in pregnancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ketotic hypoglycemia Ketotic hypoglycemia is not typically a feature of infants born to diabetic mothers. Infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) are more likely to experience hypoglycemia shortly after birth, due to elevated maternal blood glucose levels causing increased fetal insulin production. However, this is usually non-ketotic hypoglycemia, as the infant's insulin levels drop rapidly after birth and they are not yet utilizing fat stores significantly for energy. Ketotic hypoglycemia, which is a condition where there is excessive ketone production due to low glucose levels, is more common in infants who experience starvation or metabolic disorders, not typically in IDMs. Incorrect Responses: A. Obesity: Obesity can be a long-term outcome in infants born to diabetic mothers, especially if the mother had poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy. These infants often experience macrosomia (larger birth weight), which can contribute to a greater risk of obesity later in life. The increased insulin levels in utero may affect the fetus's metabolism and increase the likelihood of overweight or obesity in childhood and adolescence. B. Learning disability: Learning disabilities are a known risk for children born to mothers with poorly controlled diabetes. The elevated glucose levels and resultant hyperinsulinemia during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development, leading to potential neurodevelopmental disorders, including learning disabilities. This is particularly common in children of mothers with poorly controlled gestational diabetes or preexisting diabetes. D. Future diabetes mellitus: Future diabetes mellitus is a well-known risk for infants of diabetic mothers. Studies have shown that children born to diabetic mothers have a higher likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life, especially if they were born with macrosomia or had obesity in childhood. Increased insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in these children predispose them to future diabetes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Glucose tolerance test (GTT) The Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) is the diagnostic test of choice for gestational diabetes. It involves giving the pregnant woman a certain amount of glucose (usually 75g) and measuring her blood glucose levels at different intervals (fasting, 1 hour, and 2 hours after ingestion). If any of the blood glucose levels exceed certain threshold values, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is confirmed. The GTT is preferred because it effectively identifies women who have impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy, even if they show no symptoms. Incorrect Responses: B. Random blood sugar: Random blood sugar measurements are not used to diagnose gestational diabetes, as they do not accurately reflect the body's ability to process glucose in the context of pregnancy. A random blood sugar test can show elevated levels in some individuals but is not specific enough to distinguish between normal pregnancy-related glucose fluctuations and true gestational diabetes. The GTT is more reliable in this scenario. C. Fasting and postprandial blood sugar: While fasting and postprandial blood sugar measurements can provide insight into an individual’s general blood glucose control, they are not sufficient to diagnose gestational diabetes on their own. The GTT is a more comprehensive test because it evaluates the body’s ability to handle glucose after a set amount is consumed, reflecting insulin resistance or insufficiency specific to gestational diabetes. D. 24-hour blood glucose profile: A 24-hour blood glucose profile is not typically used to diagnose gestational diabetes. While tracking blood glucose over a day may be useful for managing diabetes, the GTT is the gold standard for diagnosing gestational diabetes. It is more controlled and standardized than a 24-hour glucose profile, which can be influenced by factors like meal timing, stress, and activity level.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Doppler flow study Doppler flow study is not routinely used for antenatal fetal monitoring in a diabetic pregnancy, although it can be useful in certain situations. This test primarily evaluates blood flow, particularly to the fetal umbilical artery or other fetal vessels, and is more often employed in high-risk pregnancies that involve fetal growth restriction (IUGR) or suspected placental insufficiency. However, in diabetic pregnancies, the focus is generally on ensuring fetal well-being and assessing parameters like fetal heart rate, fetal movement, and amniotic fluid volume. While Doppler studies can be beneficial in select cases, they are not universally recommended or required for routine fetal monitoring in gestational diabetes or preexisting diabetes. Incorrect Responses: A. Non-stress test: The Non-stress test (NST) is an essential tool for antenatal fetal monitoring in diabetic pregnancies. It measures fetal heart rate patterns in response to fetal movement. In diabetic pregnancies, NST helps assess the fetus's oxygenation and well-being, as diabetes increases the risk of fetal distress, macrosomia, and stillbirth. If the test shows a reactive pattern (normal), it indicates good fetal oxygenation. Non-reactive results can prompt further investigation. B. Biophysical profile: The biophysical profile (BPP) is a comprehensive antenatal assessment that evaluates fetal well-being through ultrasound. It assesses parameters like fetal heart rate (NST), fetal movements, fetal tone, breathing movements, and amniotic fluid volume. A BPP is especially valuable in diabetic pregnancies as it provides an overall picture of fetal health and can detect early signs of fetal hypoxia or other issues that may arise due to diabetes. It is often used when there are concerns about fetal growth or complications. D. Fetal kick count: Fetal kick count is a simple and effective method for antenatal fetal monitoring that involves the mother counting fetal movements daily. In diabetic pregnancies, maternal monitoring of fetal movements is recommended as it helps identify any sudden decrease in activity, which may indicate fetal distress. A reduction in fetal movements could indicate hypoxia or fetal compromise, prompting further investigations like NST or BPP.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Her baby having a cardiac defect Explanation: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases the risk of several complications during pregnancy, but cardiac defects in the baby are not specifically associated with GDM. The risk of cardiac defects in the fetus is generally more closely related to maternal pre-existing diabetes (type 1 or type 2 diabetes), where the risk is significantly higher due to factors such as hyperglycemia affecting fetal development in early pregnancy. However, gestational diabetes, which develops later in pregnancy, does not have the same significant teratogenic effects on fetal organ development, including the heart. Thus, a 28-year-old woman with GDM would not be at increased risk for cardiac defects in her baby, making this option the exception. Incorrect Responses: A. Preeclampsia: Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of developing preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organ systems, most commonly the kidneys and liver. This risk is elevated in women with GDM due to the shared underlying factors of insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction, which are also implicated in preeclampsia. As such, this is a known risk for women with GDM. B. Fetal macrosomia: Fetal macrosomia (excessive fetal growth) is one of the most common complications of gestational diabetes. High maternal blood glucose levels lead to an overproduction of insulin in the fetus, which acts as a growth factor and can result in macrosomia, increasing the likelihood of difficult deliveries, including shoulder dystocia. This is a well-documented risk in GDM pregnancies. C. Her baby having jaundice: Neonatal jaundice is another potential complication of gestational diabetes. Babies born to mothers with GDM are at higher risk for jaundice due to several factors, including macrosomia, prematurity, and the possibility of increased red blood cell turnover. Additionally, high insulin levels in the infant may contribute to a higher incidence of jaundice after birth. Therefore, this is another known complication in GDM pregnancies.",

Fractures of the clavicle and humerus usually heal rapidly and are clinically insigni?cant. Injury to the brachial plexus may be localized to the upper or lower roots. In Erb (or Erb-Duchenne) palsy, the upper roots of the brachial plexus are injured (C5-6), resulng in paralysis of the shoulder and arm muscles; the arm hangs limply to the side and is extended and internally rotated. In the case of Klumpke paralysis, the lower nerves of the brachial plexus are affected (C7-T1) and the hand is paralyzed",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above Maternal diabetes in pregnancy can lead to several complications, including preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, and an increased risk of cesarean section. These complications arise due to the effects of hyperglycemia on maternal physiology and fetal development. 1. Preeclampsia – Women with diabetes in pregnancy have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia, a condition characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The underlying mechanisms likely include endothelial dysfunction caused by poor glycemic control, which affects blood vessel health and increases the risk of preeclampsia. 2. Polyhydramnios – Polyhydramnios, or excess amniotic fluid, is more common in pregnancies complicated by diabetes. This occurs because the fetus produces more urine due to hyperglycemia (leading to polyuria) or an increase in fetal urination from elevated glucose levels. 3. Increased risk of cesarean section – Macrosomia (excessive fetal growth), which is common in pregnancies with diabetes, increases the risk of a cesarean section due to fetal shoulder dystocia, a condition where the baby’s shoulders become stuck during delivery.",

In gestational diabetes or pre-existing diabetes, the fetus is exposed to high maternal blood glucose levels. In response, the fetus produces more insulin to regulate its glucose metabolism. Insulin acts as a growth factor, promoting increased fat and muscle deposition in the fetus, leading to macrosomia.

Delivering at 39 weeks balances the benefits of allowing the fetus to mature with the need to prevent potential complications associated with GDM. Clinical guidelines, including those from ACOG and WHO, support planned delivery at 39 weeks in such patients to reduce perinatal morbidity without increasing neonatal complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Transposition of great vessels Transposition of the great vessels (TGV) is a cardiac anomaly that is specifically associated with maternal overt diabetes. It occurs when the pulmonary artery and aorta are switched, leading to cyanosis in the newborn. This congenital heart defect is one of the most severe and is more commonly seen in infants born to mothers with poorly controlled type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The risk of TGV is particularly elevated in the first trimester of pregnancy when the cardiac development is taking place. This anomaly is considered specific for diabetic pregnancies, as the excess maternal glucose levels are thought to disrupt fetal heart development",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Macrosomia Macrosomia is the most likely issue that might arise in this case. A woman with abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results during pregnancy, despite having no previous or family history of diabetes, is likely to have gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Gestational diabetes can lead to elevated blood glucose levels that cross the placenta and stimulate the fetal pancreas to produce more insulin. This excess insulin acts as a growth factor, leading to fetal overgrowth, also known as macrosomia. Macrosomia is a common complication of GDM and is associated with increased birth weight (greater than 4,000 grams). The fact that this woman has no prior or family history of diabetes does not rule out gestational diabetes, as it can occur in women without these risk factors, especially if there is abnormal glucose tolerance later in pregnancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) After 37 weeks but not later than 39 weeks The optimal time for delivery in a woman with overt diabetes (long-standing type 1 or type 2 diabetes) is generally after 37 weeks but not later than 39 weeks. This is because gestational age after 37 weeks provides sufficient fetal maturity, reducing the risks associated with preterm birth while avoiding the potential complications of postterm delivery. Studies show that after 37 weeks, the risk of stillbirth and other complications like macrosomia, fetal distress, and shoulder dystocia can increase in diabetic pregnancies. However, extending the pregnancy beyond 39 weeks is not recommended as it can increase the risks of these complications. Tight glucose control helps reduce the risk of fetal macrosomia, but monitoring the pregnancy carefully and inducing labor between 37 and 39 weeks is generally considered the best practice for optimal outcomes for both mother and baby.",
