      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Heart disease Induction of labor is generally not recommended in cases of severe heart disease because of the increased risk of maternal and fetal complications. The stress of labor, including uterine contractions and increased cardiac output, can exacerbate the maternal cardiovascular condition, potentially leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, or poor maternal oxygenation. For women with heart disease, the risks of induction may outweigh the benefits, particularly in cases of severe or decompensated heart disease. In such cases, close monitoring is necessary, and labor management may involve caesarean section or other measures to reduce strain on the heart. Option A: Hypertension – Incorrect Induction of labor in the presence of hypertension (especially gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia) may actually be recommended to prevent further complications such as eclampsia, stroke, or organ damage. If a woman with hypertension reaches term or has severe pre-eclampsia, induction can be considered to avoid further maternal morbidity and fetal compromise. The decision to induce would depend on the severity of the hypertension and the overall clinical picture. Option B: DM (Diabetes Mellitus) – Incorrect Induction of labor in diabetic patients can be done, particularly if there are concerns about macrosomia (large fetal size) or poor glycemic control during pregnancy. Induction may be performed to prevent complications like shoulder dystocia, fetal distress, or stillbirth associated with poorly controlled diabetes. Women with well-controlled diabetes may also proceed with a vaginal birth, but induction could be considered if there are complications, or the pregnancy has exceeded the due date. Option D: Renal disease – Incorrect In cases of renal disease, particularly if it is well-controlled and not leading to significant maternal complications, induction of labor at term may be considered to prevent further damage to the kidneys and improve maternal health. Women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or renal impairment may require induction if there are concerns about worsening renal function, uncontrolled blood pressure, or other pregnancy complications. The decision to induce will depend on the severity of the renal condition and other clinical factors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Because of the longer duration of intrauterine growth, postterm fetuses tend to be larger than term fetuses and have a higher incidence of macrosomia. Macrosomia increases the risks for several adverse sequelae, including abnormal labor progression, cesarean delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, shoulder dystocia, maternal/fetal/newborn birth injury, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal metabolic problems. These fetuses are at increased risk of umbilical cord compression due to oligohydramnios and abnormal antepartum or intrapartum fetal heart rate patterns due to uteroplacental insufficiency or cord compression. Meconium passage is common and may be related to physiologic maturation of the gut, fetal hypoxia, or both",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (A) PG F2α tablet PG F2α (Prostaglandin F2 alpha) is not commonly used for the induction of labor, especially in tablet form. Prostaglandin F2α is typically used for other obstetric indications, such as controlling postpartum hemorrhage or as a second-line treatment in cases of uterine atony. However, it is not a preferred agent for inducing labor due to its strong vasoconstrictive properties, which can cause side effects like hypertension, and because it is less effective than other prostaglandins in ripening the cervix or stimulating uterine contractions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) PG E1 tablet: Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), usually in the form of misoprostol, is commonly used for cervical ripening and labor induction. It can be administered in tablet form (oral or vaginal) and is effective in both early-term and post-term pregnancies. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin that helps to soften and dilate the cervix, making it easier for the uterus to contract and initiate labor. (C) PG E2 gel: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is frequently used for labor induction, especially when the cervix is not favorable (unripe). It is available in a gel or insert form (e.g., Cervidil), and is typically administered vaginally. PGE2 works by ripening the cervix and stimulating uterine contractions, making it a standard option for inducing labor in both term and post-term pregnancies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Progesterone Progesterone is not effective for the induction of labor because it plays a key role in maintaining pregnancy rather than initiating labor. Progesterone helps to keep the uterine muscles relaxed and inhibits contractions. As labor approaches, progesterone levels decrease, and uterine sensitivity to other agents like oxytocin and prostaglandins increases. Using progesterone for induction would counteract the natural processes required for labor initiation, making it ineffective for this purpose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid), sudden rupture of membranes — especially artificially — can cause rapid decompression of the uterus. This may lead to placental abruption, umbilical cord prolapse, or uterine atony. Therefore, the safest and most controlled way to induce labor in such cases is to gradually reduce the amniotic fluid volume via abdominal amniocentesis, followed by careful induction with oxytocin. This method: • Prevents sudden uterine decompression • Minimizes risks of placental separation and cord prolapse • Allows controlled initiation of labor after stabilization Incorrect Answers: A. High rupture of the membranes Incorrect – High rupture in polyhydramnios can lead to sudden gush of fluid, which increases the risk of cord prolapse and abruption. Not recommended. B. Low rupture of the membranes Incorrect – Same as above. Low rupture can still cause sudden fluid loss, risking complications. Controlled drainage is preferred. D. Prostaglandins Incorrect – While prostaglandins are commonly used for cervical ripening and induction, in polyhydramnios, their use without fluid reduction is risky due to potential for uterine overdistension complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prostaglandin tablet Prostaglandin tablets (specifically oral or vaginal prostaglandin) are contraindicated in patients with a previous lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) due to the risk of uterine rupture. The use of prostaglandins, particularly in the form of oral or vaginal tablets, can lead to excessive uterine contractions and increased pressure on the scar of the previous caesarean section, which can increase the risk of scar rupture. Uterine rupture in such patients can be life-threatening to both the mother and the fetus. Because of this significant risk, prostaglandin tablets are not recommended for labor induction in women with a history of caesarean section, particularly in the context of a low segment scar. Option A: Prostaglandin Gel – Incorrect Although prostaglandin gel (specifically Prostaglandin E2) is generally contraindicated in women with previous caesarean sections due to the risk of uterine rupture, there are certain controlled conditions and low-dose protocols where it may be used cautiously under strict monitoring. Prostaglandin gel is used for cervical ripening and inducing labor, but its use requires close supervision when the patient has had a prior caesarean due to concerns about uterine rupture. In certain cases, it may be used in the hospital setting, but typically only after careful evaluation of risks and with close fetal and maternal monitoring. Option C: Stripping of the Membrane – Incorrect Stripping of the membranes (also called \"membrane sweeping\") involves separating the membranes from the cervix, which may promote the release of prostaglandins and stimulate labor. This method is generally safe for women with a previous caesarean section because it does not involve the use of medications that could overstimulate the uterus. The procedure is non-pharmacological and carries a much lower risk compared to drug-induced labor methods like prostaglandins or oxytocin. It is usually performed around 40 weeks gestation, and its use is well tolerated in women with a previous caesarean. Option D: Oxytocin Drip – Incorrect Oxytocin drip is a commonly used method for labor induction and is not contraindicated for women with a previous caesarean section. Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions and can be used in controlled doses for labor induction. However, it should be used with caution and under close monitoring to avoid excessive uterine contractions, which could stress the scar of a previous caesarean section. When used carefully and with appropriate monitoring of the uterine activity, fetal heart rate, and maternal condition, oxytocin can be a safe option for induction even in women with a prior caesarean delivery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Type of pelvis The Bishop score is a scoring system used to assess the favorability of the cervix for induction of labor. It evaluates the cervix's readiness for labor based on five components: Cervical dilatation: Measures how open the cervix is in centimeters. Cervical effacement: Refers to the thinning or shortening of the cervix, typically measured as a percentage. Cervical consistency: Assesses the firmness of the cervix, which can be soft, medium, or firm. Cervical position: Evaluates the location of the cervix (posterior, mid, or anterior). Fetal station: Refers to the position of the fetal head in relation to the ischial spines of the pelvis (how far the baby’s head has descended into the pelvis). The type of pelvis (D) is not a component of the Bishop score. The type of pelvis (e.g., gynecoid, android, anthropoid) is important for labor and delivery but is not directly assessed in the Bishop score. The Bishop score focuses solely on cervical factors that influence the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. Option A: Cervical dilatation – Incorrect Cervical dilatation is one of the key components of the Bishop score. It measures how open the cervix is in preparation for labor. The more dilated the cervix, the more favorable the conditions are for labor. This is a direct indicator of how ready the cervix is for vaginal delivery. Option B: Cervical length – Incorrect While the Bishop score assesses the effacement (thinning) of the cervix, it does not directly measure cervical length. However, cervical length is another important factor for predicting the risk of preterm labor, and it can be assessed via ultrasound. For the Bishop score, cervical effacement is more important, while cervical length is an additional factor considered in some clinical settings. Option C: Position of cervix – Incorrect Position of the cervix is an essential part of the Bishop score. It describes the location of the cervix (whether it is posterior, mid, or anterior) and helps determine how favorable the cervix is for labor. A cervix that is more anterior and softened is more likely to allow for easier labor.",
