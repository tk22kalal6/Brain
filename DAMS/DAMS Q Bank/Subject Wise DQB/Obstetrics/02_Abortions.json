      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of first-trimester spontaneous abortions, accounting for approximately 50-70% of cases. These abnormalities include aneuploidy (such as trisomy or monosomy), polyploidy, and structural chromosomal rearrangements. Reasons why the other options are incorrect: B) Syphilis Although syphilis is an important cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including fetal demise and preterm birth, it is not a common cause of first-trimester abortion. Syphilis-related pregnancy loss typically occurs in later stages of pregnancy or after organogenesis is complete. Effective screening and treatment can largely prevent such outcomes, reducing its contribution to early pregnancy loss. C) Rh isoimmunization Rh isoimmunization is primarily associated with second and third-trimester complications, such as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). In rare cases, severe isoimmunization can lead to fetal demise, but it is not a significant cause of first-trimester miscarriage. Modern management with Rh immunoglobulin (e.g., Rho(D) immune globulin) has significantly reduced the occurrence of Rh-related pregnancy complications. D) Cervical incompetence Cervical incompetence is a condition that typically leads to pregnancy loss in the second trimester, not the first. It involves premature dilation of the cervix, often resulting in painless miscarriage or preterm labor. This condition is managed with cervical cerclage or other interventions, but it does not play a major role in first-trimester losses.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Embryo. The most common cause of first-trimester abortion is defects in the embryo, often due to chromosomal abnormalities. These abnormalities occur during fertilization or early cell division and result in an embryo that is unable to develop normally. Such defects include aneuploidies like trisomy, monosomy, or polyploidy, which account for nearly 50-70% of first-trimester miscarriages. Trisomy • Trisomy 16: The most common trisomy in miscarriages; it is incompatible with life and always leads to pregnancy loss. • Other Trisomies: Trisomies of chromosomes 13, 18, and 21 can also occur. While trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) can result in a live birth, it is associated with increased risk of miscarriage. • Monosomy X (Turner Syndrome) • This is the most common chromosomal abnormality in first-trimester miscarriages caused by the loss of one X chromosome in females (45,X). While some pregnancies with Turner syndrome can survive to term, most result in early pregnancy loss. • Triploidy (69 chromosomes) • Occurs due to fertilization by two sperm (dispermy) or retention of an extra haploid set of chromosomes from one parent. This leads to molar pregnancy or other severe complications, making it incompatible with life. Reasons why the other options are incorrect: A) Placenta Placental abnormalities can lead to pregnancy complications, but they are more commonly associated with second or third-trimester losses rather than first-trimester abortions. Placental issues, such as insufficiency or abnormal implantation, usually affect the growing fetus after the initial critical stages of embryogenesis have been completed. Thus, they are not the most common cause of early pregnancy loss. B) Uterus Defects in the uterus, such as uterine anomalies, fibroids, or adhesions, can lead to pregnancy loss but are not the most common cause of first-trimester abortions. Uterine factors typically account for recurrent pregnancy loss or later-term complications. While they may contribute in some cases, they are not as frequent or significant a factor as chromosomal defects in the embryo. D) Ovarian Ovarian factors, such as hormonal imbalances or ovulatory disorders, can interfere with conception or early pregnancy support but are not the leading cause of first-trimester abortions. For example, insufficient progesterone production can lead to early pregnancy loss, but these cases are far less common than embryonic defects caused by chromosomal abnormalities.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) TORCH. The TORCH group of infections (Toxoplasmosis, Other infections like syphilis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus) is not a common cause of recurrent abortions. While these infections can lead to pregnancy complications, such as congenital infections or single pregnancy losses, they rarely cause recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). TORCH infections usually result in miscarriage when they occur as a primary infection during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, but they are not a consistent cause of repeated pregnancy losses across multiple pregnancies. Reasons why the other options are incorrect: B) SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) SLE is a well-documented cause of recurrent abortions. It is an autoimmune disorder, and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs), such as lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies, is strongly associated with RPL. These antibodies increase the risk of thrombosis in the placental vessels, leading to pregnancy loss. Additionally, SLE-related inflammation and immune dysfunction can impair placental function, causing recurrent pregnancy loss. C) Rh Incompatibility Severe Rh incompatibility can result in recurrent pregnancy losses, particularly in cases where Rh sensitization has already occurred in previous pregnancies. When a Rh-negative mother carries a Rh-positive fetus, maternal antibodies can attack the fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolysis, anemia, and fetal demise. However, the use of Rh immunoglobulin prophylaxis has significantly reduced the frequency of Rh-related recurrent losses. D) Syphilis Untreated syphilis can cause recurrent abortions, especially in the second trimester and still birth. The infection can cross the placenta, leading to chronic inflammation, placental insufficiency, and fetal demise. Syphilis-related pregnancy loss is preventable with early diagnosis and treatment using antibiotics. Without treatment it can cause abortion and still birth",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lupus anticoagulant. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is an antiphospholipid antibody associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a condition that can cause recurrent pregnancy loss. LA leads to an isolated prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) due to its interference with phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests. Despite the name, lupus anticoagulant is a pro-thrombotic condition and increases the risk of clot formation in placental vessels, leading to recurrent pregnancy losses. It is one of the key diagnostic markers for APS, which is a major cause of recurrent abortions, particularly in the second trimester. Reasons why the other options are incorrect: B) Factor VII Factor VII deficiency affects the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and typically causes a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), not an isolated prolongation of APTT. While it is a bleeding disorder, it is not associated with recurrent pregnancy loss or thrombosis. Therefore, it is not the most likely cause in this scenario. C) von Willebrand Disease Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF). While it may cause a mild prolongation of APTT, it is primarily associated with mucocutaneous bleeding and does not cause recurrent pregnancy loss. VWD is not linked to thrombotic conditions that could lead to pregnancy complications, making it an unlikely cause in this case. D) Hemophilia A Hemophilia A is a deficiency of factor VIII, which results in a prolonged APTT. However, it is a bleeding disorder, not a pro-thrombotic condition, and it does not cause recurrent pregnancy loss. Hemophilia A is more commonly seen in males due to its X-linked inheritance pattern, and women are typically carriers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Atosiban. Atosiban is not used for medical abortion. It is an oxytocin receptor antagonist primarily used to prevent or delay preterm labor by inhibiting uterine contractions. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the effects of oxytocin on the uterus, making it effective in managing preterm labor but irrelevant for inducing medical abortion. Atosiban does not play a role in terminating pregnancy and is therefore not part of medical abortion protocols. Reasons why the other options are incorrect: A) Mifepristone Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid and a progesterone receptor antagonist. It is widely used for medical abortion as it blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy. By antagonizing progesterone, it causes the decidua to break down, leading to detachment of the pregnancy and sensitization of the uterus to prostaglandins, facilitating expulsion of the pregnancy. Mifepristone is a key component of medical abortion regimens. B) Misoprostol Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that causes uterine contractions and cervical softening, leading to the expulsion of pregnancy tissue. It is often used in combination with mifepristone or methotrexate for medical abortion, particularly in early pregnancy. Misoprostol is effective and widely used due to its accessibility and ease of administration (oral, vaginal, or sublingual routes). C) Methotrexate Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and folic acid antagonist that inhibits DNA synthesis, cell division, and trophoblastic proliferation. It is used for medical abortion, particularly in cases of ectopic pregnancy, as it targets rapidly dividing cells of the trophoblast. Methotrexate is less commonly used for intrauterine medical abortion compared to mifepristone and misoprostol, but it remains an option.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Avascular villi. A blighted ovum, also known as an anembryonic pregnancy, occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, but the embryo does not develop. It is characterized histologically by the presence of avascular villi, which lack blood vessels. These villi represent the failure of proper embryonic development and trophoblastic function, leading to insufficient vascularization of the placenta. Avascular villi indicate that embryonic development has failed before significant vascularization could occur, which is a hallmark of a blighted ovum. Intervillous hemorrhage Intervillous hemorrhage refers to bleeding within the intervillous spaces of the placenta, which is more commonly associated with placental abruption or other placental disorders. It is not a characteristic feature of a blighted ovum, which involves the failure of embryonic and trophoblastic development rather than hemorrhagic events. Ultrasound Criteria of anembryonic pregnancy 1. Absence of an Embryo: • A gestational sac is visible but contains no identifiable embryo or fetal pole. 2. Gestational Sac Size: • Mean Sac Diameter (MSD) ? 25 mm without a yolk sac or embryo confirms the diagnosis of an anembryonic pregnancy. • MSD between 16–24 mm without an embryo is suspicious, but follow-up is required to confirm. 3. Yolk Sac: • The absence of a yolk sac in a gestational sac that meets the criteria for a developed pregnancy further supports the diagnosis. 4. No Growth on Follow-Up Scans: • If repeat scans over 7-10 days show no growth of the gestational sac or development of an embryo, the pregnancy is considered non-viable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All the above. A pregnancy that continues following a threatened abortion is associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, fetal malformations, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Threatened abortion refers to vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of gestation without cervical dilation or expulsion of pregnancy tissue. While many pregnancies with threatened abortion progress to term, the underlying causes of the bleeding, such as placental abnormalities, subchorionic hematoma, or uteroplacental insufficiency, can contribute to these adverse outcomes. 1. Preterm Labor: The risk of preterm labor is higher in pregnancies with a history of threatened abortion due to inflammation, uteroplacental issues, or cervical insufficiency. 2. Fetal Malformation: While the risk of malformation is not exceedingly high, certain underlying factors, such as chromosomal abnormalities or teratogenic exposures, that caused the threatened abortion may contribute to fetal malformations. 3. IUGR: Poor placental function or vascular compromise, often associated with threatened abortion, can impair fetal growth, leading to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Reasons why the other options are incorrect individually: A) Preterm Labor This is correct, as pregnancies following threatened abortion are at increased risk for preterm labor. However, it is not the sole complication, as other adverse outcomes like fetal malformations and IUGR are also possible, making “all the above” the most comprehensive answer. B) Fetal Malformation While the risk of fetal malformation is increased, it is not as common as preterm labor or IUGR. Factors such as subclinical infections or genetic abnormalities associated with the threatened abortion may contribute, but this is only one of the potential complications, making “all the above” the more accurate choice. C) IUGR IUGR is a well-documented risk due to impaired placental function often linked to threatened abortion. However, this is not the only complication, as preterm labor and fetal malformations are also potential risks, supporting the selection of “all the above.”",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prostaglandin. Prostaglandins are the most effective and commonly used method for inducing abortion in the second trimester. They act by stimulating uterine contractions and cervical ripening, leading to the expulsion of pregnancy products. Prostaglandins such as misoprostol or dinoprostone are administered vaginally, orally, or intra-amniotically, and they have a high success rate with relatively fewer complications compared to other methods. They are preferred due to their ability to induce abortion in a controlled and predictable manner, with reduced risk of retained products of conception or uterine injury. Reasons why the other options are incorrect: A) Oxytocin Oxytocin is less effective in the second trimester because the uterus has fewer oxytocin receptors during this stage of pregnancy compared to later stages (such as term labor). While it can be used to enhance uterine contractions, it is not the primary choice for second-trimester abortion, as it may require higher doses, prolonged administration, and is associated with higher rates of incomplete abortion compared to prostaglandins. C) Ethacridine Ethacridine lactate (instilled extra-amniotically) was historically used for second-trimester abortions. However, it has largely been replaced by prostaglandins because it is less effective and takes longer (12-24 hours) to achieve abortion. It is also associated with discomfort during administration and potential complications such as infection or incomplete abortion. D) Hypertonic Saline Hypertonic saline is rarely used in modern practice due to its risks and availability of safer alternatives. While it induces uterine contractions when injected into the amniotic sac, it carries significant risks, such as infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and other systemic complications. Prostaglandins are preferred due to their safety profile and ease of administration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The answers are 113-e, 114-b, 115-d, 116-c, 117-a. Bleeding occurs in about 30% to 40% of human gestations before 20 weeks of pregnancy, with about half of these pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortion. A threatened abortion takes place when this uterine bleeding occurs without any cervical dilatation or e?acement. In a patient bleeding during the ?rst half of pregnancy, the diagnosis of inevitable abortion is strengthened if the bleeding is profuse and associated with uterine cramping pains. If cervical dilatation has occurred, with or without rupture of membranes, the abortion is inevitable. If only a portion of the products of conception has been expelled and the cervix remains dilated, a diagnosis of incomplete abortion is made. However, if all fetal and placental tissue has been expelled, the cervix is closed, bleeding from the canal is minimal or decreasing, and uterine cramps have ceased, a diagnosis of complete abortion can be made. The diagnosis of missed abortion is suspected when the uterus fails to continue to enlarge with or without uterine bleeding or spotting. A missed abortion is one in which fetal death occurs before 20 weeks gestation without expulsion of any fetal or maternal tissue for at least 8 weeks thereafter. When a fetus is retained in the uterus beyond 5 weeks after fetal death, consumptive coagulability with hypofibrogenemia may occur. This is uncommon, however, in gestations of less than 14 weeks in duration.",

Medical management is often preferred in hemodynamically stable patients who choose non-surgical intervention. The most effective regimen for medical management is a combination of Mifepristone followed by Misoprostol. Mifepristone is an antiprogestin that blocks the action of progesterone, leading to decidual necrosis and detachment of the gestational sac. This makes the uterus more responsive to prostaglandins. After administering mifepristone, Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, is given to induce uterine contractions and expel the pregnancy tissue. This combination has higher efficacy and fewer complications compared to misoprostol alone. It is widely endorsed by major guidelines, including those from ACOG and WHO, for managing missed abortions up to 13 weeks of gestation.",

These translocations do not usually affect the parent's health but can lead to unbalanced chromosomal content in the fetus, causing miscarriage. Therefore, karyotyping both parents is a key initial step in evaluating RPL to detect any structural chromosomal rearrangements that may be contributing to the losses.

In such cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without contractions, leading to second-trimester pregnancy loss or preterm birth. The most appropriate and potentially pregnancy-saving intervention is emergency (rescue) cerclage, which involves placement of a suture around the cervix to provide mechanical support and prevent further dilation. It is typically done between 16–24 weeks and is most successful when there are no signs of infection, uterine contractions, or ruptured membranes.

DES was a synthetic estrogen prescribed from the 1940s to the 1970s to prevent miscarriage and preterm labor, but it was later found to cause structural anomalies in the developing reproductive tract of female fetuses. The most well-known anomaly is the T-shaped uterine cavity, which results from hypoplasia of the endometrium and uterine walls. This abnormal shape is linked to recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses, infertility, and poor obstetric outcomes due to impaired implantation and reduced uterine distensibility. Although DES use has been discontinued, women exposed in utero may still present with this condition today.",

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which increase the risk of thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss, particularly in the first trimester. In pregnant women with APS, the most effective and evidence-based treatment to improve pregnancy outcomes is a combination of low-dose aspirin (LDA) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, while LMWH prevents thrombosis by inhibiting clotting factors. Together, they reduce the risk of placental thrombosis, improve placental function, and significantly increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.

During this period, the regimen is highly effective (success rates of ~95–98%) and safe for outpatient management. Mifepristone, an anti-progestin, blocks progesterone's action, leading to detachment of the gestational sac, and misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, induces uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. Beyond 9 weeks, the effectiveness decreases, and the risk of incomplete abortion increases, which is why surgical methods are generally preferred after this point, though medical abortion may still be used with caution under medical supervision up to 12 weeks in some protocols.",

The decision to terminate a pregnancy rests solely with the woman, regardless of her marital status. This reflects the recognition of the woman's autonomy and reproductive rights. The MTP Act ensures that a woman can make this decision without needing the approval of her husband or any other third party.",

While some studies have explored the relationship between reproductive history and various cancers, ovarian cancer is not considered a recognized risk associated with repeated abortions. The other risks listed are well-documented complications that can arise from multiple induced abortions, particularly those performed under unsanitary conditions or without proper medical supervision.",

The presence of vaginal bleeding and an open cervical os indicate that the pregnancy cannot be saved, and miscarriage is imminent.
