      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hydatidiform mole The snowstorm appearance on ultrasound is characteristic of a hydatidiform mole (a type of gestational trophoblastic disease). In a hydatidiform mole, the ultrasound reveals multiple cystic spaces within the uterus, giving the appearance of a snowstorm or cluster of grapes. This pattern is due to the abnormal growth of placental tissue, where the trophoblastic tissue forms fluid-filled spaces instead of a normal fetus. The snowstorm appearance is a hallmark sign that helps in diagnosing this condition, especially when there is elevated ?-hCG and no fetus present in the uterus. Incorrect Responses: B. Ectopic pregnancy: In an ectopic pregnancy, the embryo implants outside the uterus, commonly in the fallopian tube. While ultrasound is essential for diagnosing ectopic pregnancies, the typical findings include a gestational sac outside the uterus or free fluid in the abdomen (if rupture has occurred). Ectopic pregnancies do not exhibit the snowstorm appearance seen in hydatidiform mole. C. Anencephaly: Anencephaly is a neural tube defect in which the fetus is missing parts of the brain and skull. On ultrasound, anencephaly is usually diagnosed by the absence of a cranium and brain structures. The typical ultrasound findings do not resemble the snowstorm appearance, but rather show lack of the skull bones and brain development. The snowstorm appearance is not associated with anencephaly. D. None of the above: This option is incorrect because the snowstorm appearance is indeed seen in hydatidiform mole, as explained above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Suction evacuation In the case of hydatidiform mole, the primary treatment is suction evacuation of the molar tissue from the uterus. Hydatidiform mole is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease, where abnormal trophoblastic tissue grows in the uterus, often forming a mass of cysts. The lutein cysts that may form in the ovaries as a result of the increased human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels during this condition are typically functional cysts that regress after the molar pregnancy is evacuated. The management of hydatidiform mole involves evacuating the molar pregnancy through suction curettage to remove the abnormal tissue from the uterus and prevent complications such as infection or hemorrhage. Once the molar tissue is removed, the lutein cysts usually resolve spontaneously without the need for additional interventions. Incorrect Responses: A. Ovarian cystectomy: Ovarian cystectomy is the surgical removal of an ovarian cyst. While lutein cysts can form during a hydatidiform mole due to elevated hCG levels, they are usually functional cysts that do not require surgical removal unless they are symptomatic or cause complications. Ovarian cystectomy would be an unnecessary intervention in most cases of hydatidiform mole, as the cysts tend to resolve once the molar pregnancy is evacuated. B. Ovariectomy: Ovariectomy is the removal of the entire ovary. This procedure is much more invasive and is typically reserved for situations where there is a significant ovarian pathology such as ovarian cancer or a large, non-functional cyst. In the case of a lutein cyst in hydatidiform mole, ovariectomy would not be appropriate, as the cysts are usually transient and resolve after the evacuation of the molar pregnancy. The ovary is not typically removed unless there are severe complications, which are rare. D. Radio-Chemotherapy: Radio-chemotherapy is a treatment used for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which may develop if a molar pregnancy progresses to a malignant form, such as choriocarcinoma. However, this is not the standard treatment for a simple hydatidiform mole without signs of malignancy. For most hydatidiform moles, the treatment is primarily suction evacuation, and radio-chemotherapy is only indicated if there is persistent trophoblastic disease or if the mole transforms into a malignant form like choriocarcinoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stage-III Stage-III in Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) refers to the presence of metastasis in the lungs, which is a common site for GTN metastasis. The staging of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is based on the extent of the disease and the involvement of distant organs. According to the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) staging system for GTN, Stage-III involves metastasis to the lungs, with or without other sites of disease. This is an important stage in determining the appropriate treatment, such as chemotherapy. In this case, since the patient has been detected to have lung metastasis, the correct stage would be Stage-III, indicating a metastatic spread that involves the lungs. Incorrect Responses: A. Stage-I: Stage-I GTN refers to the disease confined to the uterus. This stage involves no distant metastasis. Since the patient has lung metastasis, she cannot be classified as Stage-I. This stage is only applicable when the disease is limited to the uterus without spreading to any distant organs. B. Stage-II: Stage-II in GTN involves metastasis to the pelvic region or upper vagina, but not to distant organs like the lungs. Since the patient has metastasis to the lungs, she cannot be classified as Stage-II, which is limited to pelvic and vaginal involvement. D. Stage-IV: Stage-IV is characterized by distant metastasis to organs other than the lungs, such as the liver, brain, or kidneys. While the presence of lung metastasis might seem to suggest a higher stage, Stage-IV is specifically used when the metastasis is to organs beyond the lungs. Therefore, Stage-IV would not be appropriate for this patient with lung-only metastasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chemotherapy The treatment of choice for choriocarcinoma, a type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), is chemotherapy. Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant form of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) that can occur following a molar pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, or normal pregnancy. Chemotherapy, specifically single-agent methotrexate or multi-agent chemotherapy, is highly effective for treating choriocarcinoma due to its chemosensitivity. The goal of chemotherapy is to eliminate the cancer cells and prevent further spread, particularly to distant sites such as the lungs, liver, and brain, which are common metastatic locations for choriocarcinoma. Treatment with chemotherapy leads to high cure rates even in cases with distant metastases. Incorrect Responses: A. Dilatation and evacuation: Dilatation and evacuation (D&E) is typically used in the management of molar pregnancy to remove abnormal placental tissue, but it is not the treatment for choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that has the potential to metastasize and requires systemic treatment, such as chemotherapy. D&E is not sufficient to manage choriocarcinoma and may not address the disease's metastatic potential. B. Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy is sometimes used in the treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia for isolated, resistant metastases, particularly when the disease has spread to brain or lung. However, chemotherapy is the primary treatment for choriocarcinoma. Radiotherapy is typically considered when the disease is refractory to chemotherapy or in cases where localized control of metastases is needed. It is not the first-line treatment for choriocarcinoma. C. Hysterectomy: Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is generally not the first-line treatment for choriocarcinoma. While it may be considered in cases of persistent disease limited to the uterus and when the patient no longer wishes to preserve fertility, it is not the treatment of choice for choriocarcinoma. Chemotherapy is the most effective option, as it can address both local and metastatic disease, and most women with choriocarcinoma can retain their uterus and fertility with appropriate treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chemotherapy The ideal treatment for metastatic choriocarcinoma in the lungs in a young woman is chemotherapy. Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), and it is known to be chemosensitive, meaning that it responds very well to chemotherapy. Even in the presence of lung metastasis, chemotherapy (typically with methotrexate or multidrug regimens) is the treatment of choice because it can effectively control both the primary tumor and any distant metastases, including those in the lungs. Chemotherapy allows for the preservation of fertility, which is crucial in young women who are of reproductive age. It also provides the highest chance of cure, with most women achieving remission even with metastatic disease. Incorrect Responses: B. Surgery with radiation: Surgery and radiation may be considered in some rare cases of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), particularly if the disease is resistant to chemotherapy or if it involves localized metastatic sites. However, for lung metastasis from choriocarcinoma, chemotherapy is far more effective and is the primary treatment. Radiation and surgery are not first-line options and are typically used for isolated metastases or when chemotherapy fails. C. Surgery: Surgical intervention is generally not indicated for metastatic choriocarcinoma unless the metastases are isolated and resectable. For lung metastasis, chemotherapy is preferred as it can treat both the primary tumor and metastatic disease without the need for invasive surgery. Surgery is not the ideal approach for multiple or widespread lung metastasis, which is common in metastatic choriocarcinoma. D. Wait and watch: A wait and watch approach is inappropriate for metastatic choriocarcinoma. This is a highly aggressive malignancy, and delaying treatment can allow the disease to progress rapidly. Metastatic choriocarcinoma requires urgent intervention to prevent further spread and improve survival rates. Chemotherapy is the established and effective treatment, and waiting without treatment could lead to serious complications and a poor prognosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) I trimester Molar pregnancy is typically diagnosed in the first trimester. It often presents with symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, elevated hCG levels, and uterine enlargement disproportionate to gestational age. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound, where the characteristic findings include a snowstorm appearance or cluster of grapes representing the abnormal trophoblastic tissue. Molar pregnancy, also known as gestational trophoblastic disease, can occur as a complete mole or a partial mole, but in both cases, it is usually identified early in the first trimester when the patient presents with symptoms or concerns about abnormal pregnancy progress. Early diagnosis is crucial because it allows for appropriate management and prevents complications like uterine rupture or the development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Incorrect Responses: B. II trimester: Molar pregnancy is not typically diagnosed in the second trimester. By this stage, the symptoms that might indicate a molar pregnancy, such as excessive bleeding, elevated hCG levels, and abnormal growth of the uterus, would have usually manifested earlier. If diagnosed in the second trimester, it suggests that the disease may have been missed or misdiagnosed in the first trimester. Ultrasound findings, like the snowstorm appearance, would be evident earlier and would not typically be observed for the first time in the second trimester. C. III trimester: A diagnosis of molar pregnancy in the third trimester is very uncommon. If diagnosed at this stage, it would be unusual and indicate delayed recognition. At this point, the patient would have likely experienced significant complications, such as severe bleeding or symptoms indicating a malignant transformation. The third trimester is generally when molar pregnancies have progressed significantly, and if not treated, could lead to trophoblastic malignancy, which would complicate both diagnosis and management. Molar pregnancies are not typically diagnosed this late. D. All of the above: This option is incorrect because molar pregnancies are almost always diagnosed in the first trimester, as they present early with signs like excessive bleeding and elevated hCG levels. While complications may arise later, such as trophoblastic disease in the second or third trimester, the initial diagnosis typically happens in the first trimester.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hydropic degeneration of the villous stroma Hydatidiform mole is characterized histologically by hydropic degeneration of the villous stroma. This is a hallmark feature of the condition, where the chorionic villi become swollen, edematous, and appear as fluid-filled sacs resembling clusters of grapes. The hydropic degeneration occurs due to abnormal trophoblastic proliferation, where the trophoblasts (cells that form the placenta) fail to differentiate properly, leading to the formation of these enlarged, cystic villi. This abnormal growth is one of the key histological features that differentiate a molar pregnancy from a normal pregnancy. The villous stroma in a hydatidiform mole is largely replaced by fluid, causing the characteristic appearance seen on ultrasound as well as in histological examination. Incorrect Responses: A. Hyaline membrane degeneration: Hyaline membrane degeneration is not a characteristic feature of hydatidiform mole. This term typically refers to the deposition of hyaline (a glassy, eosinophilic material) in tissues, often seen in conditions such as diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs or glomerulonephritis in the kidneys. It does not describe the abnormal growth of chorionic villi seen in molar pregnancies. This histological feature is not associated with molar pregnancy and therefore is incorrect. C. Non-proliferation of cytotrophoblast: In hydatidiform mole, there is actually proliferation of both the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. The cytotrophoblast cells, in particular, undergo abnormal growth and contribute to the formation of the swollen, cystic villi. The syncytiotrophoblast, which normally lines the villi and is responsible for hCG production, can also proliferate in an abnormal fashion, but this does not imply that the cytotrophoblast does not proliferate. Therefore, the statement about the non-proliferation of the cytotrophoblast is incorrect. D. Non-proliferation of syncytiotrophoblast: This is also incorrect. In fact, there is proliferation of syncytiotrophoblast in hydatidiform mole. This proliferation can contribute to abnormal tissue development and excessive secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is a common feature of molar pregnancy. Syncytiotrophoblasts normally play a role in nutrient exchange and hormone production, but in molar pregnancies, their uncontrolled proliferation leads to abnormal placental tissue growth.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chorion Hydatidiform mole is principally a disease of the chorion, which is the outermost membrane surrounding the developing embryo. The chorion is responsible for forming the placenta, and in hydatidiform mole, there is abnormal trophoblastic proliferation of the chorionic villi. This proliferation leads to the formation of cystic, fluid-filled spaces that give the characteristic \"grape-like\" appearance of the molar tissue. The disease results from abnormal fertilization, where either the egg is fertilized by an empty sperm (complete mole) or there is disordered fertilization involving two sperm and one egg (partial mole). The abnormal growth primarily affects the chorion, leading to the development of abnormal placental tissue. The trophoblastic tissue from the chorion produces high levels of hCG, which is often used as a diagnostic marker for molar pregnancy. Incorrect Responses: A. Amnion: The amnion is the inner membrane that surrounds the embryo and is filled with amniotic fluid. Hydatidiform mole primarily affects the chorion, not the amnion. In molar pregnancies, the amniotic sac may not develop normally, and in complete moles, there is often no fetus or embryonic development. The amnion does not play a significant role in the pathology of hydatidiform mole, making this option incorrect. C. Uterus: While the uterus is where the molar pregnancy occurs, hydatidiform mole is a disease of the placenta and chorion, not the uterus itself. The uterus may become enlarged due to the abnormal growth of trophoblastic tissue, but it is the chorionic tissue that undergoes the pathologic changes in a molar pregnancy. The uterus is the site of implantation, but the disease process is localized to the placenta, particularly the chorion. D. Decidua: The decidua is the endometrial lining of the uterus during pregnancy, which responds to the implantation of the embryo and forms a part of the placenta. While the decidua is involved in the early stages of pregnancy, hydatidiform mole is a disease that primarily affects the chorionic villi (part of the placenta). The decidua may undergo some changes, but it is not the principal site of pathology in molar pregnancies. The abnormal trophoblastic tissue originates from the chorion, not the decidua, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Absence of villi structure on histological examination of the lesion Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant form of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) that arises from abnormal trophoblastic tissue following a molar pregnancy, miscarriage, or normal pregnancy. The key histological feature that differentiates choriocarcinoma from invasive mole (also known as chorio-adenoma destruens) is the absence of villi in choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma is composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without the characteristic villous structures seen in hydatidiform moles. In contrast, invasive moles contain villous tissue that invades the uterine wall, but choriocarcinoma consists solely of trophoblastic cells that invade blood vessels and tissues without the formation of villi. This histological distinction is crucial in differentiating these two conditions. Incorrect Responses: A. Presence of high titre of urinary chorionic gonadotrophin: Both choriocarcinoma and invasive mole can present with high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), as both conditions involve abnormal trophoblastic proliferation. Choriocarcinoma often results in markedly elevated hCG levels, but invasive mole also can lead to increased hCG levels due to the trophoblastic activity. Therefore, while high hCG titres can be seen in both conditions, it is not the distinguishing feature between them. This makes hCG levels not a reliable differentiating factor. B. Presence of cannonball shadow in the lungs: Cannonball lesions in the lungs are commonly seen in metastatic choriocarcinoma, particularly when the tumor has spread to distant organs like the lungs. However, the presence of cannonball lesions is not a definitive diagnostic feature and does not differentiate choriocarcinoma from invasive mole at the time of initial diagnosis. While choriocarcinoma may metastasize to the lungs and present with these findings, invasive mole typically does not spread to distant organs in the same way. This imaging finding is not specific enough to be used as a diagnostic criterion between the two conditions. D. All of the above: As previously discussed, both high hCG levels and cannonball lesions in the lungs are not exclusive to choriocarcinoma and are not used to differentiate it from invasive mole. The key distinguishing feature is the absence of villous structures on histological examination, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Selected cases following evacuation Prophylactic chemotherapy in cases of hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is not given routinely, but is reserved for selected cases following the evacuation of the mole. Chemotherapy is indicated if there are signs of persistent trophoblastic disease or invasive mole, such as continued elevation of hCG levels after evacuation, or if there is a risk of progression to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which includes choriocarcinoma. Most cases of hydatidiform mole do not require chemotherapy, as they are self-limited and the hCG levels typically normalize after evacuation. However, prophylactic chemotherapy may be considered if there are high-risk features, such as large mole, advanced maternal age, or if the patient has a history of persistent hCG levels post-evacuation. Therefore, chemotherapy is given based on individual risk factors rather than as a routine procedure. Incorrect Responses: A. Prior to evacuation as a routine: Chemotherapy is not given prior to evacuation as a routine in hydatidiform mole. The standard treatment for a molar pregnancy is suction evacuation of the molar tissue to remove the abnormal placental tissue. Chemotherapy is not indicated before evacuation unless there is evidence of persistent trophoblastic disease or a malignant transformation that has already occurred, which is not the usual scenario for a typical molar pregnancy. Giving chemotherapy before evacuation could unnecessarily expose the patient to potential side effects without clinical benefit. B. Following evacuation as a routine: Routine administration of chemotherapy following the evacuation of hydatidiform mole is not necessary for most patients. As mentioned earlier, prophylactic chemotherapy is reserved for selected cases where there are signs of persistent trophoblastic disease, such as continued elevated hCG levels or abnormal uterine bleeding. Routine chemotherapy in all cases of molar pregnancy would be excessive and could lead to unnecessary side effects. Most cases resolve with evacuation alone, and hCG levels normalize without the need for chemotherapy. D. As a routine 6 weeks post evacuation: Chemotherapy is not routinely administered 6 weeks post-evacuation in hydatidiform mole. After molar evacuation, hCG levels are monitored to ensure they return to normal. If there is persistent elevation of hCG, which suggests gestational trophoblastic disease, chemotherapy may be initiated. However, routine chemotherapy for all patients at 6 weeks post-evacuation is unnecessary and not supported by clinical guidelines. The decision to start chemotherapy is based on the monitoring of hCG levels and clinical signs of ongoing disease, not on a fixed timeline post-evacuation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chance of pulmonary embolization is minimal Hysterectomy in the management of molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole) is generally reserved for cases where the mole is persistent, recurrent, or complicated by other issues like massive hemorrhage. The key advantage of hysterectomy in this context is that it eliminates the risk of trophoblastic disease and reduces the chance of pulmonary embolization from a large molar pregnancy. Pulmonary embolism in molar pregnancies may be due to invasive trophoblastic tissue or thromboembolism associated with the abnormal blood flow and clot formation. By performing a hysterectomy, the uterus—where most of the pathological trophoblastic tissue is located—is removed, minimizing the potential for any further complications like pulmonary embolism or metastasis. The uterus is also removed before any further complications, such as choriocarcinoma, can develop and spread. Incorrect Responses: A. Chance of choriocarcinoma becomes nil: A hysterectomy does not completely eliminate the risk of choriocarcinoma, which is a potential malignant transformation of trophoblastic tissue. Although hysterectomy removes the primary site of trophoblastic tissue, choriocarcinoma can still develop even after the uterus is removed, as it may arise from residual trophoblastic tissue that has spread outside of the uterus, such as to the lungs or other organs. Therefore, the risk of choriocarcinoma is not fully eliminated by a hysterectomy, and follow-up monitoring for elevated hCG levels is still required. B. Follow up is not required: Follow-up is still required after a hysterectomy for molar pregnancy because there remains a risk of persistent trophoblastic disease or choriocarcinoma, even after the uterus has been removed. hCG levels are monitored post-operatively to ensure that they return to normal. If hCG levels remain elevated, it indicates that there is still trophoblastic activity somewhere in the body, and chemotherapy may be necessary. Therefore, follow-up is crucial to detect any recurrence or metastasis. C. Enlarged ovaries can be removed during operation: While ovarian cysts may sometimes be present in cases of molar pregnancy (due to theca lutein cysts), the primary purpose of a hysterectomy is to remove the uterus and manage the molar tissue, not to address ovarian issues. Theca lutein cysts are often bilateral and may resolve after the molar pregnancy is treated and hCG levels normalize. Removing the ovaries during the hysterectomy is generally not indicated unless there are other underlying ovarian problems such as torsion or tumors. The primary focus of a hysterectomy in this scenario is the removal of abnormal trophoblastic tissue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Theca lutein cyst > 6 cm Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a group of diseases that includes choriocarcinoma, invasive mole, and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). It is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings. One of the key criteria for diagnosing GTN is persistently elevated or increasing β-hCG levels. A theca lutein cyst greater than 6 cm is not a diagnostic criterion for GTN, though it can be associated with molar pregnancies. The presence of a theca lutein cyst indicates ovarian hyperstimulation due to elevated hCG levels but does not directly confirm GTN. The theca lutein cysts may resolve once the ?-hCG levels normalize following the treatment of a molar pregnancy or other trophoblastic conditions. Therefore, theca lutein cyst size is not used as a diagnostic criterion for GTN. Incorrect Responses: A. Persistently increasing β-hCG for 3 values: Persistently increasing β-hCG levels is a crucial criterion for diagnosing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). After a molar pregnancy or normal pregnancy, βhCG levels should fall to undetectable levels over time. If β-hCG remains elevated or increases over three consecutive values, it suggests the presence of persistent trophoblastic tissue or neoplasia, and further investigation or treatment (such as chemotherapy) is required. This pattern of increasing ?-hCG is a significant diagnostic feature for GTN. B. Plateau levels of β-hCG for 4 values: Plateauing β-hCG levels (i.e., levels that remain unchanged over four consecutive measurements) is also indicative of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). After a molar pregnancy or any gestational event, β-hCG levels should decline over time. If the levels plateau, it suggests the presence of persistent trophoblastic disease, which can progress to choriocarcinoma or invasive mole. This is one of the criteria used to diagnose GTN, necessitating further management such as chemotherapy. D. Histological criteria for choriocarcinoma: The histological diagnosis of choriocarcinoma is a key component in diagnosing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), specifically when the disease manifests as choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma is diagnosed by identifying the characteristic features of abnormal trophoblastic cells (cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts) on histopathological examination. This histological diagnosis is essential for confirming GTN and determining the appropriate treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) hCG levels The most important prognostic marker for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is the serum ?-hCG level. hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is the biomarker used to assess the extent and activity of trophoblastic disease. Elevated or persistently rising levels of ?-hCG suggest the presence of ongoing trophoblastic activity and can indicate that the disease is persistent or metastatic. High ?-hCG levels are also associated with a more aggressive disease course. After treatment (like chemotherapy), a decline in ?-hCG levels is expected, and this is used to monitor the response to treatment. If ?-hCG levels do not fall or plateau, it suggests that the disease is resistant or that there may be metastatic spread, thus hCG levels are the most reliable marker for both diagnosis and prognosis in GTN. Incorrect Responses: A. Number of metastasis: The number of metastases does play a role in determining the severity of GTN, but it is not the most important prognostic factor. Metastasis is typically assessed in staging (such as the FIGO staging system for GTN), but hCG levels have a stronger correlation with the disease’s progression and response to treatment. hCG is often used as a marker for disease activity, including metastatic spread, and number of metastases alone does not provide as direct or consistent a measure of prognosis as hCG levels do. B. Site of metastasis: While the site of metastasis is important for staging and treatment planning, it is not as important as hCG levels in determining prognosis. Metastatic GTN can affect various organs, including the lungs, liver, and brain, but hCG levels are a more specific and reliable predictor of disease behavior and response to chemotherapy. In other words, while the site of metastasis provides crucial information for treatment, hCG levels correlate more strongly with overall prognosis and therapeutic response. D. Stage of tumor: The stage of the tumor (based on the FIGO staging system) is important in evaluating the extent of disease and determining the treatment approach. However, the stage is a broader categorization and is not as precise a marker for prognosis as hCG levels. For example, a high-stage tumor with low ?-hCG levels may still have a better prognosis than a low-stage tumor with very high ?-hCG levels. hCG levels give a more dynamic and specific indication of how the disease is behaving, particularly in response to treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) At 11 weeks of gestation, the uterus is still within the pelvis and should not be palpable above the symphysis pubis. A uterus that is palpable midway between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus is 14 to 16 weeks in size. The fetal heart tones are audible in most patients at 10 weeks. If no fetal heart tones are audible by Doppler auscultation and the patient is 10 weeks or more, an ultrasound of the pregnancy should be ordered. Molar pregnancy, twin gestation, incorrect dates, and uterine fibroids are all possible diagnoses when the uterus is large for dates; therefore, ultrasonography is the first step in the evaluation of size/date discrepancy. Although molar pregnancy is an indication for dilatation and curettage, the procedure is not indicated before evaluation of the patient with ultrasonography. This patient is of advanced maternal age (>35 years of age at the ?me of delivery), however, genetic amniocentesis should not be performed without first knowing the gestational age and viability of the pregnancy",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Plateau HCG A plateau in hCG levels after suction evacuation for a molar pregnancy is not a typical finding. Normally, after a complete hydatidiform mole is evacuated, the serum ?-hCG levels should start to decline. A plateau or persistent elevated hCG levels may suggest that there is residual trophoblastic tissue, or the development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), such as invasive mole or choriocarcinoma. Therefore, a plateau in hCG levels would be a cause for concern and would require further investigation or treatment, such as chemotherapy. It is not a finding that would be routinely expected during post-evacuation follow-up unless there is a complication. Incorrect Responses: B. Uterine subinvolution: Uterine subinvolution refers to the condition where the uterus fails to return to its normal pre-pregnancy size after an evacuation. This can be a common finding after a molar pregnancy and suction evacuation. After the evacuation, the uterus may take some time to shrink back to its normal size, and during this period, the woman may experience abnormal bleeding or persistent uterine enlargement. It is important to monitor the patient for signs of subinvolution because it could also be a sign of remaining trophoblastic tissue or the development of complications like gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). C. Theca lutein cyst: Theca lutein cysts are a known complication of hydatidiform mole. They occur due to the excessive production of hCG that stimulates the ovaries. The presence of theca lutein cysts is common in women who have had a molar pregnancy, and they may persist even after evacuation of the mole. These cysts are generally benign and may resolve on their own over time once the hCG levels decrease. However, they should be monitored, as they can cause ovarian enlargement and associated symptoms like abdominal pain or bloating. D. Bleeding after suction evacuation: Bleeding after suction evacuation of a molar pregnancy can occur and is not uncommon. It can be a normal part of the post-procedural process as the uterine lining sheds. However, excessive or prolonged bleeding could indicate the presence of retained trophoblastic tissue, a complication such as invasive mole, or infection. In some cases, bleeding might also occur if there was incomplete evacuation or if theca lutein cysts lead to ovarian torsion. Close monitoring and follow-up are important to rule out any complications.",

As a result, only paternal chromosomes are present, and this leads to abnormal growth of the placenta, forming a mass of fluid-filled cysts (hydatidiform changes).

The presence of distant metastases, especially to vital organs such as the brain or liver, indicates advanced disease and significantly worsens the prognosis. These metastases are often associated with higher mortality rates and require more aggressive treatment, such as chemotherapy, to manage the disease. The more widespread the disease, the more difficult it becomes to treat effectively, leading to a worse outcome.",

This includes cases where the patient has a persistently elevated ?-hCG level but less than 40,000 IU/L, no evidence of metastasis, and a localized uterine mass (as in this case, a 5 cm uterine mass).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Multi-agent chemotherapy EMACO This patient has gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) with high-risk features as per the WHO prognostic scoring system, indicated by the following factors: 1. High ?-hCG level: A ?-hCG level of 250,000 IU/L is well above the threshold for high-risk disease. 2. Lung metastases: The presence of lung metastases significantly increases the risk score. 3. Recent pregnancy history: A term delivery 8 months ago places this patient in a higher risk category due to the likelihood of persistent trophoblastic disease following a recent pregnancy. In high-risk cases like this, the recommended treatment is multi-agent chemotherapy. The EMACO regimen (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine) is commonly used for high-risk GTN with distant metastases (in this case, lung metastases). This regimen is highly effective for controlling high-risk GTN and reducing the risk of further complications, including the progression to choriocarcinoma",

The most specific immunohistochemical markers for diagnosing choriocarcinoma include ?-hCG and Ki-67. • ?-hCG: Human chorionic gonadotropin (?-hCG) is produced by trophoblastic tissue, and its elevated levels are characteristic of choriocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, positive staining for ?-hCG confirms the diagnosis of trophoblastic disease, particularly choriocarcinoma. • Ki-67: Ki-67 is a marker of cell proliferation. Choriocarcinoma has a high rate of cellular turnover and proliferation, making Ki-67 an important marker in differentiating it from other conditions. A high Ki-67 index is often observed in choriocarcinoma due to the rapid growth and invasive nature of the tumor.",

If there is a lack of p57KIP2 expression, it suggests that the tissue is more likely to progress to choriocarcinoma or other forms of GTN. p57KIP2 negativity is a key genetic marker that helps to predict the likelihood of a molar pregnancy progressing to a more aggressive form of gestational trophoblastic disease.",
