Biologicals such as anti-TNF-alpha agents are indicated when the disease is not responding to two or more DMARDs. But, before starting anti-TNF alpha agents, latent tuberculosis must be ruled out with an IGRA test or PPD. Additionally, viral hepatitis B and C, complete blood counts, and liver function tests should be done before initiating anti-TNF agents.",
