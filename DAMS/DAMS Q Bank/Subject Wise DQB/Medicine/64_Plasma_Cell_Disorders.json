      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bone pain The most common symptom in multiple myeloma is bone pain, which occurs in approximately 70-80% of patients. Multiple myeloma is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to bone destruction, fractures, and the formation of osteolytic lesions. This bone damage causes significant pain, particularly in the back, ribs, and long bones, which is often the presenting symptom in patients with multiple myeloma. Incorrect Responses: B. Headache: While headache can occur in multiple myeloma, it is not the most common symptom. Headaches may be related to other complications such as hypercalcemia or central nervous system involvement, but they are less frequent compared to bone pain in the presentation of the disease. C. Bleeding: Bleeding is not a primary symptom of multiple myeloma. Although patients may experience bleeding due to low platelet counts or other complications (e.g., acquired coagulopathy), this is much less common than bone pain. D. Oliguria: Oliguria (reduced urine output) can occur in multiple myeloma, especially due to kidney damage from light chain deposition (myeloma kidney), but it is not as common as bone pain. Renal involvement is a significant complication but does not typically present as the initial or most frequent symptom.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Kidneys are not involved In multiple myeloma, kidneys are often involved due to the deposition of monoclonal light chains (known as Bence-Jones proteins) in the renal tubules, leading to kidney damage, a condition referred to as myeloma kidney. This can result in renal insufficiency or even acute renal failure in severe cases. Therefore, the statement \"Kidneys are not involved\" is false, as kidney involvement is a common complication in multiple myeloma. Incorrect Responses: A. Normocytic normochromic anemia is common: This is a true statement. Anemia is a common finding in multiple myeloma, typically normocytic and normochromic. It occurs due to the suppression of normal bone marrow function by the malignant plasma cells, leading to reduced red blood cell production. B. Increased predisposition to infections: This is also a true statement. Multiple myeloma results in immunosuppression, both due to the disease itself and the treatments (such as chemotherapy) used to manage it. As a result, patients with multiple myeloma are at increased risk for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. C. Hyperviscosity can cause visual symptoms: This is another true statement. Hyperviscosity syndrome can occur in multiple myeloma, particularly in those with high levels of monoclonal proteins (such as IgA or IgG). This increased viscosity can impair blood flow, particularly in small vessels, and lead to symptoms such as visual disturbances, headaches, and bleeding.",

Myeloma cells typically produce an abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein), and in the majority of cases, this M-protein is of the IgG type. The elevated levels of IgG can be detected through serum protein electrophoresis, which is a key diagnostic tool in identifying multiple myeloma. Incorrect Responses: B. IgA: IgA is the second most common type of monoclonal immunoglobulin produced in multiple myeloma, but it occurs in a smaller percentage of patients (about 15-20%). Therefore, while IgA is involved in some cases, it is not as common as IgG. C. IgD: IgD is a very rare type of M-protein in multiple myeloma, occurring in less than 1% of cases. While it is possible to detect IgD in myeloma patients, it is extremely uncommon compared to IgG or IgA. D. None: Since IgG is the most common type of serum M-component, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) In multiple myeloma, serum β2-microglobulin is a critical biomarker and one of the most powerful predictors of survival. It reflects the tumor burden and is used in the staging of multiple myeloma. Elevated levels of β2-microglobulin correlate with poor prognosis, and it is often considered a key substitute for other staging methods, like the Durie-Salmon or International Staging System (ISS), particularly when determining the severity of the disease and predicting patient outcomes. Incorrect Responses: A. Hodgkin’s lymphoma: While β2-microglobulin levels can be elevated in Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is not the single most powerful predictor of survival or a substitute for staging. Hodgkin's lymphoma is typically staged using the Ann Arbor staging system, which relies on clinical findings such as the presence of lymph node involvement and other disease features. B. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: Similar to Hodgkin's lymphoma, β2-microglobulin can be elevated in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and is sometimes used as an adjunct to assess disease burden, but it is not considered the most powerful predictor of survival or a substitute for staging. NHL is typically staged using the Lugano classification or the Ann Arbor system, depending on the subtype. C. Hairy cell leukemia: β2-microglobulin can also be elevated in hairy cell leukemia, but it is not used as a primary prognostic factor or substitute for staging in this disease. Hairy cell leukemia is usually staged based on bone marrow involvement and peripheral blood findings, rather than relying on ?2-microglobulin levels.",

MGUS is characterized by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein (in this case, a non-IgM type) at levels less than 30 g/L, clonal bone marrow plasma cells of less than 10%, and the absence of myeloma-defining events (such as organ damage due to myeloma) or amyloidosis. MGUS is a benign condition but can occasionally progress to multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders over time. Since the patient does not meet the criteria for multiple myeloma or other more serious conditions, MGUS is the correct diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: B. Smoldering myeloma: Smoldering myeloma is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein greater than 30 g/L or clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow greater than 10%, or both. Since the patient's monoclonal protein is less than 30 g/L and the bone marrow plasma cells are less than 10%, this does not meet the criteria for smoldering myeloma. C. Symptomatic multiple myeloma: Symptomatic multiple myeloma is diagnosed when there is the presence of myeloma-defining events such as organ damage (renal failure, hypercalcemia, anemia, or bone lesions), along with a higher burden of disease. The patient described does not have myeloma-defining events, so this diagnosis is not appropriate. D. None: Since MGUS fits the description provided",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Oesophageal dysmotility POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder that involves Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and Skin changes. The characteristic features include polyneuropathy (often the most prominent symptom), various endocrine dysfunctions, skin changes such as hyperpigmentation, and organ involvement (e.g., hepatomegaly, splenomegaly). While esophageal dysmotility can occur in other conditions, it is not a hallmark feature of POEMS syndrome. Therefore, oesophageal dysmotility is not a typical characteristic of POEMS syndrome, making option B the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A. Polyneuropathy: Polyneuropathy is a central and defining feature of POEMS syndrome. It typically presents as a mixed sensory and motor neuropathy, often starting in the lower extremities. It is one of the first symptoms to appear and is critical for diagnosing POEMS syndrome. C. Endocrinopathy: Endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, or diabetes, are common in POEMS syndrome. These abnormalities occur due to the involvement of various endocrine glands and are part of the diagnostic criteria for the syndrome. D. Skin changes: Skin changes, including hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis (excess hair growth), and clubbing of fingers, are common in POEMS syndrome.

Incorrect Responses: B. Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that is often used in combination with other drugs (such as bortezomib and dexamethasone) in the treatment of multiple myeloma, especially in cases of relapsed or refractory disease. It is an integral part of various treatment regimens, making it an appropriate choice in the management of multiple myeloma. C.

It is used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and is often combined with other therapies, such as chemotherapy or proteasome inhibitors, to help manage the disease and control symptoms. D. Bortezomib: Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor and is a cornerstone in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Panobinostat Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. It works by modifying the acetylation of histones, leading to changes in gene expression that promote cancer cell death, inhibit tumor growth, and sensitize myeloma cells to other therapies. Panobinostat is often used in combination with other agents like bortezomib and dexamethasone in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Incorrect Responses: A. Bortezomib: Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, not a histone deacetylase inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the proteasome, which leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins in cells and promotes apoptosis, particularly in cancerous plasma cells. While it is commonly used in multiple myeloma treatment, it is not an HDAC inhibitor. C. Daratumumab: Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38 on plasma cells. It is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, particularly in relapsed or refractory cases. However, it is not a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and its mechanism of action is entirely different from that of HDAC inhibitors. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IgM Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a type of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma characterized by the malignant proliferation of lymphoplasmacytoid cells, which produce large amounts of IgM (immunoglobulin M). The excessive production of IgM leads to hyperviscosity of the blood, causing symptoms such as visual disturbances, headache, and neurological issues. This is the hallmark feature of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and the presence of elevated IgM levels is key to its diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: B. IgG: IgG is the most common type of immunoglobulin in the blood, but it is not the primary immunoglobulin secreted in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. The disease is specifically associated with the production of IgM, not IgG. C. IgE: IgE is primarily involved in allergic reactions and parasitic infections, but it is not the type of immunoglobulin produced in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. This option is unrelated to the disease process. D. IgD: IgD is another class of immunoglobulin, but it is not the main immunoglobulin secreted in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. IgD is more commonly found on the surface of immature B cells, but it is not associated with the pathological production in this disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MYD88 The most common gene mutation found in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is in the MYD88 gene. This mutation is present in approximately 90-95% of WM cases. MYD88 is involved in the signaling pathway of the immune system, particularly in the activation of B cells. The mutation, specifically MYD88 L265P, leads to the constitutive activation of signaling pathways that promote the survival and proliferation of malignant lymphoplasmacytoid cells, driving the development of WM. Incorrect Responses: B. CXCR4: While mutations in CXCR4 can occur in WM, they are less common compared to MYD88 mutations. CXCR4 mutations are often associated with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis, but they are not the most common genetic abnormality in WM. C. ARID1A: ARID1A mutations are seen in various cancers, but they are not typical or common in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. These mutations are more associated with other types of lymphomas and cancers, not with WM specifically. D. CD79B: CD79B mutations are seen in some B-cell malignancies, including certain lymphomas, but they are not the most common mutation in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. These mutations can be present in a subset of WM patients, but MYD88 mutations remain the most prevalent.",

Seligmann’s disease is the most frequently diagnosed heavy chain disease, and it is important to recognize it for proper diagnosis and treatment. Incorrect Responses: A. Franklin’s disease: Franklin's disease is a rare form of heavy chain disease that involves the production of abnormal IgG heavy chains. While it is a type of heavy chain disease, it is less common compared to Seligmann's disease, which is more frequently encountered in clinical practice. C.
