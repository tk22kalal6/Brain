      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Type I pneumocytes can divide to reconstitute type II pneumocytes after lung injury. Type I pneumocytes are primarily responsible for the structure of the alveolar walls, providing the surface area for gas exchange. However, they cannot divide to regenerate type II pneumocytes after lung injury. Instead, type II pneumocytes are the progenitor cells for both type I and type II pneumocytes. After lung injury, type II pneumocytes can proliferate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes to repair the alveolar lining. Thus, the statement that type I pneumocytes can divide to reconstitute type II pneumocytes is false. Incorrect Options: A. The alveoli are lined predominantly by epithelial cells (incorrect): The alveoli are indeed lined predominantly by epithelial cells, specifically type I pneumocytes, which form the majority of the alveolar surface and are involved in gas exchange. Type II pneumocytes also contribute to the epithelial lining, but to a lesser extent. Therefore, this statement is true. B. Type II pneumocytes are a source of surfactant (incorrect): Type II pneumocytes are indeed the cells responsible for producing surfactant, which reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing collapse. This is a key function of type II pneumocytes. Therefore, this statement is true. D. Surfactant reduces surface tension and counteracts the tendency of the alveoli to collapse (incorrect): Surfactant, produced by type II pneumocytes, plays a crucial role in reducing surface tension in the alveoli. By lowering surface tension, surfactant prevents the alveoli from collapsing, particularly during exhalation, and helps maintain lung compliance. Therefore, this statement is true.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chest wall and lungs recoil in opposite directions to each other. Intrapleural pressure is negative due to the opposing elastic forces exerted by the chest wall and the lungs. The lungs tend to recoil inward due to their natural elasticity, while the chest wall tends to recoil outward. These opposing forces create a sub-atmospheric pressure in the pleural space, which helps keep the lungs expanded. The negative intrapleural pressure is essential for lung inflation during inspiration and prevents the lungs from collapsing. This negative pressure is maintained even during normal quiet breathing. Incorrect Options: B. Transpulmonary pressure is negative (incorrect): Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between intrapulmonary pressure (the pressure inside the lungs) and intrapleural pressure (the pressure in the pleural cavity). For normal breathing, transpulmonary pressure is positive, not negative. It is positive because the intrapulmonary pressure is greater than the intrapleural pressure, allowing the lungs to stay inflated. A negative transpulmonary pressure would result in lung collapse, which is not the case in normal physiology. Hence, this option is incorrect. C. Intrapulmonary pressure is always negative (incorrect): Intrapulmonary pressure, or alveolar pressure, is not always negative. It becomes negative during inspiration (when the diaphragm contracts and expands the thoracic cavity), but it is positive during expiration (when air is expelled from the lungs). Thus, intrapulmonary pressure fluctuates around atmospheric pressure during the respiratory cycle, and it is not always negative. This statement is incorrect. D. Pulmonary collapse is prevented by surfactants (incorrect): While pulmonary surfactant plays a crucial role in reducing surface tension in the alveoli, preventing the alveoli from collapsing, it is not responsible for maintaining negative intrapleural pressure. The negative intrapleural pressure is primarily due to the opposing recoil forces of the chest wall and lungs, as mentioned in A. Surfactants help to prevent the alveoli from collapsing by reducing surface tension, but they do not directly influence the intrapleural pressure. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tuberculosis. The most common cause of hemoptysis worldwide is tuberculosis (TB). Hemoptysis refers to the coughing up of blood, and in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, tuberculosis is a leading cause of this condition. TB primarily affects the lungs and can lead to chronic cough, damage to lung tissue, and the formation of cavitary lesions that can erode blood vessels, causing bleeding into the airways. Despite improvements in healthcare, TB remains a significant cause of hemoptysis, especially in regions with high TB prevalence. Therefore, TB is the most likely cause of hemoptysis globally. Incorrect Options: A. Malignancy (incorrect): While lung cancer is a known cause of hemoptysis, it is not the most common cause worldwide. Cancer-related hemoptysis is more prevalent in developed countries, where smoking-related lung cancer is common. However, tuberculosis remains a more frequent cause of hemoptysis globally, particularly in regions where TB is endemic. Hence, although malignancy is a possible cause of hemoptysis, it is not the leading cause globally. This makes option A incorrect. C. Chronic bronchitis (incorrect): Chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), can cause hemoptysis, but it is typically associated with long-term smoking and chronic airway inflammation. While it may cause blood-tinged sputum in some cases, hemoptysis due to chronic bronchitis is generally less frequent and less severe than that caused by tuberculosis. In terms of global prevalence, chronic bronchitis is not as significant a contributor to hemoptysis as tuberculosis. Therefore, this option is incorrect. D. Pulmonary embolism (incorrect): Pulmonary embolism (PE), which refers to a blockage in the pulmonary arteries typically caused by blood clots, can indeed lead to hemoptysis. However, it is not the most common cause of hemoptysis globally. Pulmonary embolism often presents with other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate, and it is more common in developed countries. TB, on the other hand, remains the leading cause of hemoptysis worldwide, particularly in regions where TB is endemic. Hence, pulmonary embolism is a less common cause of hemoptysis when compared to tuberculosis. This makes option D incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Functional residual capacity The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal tidal exhalation. It is the point at which the outward recoil of the chest wall exactly balances the inward elastic recoil of the lungs. This equilibrium prevents the lungs from collapsing or over-expanding and is crucial in maintaining a stable lung volume between breaths. At this lung volume, the lung and chest wall forces are in balance, and it represents a point of natural lung compliance. Explanation for the incorrect responses: A. Expiratory reserve volume (incorrect): The expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after a normal exhalation. It does not represent the balance point between the lung and chest wall recoil. Instead, ERV refers to the extra air that can be exhaled beyond the tidal volume during forced expiration. It occurs at volumes lower than the FRC and does not correspond to the equilibrium of elastic forces. C. Residual volume (incorrect): Residual volume (RV) is the amount of air remaining in the lungs after maximal exhalation. It represents the air that cannot be exhaled. RV is below the FRC and does not correspond to the point where lung and chest wall forces are balanced. It is simply the leftover volume after the maximal expiration effort. D. Tidal volume (incorrect): Tidal volume (TV) is the volume of air that is inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing. This is a much smaller volume compared to the FRC and does not represent the balance point of lung and chest wall elastic forces. It is simply the air moved with each breath and does not describe the equilibrium of lung pressures.",
