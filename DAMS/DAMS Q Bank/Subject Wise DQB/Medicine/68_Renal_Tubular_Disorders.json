      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Proximal convoluted tubule. Explanation: The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is the primary site for bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidneys. Approximately 80-90% of the filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed here. In the PCT, bicarbonate is exchanged with hydrogen ions through the action of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which facilitates the formation of carbonic acid and its subsequent dissociation to water and carbon dioxide. This process ensures that the majority of bicarbonate is reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Incorrect Answers: B. Distal convoluted tubule: While bicarbonate reabsorption does occur in the distal convoluted tubule, it accounts for a much smaller percentage compared to the proximal convoluted tubule. The distal convoluted tubule primarily fine-tunes electrolyte balance, with bicarbonate reabsorption occurring in response to pH changes but not being the major site of bicarbonate reabsorption. C. Cortical collection duct: The cortical collecting duct plays a role in acid-base balance by secreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate, especially under certain conditions like acidosis. However, its contribution to total bicarbonate reabsorption is minimal compared to the proximal tubule. D. Medullary collection duct: The medullary collecting duct, similar to the cortical collecting duct, plays a role in acid-base balance, especially in the regulation of hydrogen ion secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption. However, this part of the nephron also contributes only a minor amount to overall bicarbonate reabsorption, with the majority occurring in the proximal convoluted tubule.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Glomerulonephritis. The patient presents with recurrent hematuria associated with a sore throat the day before each episode, which raises suspicion for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The key finding in his urine analysis is the presence of dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs), which is suggestive of glomerular bleeding. The dysmorphic RBCs indicate that the bleeding originates from the glomeruli, a hallmark of glomerulonephritis. In addition, the patient’s elevated blood pressure (143/92 mm Hg) is another clue that suggests glomerular involvement. PSGN often occurs following a streptococcal throat infection, which the patient reports as occurring before each episode of hematuria. Thus, glomerulonephritis is the most likely cause of his hematuria. Incorrect Options: A. Stones: While kidney stones can cause hematuria, they typically lead to more acute, colicky pain and hematuria that is often associated with gross hematuria (visible blood). The lack of pain, the presence of dysmorphic RBCs, and the recurrent nature of the hematuria make stones less likely in this case. B. Infection: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can cause hematuria, but they are usually associated with white blood cells (WBCs) and bacteria in the urine, which are not present in this case. Additionally, UTIs typically present with dysuria (painful urination) and fever, neither of which the patient is experiencing. The recurrent hematuria without infection markers points away from an infection as the cause. D. Tumor (renal or bladder cancer): Renal or bladder tumors can present with hematuria, but they tend to cause painless gross hematuria, often with no associated symptoms like sore throat. Furthermore, the presence of dysmorphic RBCs strongly suggests glomerular disease rather than a tumor, which usually presents with more isolated or macroscopic hematuria without other findings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). This patient has hyponatremia (serum sodium 112 mEq/L), a low serum uric acid (2.0 mg/dL), and high urine sodium (64 mEq/L), which strongly suggests SIADH. In SIADH, there is inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. The key lab findings supporting this diagnosis are: Hyponatremia with a serum sodium of 112 mEq/L, which is significantly low. High urine sodium (64 mEq/L), which is consistent with the kidneys excreting sodium despite the low serum sodium, a hallmark of SIADH. Low serum uric acid (2.0 mg/dL), which is also typically seen in SIADH due to water retention. Normal calcium levels (9.2 mg/dL), ruling out hypercalcemia as a cause of confusion. Normal lung function and oxygen saturation, ruling out hypoxia or any significant respiratory cause. Given the patient's lung cancer and the laboratory findings, SIADH is a common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancies, especially small cell lung cancer, and it can lead to significant water retention and hyponatremia. Therefore, SIADH is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation. Incorrect Options: A. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): While CHF can cause edema and fluid retention, it is not the most likely cause of this patient's severe hyponatremia with the high urine sodium and low uric acid. In CHF, one might expect low urine sodium due to the body's attempt to conserve sodium in response to perceived low effective blood volume. The lab findings in this case, particularly the high urine sodium, do not support CHF as the cause of hyponatremia. B. Nephrotic syndrome due to paraneoplastic syndrome: Nephrotic syndrome can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome in malignancies, but it typically presents with proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. While this patient does have edema, the urine findings (high urine sodium, no significant proteinuria) and the absence of hypoalbuminemia make nephrotic syndrome an unlikely diagnosis. Additionally, nephrotic syndrome does not typically cause the marked dilutional hyponatremia seen in this patient. C. Dehydration: Dehydration typically leads to high serum sodium (hypernatremia) and low urine sodium (due to compensatory sodium retention). In this case, the patient has hyponatremia and high urine sodium, which is inconsistent with dehydration. The lab findings are more consistent with SIADH than dehydration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Urine osm 800 mosm/kg, urine volume-low. In central diabetes insipidus (CDI), there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which results in the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine. When vasopressin (synthetic ADH) is administered, the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine is restored, leading to an increase in urine osmolality. Normally, after vasopressin administration, the urine osmolality should increase to more than 800 mOsm/kg, and the urine volume should decrease due to the concentration of the urine. Thus, in a patient with CDI, after administering vasopressin, you would expect high urine osmolality (800 mOsm/kg or higher) and low urine volume due to the kidneys' ability to concentrate the urine. Incorrect responses: A. Urine osm 800 mosm/kg, urine volume-high: This option is incorrect because, in CDI, the urine volume should decrease after the administration of vasopressin, not remain high. The kidneys are unable to concentrate urine without ADH, but after vasopressin is given, they concentrate the urine, and the volume should decrease, not remain high. C. Urine osm 120 mosm/kg, urine volume-high: This option is incorrect because, after vasopressin is given, the urine osmolality should rise significantly (above 800 mOsm/kg), not remain low at 120 mOsm/kg. The persistence of low urine osmolality despite vasopressin administration suggests that the kidneys are not responding to the hormone, which would be a feature of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, not central. D. Urine osm 120 mosm/kg, urine volume-low: This option is incorrect because although the urine osmolality remains low, the urine volume would not decrease in a patient with central diabetes insipidus unless the kidney's response to vasopressin is impaired. This scenario suggests a different pathophysiological process (like nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) rather than CDI.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Add Rasburicase. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that is used in the treatment of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) when uric acid levels remain elevated despite hydration and use of allopurinol. In TLS, there is rapid breakdown of tumor cells, leading to the release of large amounts of uric acid. This can cause acute kidney injury due to uric acid crystal deposition in the kidneys. Allopurinol inhibits the formation of uric acid, but it does not directly lower the existing uric acid levels. Rasburicase, on the other hand, breaks down uric acid into allantoin, which is more easily excreted by the kidneys, thereby reducing uric acid levels more rapidly. Since the patient's uric acid level is still elevated and renal function continues to worsen despite fluids and allopurinol, the addition of rasburicase is the most appropriate next step. Incorrect responses: A. Observation: Observation alone is not an appropriate option in this case, as the patient's creatinine is rising and the uric acid remains elevated, indicating ongoing kidney injury and worsening tumor lysis syndrome. Active intervention with rasburicase is necessary to address the elevated uric acid and prevent further renal damage. B. Add N-acetylcysteine: N-acetylcysteine is used in the prevention and treatment of contrast-induced nephropathy and may be beneficial in some cases of acute kidney injury. However, it is not effective for treating the underlying cause of tumor lysis syndrome, particularly the hyperuricemia. This patient requires treatment aimed at reducing uric acid levels, such as rasburicase, rather than N-acetylcysteine. C. Add Febuxostat: Febuxostat is another urate-lowering agent, but it works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, similarly to allopurinol. It is not as effective as rasburicase in acutely reducing already elevated uric acid levels. In a patient with severe TLS and elevated uric acid, rasburicase is the preferred choice as it directly breaks down uric acid into a more easily excreted compound, whereas febuxostat only prevents further production of uric acid. Therefore, rasburicase remains the most appropriate therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cranial diabetes insipidus. Cranial diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition where the posterior pituitary does not produce enough antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to an inability to concentrate urine. This results in polyuria (increased urine output) and polydipsia (increased thirst). The key diagnostic feature in this case is the response to desmopressin, a synthetic form of ADH: Water deprivation test would show increased urine output and low urine osmolality in DI patients, confirming their inability to concentrate urine. The subsequent desmopressin test (administering desmopressin to assess the response) typically shows a marked increase in urine osmolality and a decrease in urine volume in cranial DI patients. This response indicates that the kidneys can concentrate urine when they receive adequate ADH, suggesting that the defect lies in the production of ADH rather than in the kidneys’ ability to respond to it. Therefore, the combination of findings supports the diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus. Incorrect responses: B. Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia, which leads to osmotic diuresis (excessive urine output due to high glucose levels). While patients with diabetes mellitus may present with polyuria and polydipsia, the water deprivation test would not be used for diagnosing diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the desmopressin test does not directly influence the symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, diabetes mellitus is not the correct answer. C. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidneys are resistant to ADH, even though it is produced normally. In contrast to cranial DI, patients with nephrogenic DI would not show a significant increase in urine osmolality or a decrease in urine output after desmopressin administration. The lack of response to desmopressin in nephrogenic DI would differentiate it from cranial DI. D. Psychogenic polydipsia: Psychogenic polydipsia is a condition characterized by excessive water intake, often due to a psychological condition, leading to dilutional hyponatremia and increased urine output. However, unlike diabetes insipidus, the water deprivation test in psychogenic polydipsia would show a normal response, with the urine osmolality increasing after water deprivation. The desmopressin test in psychogenic polydipsia would typically show no change in urine osmolality because the problem is due to excessive fluid intake rather than a defect in ADH production or response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glomerulonephritis. In this case, the patient presents with persistent hematuria (positive dipstick for blood) and deformed red blood cells (RBCs), some of which are also in the form of casts. These findings are highly suggestive of glomerulonephritis, a condition where there is inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys. In glomerulonephritis, RBCs may appear dysmorphic (deformed) due to the damage to the glomerular capillaries. The presence of casts (especially RBC casts) indicates that the blood is coming from the glomeruli rather than the lower urinary tract, which is a key feature of glomerulonephritis. The combination of these laboratory findings (deformed RBCs and casts) points to glomerulonephritis, a common cause of hematuria that involves the glomerular filtration barrier. Incorrect responses: A. Urinary tract stones: While urinary tract stones can cause hematuria, the presence of dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts is not characteristic of stones. Stones typically cause painful hematuria (especially if they obstruct the urinary tract), but the urine would generally contain normal RBCs and would not show casts. This makes urinary tract stones less likely in this case. C. Trauma: Trauma can cause hematuria, but the hematuria would generally be non-glomerular and would not involve the presence of dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts. If trauma were the cause, the hematuria would be more likely to originate from the lower urinary tract (bladder or urethra), and the RBCs would not be deformed or in casts. Additionally, there is no mention of any traumatic injury or other findings that would suggest trauma. D. Renal tumor: Renal tumors can cause gross or microscopic hematuria, but they typically do not result in the presence of dysmorphic RBCs or casts. Hematuria from a renal tumor usually involves normal RBCs and would typically not be associated with other features like casts, which are indicative of glomerular injury.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) This patient has multiple myeloma as evidenced by her history and laboratory findings. Her renal function is impaired, suggesting renal involvement. The urine dipstick shows minimal proteinuria but this test only reliably detects albumin and not other proteins; hence, although it can detect glomerular proteinuria, it is a poor test to assess for tubular and overflow proteinuria. A quantitative test including an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) and a protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) should be requested. In the case of cast nephropathy, one would expect a significant discrepancy in these values with a higher uPCR as compared with the uACR, suggesting that there is excretion of an alternate protein other than albumin (in this case, light chains).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Urea is a poor marker of filtration as in this case it is influenced by upper GI bleeding. Explanation: In this patient with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, urea levels can be elevated due to the breakdown of hemoglobin and other proteins in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to increased urea production. The GI bleed leads to blood protein breakdown, which raises urea levels, regardless of renal function. Thus, urea is not a reliable marker of renal function in this case because it is influenced by extrarenal factors, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding. This is why urea is considered a poor marker of filtration in the context of upper GI bleeding. Incorrect Responses: A. This patient has intrinsic acute kidney injury as evidenced by the rise in urea.: The rise in urea alone is not sufficient to diagnose intrinsic acute kidney injury (AKI). Intrinsic AKI is typically characterized by damage to the renal parenchyma (e.g., glomeruli, tubules, or interstitium) and is often indicated by features such as elevated creatinine, abnormal urinalysis, and evidence of tubular injury (e.g., casts). In this case, the elevated urea is more likely due to the GI bleed, rather than intrinsic renal damage. B. This patient has intrinsic acute kidney injury as evidenced by the decline in eGFR.: The decline in eGFR can occur in any type of kidney injury, including pre-renal, intrinsic, or post-renal causes. It is not specific to intrinsic AKI. In this patient, acute kidney injury is likely pre-renal in nature, as evidenced by hypotension and volume depletion due to the GI bleed. Declining eGFR alone does not confirm intrinsic AKI in this context. D. Creatinine is an ideal filtration marker as it is freely filtered but not secreted from the renal tubules.: While creatinine is a more reliable marker of renal function compared to urea, it is not an ideal filtration marker. Creatinine is indeed freely filtered by the glomerulus; however, it is also secreted by the renal tubules to some extent, which can increase its concentration in the urine and overestimate renal function. Additionally, creatinine levels can be affected by other factors like muscle mass and diet, and it may not accurately reflect renal function in acute kidney injury until a significant time has passed.",
