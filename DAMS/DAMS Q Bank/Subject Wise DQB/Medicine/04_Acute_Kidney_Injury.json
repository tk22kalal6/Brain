      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Type 2. Explanation: In Type 2 Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA), also known as proximal RTA, there is impaired reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal tubules of the kidney. This leads to a loss of bicarbonate, causing a metabolic acidosis. One of the consequences of Type 2 RTA is a decreased ability to activate vitamin D, which is essential for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Vitamin D supplementation helps prevent osteomalacia (softening of the bones due to mineral deficiency) by enhancing calcium absorption in the intestines, which can be impaired in this type of RTA. Incorrect Responses: A. Type 1: In Type 1 Renal Tubular Acidosis (distal RTA), the primary defect is in the ability of the distal tubule to excrete hydrogen ions, resulting in metabolic acidosis. While osteomalacia can occur in Type 1 RTA due to acidosis and phosphate wasting, vitamin D supplementation does not effectively correct the underlying problem in this type. The bone disease in Type 1 is more related to impaired phosphate handling and acidosis rather than a deficiency of vitamin D activation, so it is not the correct answer. C. Type 3: Type 3 RTA is a less common form of RTA, often associated with a combination of features from both Type 1 and Type 2 RTA. While osteomalacia can also be a complication in Type 3 RTA, vitamin D supplementation does not necessarily prevent its development in this type as effectively as it does in Type 2 RTA. The management of Type 3 involves addressing both metabolic acidosis and phosphate handling, so it’s not the most appropriate choice. D. All of them: This option is incorrect because vitamin D supplementation is particularly effective in Type 2 RTA to prevent osteomalacia due to issues with calcium absorption. It is not as effective or required in Type 1 or Type 3, making this answer incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) urinary pH is > 5.5 and bicarbonate 5.5 and bicarbonate 15: This option is also incorrect. Type 1 RTA is characterized by a high urinary pH (> 5.5) due to the kidney's inability to excrete hydrogen ions, and serum bicarbonate levels are typically low (less than 14 mEq/L), not elevated. Therefore, this combination does not fit the characteristics of Type 1 RTA. D. Fanconi syndrome commonly associated: While Fanconi syndrome, which involves a generalized defect in proximal tubular reabsorption (affecting glucose, amino acids, phosphate, and bicarbonate), can be seen in some forms of RTA, it is not commonly associated with Type 1 RTA. Fanconi syndrome is more commonly seen in Type 2 RTA (proximal RTA), where there is a defect in proximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tumor lysis syndrome. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurs when a large number of cancer cells are rapidly destroyed, typically after chemotherapy, leading to the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. This release results in significant electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia, which are seen in this patient. The elevated levels of potassium (6.6 mEq/L), uric acid (10.4 mg/dL), and phosphate (7.0 mg/dL) along with renal impairment (elevated creatinine and BUN) are characteristic of TLS. Additionally, the muscle weakness and laboratory findings suggest acute renal failure, which is a complication of TLS due to the renal deposition of uric acid crystals and phosphate, leading to acute kidney injury. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a known risk factor for developing TLS. Incorrect responses: B. Rhabdomyolysis: While rhabdomyolysis can also cause muscle weakness and elevated creatinine levels, the key differentiating factor in this patient is the combination of electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia) that are seen in TLS, but not typically in rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, the urine analysis in rhabdomyolysis often shows evidence of myoglobinuria, which is not present in this case. C. Chemotherapy induced intrinsic acute renal failure: This could be a possible cause of renal impairment after chemotherapy, but it would typically be characterized by a gradual decline in renal function. TLS is a more acute process that can present with rapid renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia shortly after chemotherapy, which fits the clinical picture in this case better than intrinsic renal failure. D. Dehydration induced pre renal AKI: While dehydration can cause pre-renal acute kidney injury, it typically does not cause the same marked electrolyte abnormalities seen here, such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia. In this case, the electrolyte disturbances and rapid onset of renal dysfunction point more toward tumor lysis syndrome rather than dehydration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Amphotericin. The patient’s laboratory results suggest kidney dysfunction and electrolyte imbalances, which are classic side effects of amphotericin B therapy. Amphotericin B can cause renal toxicity (commonly referred to as nephrotoxicity), especially with prolonged use or high doses. This toxicity can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), which explains the elevated creatinine and the low potassium (hypokalemia), as well as metabolic acidosis (indicated by the low serum bicarbonate and the elevated chloride). Amphotericin B binds to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, but it can also bind to cholesterol in human cells, especially in the kidneys, causing damage to renal tubular cells, leading to tubular dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired kidney function. This toxicity is a well-known side effect of the drug, making it the most likely cause of the changes in this patient’s laboratory values. Incorrect responses: A. Sepsis: Sepsis could contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte abnormalities, and changes in laboratory values. However, the patient’s fever and clinical signs of infection are managed, and sepsis would typically present with other signs of infection (such as elevated white blood cell count, positive cultures, and more systemic symptoms). Given the patient’s recent amphotericin treatment and the timing of laboratory changes, amphotericin nephrotoxicity is a more likely cause in this context. B. Lactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis can cause metabolic acidosis, but it typically results from conditions like sepsis, shock, or hypoxia, none of which are clearly indicated in this patient. Additionally, the lactate level would be elevated in lactic acidosis, but there is no mention of elevated lactate in this case. The electrolyte abnormalities, particularly the low potassium and kidney dysfunction, point toward nephrotoxicity rather than lactic acidosis. D. Anti-retroviral toxicity: While certain antiretroviral drugs (such as those from the NRTI class) can cause lactic acidosis and renal toxicity, the patient’s recent amphotericin therapy is more strongly associated with the lab changes described. The timing of the laboratory changes and the known nephrotoxic effects of amphotericin B make it the most likely cause, not anti-retroviral toxicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Urine anion gap. The urine anion gap is a useful test to help differentiate between diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis (RTA) as causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. This test works by measuring the difference between the major cations and anions in the urine, helping to identify the cause of the acidosis. In diarrhea, there is bicarbonate loss from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to a negative urine anion gap (because the kidneys compensate for this loss by increasing ammonium excretion and retaining bicarbonate). In renal tubular acidosis (RTA), there is impaired renal acid excretion, which results in a positive urine anion gap (due to impaired ammonium excretion). Thus, measuring the urine anion gap can help distinguish between diarrhea (negative urine anion gap) and RTA (positive urine anion gap) as causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Incorrect responses: A. Serum bicarbonate level: While the serum bicarbonate level is part of the metabolic acidosis picture, it alone does not differentiate between diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis. Both conditions can present with low bicarbonate levels due to the body’s attempt to buffer the acid load. Therefore, this test does not provide the specific distinction needed. B. Sodium level: Sodium levels are useful in calculating the anion gap, but they do not help in distinguishing between diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis in cases of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The urine anion gap is the more specific test for this purpose. D. Response to antibiotics: Antibiotics may be used for treating infections, but they do not directly help in differentiating diarrhea from renal tubular acidosis. The causes of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis are related to acid-base disturbances and renal or gastrointestinal function, not infections that would be treated with antibiotics.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cholesterol embolization. This patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI) following a myocardial infarction and coronary stenting, with subsequent eosinophilic casts in the urine and eosinophilia. These findings are highly suggestive of cholesterol embolization syndrome. Cholesterol embolization occurs when cholesterol crystals are released into the bloodstream during procedures like coronary angiography and stenting. These crystals can lodge in small blood vessels, including those in the kidneys, leading to AKI. The characteristic findings in the urine are eosinophilic casts and sometimes eosinophilia in the blood. This is a recognized complication of invasive vascular procedures, such as angiography, especially in older patients with atherosclerotic disease. Incorrect responses: B. Contrast nephropathy: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) can cause AKI, but it typically presents with a rise in serum creatinine after the administration of contrast media, and the urine usually shows mild proteinuria or casts. The presence of eosinophilic casts and eosinophilia is not characteristic of CIN, and it is more suggestive of cholesterol embolization. C. Haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS): HUS is often associated with diarrhea (due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli) or thrombotic microangiopathy, but it would typically not present with eosinophilic casts. Moreover, the patient’s fever and eosinophilia do not align with HUS, which is more characterized by hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and AKI. D. Renal artery thrombosis: While renal artery thrombosis can cause AKI, the presentation would typically involve severe flank pain, hypertension, and signs of ischemic kidney injury. The presence of eosinophilic casts and eosinophilia makes renal artery thrombosis less likely in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. The patient has a history of prerenal azotemia due to dehydration, and after receiving naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), his creatinine has worsened. The mechanism by which NSAIDs can impair renal function is through afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which reduces the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are important for vasodilation of the afferent arteriole, especially under conditions of low blood volume or dehydration. When prostaglandin production is inhibited, the afferent arterioles constrict, leading to reduced renal blood flow, which can worsen renal function, especially in a patient already at risk due to dehydration. This is the mechanism that leads to prerenal azotemia exacerbation. Incorrect responses: B. Afferent arteriolar vasodilatation: NSAIDs do not cause vasodilation of the afferent arteriole. In fact, they cause vasoconstriction, not dilation. This makes option B incorrect. C. Efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction: The efferent arteriole constricts in response to angiotensin II, not NSAIDs. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the drugs that affect the efferent arteriole by causing efferent vasodilation. NSAIDs primarily affect the afferent arterioles, so option C is incorrect. D. Proximal tubular toxicity: Proximal tubular toxicity is a mechanism more commonly seen with drugs like aminoglycosides or radiocontrast agents. NSAIDs primarily affect renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rather than causing direct toxicity to the renal tubules. Thus, option D is not the correct explanation for this patient's worsening renal function.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Isotonic saline. This patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to rhabdomyolysis from the crush injury. Rhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle tissue is damaged, releasing intracellular contents, including creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, and electrolytes, into the bloodstream. Elevated CK (10,000 U/L) is a key marker of rhabdomyolysis, and the patient's low calcium (6.5 mg/dL) and high phosphorus (6 mg/dL) are common findings in this condition due to the release of intracellular contents from the damaged muscle cells. Isotonic saline is the most appropriate initial treatment to maintain renal perfusion and flush out myoglobin from the kidneys, thereby preventing acute kidney injury (AKI) from myoglobin-induced tubular obstruction and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline increases renal perfusion and helps prevent further kidney damage. Incorrect responses: A. Mannitol: Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is sometimes used in the management of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with rhabdomyolysis. However, the first-line treatment for rhabdomyolysis-related AKI is fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline to prevent kidney injury. Mannitol may be used in cases where there is insufficient response to fluids, but it is not the first-line therapy and may even exacerbate kidney injury in some cases due to its diuretic effect, which can lead to hypovolemia. C. Furosemide: Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is used to manage fluid overload, but it is not recommended for the initial treatment of rhabdomyolysis-related AKI unless the patient is in fluid overload or has symptoms of heart failure. Diuretics may cause electrolyte imbalances (e.g., low potassium) and worsen renal function in rhabdomyolysis, so isotonic saline should be the priority treatment. D. Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis may be required in severe cases of rhabdomyolysis-related AKI, particularly if there is oliguria, anuria, or severe electrolyte imbalances (such as hyperkalemia). However, the initial step in management is to provide adequate hydration with isotonic saline to prevent the need for hemodialysis. Dialysis is usually considered if there is progressive kidney failure or severe complications (e.g., hyperkalemia, acidosis).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This 17-year-old male is presenting with vomiting, bloody diarrhea, followed by declining urine output, bilateral ankle edema, high urea and creatinine levels (indicating acute kidney injury), low hemoglobin (suggesting anemia), low platelets (thrombocytopenia), and the presence of schistocytes on blood film, which is a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. These findings are consistent with Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a disorder often triggered by infection with Shiga toxin-producing bacteria, most commonly Escherichia coli O157:H7. Even though the stool cultures in this patient were negative for E. coli O157, this could be due to the timing of the stool culture or the presence of other infections or factors causing HUS. HUS is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. It frequently follows an episode of gastroenteritis with bloody diarrhea, commonly associated with E. coli infection, although other causes can be involved. Incorrect responses: B. Lupus nephritis: While lupus nephritis can cause acute kidney injury and may present with proteinuria, hematuria, and edema, it does not typically cause thrombocytopenia, anemia, or the presence of schistocytes on a blood film. The absence of other typical signs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), such as skin rashes, arthritis, or positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), further makes lupus nephritis unlikely in this case. C. Pre-renal failure: Pre-renal failure can cause acute kidney injury due to factors such as hypovolemia or decreased renal perfusion. However, it would not explain the thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, or the presence of schistocytes. Pre-renal failure typically improves with volume resuscitation and does not cause the systemic hemolysis seen in HUS. D. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP is another condition that involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, but it is more commonly associated with neurological symptoms (such as confusion or seizures) and fever, which are not present in this patient. TTP is typically caused by a deficiency of ADAMTS13, an enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers, leading to platelet aggregation. While the symptoms overlap, the absence of neurological signs and the clear history of diarrheal illness make HUS the more likely diagnosis in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) White blood cell casts are likely on microscopic examination of urinary sediment. In contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), which occurs after the administration of iodinated contrast media, the typical findings in urinary sediment are granular casts (often referred to as muddy brown casts), which are indicative of tubular injury. White blood cell casts are more commonly associated with inflammatory or infectious processes in the kidneys, such as pyelonephritis, rather than with CI-AKI. Thus, white blood cell casts are not characteristic of contrast nephropathy. Incorrect responses: A. Hydration is a preventive measure: Adequate hydration is indeed a key preventive measure in contrast-induced acute kidney injury. Pre-procedural hydration has been shown to help in preventing renal damage by promoting renal perfusion and reducing the risk of contrast nephropathy. Therefore, hydration is a well-established preventive strategy. B. His creatinine is likely to peak within 3–5 days: In most cases of contrast-induced nephropathy, serum creatinine tends to peak 2–5 days after exposure to contrast media, making this statement accurate. The rise in creatinine can typically be seen within this window. C. His diabetes mellitus predisposed him to develop contrast nephropathy: Diabetes mellitus is indeed a risk factor for contrast-induced acute kidney injury. Diabetic patients often have pre-existing kidney damage (such as diabetic nephropathy) and altered renal hemodynamics, making them more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of contrast media. Therefore, diabetes mellitus increases the likelihood of developing CI-AKI.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acute interstitial nephritis. This patient's presentation is suggestive of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which is a well-known cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and can be triggered by drug exposure, especially medications like inhaled steroids (e.g., fluticasone) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (used for GERD). AIN is characterized by an eosinophilic infiltration in the renal interstitium, leading to kidney dysfunction. The associated fever, rash, eosinophilia, and cellular casts (which are indicative of tubular injury) further point toward this diagnosis. Drugs such as PPIs, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common culprits in AIN. Incorrect responses: A. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): ATN is typically caused by ischemic injury or nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides or radiocontrast agents, and usually presents with muddy brown casts in the urine. Although AIN can result in tubular injury, the presence of eosinophilia and the rash in this patient are more suggestive of AIN, not ATN. Additionally, ATN does not commonly present with a rash or eosinophilia. C. Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN): AGN is often characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and glomerular casts in the urine. The absence of these findings, along with the presence of eosinophilia, fever, and rash, makes AGN an unlikely cause in this case. Additionally, AGN typically does not present with the type of cellular casts seen in this patient's urinalysis. D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP): HSP is a form of small-vessel vasculitis that predominantly affects children and presents with purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. While renal involvement can occur, HSP is less likely in an adult and typically presents with visible purpura and glomerular hematuria, neither of which is observed in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Type I RTA (Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis) Explanation: This patient is most likely suffering from Type I RTA (Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis), and here’s why: Low serum bicarbonate (15 mEq/L) indicates metabolic acidosis. The urine pH of 6.0, although not extremely high, suggests impaired hydrogen ion secretion in the distal tubule, which is a hallmark of Type I RTA. In this disorder, the distal tubule is unable to excrete hydrogen ions effectively, leading to an inability to acidify the urine. Urine electrolytes show low sodium (15 mEq/L), potassium (10 mEq/L), and chloride (12 mEq/L), suggesting a urine with low electrolyte concentrations typical of Type I RTA. Hypokalemia (serum potassium 3.0 mEq/L) is another key feature, which is common in Type I RTA, as there is increased potassium excretion in the urine secondary to impaired hydrogen ion secretion. Type I RTA is often associated with autoimmune diseases like Sjogren syndrome, which explains why this patient, who has Sjogren syndrome, is presenting with these findings. Incorrect Responses: B. Type II RTA (Proximal Renal Tubular Acidosis): In Type II RTA, there is impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to decreased serum bicarbonate and proximal tubular dysfunction. However, unlike Type I RTA, Type II RTA does not typically present with an elevated urine pH. Instead, the urine pH tends to be <5.5, as the proximal tubule is unable to reabsorb bicarbonate, but the distal tubule can still excrete hydrogen ions normally. The patient's urine pH of 6.0 is more consistent with Type I than Type II. C. Type III RTA: Type III RTA is a rare and debated condition. It is often considered a combination of Type I and Type II RTA, presenting with features of both. It is not a commonly recognized classification and is not appropriate in this case, given the patient's presentation and lab findings, which are more consistent with Type I RTA. D. Type IV RTA (Hyperkalemic RTA): Type IV RTA is typically associated with hyperkalemia (high serum potassium), normal or low serum bicarbonate, and impaired aldosterone activity. The hypokalemia (serum potassium 3.0 mEq/L) in this patient makes Type IV RTA unlikely.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Kidney biopsy showing inflammatory interstitial infiltrate is required Explanation: This patient is presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is likely suffering from acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATN), a form of kidney injury that can be caused by various factors, including medications such as piperacillin-tazobactam. The clinical features—recent use of a potentially nephrotoxic drug, a rise in creatinine, urinary findings suggestive of inflammation (such as WBCs, WBC casts, and eosinophils)—are consistent with drug-induced interstitial nephritis. However, to secure a definitive diagnosis, kidney biopsy showing inflammatory interstitial infiltrate is required. Although urinary eosinophils, WBC casts, and renal ultrasound findings can all provide supportive evidence, a kidney biopsy remains the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Incorrect Responses: A. Large, echogenic kidneys on renal ultrasound: While renal ultrasound may show echogenic kidneys in certain cases of chronic kidney disease or interstitial nephritis, this finding is nonspecific and does not confirm the diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. The ultrasound finding of bilateral 15-cm kidneys with increased echogenicity in this case likely represents chronic kidney disease rather than being specific for AIN. Hence, renal ultrasound alone is not diagnostic. B. Positive urinary eosinophils: Urinary eosinophils are often seen in drug-induced AIN, but their presence is not diagnostic on its own. Eosinophils may also be present in other conditions, such as acute pyelonephritis, or in other forms of interstitial nephritis. While >1% eosinophils in the urine is suggestive of drug-induced nephritis, it is not pathognomonic. Urine eosinophils can be a helpful clue, but the final diagnosis still relies on kidney biopsy. C. WBC casts in the urine: WBC casts in the urine are a nonspecific finding, indicating inflammation within the kidneys, which can be seen in a variety of conditions such as acute pyelonephritis, acute interstitial nephritis, and even glomerulonephritis. While the presence of WBC casts does support the diagnosis of tubulointerstitial disease, it is not specific enough to confirm acute interstitial nephritis on its own. Thus, a kidney biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Continue ACE inhibitor at the same dose Explanation: This patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been appropriately started on an ACE inhibitor (enalapril). ACE inhibitors are first-line therapy for patients with HFrEF as they improve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival. The rise in serum creatinine from 1.1 to 1.3 mg/dL and the development of postural hypotension are common side effects of ACE inhibitors, especially when therapy is initiated or titrated upwards. However, this increase in creatinine (a small increase of 0.2 mg/dL) is typically well tolerated in patients with HFrEF, and the blood pressure of 108/60 mm Hg is not dangerously low. Mild increases in creatinine (up to 30%) are expected and should not necessarily lead to discontinuation or dose reduction of the ACE inhibitor. As long as there is no significant rise in creatinine (above 30% of baseline) and the patient’s symptoms are manageable, it is appropriate to continue the ACE inhibitor at the same dose, as it is still beneficial for her heart failure management. Incorrect Responses: A. Up titrate ACE inhibitor therapy further: While up-titrating ACE inhibitors is beneficial for heart failure, this patient is already experiencing mild postural hypotension and a modest rise in creatinine. Further up-titration may worsen these side effects, potentially leading to symptomatic hypotension or a more significant decline in kidney function. Therefore, increasing the dose is not advisable at this stage. B. Decrease dose of ACE inhibitor: Decreasing the dose of the ACE inhibitor is unnecessary given that the creatinine rise is modest and within an acceptable range. The patient’s blood pressure is not critically low (108/60 mm Hg), and the symptoms of postural hypotension should be managed through other means (such as increasing salt intake or adding a mild vasoconstrictor like fludrocortisone) rather than reducing the ACE inhibitor dose. Decreasing the dose prematurely could reduce the benefit to her heart failure management. C. Stop ACE inhibitor: Stopping the ACE inhibitor would be premature. ACE inhibitors are a cornerstone in the treatment of HFrEF and stopping the medication without clear evidence of severe side effects (such as acute kidney injury or life-threatening hypotension) would deprive the patient of a critical therapy that helps reduce mortality and hospitalization rates. Therefore, stopping the ACE inhibitor is not indicated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 24-hour urine calcium will be low This 35-year-old woman has celiac disease with associated osteopenia, low serum calcium, and very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (a key indicator of vitamin D deficiency). The low vitamin D levels impair calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to hypocalcemia. In response to low calcium levels, the body compensates by increasing parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, as seen with a PTH level of 80 pg/mL (higher than the normal range). Increased PTH leads to enhanced calcium reabsorption from the kidneys. However, the kidney's ability to reabsorb calcium may be impaired due to vitamin D deficiency, which affects the kidney's handling of calcium and phosphorus. Therefore, despite elevated PTH, calcium excretion in the urine is likely to be low in this patient. Incorrect Responses: B. 24-hour urine calcium will be high: In the presence of hypocalcemia, the body attempts to conserve calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) promotes calcium reabsorption from the renal tubules. As a result, the 24-hour urine calcium is expected to be low, not high. A high urine calcium level would suggest a different etiology, such as primary hyperparathyroidism or calcium supplementation. C. 24-hour urine phosphorus will be low: Phosphorus levels in this patient are already low (2.5 mg/dL, with normal range usually being 2.5–4.5 mg/dL), which suggests that she is likely retaining phosphorus due to increased PTH secretion. PTH increases phosphorus excretion in the urine, but here the phosphorus levels are already low, suggesting that there may not be substantial excretion. Hence, urinary phosphorus levels are not expected to be low, as the body may attempt to conserve phosphorus during vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia. D. All: Since option C is incorrect, the option \"all\" cannot be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is A, as 24-hour urine calcium is likely to be low in the context of vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism.",
