      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Syringomyelia is a developmental cavity in the cervical cord that may enlarge and produce progressive myelopathy or may remain asymptomatic. The presentation is a central cord syndrome consisting of a regional dissociated sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation with sparing of touch and vibration) and areflexic weakness in the upper limbs. The sensory deficit has a distribution that is “suspended” over the nape of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms (cape distribution) or in the hands. Muscle wasting in the lower neck, shoulders, arms, and hands with asymmetric or absent reflexes in the arms reflects expansion of the cavity in the gray matter of the cord. Early sacral involvement is not seen as syringomyelia commonly affects the cervical cord.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) LMN Paralysis of cranial nerve IX to XII. Why (C) is correct: Bulbar paralysis refers to lower motor neuron (LMN) paralysis involving cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), XI (accessory), and XII (hypoglossal), which originate from the medulla oblongata (bulbar region of the brainstem). This condition results in clinical features such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking), nasal regurgitation, weak or absent gag reflex, and tongue atrophy or fasciculations. Bulbar paralysis is seen in conditions such as motor neuron disease (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and brainstem strokes affecting the LMN nuclei of these cranial nerves. Why the other options are incorrect: (A) UMN Paralysis of cranial nerve III to XII: Upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions affecting cranial nerves typically result in spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia, and the presence of pathological reflexes. Moreover, bulbar paralysis specifically refers to LMN lesions and involves cranial nerves IX to XII, not III to XII. Cranial nerves III, IV, and VI are associated with eye movement and are not part of bulbar paralysis. (B) UMN Paralysis of cranial nerve IX to XII: UMN lesions involving cranial nerves IX to XII result in pseudobulbar palsy, not bulbar paralysis. Pseudobulbar palsy is characterized by spasticity, exaggerated gag reflex, emotional lability, and the absence of LMN signs such as atrophy or fasciculations. Therefore, this option describes a distinct condition rather than bulbar paralysis. (D) LMN Paralysis of cranial nerve III to XII: This option is incorrect because bulbar paralysis is specifically limited to LMN involvement of cranial nerves IX to XII. Cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, responsible for ocular motor functions, are not involved in bulbar paralysis. Including these nerves in the definition is inaccurate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sacral sparing. Why (D) is correct: Sacral sparing refers to the preservation of sensation in the sacral dermatomes (S3-S5) despite significant spinal cord involvement. This feature is typical of intramedullary tumors, as they originate within the spinal cord and tend to spare the peripheral sacral fibers due to their anatomical location in the outermost part of the spinal cord. Extramedullary tumors, on the other hand, compress the spinal cord from the outside, and sacral sparing is not characteristic because the compression affects the outermost fibers, including the sacral segments. Why the other options are incorrect: (A) Early corticospinal signs and paralysis: Extramedullary tumors compress the spinal cord externally, leading to early involvement of the corticospinal tracts. This results in motor deficits such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and eventual paralysis, which are hallmark features of extramedullary tumors. Hence, early corticospinal signs are a typical feature. (B) Root pain: Root pain is a common symptom of extramedullary tumors. These tumors often irritate or compress the spinal nerve roots, leading to sharp, radicular pain that corresponds to the affected dermatomes. This is a distinguishing feature of extramedullary tumors compared to intramedullary ones, which may cause more diffuse or poorly localized pain. (C) Asymmetric weakness: Extramedullary tumors often present with asymmetric weakness because the compression is usually unilateral or more pronounced on one side. This is in contrast to intramedullary tumors, which often cause symmetrical weakness due to their central origin within the spinal cord.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Wasting. Why (A) is correct: Spinal shock refers to the temporary loss of all spinal cord functions below the level of injury immediately following spinal cord trauma. It is characterized by areflexia, flaccid paralysis, sensory loss, and loss of autonomic function (such as bladder and bowel control). However, muscle wasting does not occur immediately in spinal shock. Muscle atrophy or wasting is a result of long-term disuse or denervation and occurs over weeks to months, not during the acute phase of spinal shock. Thus, wasting is not a feature of spinal shock. Why the other options are incorrect: (B) Sensory loss: Sensory loss is a characteristic feature of spinal shock. The disruption of the spinal cord pathways results in the loss of both sensory and motor functions below the level of injury. This sensory loss is typically complete and can affect all modalities (pain, temperature, touch, and proprioception) during the acute phase of spinal shock. (C) Urinary retention: Urinary retention is another hallmark of spinal shock. The loss of sympathetic and parasympathetic control over the bladder results in urinary retention and an inability to initiate urination. This is a common manifestation in the acute phase and can persist until the reflexive bladder activity resumes later in the recovery phase. (D) Areflexia: Areflexia, or the absence of reflexes, is a key feature of spinal shock. The interruption of the normal reflex arcs at or below the level of injury causes areflexia, which is a transient phenomenon that typically resolves as spinal reflexes return. This is part of the initial presentation of spinal shock.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) C4-C5. The patient's presentation, including quadriparesis (weakness in all four limbs), sphincter disturbance (which could be related to autonomic dysfunction), sensory level up to the upper border of the sternum, and breathing difficulty, is consistent with a cervical spinal cord injury, particularly at the C4-C5 level. The upper border of the sternum corresponds to the level of C4, and this sensory level indicates a lesion above this level. At the C4-C5 level, a lesion would affect the motor control of the upper and lower limbs (quadriparesis) and compromise diaphragmatic function, leading to breathing difficulty. This level is also associated with disruption of autonomic functions, which can result in sphincter disturbances. Incorrect Answers: A. C1-C2: A lesion at the C1-C2 level would typically result in total paralysis (quadriplegia) and complete loss of respiratory function, as the injury would affect both motor control of the limbs and the respiratory centers in the brainstem. However, breathing difficulty here would be much more severe (often requiring mechanical ventilation), and the sensory level would not typically be limited to the upper border of the sternum. This makes C1-C2 unlikely as the lesion site. C. T1-T2: A lesion at the T1-T2 level would usually result in paraplegia (paralysis of the lower limbs), not quadriparesis. The sensory level would likely be at the level of the chest, below the sternum, and not at the upper border of the sternum. Additionally, respiratory difficulties would not be as significant at this level, as the diaphragm (controlled by the phrenic nerve, originating from C3-C5) would typically remain intact. D. T3-T4: A lesion at the T3-T4 level would primarily affect the trunk and lower limbs, leading to paraplegia and not quadriparesis. The sensory level would likely be around the lower chest, and breathing difficulty would be less prominent because respiratory function is still primarily controlled by the cervical levels (C3-C5). Therefore, T3-T4 is also an unlikely level of injury based on the clinical presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Loss of vibration sense. Anterior spinal artery thrombosis leads to ischemia of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, which primarily affects the motor and sensory pathways responsible for pain, temperature, and motor control, but vibration sense is mediated by the dorsal column, which is not affected by this condition. The posterior spinal artery, which supplies the dorsal columns, remains intact. Therefore, vibration sense is typically preserved in anterior spinal artery thrombosis, making option B the exception. Incorrect Answers: A. Loss of pain and touch: The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior part of the spinal cord, which includes the spinothalamic tract responsible for pain and temperature sensation. Thrombosis of this artery can result in a loss of pain and touch sensation below the level of the lesion, affecting the sensory pathways carried in the anterior and lateral spinal cord regions. Therefore, loss of pain and touch is characteristic of this condition. C. Loss of power in lower limb: The anterior spinal artery also supplies the motor pathways, including the corticospinal tract, which controls voluntary motor movement. Thrombosis can lead to a loss of power (paralysis) in the lower limbs, as motor control is impaired due to ischemia of the anterior spinal cord. This is a key feature of anterior spinal artery thrombosis, making this option correct. D. Sphincter dysfunction: The anterior spinal artery supplies regions that control autonomic functions, including the control of sphincters. Therefore, ischemia at this level can lead to sphincter dysfunction such as bladder and bowel incontinence. This dysfunction is a common symptom seen in patients with anterior spinal artery thrombosis, making this option correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Brisk jaw jerk. Cervical myelopathy refers to the compression or injury of the spinal cord in the cervical region, which can lead to a range of neurological symptoms due to the involvement of both motor and sensory pathways. A brisk jaw jerk is typically a sign of upper motor neuron dysfunction and is more commonly seen in conditions affecting the brainstem (such as lesions in the pons or medulla), rather than in cervical myelopathy. Therefore, a brisk jaw jerk is not a typical clinical feature of cervical myelopathy, making option B the correct exception. Incorrect Answers: A. Facial sensory loss: While cervical myelopathy generally affects the limbs and trunk, in some cases, it can cause facial sensory loss due to the involvement of the sensory pathways. Compression in the cervical spinal cord can affect the trigeminal nerve pathways, leading to sensory deficits in the face. This can occasionally be seen in cervical myelopathy, making option A incorrect. C. Urinary bladder dysfunction: Urinary bladder dysfunction, such as urgency, incontinence, or retention, is a common feature of cervical myelopathy. The compression of the cervical spinal cord can interfere with the neural control of the bladder, leading to autonomic dysfunction. This is often seen in the later stages of the condition, so option C is incorrect. D. Horner’s syndrome: Horner's syndrome, characterized by ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis, and enophthalmos, can also be associated with cervical myelopathy, especially if the compression involves the sympathetic nerve fibers that originate from the upper cervical spinal cord (C8-T2). This syndrome can occur when there is disruption to the sympathetic pathway, which can be seen in cervical myelopathy. Hence, option D is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) T9 to T10. The patient is experiencing pain around the umbilical region, which corresponds to the T10 dermatome, suggesting that the lesion is located at or around the T9-T10 level. In addition to abdominal pain, the patient has bladder and bowel disturbances (suggesting autonomic dysfunction) and paralysis of the lower abdominal muscles (likely involving the lower thoracic or upper lumbar levels). The weakness of the leg muscles also points to a lower spinal cord level, affecting motor pathways below the lesion. The combination of these signs—sensory, autonomic, and motor dysfunction—aligns with a T9-T10 spinal cord injury, making this the most likely conclusion. Incorrect Answers: A. C1 to C2: A lesion at the C1 to C2 level would primarily affect motor and sensory function in the upper limbs, with potential respiratory complications due to the involvement of the brainstem and the phrenic nerve. However, this level would not explain the abdominal pain, bowel and bladder disturbances, or the weakness in the lower abdominal muscles and legs. The sensory disturbance would likely be felt much higher up (in the arms, neck, and head) and not around the umbilical region, making C1-C2 an unlikely level for this presentation. B. C1 to C2 (repeated): This option is identical to the first and still remains incorrect for the same reasons outlined above. C. T1 to T2: A lesion at the T1 to T2 level would affect the upper thoracic region and may cause upper limb dysfunction. However, it would not typically lead to lower abdominal muscle paralysis or leg weakness. The pain would likely be located higher than the umbilical region (closer to the chest), and bladder and bowel dysfunction would be less pronounced. Therefore, T1-T2 is not the correct level of injury based on the symptoms presented.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cervical. The central canal of the spinal cord is located in the central region, and its enlargement (such as in conditions like syringomyelia) often affects the upper spinal cord regions first, specifically in the cervical region. This is because the cervical cord is located closer to the central canal and is more prone to early involvement. The motor neurons that control the upper limbs, especially the hand muscles, are situated in this area, and as the central canal enlarges, it can compress these neurons, leading to weakness or dysfunction in the muscles of the upper limbs (cervical region) first. Incorrect Answers: B. Thoracic: The thoracic region of the spinal cord is located lower than the cervical region and would be affected later in cases of central canal enlargement. The thoracic spinal cord does not contain the motor neurons for the upper limbs, so this region is less likely to be involved initially. Any motor impairment related to the thoracic region would be less pronounced in the early stages. C. Lumbar: The lumbar region is located below the thoracic region and would be the last to be affected by an enlargement in the central canal. The lumbar region primarily controls the lower limbs, but it is situated further from the central canal, so it typically becomes involved only after the cervical and thoracic regions. D. Sacral: The sacral region is located at the lowest part of the spinal cord and would be the least affected in the early stages of central canal enlargement. The sacral region controls functions like bladder and bowel function but is less likely to be impacted first compared to the cervical region, which controls the upper limbs.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Disuse atrophy. In the case of an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion, the primary feature that occurs is disuse atrophy. This type of atrophy results from the lack of voluntary movement due to the disruption in the motor pathways that connect the brain to the muscles. The muscles, although they are still innervated by lower motor neurons, are not actively used, leading to wasting. This atrophy is typically gradual and is due to reduced use of the affected muscles rather than a direct loss of muscle innervation. Incorrect Answers: B. Denervation atrophy: Denervation atrophy occurs when there is damage to the lower motor neurons (LMNs) or their axons, which leads to the loss of direct nerve supply to the muscle. This type of atrophy is a characteristic of LMN lesions rather than UMN lesions. Therefore, this answer is incorrect in the context of UMN lesions. C. Fasciculation: Fasciculation refers to the involuntary, visible twitching of muscle fibers and is a sign of LMN lesions or peripheral nerve damage. It occurs due to spontaneous depolarization of lower motor neurons, and is not typically seen in upper motor neuron lesions. Hence, fasciculations are not a feature of UMN lesions. D. Plantar absent: The plantar reflex, also known as the Babinski sign, is usually present and abnormal (extensor) in patients with an upper motor neuron lesion. The plantar response would be positive in UMN lesions (toes fan out), not absent. A normal or absent plantar response is generally more consistent with lower motor neuron lesions or other conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.",

This is the level at which the sensory nerve fibers from the T10 spinal segment provide sensation to the skin of the anterior abdominal wall at the level of the umbilicus. Therefore, T10 is the correct answer for the dermatome of the umbilicus. Incorrect Answers: A. L1: The L1 dermatome is located lower than T10 and covers the area of the lower abdomen and groin, but it does not extend to the level of the umbilicus.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Compressive Myelopathy at lumbar region. The patient's presentation of severe lower back pain radiating towards the right knee, along with sensory impairments (pain, temperature, and proprioception) in the right lower limb, motor weakness (3/5 power) in the right lower limb, and normal findings in the upper limbs, strongly suggests a compressive myelopathy. In this case, the lesion likely involves the lumbar region, where compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots may result in sensory and motor deficits confined to one lower limb (right in this case). The asymmetry in the symptoms (right limb involvement) and the presence of motor weakness (3/5 power) also point toward a focal lesion in the lumbar spinal cord or nerve roots, rather than a more diffuse condition like transverse myelitis. Incorrect Answers: B. Non-Compressive Myelopathy at lumbar region: While non-compressive myelopathy (such as from inflammatory or ischemic causes) could present with similar symptoms, it would usually cause more bilateral findings rather than the unilateral impairment seen here. Additionally, non-compressive myelopathy typically doesn’t present with such focal pain or a clear radicular pattern as seen in this case. Therefore, this diagnosis is less likely. C. Acute Transverse Myelitis: Acute transverse myelitis typically causes bilateral sensory and motor deficits below the level of the lesion and would not explain the unilateral involvement (right side only) seen in this patient. The pattern of symptoms and the absence of a more widespread neurological deficit make this diagnosis unlikely. D. Guillain-Barre Syndrome: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a peripheral nerve disorder, usually presenting with ascending paralysis, often starting in the lower limbs, and affecting both sides. However, in this patient, the symptoms are unilateral and localized to the right leg, with specific sensory and motor findings. Additionally, there are no signs of progressive weakness or distal limb involvement that would be seen in GBS. Therefore, this is not the correct diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Syringomyelia. Syringomyelia is a condition characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord, which typically affects the central canal of the cord. While it can lead to a variety of sensory and motor symptoms, exaggerated jaw reflex is not a typical feature of syringomyelia. The primary symptoms of syringomyelia usually involve pain and temperature sensation loss, motor weakness, and muscle atrophy, particularly in the upper limbs, and it often presents with \"cape-like\" sensory loss. Since syringomyelia is more related to a local spinal cord lesion, it does not directly lead to upper motor neuron signs such as an exaggerated jaw reflex. Incorrect Answers: A. Multiple sclerosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system demyelinating disease that can affect both the upper and lower motor neurons. One of the signs of MS is the exaggerated jaw reflex due to the involvement of the brainstem or corticobulbar tracts, leading to an abnormal increase in the reflex response. Therefore, MS can cause an exaggerated jaw reflex, making this option incorrect. B. Motor neuron disease: Motor neuron disease (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), leads to upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction, which can result in exaggerated reflexes, including the jaw reflex. Since MND involves both upper and lower motor neurons, it is known to cause exaggerated reflex responses, including hyperactive jaw reflex. Therefore, MND is an incorrect choice. C. Pseudobulbar palsy: Pseudobulbar palsy, caused by bilateral corticobulbar tract lesions (often due to stroke, MS, or ALS), results in exaggerated reflexes, including the jaw jerk reflex. This occurs because the loss of corticobulbar control over the brainstem reflex centers leads to increased reflex activity. Hence, this condition is also associated with an exaggerated jaw reflex, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Conus medullaris. The patient’s symptoms, including perianal sensory loss (bilateral), retention of urine, and abdominal discomfort, along with lost ankle reflexes (bilaterally), suggest a lesion at the conus medullaris, which is the terminal portion of the spinal cord (L1-L2 level). The plantar reflex being extensor bilaterally (Babinski sign) points to upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement, which is typically seen with lesions at or above the conus medullaris. The loss of sensory function in the perianal area and sphincter dysfunction (urinary retention) are classic signs of a conus medullaris syndrome, which affects both the lower motor neurons (LMNs) and upper motor neurons in the sacral region, leading to a mixed pattern of motor and sensory deficits. Incorrect Answers: A. Cauda equina: Cauda equina syndrome typically results from a lesion or compression of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. While it can also cause urinary retention, sphincter dysfunction, and sensory loss in the lower extremities, cauda equina syndrome usually involves LMN signs, such as flaccid paralysis, loss of reflexes, and saddle anesthesia. However, in this case, the extensor plantar reflex (Babinski sign) and the combination of UMN and LMN findings point more toward conus medullaris, which is located higher in the spinal cord compared to cauda equina syndrome. C. Syringomyelia: Syringomyelia is a condition characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord, often leading to a loss of pain and temperature sensation in a cape-like distribution. While it can cause motor deficits, sensory disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction, the perianal sensory loss seen in this patient is not typical of syringomyelia, which primarily affects the upper spinal cord and does not have a specific focus on perianal areas. Therefore, syringomyelia is unlikely in this case. D. Subacute combined degeneration: Subacute combined degeneration (SCD) is a result of vitamin B12 deficiency and typically affects the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, causing sensory ataxia, paresthesia, and motor weakness. However, it does not typically cause specific sensory loss in the perianal area or the combination of motor findings (e.g., extensor plantar reflex with ankle reflex loss). The sphincter dysfunction seen in this patient is more consistent with conus medullaris syndrome rather than SCD, which is more associated with spasticity and sensory loss in the lower limbs. Therefore, this is an incorrect diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cauda equina. The patient's presentation of severe back pain radiating to the left knee, along with unilateral lower limb symptoms (loss of sensations and reflexes on the left side), weakness (4/5 power) in the left lower limb, and normal right side reflexes is highly suggestive of cauda equina syndrome. The cauda equina consists of the lumbar and sacral nerve roots that are responsible for sensory and motor innervation to the lower limbs, bladder, and bowel. In this case, the involvement of the left lower limb with loss of sensations, loss of reflexes, and motor weakness (along with the absence of plantar reflex on the left side) points to a nerve root compression or lesion at the level of the cauda equina. The symptoms of severe back pain, unilateral lower limb involvement, and sphincter disturbances (e.g., absent plantar reflex and loss of ankle reflex) are characteristic of cauda equina syndrome. Incorrect Answers: B. Conus medullaris: The conus medullaris is located at the L1-L2 level of the spinal cord and is responsible for both upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs, which typically present as bilateral symptoms. The bilateral involvement in sphincter dysfunction, motor weakness, and sensory loss would be expected in conus medullaris syndrome, whereas this patient has unilateral symptoms (left side only). The presence of unilateral symptoms and reflex asymmetry makes cauda equina a more likely diagnosis than conus medullaris. C. Syringomyelia: Syringomyelia involves the development of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord, often at the cervical or thoracic levels. It typically causes bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in a cape-like distribution and motor deficits in the upper limbs. The patient's symptoms are localized to the left lower limb, with motor and sensory deficits on one side, and do not match the typical presentation of syringomyelia. Additionally, the absence of bilateral sensory loss or a cape-like distribution rules out syringomyelia as the likely diagnosis. D. Subacute combined degeneration: Subacute combined degeneration is primarily caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and affects the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, leading to sensory ataxia, paresthesia, and motor weakness. It typically affects both sides (bilateral) and does not usually cause the unilateral lower limb symptoms observed here. Additionally, the reflex loss and plantar response abnormalities in only the left lower limb do not fit with the more bilateral and gradual onset of symptoms seen in subacute combined degeneration. Therefore, it is not the correct diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lead poisoning. Lead poisoning typically presents with symptoms like abdominal pain, neuropathy, constipation, and cognitive changes. While it can cause peripheral neuropathy and motor deficits, it does not directly lead to spastic paraplegia, which is characterized by spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs due to damage to the upper motor neurons or corticospinal tracts. Lead poisoning primarily affects the peripheral nerves and causes motor neuropathy, which presents differently from the spasticity seen in spastic paraplegia. Therefore, lead poisoning is not a cause of spastic paraplegia. Incorrect Answers: A. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, affecting both the posterior and lateral columns, leading to spastic paraplegia. This condition often manifests with bilateral lower limb weakness, spasticity, and sensory deficits in the lower limbs, making it a well-known cause of spastic paraplegia. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause spastic paraplegia. B. Cervical spondylosis: Cervical spondylosis refers to degenerative changes in the cervical spine, which can lead to compression of the spinal cord (cervical myelopathy). This compression can result in spastic paraplegia, as it affects the upper motor neurons that control motor function in the lower limbs. Therefore, cervical spondylosis is a known cause of spastic paraplegia. D. Motor neuron disease: Motor neuron disease (MND), which includes conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), involves the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. While MND can lead to both upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs, the upper motor neuron involvement can result in spastic paraplegia, particularly in the later stages of the disease. Therefore, motor neuron disease can cause spastic paraplegia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Abdominal muscles. Beevor’s sign is a clinical sign observed during abdominal muscle testing. It is seen when there is dysfunction of the lower abdominal muscles, especially those innervated by the lower thoracoabdominal nerves (T10-T12). The sign is positive when there is upward movement of the umbilicus during an abdominal contraction (e.g., when the patient tries to perform a sit-up). This indicates weakness or paralysis of the lower abdominal muscles due to a neurological lesion affecting the motor innervation to these muscles, often seen in conditions such as spinal cord lesions or motor neuron diseases. Therefore, Beevor's sign is related to abdominal muscle dysfunction. Incorrect Answers: B. Facial muscles: Facial muscles are involved in facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) function. There are no clinical signs like Beevor’s sign related to the facial muscles. Dysfunction in facial muscles can result in facial weakness or paralysis, seen in conditions like Bell’s palsy, but this is unrelated to Beevor's sign. C. Respiratory muscles: Respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, are involved in breathing but do not display Beevor’s sign. Dysfunction of respiratory muscles may lead to respiratory distress, but Beevor's sign is specifically a sign of abdominal muscle weakness due to nerve involvement, not respiratory muscle dysfunction. D. Hand muscles: Hand muscles are controlled by the brachial plexus and the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. While dysfunction of these nerves can lead to hand weakness or atrophy, Beevor’s sign is not related to the hand muscles. It specifically involves the abdominal muscles, not the hand muscles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tic douloureux. Trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, is a neurological disorder characterized by sudden, severe, and stabbing pain along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V). This pain usually affects one side of the face and is triggered by stimuli such as touch, chewing, or brushing the teeth. The term \"tic douloureux\" comes from the French words for \"pain\" (douloureux) and \"tic\", referring to the sudden, spasmodic nature of the pain. Therefore, tic douloureux is the correct term for trigeminal neuralgia. Incorrect Answers: A. Cluster tic: Cluster tic is not a widely recognized medical term. It is likely a misunderstanding or confusion with cluster headaches, which are a distinct type of severe headache that occurs in clusters. Cluster headaches involve intense pain around the eyes and are unrelated to trigeminal neuralgia, which affects the trigeminal nerve and causes facial pain. B. Jaw winking: Jaw winking is a rare phenomenon where the jaw muscles twitch in response to eye movements, often seen in certain neurological conditions like congenital facial paralysis or other cranial nerve anomalies. It is unrelated to trigeminal neuralgia and is not a synonym for it. D. Myokymia: Myokymia refers to the spontaneous, involuntary muscle twitching or rippling seen under the skin, typically affecting the eyelids or other muscles. It is often benign but can be associated with neurological conditions. Myokymia is not related to trigeminal neuralgia, which involves severe facial pain rather than muscle twitching.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mental retardation. Friedreich ataxia is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by progressive ataxia, cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus (DM), and scoliosis. The disorder involves the spinocerebellar tract, leading to ataxia and loss of coordination. Mental retardation or intellectual disability is not typically seen in Friedreich ataxia, as cognitive function is usually preserved. The most prominent features of the disease are related to motor dysfunction, heart issues, and endocrine problems such as diabetes. Therefore, mental retardation is the least common feature among the listed options. Incorrect Answers: A. Cardiomyopathy: Cardiomyopathy, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy, is a very common feature in Friedreich ataxia. Cardiac involvement occurs in the majority of patients and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this condition. Therefore, cardiomyopathy is a common feature of Friedreich ataxia. B. DM (Diabetes Mellitus): Diabetes mellitus is also a common feature in Friedreich ataxia, often occurring in the early to mid-teens. It is due to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, which is a result of the degeneration of nerve tissue. Therefore, DM is a frequent feature of Friedreich ataxia. C. Scoliosis: Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) is another common feature of Friedreich ataxia, especially as the disease progresses and muscle weakness and impaired motor coordination become more pronounced. The lack of muscle control can lead to postural deformities such as scoliosis, making it a frequent clinical finding in this condition. Therefore, scoliosis is a common feature of Friedreich ataxia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Wilson’s disease. The patient’s symptoms, including tremors, emotional lability, and the golden-brown discoloration in Descemet’s membrane (known as Kayser-Fleischer rings), are characteristic of Wilson’s disease. Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder that results in defective copper metabolism, leading to the accumulation of copper in various tissues, particularly in the liver, brain, and cornea. The Kayser-Fleischer rings are copper deposits in the corneal Descemet's membrane and are a hallmark finding in this condition. The tremors and emotional lability reflect the neurological and psychiatric involvement of the disease, which commonly occurs in children and young adults. Therefore, Wilson’s disease is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Incorrect Answers: A. Fabry’s disease: Fabry’s disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. It leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in various tissues, resulting in symptoms such as painful neuropathy, angiokeratomas, and renal and cardiac problems. However, Fabry’s disease does not typically cause Kayser-Fleischer rings or the neurological signs (tremors and emotional lability) seen in this patient. Therefore, Fabry’s disease is not the most likely diagnosis. C. Glycogen storage disease: Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that affect the body’s ability to store or break down glycogen. While these diseases can cause muscle weakness, hepatomegaly, and growth retardation, they do not typically present with tremors, emotional lability, or Kayser-Fleischer rings. Therefore, glycogen storage disease is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. D. Acute rheumatic fever: Acute rheumatic fever is a post-infectious complication of Group A streptococcal throat infection. It primarily affects the heart, joints, and nervous system (causing Sydenham’s chorea). While emotional lability and neurological symptoms can occur, the golden-brown discoloration in Descemet's membrane (Kayser-Fleischer rings) is not a feature of acute rheumatic fever. Therefore, acute rheumatic fever is not the most likely diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Extensor plantar with brisk lower limb reflexes. Friedreich ataxia is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the spinocerebellar tract, dorsal columns, and corticospinal tracts. It is characterized by progressive ataxia, cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and scoliosis. Extensor plantar responses and brisk reflexes are typically not seen in Friedreich ataxia. Instead, patients usually exhibit hyporeflexia or areflexia, particularly in the lower limbs, due to sensory and motor involvement. Spasticity and increased reflexes are more commonly associated with upper motor neuron lesions, but this is not typical for Friedreich ataxia. Therefore, extensor plantar responses with brisk reflexes is not a feature of this condition. Incorrect Answers: A. Progressive ataxia is the most common presentation: Progressive ataxia is indeed the most common presentation of Friedreich ataxia. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence and involves a gradual loss of coordination and motor control, typically affecting the lower limbs first. Therefore, progressive ataxia is a hallmark feature of this disorder. B. Cardiomyopathy is a common association: Cardiomyopathy, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy, is very common in Friedreich ataxia. It affects most individuals with the condition and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The heart involvement is a key aspect of the disease. C. Diabetes mellitus may be associated: Diabetes mellitus is another common feature of Friedreich ataxia, occurring in many patients, often in their teenage years. It results from pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and is an important component of the disease's overall presentation. Therefore, diabetes mellitus is a known associated feature of Friedreich ataxia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Friedrich ataxia. In Friedreich ataxia, a genetic neurodegenerative disorder, bilateral loss of ankle jerk and extensor plantar responses (Babinski sign) are commonly observed. The disease primarily affects the spinocerebellar tract, dorsal columns, and corticospinal tracts, leading to sensory ataxia, loss of deep tendon reflexes (like the ankle jerk), and motor dysfunction. The extensor plantar response occurs due to the upper motor neuron involvement in the later stages of the disease. Friedreich ataxia typically presents with progressive ataxia, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus in childhood or adolescence, making the loss of reflexes and the presence of extensor plantar response part of its clinical presentation. Incorrect Answers: A. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): In Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, both upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron dysfunctions are present. While brisk reflexes and extensor plantar responses (indicative of upper motor neuron involvement) are common, loss of ankle jerk (a sign of lower motor neuron involvement) is not typically bilateral in ALS. In ALS, reflexes may be hyperactive in the upper limbs, and weakness and wasting in the muscles are more prominent. Therefore, bilateral loss of ankle jerk and extensor plantar response is not characteristic of ALS. C. Tabes dorsalis: Tabes dorsalis is a form of tertiary syphilis that affects the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. It typically leads to loss of proprioception, vibratory sense, and deep tendon reflexes, including ankle jerks. However, the extensor plantar response is not typically present in tabes dorsalis. Instead, patients may have areflexia or hyporeflexia. Therefore, Tabes dorsalis would not typically present with a bilateral extensor plantar response. D. Lead poisoning: Lead poisoning can affect the peripheral nervous system, often causing sensorimotor neuropathy and muscle weakness, but it does not typically present with bilateral loss of ankle jerk and extensor plantar response. Instead, the pattern of reflex loss in lead poisoning is more commonly distal and affects lower limbs, with other findings such as abdominal pain, anemia, and neurological changes. Therefore, lead poisoning is unlikely to be the cause of this specific presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dorsal root ganglion. In Friedreich's ataxia, the dorsal root ganglion is typically the first region to be involved. The disorder leads to degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia, which results in loss of sensory input to the spinal cord. As a result, proprioception and vibration sense are impaired, leading to the ataxia and motor dysfunction that are hallmark features of the disease. The early involvement of the dorsal root ganglion affects the sensory fibers, leading to sensory ataxia before the disease progresses to affect other structures like the spinocerebellar tracts. Incorrect Answers: B. Spinal tracts: The spinocerebellar tracts are indeed affected in Friedreich's ataxia, but they are not typically the first structures to be involved. Sensory loss and ataxia result from the degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia and subsequent sensory pathways, while the involvement of the spinal tracts (including the corticospinal tract and spinocerebellar tracts) occurs later in the disease course. Therefore, spinal tracts are not the first region to be affected. C. Peripheral nerve: Peripheral nerves may become affected later in the disease progression as Friedreich's ataxia advances. However, the primary pathology starts in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord, not the peripheral nerves. The involvement of peripheral nerves typically occurs as a secondary effect, contributing to neuropathy but not as the initial site of damage. D. Cerebellum: While the cerebellum is a major site of involvement in Friedreich's ataxia, it is not the first structure to be affected. The cerebellar degeneration leads to coordination problems and motor dysfunction, but the disease primarily begins in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord. Therefore, the cerebellum is involved later in the disease progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Myopathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency primarily causes neurological and hematological manifestations, but it does not typically cause myopathy (muscle weakness due to muscle disease). The neurological complications of Vitamin B12 deficiency are more commonly associated with myelopathy, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy, due to its impact on myelin formation and nerve function. While muscle weakness can be seen in the general context of severe vitamin B12 deficiency (due to the associated neurological impairments), myopathy (a primary muscle disease) is not a direct consequence of B12 deficiency. Incorrect Answers: A. Myelopathy: Vitamin B12 deficiency can indeed cause myelopathy, specifically subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. This occurs due to impaired myelin synthesis, which primarily affects the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Patients typically present with sensory ataxia, muscle weakness, and loss of vibration sense and proprioception, making myelopathy a well-known consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency. B. Optic atrophy: Optic atrophy can result from Vitamin B12 deficiency due to its effects on the central nervous system, including the optic nerves. The deficiency causes demyelination, which can lead to optic nerve degeneration, resulting in visual disturbances and eventually optic atrophy. C. Peripheral neuropathy: Peripheral neuropathy is a common manifestation of Vitamin B12 deficiency. It occurs due to demyelination of the sensory and motor nerves in the peripheral nervous system. Patients may experience numbness, tingling, and weakness, especially in the lower limbs, which are characteristic signs of peripheral neuropathy associated with B12 deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can present with a combination of anemia, posterior column dysfunction, and plantar extensor response (Babinski sign). This occurs due to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a condition that affects the posterior and lateral columns. The posterior column dysfunction leads to loss of proprioception, vibration sense, and sensory ataxia, while plantar extensor responses (Babinski sign) indicate upper motor neuron involvement, often seen in B12 deficiency. The anemia is typically megaloblastic in nature, which is another key feature of Vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition is also associated with neurological symptoms, such as peripheral neuropathy and demyelination, which are part of the clinical presentation. Incorrect Answers: A. SSPE (Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis): SSPE is a progressive neurological disorder that typically occurs in children and young adults following a measles infection. It presents with a variety of neurological symptoms, such as seizures, cognitive decline, and motor dysfunction. It does not typically cause anemia or posterior column dysfunction, and plantar extensor responses are not characteristic of SSPE. Thus, SSPE is not the likely cause of this patient's symptoms. B. Multiple sclerosis (MS): Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that typically presents with optic neuritis, limb weakness, and sensory deficits. Although posterior column dysfunction can be seen in MS, it is usually associated with other findings, such as visual disturbances and relapsing-remitting neurological deficits. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a much more likely diagnosis for this presentation, especially in an elderly individual, as MS typically presents in younger adults and does not cause megaloblastic anemia. C. Vitamin B1 deficiency (Thiamine deficiency): Vitamin B1 deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause neuropathy and cardiovascular symptoms, but it does not typically lead to posterior column dysfunction or plantar extensor responses. The hallmark of thiamine deficiency is dry or wet beriberi, with symptoms such as edema, heart failure, and muscle weakness, but posterior column signs and anemia are not characteristic features of thiamine deficiency. Therefore, this is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Deep tendon reflexes are brisk. In tabes dorsalis, which is a form of neurosyphilis, the dorsal columns of the spinal cord are primarily affected. This results in loss of proprioception, vibration sense, and light touch. As a consequence of the degeneration of the dorsal columns, deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) are absent or diminished, not brisk. The loss of reflexes is a key feature of tabes dorsalis, so brisk reflexes are not seen in this condition. The absence of reflexes is a result of the demyelination of sensory fibers and the impairment of sensory input to the spinal cord. Incorrect Answers: A. Seen in neurosyphilis: Tabes dorsalis is a classic manifestation of tertiary syphilis, which is a stage of neurosyphilis. It is caused by the treponema pallidum bacterium and involves demyelination of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Tabes dorsalis is specifically associated with neurosyphilis, making this statement true. C. Loss of vibration sense: Loss of vibration sense is one of the hallmark features of tabes dorsalis. The posterior columns of the spinal cord, responsible for proprioception and vibration sense, are demyelinated in this condition. As a result, patients have difficulty perceiving vibration stimuli, which is a significant sensory deficit seen in tabes dorsalis. Therefore, this statement is true. D. Bladder involvement: Bladder involvement, often presenting as urinary incontinence or difficulty emptying the bladder, is a common symptom of tabes dorsalis. The damage to the dorsal columns affects sensory feedback to the spinal cord, leading to autonomic dysfunction, including issues with bladder control. Hence, this statement is true.",
