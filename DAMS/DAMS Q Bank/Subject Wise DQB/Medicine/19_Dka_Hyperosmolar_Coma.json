      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A. Bradycardia. Bradycardia is not typically seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In fact, in DKA, tachycardia (increased heart rate) is more commonly observed due to the body’s response to dehydration, acidosis, and the associated stress response. Bradycardia would be unusual and may suggest other underlying conditions or complications, such as electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hyperkalemia or hypokalemia) or medication side effects. B. Kussmaul’s breathing This option is correct. Kussmaul’s breathing is a hallmark of DKA. It is a deep, labored breathing pattern that occurs in response to metabolic acidosis. In DKA, the body tries to compensate for the accumulation of ketones and acids by increasing the rate and depth of respiration to expel more carbon dioxide and restore normal pH levels. C. Abdominal pain This option is correct. Abdominal pain is a common symptom in DKA, often due to the effects of acidosis and dehydration, as well as the electrolyte imbalances that occur in the condition. This can also be related to delayed gastric emptying or pseudoperitonitis in DKA. D. Dehydration This option is correct. Dehydration is a significant feature of DKA due to the combined effects of hyperglycemia, osmotic diuresis, and the body’s attempt to excrete excess ketones and glucose in the urine. The dehydration leads to hypovolemia, which contributes to tachycardia, hypotension, and other complications in DKA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Excess of H+ ions combines with HCO3-. In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the excessive production of ketones (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate) leads to metabolic acidosis, resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions. These excess H+ ions combine with bicarbonate ions, lowering the bicarbonate level and increasing the anion gap. The increased anion gap is the difference between the concentrations of measured cations (e.g., sodium) and measured anions (e.g., chloride), and it reflects the presence of unmeasured anions such as ketones. This is why DKA is associated with an increased anion gap. A. Loss of H+ ions in urine This option is incorrect. Loss of H+ ions in urine would reduce the acidosis, not contribute to it. In DKA, there is retention of H+ ions due to the accumulation of ketone bodies, not their loss. In fact, in DKA, there may be some urinary excretion of H+ as part of the body's attempt to correct the acidosis, but this does not directly increase the anion gap. B. Loss of HCO3- ions in urine This option is incorrect. While it is true that bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions are lost in the urine during acidosis, the loss of bicarbonate itself does not directly increase the anion gap. The increase in the anion gap in DKA is primarily due to the accumulation of unmeasured anions, like ketones, rather than the loss of bicarbonate. D. Loss of Cl- ions in urine This option is incorrect. Chloride ions (Cl-) are typically excreted in the urine in response to metabolic acidosis to maintain electrical neutrality, but the loss of chloride ions does not increase the anion gap. In fact, in many cases of acidosis, chloride levels may rise, and it is the accumulation of unmeasured anions (like ketones) that causes an increased anion gap in DKA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis (low pH), and the presence of ketones in the blood and urine, all of which are present in this case. The patient's glucose level of 400 mg/dl is elevated, and the pH of 6.8 indicates severe acidosis, which is a hallmark of DKA. Additionally, the presence of plasma ketones (++) confirms the presence of ketosis, which is another key feature of DKA. The patient's potassium level of 5.8 meq/L is also elevated, which is often seen in DKA due to the shift of potassium from inside the cells to the bloodstream as a result of acidosis. The patient’s fever for the past week suggests an underlying infection, which is a common precipitating factor for DKA in diabetic patients. The serum osmolality of 310 mOsm/L is slightly elevated but does not strongly suggest the other conditions. A. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) This option is incorrect. HHS is another complication of type 2 diabetes and is typically seen in elderly patients with very high blood glucose levels (often >600 mg/dL) and significant hyperosmolarity (serum osmolality >320 mOsm/L). However, HHS does not typically present with ketosis (no ketones) or metabolic acidosis. In contrast, the patient here has a significant ketone presence and metabolic acidosis, pointing more towards DKA. C. Meningitis This option is incorrect. Meningitis can cause fever, altered mental status, and a range of other symptoms, but it would not explain the hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketosis seen in this patient. Additionally, the glucose level of 400 mg/dL and pH of 6.8 are much more consistent with DKA than meningitis. D. Hypoosmolar hyperglycemic state This option is incorrect. There is no such thing as hypoosmolar hyperglycemic state in clinical practice. HHS is characterized by hyperosmolarity (high serum osmolality) and severe hyperglycemia, and it occurs in type 2 diabetes. However, this case has a normal to slightly elevated serum osmolality (310 mOsm/L), and the patient’s primary issue is likely DKA, not a hyperosmolar state.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). This patient's presentation of extremely high glucose levels (800 mg/dL), serum osmolality of 350 mOsm/L, and absence of plasma ketones points to HHS, which is a serious complication of type 2 diabetes. The hallmark of HHS includes marked hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration, without significant ketoacidosis. The absence of ketosis (negative ketones) and the severe hyperosmolarity (serum osmolality of 350 mOsm/L) support HHS over DKA. This condition is typically seen in older patients with type 2 diabetes, often precipitated by infections or other stressors like fever, which this patient also has. B. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) This option is incorrect. While DKA also presents with hyperglycemia and altered mental status, it is typically characterized by metabolic acidosis (low pH) and the presence of ketones in the blood and urine. In this case, the patient has a normal potassium level (4.6 meq/L) and negative ketones, which excludes DKA. Additionally, the pH of 6.8 suggests severe acidosis, which can occur in both conditions, but DKA usually involves ketosis, making it less likely here. C. Meningitis This option is incorrect. Meningitis could cause fever, altered mental status, and possibly coma, but it does not typically present with severe hyperglycemia or hyperosmolarity. The glucose of 800 mg/dL and the absence of ketones point to HHS, not meningitis. Furthermore, meningitis would usually present with symptoms such as neck stiffness, photophobia, or nuchal rigidity, which are not mentioned here. D. Hypoosmolar hyperglycemic state This option is incorrect. As mentioned, there is no condition known as hypoosmolar hyperglycemic state in clinical practice. HHS involves hyperosmolarity (elevated serum osmolality), not hypoosmolarity. In this patient, the serum osmolality of 350 mOsm/L is high, which supports HHS and not any form of hypoosmolar state.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Regular insulin. In a patient presenting with hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis, regular insulin is the drug of choice. DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) requires rapid correction of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, which is best achieved with intravenous (IV) regular insulin. Regular insulin is a short-acting insulin that can be administered intravenously and works quickly to lower blood glucose levels and correct the ketosis. It is the standard of care in DKA, where insulin therapy is essential to reverse both hyperglycemia and ketogenesis. A. Oral hypoglycemic agent This option is incorrect. Oral hypoglycemic agents, such as metformin or sulfonylureas, are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus but are not effective in the management of DKA or ketoacidosis. In DKA, the patient is in a state of insulin deficiency, and oral agents would not provide the rapid insulin replacement required to correct both hyperglycemia and ketosis. Therefore, insulin therapy is essential, and oral agents are not suitable in this acute scenario. B. Lente insulin This option is incorrect. Lente insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin, which is typically used in chronic management of diabetes to maintain blood glucose control. It is not suitable for the acute correction of DKA, where a rapid-acting insulin is required to address both the hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Intermediate-acting insulins are slower to act compared to regular insulin, making them less effective for the acute management of DKA. C. Oral drugs with intermediate acting insulin This option is incorrect. As mentioned earlier, oral drugs are not effective for managing DKA, and intermediate-acting insulin (such as NPH) is not ideal for the rapid correction needed in DKA. Regular insulin (a short-acting insulin) is preferred for quick action in acute conditions like DKA, while intermediate-acting insulin is more suited for maintaining glucose control over a longer period.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Serum bicarbonate in DKA is > 15 meq/L. In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), serum bicarbonate is typically < 15 meq/L, and often as low as 5-10 meq/L or even lower, reflecting the metabolic acidosis that is a hallmark of DKA. In this condition, the body produces excess ketones, which are acidic, and the bicarbonate buffer system is overwhelmed, leading to a decreased bicarbonate level. Therefore, having a serum bicarbonate level greater than 15 meq/L is inconsistent with DKA. A. DKA is commoner in type 1 This statement is correct. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is indeed more common in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) because T1DM is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency, leading to the inability to suppress ketogenesis. In the absence of insulin, the body switches to fat metabolism, resulting in the production of ketones and ketoacidosis. Although it can occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it is much rarer because type 2 diabetes usually has some degree of insulin resistance rather than total insulin deficiency. B. Anion gap increases This statement is correct. In DKA, there is an increase in the anion gap because of the accumulation of ketone bodies (such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), which are unmeasured anions. The anion gap is calculated as: Anion Gap = (Na+ + K+) − (Cl- + HCO?-) In DKA, the bicarbonate level drops, and the accumulation of ketones causes an increase in the anion gap, which helps in diagnosing metabolic acidosis in DKA. C. Serum pH < 7.4 This statement is correct. In DKA, the serum pH is typically < 7.4 and often falls to < 7.0, indicating severe acidosis. The primary cause of the acidosis is the accumulation of ketones, which lowers the blood pH and leads to metabolic acidosis. This is a key feature of DKA and is closely monitored in managing the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypokalemia. When insulin is administered intravenously, especially in the context of severe hyperglycemia (such as in diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state), it drives potassium from the extracellular space (blood) into the intracellular space (cells). This movement of potassium into cells can lead to a decrease in blood potassium levels, resulting in hypokalemia. This effect is especially concerning when insulin is given rapidly or without adequate potassium supplementation, as severe hypokalemia can be life-threatening and requires careful monitoring. B. Hyperkalemia This option is incorrect. In fact, hyperkalemia is often seen before insulin administration in conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), where there is acidosis and potassium shifts out of cells into the bloodstream. However, once insulin is administered, it causes potassium to move back into cells, thereby lowering the potassium levels in the blood. Thus, hyperkalemia would not typically occur after insulin administration in severe hyperglycemia. C. Hyponatremia This option is incorrect. Although hyperglycemia itself can lead to pseudo-hyponatremia (due to the dilutional effect of high glucose on serum sodium), the administration of insulin would actually help correct hyperglycemia and can result in a rise in serum sodium as glucose levels decrease. Hyponatremia could be seen as a result of water shifts due to hyperglycemia, but insulin administration typically addresses the underlying hyperglycemia and would likely reverse the condition. D. Hypernatremia This option is incorrect. Hypernatremia is typically associated with water loss or dehydration, not insulin administration. In the case of severe hyperglycemia (especially in DKA or HHS), patients may experience significant water shifts, but insulin administration, by lowering blood glucose levels, would not typically cause an increase in sodium levels. In fact, the hydration correction associated with insulin therapy can help restore normal sodium balance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 1 and 2. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), also known as hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, typically above 600-750 mg/dL, and severe dehydration. It is more common in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The hallmark of HHS is the absence or minimal ketonuria (which distinguishes it from diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA) and a high serum osmolality. The blood sugar level often exceeds 750 mg/dL, and severe dehydration (often due to osmotic diuresis) is observed. In contrast to DKA, serum sodium levels are usually elevated or normal due to dehydration, rather than being below 120 mEq/L as stated in feature 4. Ketonuria is typically absent or minimal in HHS. Therefore, the correct features of HHS are severe dehydration and blood glucose > 750 mg/dL, making 1 and 2 the most characteristic findings. Incorrect Answers A. 1, 2, 3 and 4 This option is incorrect because ketonuria (feature 3) is not characteristic of HHS. In HHS, ketones are usually absent or minimally present, as the body does not produce large amounts of ketones due to the relatively low insulin deficiency in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, serum sodium levels in HHS tend to be normal or elevated (due to dehydration), not as low as <120 mEq/L, which is more typical of DKA. C. 2 and 3 This option is incorrect because while severe hyperglycemia (feature 2) is characteristic of HHS, ketonuria (feature 3) is not typically present or is only minimal in HHS, unlike in DKA, where ketonuria is a prominent feature. D. 1, 3 and 4 This option is incorrect because feature 3 (ketonuria) and feature 4 (serum sodium <120 mEq/L) do not fit the typical presentation of HHS. Ketonuria is minimal or absent in HHS, and the serum sodium is usually elevated or normal, not below 120 mEq/L. These features are more commonly associated with DKA.",

Insulin glargine (15 units subcutaneously at bedtime) has recently been started because of a hemoglobin A1C level of 8.4. Over the weekend, she develops nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after exposure to family members with a similar illness. Afraid of hypoglycemia, the patient omits the insulin for 3 nights. Over the next 24 hours, she develops lethargy and is brought to the emergency room. On examination, she is afebrile and unresponsive to verbal command. Blood pressure is 84/52. Skin turgor is poor and mucous membranes dry. Neurological examination is nonfocal; she does not have neck rigidity. Laboratory results are as follows: Na: 126 mEq/L K: 4.0 mEq/L Cl: 95 mEq/L HCO3 : 22 mEq/L Glucose: 1100 mg/dL BUN: 84 mg/dL Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s coma?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyperosmolar nonketotic state (HNS). This patient is presenting with severe hyperglycemia (glucose of 1100 mg/dL), dehydration (poor skin turgor, dry mucous membranes), and altered mental status (lethargy, unresponsiveness). These are all hallmark signs of hyperosmolar nonketotic state (HNS), which is a serious complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The lack of ketoacidosis (normal bicarbonate levels and absence of fruity breath odor) helps differentiate HNS from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). HNS is characterized by extremely high blood glucose levels, significant dehydration, and a hyperosmolar state, but without the significant ketosis or acidosis seen in DKA. The patient's poor oral intake, possibly exacerbated by vomiting and diarrhea, led to severe dehydration, worsening the hyperglycemia. Additionally, her recent omission of insulin contributes to the poor glucose control, leading to this hyperosmolar state. The elevated BUN and creatinine (indicating kidney dysfunction) also support this diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – Incorrect: DKA is another acute complication of diabetes, but it is characterized by ketoacidosis (low bicarbonate and elevated anion gap) and ketosis (often producing a fruity odor to the breath). This patient has no significant acidosis (normal bicarbonate), and the glucose level is extremely high, which would suggest HNS rather than DKA. Additionally, ketoacidosis is more commonly seen in type 1 diabetes and is less likely in type 2 diabetes unless there is significant illness or stress. C. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion – Incorrect: SIADH typically causes hyponatremia (low sodium levels), but it would not explain the extremely high glucose levels and the patient's altered mental status. SIADH usually leads to dilutional hyponatremia without the marked dehydration seen here. In SIADH, sodium levels are typically much lower, and there would be no significant dehydration or hyperglycemia. D. Bacterial meningitis – Incorrect: While bacterial meningitis can cause altered mental status, it typically presents with fever, neck stiffness, and a more acute onset of symptoms, none of which are present in this patient. The absence of fever, neck rigidity, and the chronic nature of her symptoms (not an acute illness) makes bacterial meningitis unlikely. Additionally, the severe hyperglycemia is not a typical feature of meningitis, which is more likely to present with a normal or mildly elevated glucose level.",
