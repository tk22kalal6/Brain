      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) By inhibiting IL-6. Sarilumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets and inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes. It works by binding to the IL-6 receptor, preventing IL-6 from binding and initiating downstream inflammatory signaling pathways. This mechanism is particularly effective in treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, where IL-6 plays a central role in inflammation and joint damage. By inhibiting IL-6, sarilumab helps reduce inflammation and disease activity in patients with inflammatory disorders. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) By blocking Tumor necrosis factor-Alpha: Blocking TNF-alpha is the mechanism of action of a different class of drugs, such as TNF inhibitors (e.g., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab). These drugs work by binding to TNF-alpha, preventing its interaction with its receptors, and thus reducing inflammation. Sarilumab, however, does not target TNF-alpha and instead focuses on IL-6 inhibition. B) By blocking IL-1: IL-1 inhibitors, such as anakinra, target and block the effects of interleukin-1, another cytokine involved in inflammation. IL-1 plays a role in various inflammatory conditions, but sarilumab does not target IL-1. Sarilumab specifically inhibits IL-6 signaling. D) By T-cell modulation: T-cell modulation refers to the alteration of T-cell activity, which is the target of drugs like abatacept and cyclosporine. These drugs act on the T-cell activation process to suppress immune responses. Sarilumab, on the other hand, does not modulate T-cells but inhibits IL-6 signaling, which plays a more direct role in inflammation rather than immune cell activation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Anti-Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) levels. Anti-CCP antibodies are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These antibodies target citrullinated proteins, which are often present in the joints of individuals with RA. The presence of Anti-CCP antibodies is highly specific for RA and is considered one of the best markers for diagnosing the condition. It is particularly useful in early-stage RA and helps to distinguish it from other forms of inflammatory arthritis. A positive Anti-CCP test strongly supports the diagnosis of RA, especially when the clinical presentation (morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling) is consistent with this condition. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) X-rays: X-rays are commonly used to assess the extent of joint damage and to look for erosions or joint space narrowing, which are characteristic of long-standing RA. However, X-rays are not sensitive or specific for early diagnosis of RA and cannot detect the disease in its early stages when joint damage has not yet occurred. Therefore, X-rays are not the most specific test for diagnosing RA in this patient. B) Rheumatoid factor levels (RAF): Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an antibody that is found in a subset of patients with RA. However, it is not specific to RA, as it can also be present in other autoimmune diseases (like Sjogren's syndrome, SLE) and in healthy individuals, particularly the elderly. While RF can be helpful in diagnosis, it is less specific than Anti-CCP and can sometimes be negative in early RA, especially in seronegative patients. D) C-Reactive Protein (CRP): CRP is an acute-phase reactant that is commonly elevated in inflammatory conditions like RA. While it can indicate active inflammation, it is not specific to RA. Elevated CRP levels can also be seen in many other inflammatory or infectious conditions. It is useful for monitoring disease activity and inflammation but is not specific for confirming a diagnosis of RA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) DIP. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the typical joint involvement at the onset of the disease primarily affects the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, and wrists, while the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are usually sparing in the early stages. The DIP joints are more commonly affected in osteoarthritis (OA) rather than RA, making them the joints least likely to be involved at the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) PIP: The PIP joints are commonly involved in rheumatoid arthritis. In fact, PIP joints are one of the typical sites of early symmetrical joint involvement in RA. The inflammation in these joints is often associated with significant pain, swelling, and stiffness, especially in the morning. C) MCP: The MCP joints (metacarpophalangeal joints) are also frequently involved in rheumatoid arthritis, especially in the early stages. These joints are typically symmetrically affected, with inflammation causing pain and swelling. The MCP joints are a hallmark of RA involvement. D) Wrists: The wrists are commonly involved in rheumatoid arthritis as well. In fact, the wrist joints are often one of the first joints to show signs of RA involvement. Inflammation in the wrists can contribute to decreased grip strength and pain during motion.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a type of inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, a skin condition that causes patches of red, scaly skin. The patient’s symptoms — including pain in the hands, brown discoloration of nails, and onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed) — are classic signs of psoriatic arthritis. In PsA, distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are often affected, which is consistent with the swelling and tenderness the patient is experiencing in his right hand. The characteristic nail changes, such as onycholysis and nail discoloration, are also common in PsA and can help confirm the diagnosis. PsA may present asymmetrically, with one hand more affected than the other, as seen in this case. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically involves proximal joints (e.g., MCP and PIP joints) and is characterized by symmetrical joint involvement. In contrast to PsA, RA is less likely to affect the DIP joints, which are specifically involved in psoriatic arthritis. The characteristic nail changes like onycholysis are also more specific to PsA and less commonly seen in RA. Additionally, RA is associated with morning stiffness and a more symmetrical pattern of joint pain, which is not mentioned in this case. B) Dermatomyositis: Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the skin and muscles. It is characterized by a rash (especially on the face, shoulders, and chest) and muscle weakness. While nail changes and joint pain may occasionally be present in dermatomyositis, the hallmark features of muscle weakness and characteristic heliotrope rash are absent in this patient. Dermatomyositis is not typically associated with the DIP joint involvement or nail changes described here. C) Reactive arthritis: Reactive arthritis is a form of arthritis that typically develops after an infection (e.g., gastrointestinal or urogenital). It usually involves large joints (e.g., knees, ankles) and is associated with other features like conjunctivitis and urethritis (part of the Reiter's syndrome). The DIP joint involvement and nail changes seen here are more characteristic of psoriatic arthritis. While reactive arthritis can cause joint pain and swelling, it does not typically lead to the same type of nail changes or affect the DIP joints in the same way.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) NSAIDS and regular follow-up. The patient’s symptoms and X-ray findings are most consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), particularly degenerative joint disease affecting the knees and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, which is common in the elderly. The classic features of OA include pain worse with activity, reduced joint space, subchondral sclerosis, and the presence of osteophytes (bone spurs). In such cases, the first-line treatment is NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) to reduce pain and inflammation, along with regular follow-up to monitor the progression of the disease and manage symptoms. OA is a chronic condition and management mainly focuses on symptom relief and improving function, rather than aggressive disease-modifying treatments. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Anti-TNF alpha therapy: Anti-TNF alpha therapy is used in the treatment of inflammatory arthropathies like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis, where autoimmune inflammation is the primary cause. In osteoarthritis (OA), which is a degenerative joint disease, anti-TNF therapy is not indicated. The condition does not involve the immune system in the way that autoimmune conditions do, so this therapy would not be appropriate. B) NSAIDS and urgent Orthopaedic opinion: While NSAIDs are a suitable option for pain relief in osteoarthritis (OA), an urgent orthopedic opinion is not required in this case unless the patient has acute joint damage or a need for surgical intervention, neither of which are indicated by the patient’s current presentation. The patient does not have signs of a more severe or acute joint issue that would require immediate surgical consultation. Regular follow-up is more appropriate for monitoring disease progression. D) DMARD therapy: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used in the treatment of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where they help modify the underlying disease process. In osteoarthritis (OA), there is no autoimmune component, and DMARDs are not effective. The treatment for OA primarily revolves around pain management and joint function improvement, making DMARDs inappropriate in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aspiration of the joint and blood cultures. The patient presents with acute onset of knee pain, fever, and swelling of the joint — these are concerning signs of septic arthritis, a serious infection in the joint. Aspiration of the joint is the most important next step to confirm the diagnosis. It allows for synovial fluid analysis, which can help identify the presence of infection (typically bacterial) through gram stain, culture, and white blood cell count. Blood cultures are also necessary to detect bacteremia, which is commonly associated with septic arthritis. Once the infection is confirmed, appropriate antibiotics can be administered, ideally after culture results are available. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Empirical Antibiotics: While empirical antibiotics are essential in the management of septic arthritis, they are usually started after joint aspiration and blood cultures are obtained. It is crucial to obtain samples for culture before initiating antibiotics, as this ensures accurate identification of the causative organism and helps guide targeted therapy. Starting antibiotics without proper diagnostic confirmation may interfere with the culture results. B) X-ray of Right Knee: An X-ray can help rule out joint damage or fracture, but it is not useful in diagnosing septic arthritis, as it may not show any abnormalities in the early stages of infection. While X-rays can be helpful in the longer-term management of joint conditions, in this case, the acute presentation and clinical signs (fever, swelling, warmth, pain) point more toward a joint infection. Therefore, the priority is joint aspiration to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. D) Referral for physiotherapy: Referral for physiotherapy is inappropriate at this stage. The patient is presenting with signs of an acute infection, and immediate attention should be focused on diagnosing and treating the infection. Physiotherapy is typically considered for rehabilitation after infection resolution or in the management of chronic joint conditions, but it is not suitable for the acute setting described here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reactive arthritis – Chlamydia. The patient's presentation of symmetric joint pain involving both knees, with a history of burning micturition and sterile urine cultures, is highly suggestive of reactive arthritis. This is a type of inflammatory arthritis that typically follows an infection of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract. In this case, the recent history of burning micturition (a common symptom of a urinary tract infection or urethritis) without a positive urine culture points towards a genitourinary infection that has triggered the reactive arthritis. The most common causative organism for reactive arthritis in women is Chlamydia trachomatis, a sexually transmitted bacterium. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Septic arthritis – E. Coli: Septic arthritis is a serious condition in which a joint becomes infected, usually with bacteria. While E. coli is a common pathogen causing septic arthritis, the patient’s presentation of symmetric joint involvement and a history of burning micturition without a positive urine culture makes septic arthritis less likely. Septic arthritis usually presents acutely with severe pain, swelling, and warmth in the affected joint, and is more commonly associated with a positive urine culture in the case of E. coli. In this patient, the clinical picture aligns more with reactive arthritis than septic arthritis. C) Rheumatoid arthritis – Mycoplasma: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by symmetric joint involvement, but it typically does not have an acute onset like this patient’s presentation. RA also does not usually follow an infectious trigger like burning micturition. Additionally, Mycoplasma is not a common causative organism for RA, and the patient’s history is more indicative of reactive arthritis following a recent infection. RA involves a longer course and is associated with other specific findings, such as rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, which are not mentioned in this case. D) Enteropathic arthritis – E. coli: Enteropathic arthritis is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, and can be triggered by gastrointestinal infections. While E. coli can be involved in enteric infections, this patient’s symptoms do not suggest a recent gastrointestinal illness or a diagnosis of IBD. Additionally, the patient’s joint involvement is symmetric, which is more characteristic of reactive arthritis than of enteropathic arthritis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is an IgG type of antibody. Rheumatoid factor (RF) is actually an IgM type antibody, which targets the Fc portion of IgG antibodies. IgM rheumatoid factor is the most commonly detected form in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. It is not an IgG antibody as described in option B. Therefore, this statement is incorrect and is the correct answer to this question. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Titers of RA factor are associated with bad prognosis: Higher titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) are indeed associated with a more severe course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Elevated RF levels, particularly at high titers, can indicate more aggressive disease, joint damage, and higher likelihood of developing extra-articular manifestations (such as nodules and vasculitis). Therefore, this statement is true and supports the association between RF levels and prognosis in RA. C) It is the most common in rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is the most common serologic marker in rheumatoid arthritis. It is found in about 70-80% of patients with RA. The presence of RF is one of the key diagnostic criteria for RA, although it is not exclusive to the disease, as it can be found in other conditions as well. This statement is true and reflects the importance of RF in RA diagnosis. D) It is non-specific for the diagnosis of RA: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is non-specific for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because it can be found in various other conditions such as chronic infections, hepatitis, autoimmune diseases (like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)), and even in healthy elderly individuals. Hence, while RF is common in RA, its presence alone is not diagnostic. This statement is true, emphasizing the non-specific nature of RF for RA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Keratoderma blennorrhagicum. The patient has symptoms that suggest reactive arthritis (ReA), which commonly follows a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection (such as the burning micturition and urethral discharge the patient experienced). The skin lesions associated with reactive arthritis include keratoderma blennorrhagicum, a characteristic rash that typically appears as scaly, erythematous plaques on the palms and soles, and sometimes on other areas of the body. It is strongly associated with reactive arthritis, especially in the context of urethritis and conjunctivitis (as seen in this patient). Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Onycholysis: Onycholysis, which is the detachment of the nail from the nail bed, can occur in various conditions, including psoriasis, fungal infections, and trauma, but it is not the typical skin lesion associated with reactive arthritis. Although onycholysis can occur in reactive arthritis, it is not the most probable skin manifestation based on the clinical presentation of this patient. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B) Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers that can occur in association with various systemic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatic diseases. However, it is not typical of reactive arthritis. The patient's presentation is more consistent with keratoderma blennorrhagicum than pyoderma gangrenosum, so this option is incorrect. D) Erythema nodosum: Erythema nodosum consists of tender, red nodules, usually found on the shins, and can be associated with infections, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune disorders. However, it is not typically associated with reactive arthritis, and the patient’s presentation (joint pain, urethritis, conjunctivitis) is more suggestive of keratoderma blennorrhagicum.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This patient's presentation of pain in her hands and feet, particularly involving the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, along with morning stiffness that improves with activity, strongly points to Rheumatoid arthritis. RA is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects synovial joints, especially in the hands and feet. The positive Anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies and elevated ESR and CRP further support this diagnosis, as these are characteristic markers of inflammatory arthritis. The right-sided pleural effusion seen on the chest x-ray may also be associated with RA, which can lead to pleural involvement or even rheumatoid lung disease. The chronic pain, joint stiffness, and positive lab results make RA the most likely diagnosis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Pulmonary TB: Although pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) can cause pleural effusion and might present with systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss, it does not typically cause the type of joint pain or morning stiffness seen in this patient. The positive Anti-CCP antibodies and the absence of respiratory symptoms make pulmonary TB unlikely in this case. TB may also cause a granulomatous reaction in the lungs, which is not consistent with the joint findings here. C) SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus): SLE is an autoimmune disease that can cause arthritis and pleural effusion, but it typically affects the small joints (like the fingers and wrists) in a non-erosive manner. It is often associated with malar rash, photosensitivity, and other systemic symptoms like renal involvement and positive ANA (antinuclear antibody). The positive Anti-CCP and the specific morning stiffness and joint involvement point more toward RA than SLE. Furthermore, SLE is typically associated with lower ESR and CRP levels than those seen in this case. D) Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that can involve the lungs, skin, and joints. It typically presents with non-caseating granulomas, and the most common symptom is lung involvement. While sarcoidosis can cause arthritis, it usually affects the ankles and knees and is not typically associated with the specific pattern of joint stiffness and morning pain seen in RA. The patient's positive Anti-CCP and elevated inflammatory markers also make sarcoidosis less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Low glucose level. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pleural effusion can occur due to rheumatoid pleuritis, which is a complication of RA. The pleural fluid in these cases typically has low glucose levels. This occurs because of the inflammation caused by the rheumatoid process itself, which leads to a decrease in glucose within the pleural fluid. This finding is considered characteristic of rheumatoid pleuritis, and it helps differentiate this type of effusion from other causes, such as infections or malignancy. The low glucose level in pleural effusion is indicative of chronic inflammation and cellular activity in the pleural space, which is common in autoimmune diseases like RA. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) High white blood cell (WBC) count: In rheumatoid pleural effusion, the WBC count is usually moderate and typically low to normal compared to infectious pleural effusions, where a high WBC count would be more common. The pleural fluid in RA-related effusions is often low in cells, and the WBC count generally does not exceed 1,000-2,000 cells/?L. Thus, a high WBC count would be more suggestive of an infectious process rather than rheumatoid pleuritis. C) High protein level: While rheumatoid pleural effusion may have elevated protein levels, it is not unique to RA. A high protein level in pleural fluid can also be seen in other types of exudative effusions, including those caused by infections, malignancies, or other inflammatory conditions. The unique feature of rheumatoid pleural effusion is the low glucose level, not a high protein level. D) Negative Gram stain: While negative Gram stains are commonly seen in pleural effusions due to non-infectious causes, this is not unique to rheumatoid pleuritis. Many non-infectious pleural effusions, including those due to malignancy or autoimmune diseases, can have a negative Gram stain. While the Gram stain would indeed be negative in a patient with RA-related effusion, it is not exclusive to this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Leflunomide. In this case, the patient has developed complications from methotrexate therapy, including elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, and pulmonary fibrosis. Leflunomide is an alternative disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that can be used in patients who have methotrexate intolerance or toxicity, as seen here. Leflunomide is generally preferred because it is well-tolerated and effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis. It works by inhibiting the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, which is important for the proliferation of activated lymphocytes, a key component in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis. Importantly, leflunomide does not have the same pulmonary or hepatic toxicity as methotrexate, making it a safer option in this patient who has developed pulmonary fibrosis and liver enzyme abnormalities due to methotrexate. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Gold salts: Gold salts, such as aurothiomalate, were historically used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but have fallen out of favor due to significant side effects, including renal toxicity and hematologic issues. In this patient, who has developed low hemoglobin and liver complications with methotrexate, the use of gold salts would not be ideal due to the potential for further toxicity and poor tolerability. Gold salts also do not have the same efficacy or safety profile as modern DMARDs like leflunomide. C) Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent used in conditions like organ transplant rejection or autoimmune diseases like psoriasis or uveitis. It is not typically used as a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Cyclosporine can have nephrotoxic effects, which would make it an unsuitable choice for this patient, who already has issues with liver and pulmonary complications. Additionally, cyclosporine is not as effective in managing the inflammatory processes of rheumatoid arthritis compared to other agents like methotrexate or leflunomide. D) Penicillamine: Penicillamine is another DMARD used in rheumatoid arthritis, but it is associated with several serious adverse effects, including renal toxicity, dermatologic reactions, and hematologic abnormalities (e.g., thrombocytopenia and leukopenia). Given the patient's existing problems with elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, and fibrotic lung changes, the use of penicillamine would not be advisable due to its potential to worsen these complications. It is also less commonly used in modern practice due to its side-effect profile.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. In this case, the patient is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is pregnant (in her 3rd month). The treatment for RA in pregnancy should be carefully selected to avoid harm to both the mother and the developing fetus. Sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine are both considered safe and effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy. Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory and DMARD that has been shown to be safe during pregnancy. It is commonly used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Hydroxychloroquine, which is also commonly used in autoimmune diseases like lupus, is safe in pregnancy and does not pose a risk to the fetus. It helps to control joint inflammation and prevent damage in rheumatoid arthritis. These medications are preferred because they do not carry the same teratogenic risks associated with other RA treatments. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors such as etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab are commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis but are generally contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. TNF inhibitors can cross the placenta and may cause immunosuppressive effects on the fetus. The use of these agents in pregnancy is not recommended unless absolutely necessary and under strict medical supervision. Therefore, TNF inhibitors should be avoided in this pregnant patient. C) Minocycline: Minocycline is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties and is sometimes used for rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is not a first-line therapy for RA, especially during pregnancy. Tetracyclines, like minocycline, are generally contraindicated in pregnancy because they can affect fetal development, particularly bone growth and tooth discoloration. Minocycline would not be an appropriate choice for this patient. D) Leflunomide: Leflunomide is a DMARD used for rheumatoid arthritis, but it is contraindicated during pregnancy. It can cause severe birth defects and is classified as a Category X drug for pregnancy, meaning it should be avoided due to its teratogenic effects. Women who are planning to become pregnant or who are already pregnant should not be treated with leflunomide.",

Adalimumab (a TNF inhibitor) and etanercept (another TNF inhibitor) are first-line biologics for patients with moderate to severe RA who have not responded adequately to traditional DMARDs like methotrexate. TNF inhibitors are known to reduce inflammation, prevent joint damage, and improve physical function in RA. They work by blocking the action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key mediator in the inflammatory process of RA. Both of these medications have a well-established track record of safety and effectiveness in treating RA and are commonly used after methotrexate has failed to control disease activity. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Rituximab: Rituximab is a B-cell depleting agent used in RA, especially in patients with severe RA who have not responded to TNF inhibitors or other biologics. However, rituximab is generally considered second-line after TNF inhibitors. Since TNF inhibitors are well-established and effective in most cases, they would be preferred before trying rituximab in this patient, unless there are specific contraindications to TNF inhibitors. C) Abatacept: Abatacept is a T-cell co-stimulation inhibitor that is used in moderate to severe RA that is not responding to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. However, like rituximab, it is typically used after TNF inhibitors or when TNF inhibitors are not suitable. Abatacept can be considered if the patient does not respond to or cannot tolerate TNF inhibitors, but it would not be the first biologic added in this case. D) Tocilizumab: Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist that is used in RA when other biologics are ineffective. While it is effective, it is usually reserved for cases where TNF inhibitors and other biologics like rituximab or abatacept have not been successful. Tocilizumab would not be the first-line biologic added in this patient after methotrexate failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Loss of articular cartilage and bone erosion. This patient's symptoms—fatigue, morning stiffness, painful swelling of both hands, and low-grade fever—are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune inflammatory condition that primarily affects the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. In RA, the x-ray findings are typically destructive and include: Loss of articular cartilage, which occurs due to inflammation of the synovial membrane leading to cartilage breakdown. Bone erosion, which is seen at the joint margins where the synovium invades and degrades the bone. This is a hallmark of RA. These findings are a result of the inflammatory process associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and can be seen on plain x-rays in later stages of the disease. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Normal: A normal x-ray is not characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially in a patient with a prolonged history of symptoms like morning stiffness, joint swelling, and tenderness. RA usually shows radiologic changes, particularly bone erosions and cartilage loss in the affected joints. A normal x-ray would be more consistent with other conditions such as osteoarthritis in its early stages. C) Osteolytic changes: Osteolytic changes (areas of bone resorption or destruction) are typically seen in conditions like multiple myeloma or infectious arthritis. While bone erosion is a common finding in RA, the term osteolytic changes is more specific to conditions involving a direct destruction of bone tissue by mechanisms other than the synovial inflammation seen in RA. D) Osteosclerotic changes: Osteosclerotic changes (increased bone density or hardening) are generally seen in conditions like Paget's disease or metastatic bone disease, not in rheumatoid arthritis. RA typically leads to bone loss due to erosion and destruction of the joint structures, not increased bone density or sclerosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) RA Factor. The Rheumatoid Factor (RA factor) is an autoantibody that is commonly present in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly in patients who have more severe disease. The presence of RA factor is a predictor of extraarticular manifestations in RA, such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, lung disease, and eye involvement. In general, the higher the level of RA factor, the more likely a patient is to develop these extraarticular complications. Since this patient presents with rheumatoid nodules (a typical extraarticular feature), the presence of RA factor increases the likelihood of further extraarticular involvement. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Early Knee Joint Involvement: Early joint involvement, including the knee, is not a strong predictor of extraarticular features. While joint involvement in RA is common, the early involvement of large joints like the knee does not correlate as directly with the likelihood of developing extraarticular manifestations. Extraarticular manifestations are more closely associated with serologic markers like RA factor. B) Poor Articular Response To Disease-Suppressing Medication: A poor articular response to treatment indicates disease severity and can be associated with worse overall outcomes, including potential extraarticular features. However, this is a later indicator of disease progression rather than a predictor at the time of diagnosis. The RA factor remains a more reliable predictor in the early stages. C) Morning Stiffness: Morning stiffness is a common symptom of rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not specific for the development of extraarticular features. Morning stiffness is more of a general indicator of inflammatory activity in the joints rather than a predictive factor for extraarticular manifestations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Exudate protein and LDH ratios with low glucose. This patient presents with painful joint swelling, pleuritic chest pain, and a straw-colored pleural effusion, all of which are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its associated complications. The pleural effusion in RA is typically an exudate, characterized by increased levels of protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the pleural fluid. Additionally, low glucose levels are a hallmark of RA-related pleural effusions due to the high metabolic activity of inflammatory cells and immune complexes present in the pleural space. Low pleural fluid glucose (<60 mg/dL) occurs due to the consumption of glucose by inflammatory cells and cytokines, which is characteristic of effusions caused by RA. This biochemical pattern distinguishes RA-related effusions from other causes. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Exudate protein and LDH ratios with high glucose: While RA-associated pleural effusions are exudative, they typically have low glucose levels, not high glucose levels. High glucose levels are more characteristic of other exudative effusions, such as those caused by infections with low cellular activity or certain malignancies. C) Transudate protein and LDH ratios with high glucose: RA-related pleural effusions are exudative, not transudative. A transudative effusion results from systemic factors like heart failure or hypoalbuminemia, leading to imbalances in hydrostatic or oncotic pressures. These effusions typically have low protein and LDH levels, and the glucose is usually normal or high. This does not match the clinical scenario or pathophysiology of RA. D) Transudate protein and LDH ratios with low glucose: While low glucose might be present, transudative effusions are not typical of RA. The hallmark of RA pleural effusion is its exudative nature, driven by local inflammation and immune activity, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Interstitial fibrosis. This 67-year-old patient with long-standing symmetrical small joint arthritis and positive RA factor and anti-CCP antibodies is most likely suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can be associated with pulmonary manifestations, one of the most common being interstitial lung disease (ILD). ILD is a type of pulmonary fibrosis that leads to scarring of the lung tissue. The characteristic features of ILD in RA include: Shortness of breath on exertion: This is a typical symptom of interstitial fibrosis, as the scarring in the lungs impairs oxygen exchange. Dry cough: Another common symptom associated with ILD. Bibasilar crackles: The fine crackles heard on auscultation are a classic sign of interstitial lung disease and are often heard in RA-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Loud P2: This suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension, which can occur as a complication of ILD. The patient's history of RA and positive serology for RA factor and anti-CCP further supports the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-associated pulmonary disease, which often manifests as interstitial fibrosis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Pleuritis: Pleuritis (inflammation of the pleura) can indeed occur in RA, but it typically causes sharp chest pain, especially with deep breathing or coughing, which is not described in this patient's presentation. Pleuritis can also cause pleuritic rubs on examination, but this patient has no chest pain and no rubs. Additionally, pleuritis would not explain the dry cough and bibasilar crackles seen here, making it an unlikely diagnosis. B) Cavitating lesions: Cavitating lesions in the lungs are often associated with infections (e.g., tuberculosis, fungal infections) or rheumatoid nodules in the lung, but these are less common compared to interstitial lung disease in RA. The patient’s symptoms are more consistent with the fibrotic changes seen in RA-associated ILD, rather than cavitating lesions. Furthermore, cavitating lesions typically present with productive cough and sputum production, which this patient does not have. C) Intrapulmonary nodules: Intrapulmonary rheumatoid nodules can occur in RA and are typically seen on imaging, but they usually present as firm, round masses in the lungs and often do not cause the progressive dyspnea or fine crackles observed in this case. Rheumatoid nodules can also be asymptomatic or cause localized lung issues, but they would not explain the bibasilar crackles and other signs of pulmonary fibrosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Psoriatic arthritis. This patient presents with chronic papulosquamous skin lesions, particularly involving his knees and elbows, which is a typical feature of psoriasis. The dull low back pain and morning stiffness that lasts a few hours, along with reduced forward flexion at the lumbar spine, suggest a spondyloarthropathy. The involvement of sacroiliac joints with stress tenderness is a common feature of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which is one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. The family history of a similar condition in the patient's father further supports the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, as there is a known genetic predisposition to PsA. PsA can present with both psoriasis (skin involvement) and arthritis (sacroiliitis, peripheral joint inflammation), making this diagnosis the most likely. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition that typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, most often affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, with morning stiffness lasting more than an hour. RA does not typically involve the sacroiliac joints or present with skin lesions like those seen in this patient. The chronic papulosquamous rash and the family history point away from RA, making it an unlikely diagnosis. B) Ankylosing spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is another spondyloarthropathy that often presents with low back pain, morning stiffness, and sacroiliac joint tenderness. However, it typically does not present with psoriasis or skin lesions. Additionally, the presence of skin lesions (particularly psoriasis on the knees and elbows) makes ankylosing spondylitis less likely in this case. D) Reactive arthritis: Reactive arthritis is a spondyloarthropathy that typically occurs after an infection (such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections), and it often presents with the classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis (Reiter's syndrome). Although sacroiliitis can occur in reactive arthritis, it is not typically associated with psoriasis or papulosquamous lesions on the elbows and knees. Given the patient's lack of any recent infection and the presence of psoriasis, reactive arthritis is less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Is positive in 10–20% of people over age 65. The Rheumatoid Factor (RF) is an antibody that is often present in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but it can also be found in other conditions and even in healthy individuals, especially as they age. In people over the age of 65, it is not uncommon to have a low-titer positive RF without having any clinical symptoms of RA or other autoimmune diseases. The prevalence of positive RF increases with age, with around 10-20% of individuals over age 65 having a positive test result. This makes RF not specific to RA, and a low-titer positive RF in an elderly patient without symptoms of active disease does not necessarily indicate RA. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Is positive in almost 100% of classical RA: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is not present in all cases of classical RA. Approximately 70-80% of people with RA will test positive for RF, so it is not positive in 100% of cases. Additionally, a negative RF does not rule out RA, as other markers (such as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, ACPA) may be present instead. Thus, RF is not a universal marker for RA. C) Is seen only in RA: Rheumatoid factor is not exclusive to RA. While it is commonly found in RA, RF can also be present in a variety of other autoimmune diseases (such as Sjögren’s syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus), chronic infections, and even in healthy individuals, particularly in older age. Therefore, it is not specific to RA and can be found in several other conditions. D) Is always abnormal: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is not always abnormal. Many patients with RA will have a positive RF, but it is not universally present. Additionally, RF can be positive in the general population without any underlying disease, especially in older individuals. Therefore, it is not \"always abnormal\" and must be interpreted in the context of symptoms, other clinical findings, and other diagnostic tests.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Absence of morning stiffness makes RA an unlikely cause of articular symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically presents with morning stiffness that lasts for at least 30 minutes and can sometimes last longer, which is a key feature in the diagnosis of RA. This stiffness is due to inflammation in the joints and tends to be bilateral and symmetric. In the case of the patient, the morning stiffness of the hand joints supports the diagnosis of RA. The absence of morning stiffness would be atypical for RA, making it an unlikely cause of articular symptoms if it were not present. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Wrists are rarely involved: This statement is incorrect because wrists are commonly involved in rheumatoid arthritis. RA typically affects the small joints of the hands and wrists in a symmetrical fashion. The involvement of the wrists is one of the hallmark features of RA, and it is not rare. B) Involvement of hands is characteristically asymmetric: This statement is incorrect because in rheumatoid arthritis, the involvement of the hands is typically symmetric. RA affects both sides of the body in a mirrored pattern, particularly the MCP joints and the PIP joints in the hands. Asymmetric joint involvement would be more characteristic of other conditions like osteoarthritis or psoriatic arthritis. C) Fever up to 104°F is common with joint involvement: While fever can be present in the early stages of RA, fever of 104°F is not typical. In most cases, RA causes a low-grade fever due to systemic inflammation, but high fevers of 104°F are more commonly associated with infection or other inflammatory diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatic fever, rather than rheumatoid arthritis itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Disease of the entire joint. This patient’s symptoms are indicative of osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease primarily affecting the articular cartilage but also involving the subchondral bone, synovial membrane, ligaments, and soft tissues around the joint. The gradual onset of joint pain, which worsens with activity and improves with rest, along with crepitus (a crunching sound in the knee with flexion), and the bony swelling of the DIP joints (distal interphalangeal joints) suggest that OA is the most likely diagnosis. OA is a condition that affects the entire joint, not just one part of it. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Disease of the synovial membrane: This description is more typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other inflammatory arthropathies where the synovial membrane becomes inflamed and thickened. In OA, the synovium may be involved secondarily, but the primary pathology is the degeneration of articular cartilage and subsequent changes in the entire joint structure, not just the synovium. B) Disease of the articular cartilage: While articular cartilage degeneration is a key feature of osteoarthritis, OA affects the entire joint. The disease process involves not only cartilage loss but also changes in the subchondral bone, synovium, ligaments, and joint capsule. So, it’s more accurate to describe OA as a disease of the entire joint, rather than being limited to the cartilage alone. D) Disease of the subchondral bone: Although subchondral bone changes, such as sclerosis or cyst formation, are common in OA, they are not the sole feature. The entire joint is involved, including the cartilage, synovium, and surrounding structures. Thus, it would be incorrect to solely attribute OA to changes in the subchondral bone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Activated T cells. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the synovial joints, especially the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, as seen in this patient. The inflammation in RA is driven by an immune response, particularly involving activated T cells, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. T cells are activated in the synovium (lining of the joints), where they release inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which recruit and activate other inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils. This leads to synovial hyperplasia (proliferation of the synovial lining) and inflammatory infiltrates, causing joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, which are hallmark symptoms of RA. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Antineutrophil antibodies: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with vasculitis and certain systemic inflammatory conditions like granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis) or Churg-Strauss syndrome, not with rheumatoid arthritis. In RA, the primary inflammatory mediators are T cells and autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), rather than antibodies targeting neutrophils. C) Microvascular injury: Microvascular injury can occur in certain diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or scleroderma, but it is not a primary cause of joint inflammation in RA. In RA, joint inflammation is primarily caused by immune-mediated mechanisms involving T cells and inflammatory cytokines, rather than direct damage to small blood vessels. D) Interleukin-4 (IL-4): Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly promoting the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and the production of IgE, which is crucial in allergic responses. While IL-4 may play some role in autoimmune diseases, IL-4 is not the primary mediator of inflammation in RA. Instead, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 are more directly involved in the inflammatory process in RA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Methotrexate. Methotrexate is the first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This medication has been proven to prevent disease progression, reduce joint damage, and improve symptoms in patients with active RA. Methotrexate works by suppressing the immune system, particularly targeting the proliferation of T cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α. This immunosuppressive effect helps reduce the chronic inflammation in the joints and slows the progression of joint erosions, as seen in this patient's early erosive joint changes on x-rays. The presence of positive rheumatoid factor (RA factor) and morning stiffness suggests active RA, and methotrexate is indicated in this context to manage the disease effectively. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) D-penicillamine: D-penicillamine is a chelation agent sometimes used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Wilson's disease, but it is not considered a first-line therapy for RA. While it has some immunomodulatory effects, it is not as effective as methotrexate in preventing disease progression and reducing joint damage. It is typically reserved for patients who are intolerant to or do not respond well to other treatments. B) Antimalarial: Antimalarial drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, are sometimes used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, particularly lupus or rheumatoid arthritis with mild symptoms or skin involvement. However, they are not considered as effective as methotrexate for preventing joint erosions or halting the progression of disease in RA. Antimalarials are more useful in milder cases or in patients with seronegative RA (those without RA factor or anti-CCP antibodies). D) NSAID: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation in RA. They can provide symptom relief but do not address the underlying disease or prevent joint damage. NSAIDs do not modify the course of RA or prevent the progression of joint erosions. They are primarily used for symptomatic relief but do not slow disease progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) DIP joints of hand. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and typically affects joints that bear weight or are used repetitively. While OA can affect multiple joints, the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the hands are the most commonly involved locations. This is due to the mechanical stress exerted on these small joints over time. The hallmark feature of OA in the DIP joints is the development of Heberden's nodes, which are bony enlargements of the joint. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Hip: The hip is a common site for OA, especially in older individuals, as it is a weight-bearing joint. However, it is not as frequently affected as the DIP joints of the hand. Hip involvement is typically seen in advanced cases or in individuals with significant mechanical stress or structural abnormalities in the hip joint. B) Base of thumb (Carpometacarpal joint): The base of the thumb, specifically the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, is a common location for OA, particularly in women. However, like the hip, it is not the most frequently affected joint overall when compared to the DIP joints of the hands. C) Knee: The knee is another common site for OA due to its role as a weight-bearing joint. Obesity, as seen in this patient, further increases the mechanical load on the knees, making them prone to degenerative changes. However, the DIP joints are still more commonly involved overall.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition. This patient’s presentation of a hot, red, painful knee joint, combined with his history of hemochromatosis, strongly suggests calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), commonly known as pseudogout. CPPD frequently affects large joints such as the knee and is commonly associated with underlying conditions like hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, or hypothyroidism. Synovial fluid analysis in CPPD typically reveals positively birefringent, rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystals under polarized light microscopy. The presence of hepatomegaly and his history of hemochromatosis further supports this diagnosis, as hemochromatosis is a known risk factor for CPPD. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Staphylococcal infection: While staphylococcal septic arthritis can cause a similar presentation with acute monoarticular joint pain, swelling, and erythema, the absence of fever, systemic signs of infection, or a history of risk factors like recent surgery, trauma, or bacteremia makes this less likely. Synovial fluid in septic arthritis would reveal purulent fluid with a high WBC count and positive Gram stain/culture for bacteria. B) Gonococcal infection: Gonococcal arthritis typically affects sexually active younger individuals and is associated with disseminated gonococcal infection. Symptoms often include migratory polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis rather than isolated monoarthritis. Synovial fluid analysis would show bacteria or a positive culture, but this diagnosis does not fit the clinical context of a middle-aged man with hemochromatosis. C) Calcium hydroxyapatite crystals: Hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD) can cause joint pain and inflammation, but it is more commonly associated with periarticular structures like tendons rather than intra-articular inflammation. Synovial fluid in HADD typically lacks birefringent crystals visible on polarized light microscopy, making it a less likely cause of the acute symptoms described here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is the most likely diagnosis in this case due to the following features: Hot, swollen, and red knee: These symptoms strongly suggest inflammation, with infection being a primary concern. Joint fluid findings: The opaque yellow-colored synovial fluid with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 100,000/µL (predominantly neutrophils), high protein, and low glucose is highly suggestive of bacterial infection. In septic arthritis, synovial glucose is low because bacteria and inflammatory cells consume it. Risk factors: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predisposes patients to septic arthritis because of pre-existing joint damage, immune dysregulation, and immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate). Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical, as untreated septic arthritis can lead to irreversible joint damage and systemic sepsis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Uric acid deposition: Uric acid crystals are seen in gout, which can cause acute monoarthritis. However, gout typically involves the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe) and less commonly affects large joints like the knee. Joint fluid in gout shows needle-shaped, negatively birefringent urate crystals under polarized light microscopy, not the described findings (high neutrophils and low glucose). B) CPPD deposition: Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout) can cause acute monoarthritis, particularly in large joints like the knee. However, synovial fluid in pseudogout shows rhomboid-shaped, weakly positive birefringent crystals under polarized light microscopy. Additionally, while inflammation is seen, the WBC count in pseudogout is typically 15,000–30,000/µL, much lower than the 100,000/µL seen here. D) Calcium hydroxyapatite deposition: Calcium hydroxyapatite crystal disease can cause joint inflammation, but it more commonly presents as chronic periarticular calcification or a milder inflammatory arthritis. These crystals are not visible under regular light microscopy and do not typically result in such a high synovial fluid WBC count or low glucose levels.",
