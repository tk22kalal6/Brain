      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Embolic stroke An embolic stroke occurs when a clot or other debris forms elsewhere in the body—commonly from the heart in patients with atrial fibrillation—and is transported to the brain, where it obstructs a blood vessel. In this case, the 26-year-old male has rheumatic heart disease with atrial fibrillation, which is a known risk factor for the formation of emboli that can travel to the brain, leading to ischemic stroke. The acute onset of left-sided weakness that resolves within 20 hours suggests a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a mild embolic stroke, and the CT scan showing ischemic changes in the right internal capsule supports the diagnosis of an embolic event. Embolic strokes are often caused by clots originating from the heart and can affect the brain rapidly. Incorrect Answers: B. Thrombotic stroke A thrombotic stroke typically occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the brain's arteries, usually due to atherosclerosis or narrowing of the arteries. While thrombotic strokes can cause ischemia, they tend to develop more gradually and are often associated with longer-term symptoms (e.g., over several hours to days), rather than the acute onset and rapid recovery seen in this case. The absence of predisposing risk factors for thrombotic stroke (such as atherosclerosis) makes this less likely. C. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction due to a temporary blockage in blood flow to the brain. The symptoms resolve completely within 24 hours, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. However, TIAs typically do not show clear ischemic changes on a CT scan (which is evident in this case). The presence of ischemic changes in the right internal capsule on CT suggests a completed ischemic event, making TIA less likely and favoring embolic stroke. D. Hemorrhagic stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs due to bleeding in the brain, often resulting from an aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or high blood pressure. Hemorrhagic strokes usually present with severe headache, vomiting, and neurological deficits. In this case, the CT scan showing ischemic changes rather than hemorrhage makes a hemorrhagic stroke unlikely. Additionally, the recovery of symptoms within 20 hours further supports the idea of a transient ischemic event rather than a hemorrhagic stroke.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 1 hour. Correct Answer (A): 1 hour When cerebral blood flow (CBF) falls below 16 to 18 ml/100g/min, it results in significant ischemia of the brain tissue, which can lead to brain infarction. Brain cells, particularly neurons, are highly sensitive to changes in blood supply, and at this level of reduced blood flow, irreversible damage can occur. Studies have shown that within approximately 1 hour of sustained low cerebral perfusion, ischemic injury begins to occur, potentially leading to infarction if the blood flow is not restored. The critical threshold for the brain's survival in this state is very low, which is why rapid intervention is crucial to prevent infarction. Incorrect Answers: B. 2 hours While a fall in cerebral blood flow below the critical threshold for 2 hours would almost certainly result in infarction, the onset of brain infarction begins much earlier than 2 hours after severe ischemia. Brain cells are vulnerable to ischemic injury within the first hour, so the process of infarction typically starts earlier than 2 hours. This makes 2 hours too long for the onset of infarction to begin. C. 4 to 10 minutes While 4 to 10 minutes may be the time window in which brain cells begin to become severely compromised by lack of oxygen or glucose, infarction doesn't typically begin to develop within such a short time frame. Cerebral blood flow must be critically low for a sustained period (usually at least 1 hour) for infarction to occur, making this answer too short a time span to lead to brain infarction. D. 1 minute 1 minute is far too short for brain infarction to occur. While cerebral blood flow may be temporarily reduced for short periods, as in the case of brief interruptions or transient ischemia, infarction requires a much more sustained decrease in flow. Even with significant reductions in flow, the brain can tolerate short periods of reduced blood flow (a minute) without irreversible damage occurring.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Posterior transcortical aphasia. Posterior transcortical aphasia is a type of non-fluent aphasia characterized by impaired comprehension and naming, but normal repetition and fluency. This condition occurs due to damage to the posterior portion of the brain, specifically the language comprehension centers, while the repetition abilities remain intact because the arcuate fasciculus is typically unaffected. Patients may have difficulty understanding speech or naming objects (which are key characteristics of aphasia), but they can still repeat words and sentences effortlessly. This aphasia is usually linked to damage to the posterior language areas. Incorrect Answers: A. Anterior transcortical aphasia Anterior transcortical aphasia presents with impaired fluency (e.g., difficulty in producing speech) but preserved comprehension and repetition. It is often due to damage to the anterior regions of the language network, typically involving the Broca's area. In this type, patients can repeat words or phrases but have trouble forming speech or expressing themselves spontaneously, which is not consistent with the symptoms described in the question (normal fluency and repetition). C. Isolation aphasia Isolation aphasia is a term sometimes used to refer to a severe form of aphasia where there is a marked inability to comprehend, produce speech, or engage in meaningful conversation, often due to widespread brain damage affecting multiple areas involved in language processing. It does not fit the description of having impaired comprehension and naming with normal repetition and fluency. This would be a much more profound and generalized aphasia than what is described in the question.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) SAH (Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) The presentation described in the question—sudden onset of severe headache, unresponsiveness, high blood pressure (180/110), irregular respirations with Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and agitation—is strongly suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH is often caused by the rupture of an aneurysm and results in a sudden, severe headache often described as \"the worst headache of my life.\" This can be followed by signs of increased intracranial pressure, including irregular breathing patterns such as Cheyne-Stokes respiration, altered consciousness, and agitation. Elevated blood pressure can also be a compensatory mechanism due to increased intracranial pressure. The combination of these symptoms points strongly toward SAH as the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: B. ICH (Intracerebral Hemorrhage) Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) typically presents with sudden neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis or aphasia, rather than the severe headache that is more characteristic of SAH. Additionally, ICH can also cause altered consciousness and hypertension, but it would not cause the typical thunderclap headache seen in SAH. While ICH can also cause a sudden decline in the neurological status, the history of severe headache preceding the deterioration leans more toward SAH. C. SDH (Subdural Hematoma) A subdural hematoma (SDH) typically results from trauma (even minor), leading to gradual onset of symptoms over days or weeks. It is more common in elderly patients or those with coagulopathies, and although it can cause headache and altered consciousness, it is not usually associated with sudden onset of severe headache as in SAH. The rapid progression of symptoms, including severe headache, high blood pressure, and irregular respiration, makes SDH less likely. D. TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) presents with focal neurological deficits such as weakness or speech difficulties that typically resolve completely within 24 hours, usually within minutes to hours. While a TIA can cause confusion or agitation, it does not present with the sudden, severe headache and Cheyne-Stokes breathing observed in this patient. The absence of a focal neurological deficit and the severity of the headache make TIA unlikely in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Posterior Communicating Artery Aneurysm with SAH A posterior communicating artery aneurysm is a common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The typical presentation of SAH includes sudden, severe, and \"bursting\" headache, which is often described as the \"worst headache of my life.\" The neck stiffness and restlessness are indicative of meningeal irritation, which occurs when blood spills into the subarachnoid space. The drooping of the right eyelid (ptosis) is a sign of oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) palsy, which is a known complication of posterior communicating artery aneurysms because the aneurysm can compress the oculomotor nerve. The combination of these symptoms (severe headache, neck stiffness, ptosis, and restlessness) points strongly to a posterior communicating artery aneurysm with SAH as the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Cerebral Embolism A cerebral embolism generally leads to a sudden onset of focal neurological deficits, such as weakness, sensory loss, or speech difficulties, rather than the \"bursting\" headache typical of SAH. Embolism would not usually cause neck stiffness or ptosis. While it can cause a stroke-like presentation, it does not match the pattern of severe headache with meningeal signs and cranial nerve involvement observed in this case. C. Anterior Communicating Artery Aneurysm with SAH An anterior communicating artery aneurysm with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can indeed cause a severe headache, but it is more commonly associated with visual field deficits (such as bitemporal hemianopia) or frontal lobe signs due to its location near the optic chiasm. While it can cause SAH, it is less likely to cause ptosis (which is more characteristic of posterior communicating artery aneurysms), and neck stiffness would typically be a secondary sign of hemorrhage rather than the primary presenting symptom. D. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis typically presents with ocular symptoms (e.g., exophthalmos, diplopia, and proptosis), as well as headache and fever. Ptosis can occur, but neck stiffness and the sudden severe headache seen in this patient are more characteristic of SAH rather than cavernous sinus thrombosis. This condition also usually presents with signs of cranial nerve involvement affecting multiple nerves, but SAH caused by an aneurysm is more fitting for this clinical scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Posterior Cerebral Artery The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies the occipital lobe and the inferior part of the temporal lobe, both of which are critical for vision and memory processing. Occlusion of the PCA can lead to a combination of cortical blindness (due to damage to the occipital cortex), amnesia (due to damage to the medial temporal lobe structures, such as the hippocampus), and thalamic pain (from involvement of the thalamus, which is a relay station for sensory information). This combination of symptoms is characteristic of PCA infarction, often associated with a condition called Verger's syndrome or thalamic pain syndrome. Incorrect Answers: A. Anterior Cerebral Artery The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) primarily supplies the medial aspects of the frontal and parietal lobes. Occlusion of the ACA is more likely to result in contralateral lower limb weakness, sensory loss, and frontal lobe symptoms such as personality changes and disinhibition, rather than the combination of cortical blindness, amnesia, and thalamic pain. These specific symptoms are not typically associated with ACA infarctions. B. Basilar Artery The basilar artery supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, and parts of the occipital and temporal lobes. While occlusion of the basilar artery can lead to brainstem dysfunction (e.g., cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, dysphagia, and hemiplegia), it does not typically cause the specific combination of cortical blindness, amnesia, and thalamic pain seen with posterior cerebral artery infarctions. C. Middle Cerebral Artery The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral aspects of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Occlusion of the MCA can result in contralateral hemiparesis, sensory deficits, aphasia (if the dominant hemisphere is affected), and neglect (if the non-dominant hemisphere is involved). However, cortical blindness, amnesia, and thalamic pain are not typically features of MCA infarctions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Platelet count < 1 lac Thrombolysis in the setting of ischemic stroke is contraindicated in patients with low platelet count. Specifically, a platelet count of less than 100,000/µL (1 lac) is considered a significant risk factor for bleeding complications, which can be exacerbated by thrombolytic therapy. The use of thrombolytics such as alteplase can increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in patients with thrombocytopenia, making it unsafe to administer in such cases. Incorrect Answers: A. BP < 185/100 A blood pressure of less than 185/100 mmHg is not a contraindication for thrombolysis. In fact, blood pressure control is an important aspect of thrombolytic therapy, and the threshold for administering thrombolytics is typically a systolic BP of less than 185 mmHg and a diastolic BP of less than 110 mmHg. If BP is above these thresholds, antihypertensive therapy should be used to lower the BP before thrombolysis can be given. B. Blood glucose < 100 A blood glucose level less than 100 mg/dL is not a contraindication for thrombolysis. In fact, hypoglycemia is a separate condition that can mimic stroke-like symptoms, so it should be corrected before administering thrombolytics. However, a normal blood glucose level is not a contraindication, and thrombolysis can be considered even if the blood glucose is above 100 mg/dL. C. CT scan showing edema < 1/3rd of MCA CT findings of edema that affect less than 1/3rd of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory are not a contraindication for thrombolysis. The extent of early ischemic changes on CT scan does not automatically rule out thrombolysis unless the ischemic damage is severe (e.g., substantial ischemic penumbra or large infarct volume). A CT showing less than 1/3rd MCA involvement is generally considered safe for thrombolysis, provided other criteria are met.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterior cerebral artery. Correct Answer (A): Anterior cerebral artery The paracentral lobule is located on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and is part of the frontal lobe. Its blood supply primarily comes from the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The ACA supplies the medial parts of the frontal and parietal lobes, which includes the paracentral lobule. This artery is responsible for supplying the motor and sensory areas of the lower extremities, and it is crucial for the functioning of the paracentral lobule. Incorrect Answers: B. Anterior choroidal artery The anterior choroidal artery primarily supplies structures in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, and parts of the hippocampus and thalamus. It does not supply the paracentral lobule. The anterior choroidal artery is important for the blood supply to deeper brain structures, but it does not contribute significantly to the paracentral lobule. C. Anterior communicating artery The anterior communicating artery is a short vessel that connects the left and right anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs). It plays a role in forming the circle of Willis and ensuring collateral circulation between the two ACA territories. However, it does not supply the paracentral lobule. The paracentral lobule is specifically supplied by the ACA itself, not by the anterior communicating artery. D. Middle cerebral artery The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies the lateral portions of the frontal and parietal lobes, but it does not supply the medial aspects where the paracentral lobule is located. The MCA is responsible for blood flow to areas such as the lateral motor cortex, and it does not typically reach the medial cortical areas like the paracentral lobule.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Contralateral foot weakness. Correct Answer (A): Contralateral foot weakness The paracentral lobule is located on the medial surface of the frontal lobe, and it contains the motor cortex that controls the lower extremities. A lesion in the paracentral lobule would affect the motor control of the contralateral side of the body, particularly the foot and leg. This results in contralateral foot weakness or paresis. Since the motor cortex is arranged in a somatotopic manner, the paracentral lobule specifically governs the motor function of the lower limb, and a lesion here would lead to weakness in the contralateral foot. Incorrect Answers: B. Seizures While brain lesions can sometimes lead to seizures, seizures are not the most characteristic manifestation of a paracentral lobule lesion. Seizures would more commonly be seen in lesions affecting areas of the temporal lobe or other cortical regions, but not primarily in the paracentral lobule. Lesions in the motor cortex are more likely to lead to motor impairments such as weakness or paralysis rather than seizures. C. Migraine Migraine is primarily a vascular condition, not typically caused by a lesion in the paracentral lobule. Migraines are associated with changes in blood flow, often in the posterior cerebral circulation, and are generally not linked to specific brain lesions like those in the paracentral lobule. A lesion here would more likely lead to motor deficits, not migraines. D. Cognitive loss Cognitive functions are generally governed by the frontal lobes, but lesions in the paracentral lobule specifically affect the motor areas rather than directly leading to cognitive loss. While the frontal lobe as a whole is important for cognitive functions, a lesion in the paracentral lobule, which is primarily responsible for motor control of the lower extremities, would more commonly cause motor symptoms rather than cognitive impairment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Prefrontal area of frontal lobe The prefrontal cortex, located in the frontal lobe, plays a critical role in personality, behavior regulation, decision-making, and social interactions. Damage to the prefrontal cortex, particularly the ventromedial and dorsolateral regions, can result in impaired judgment, impulsivity, and antisocial behavior. This damage often disrupts a person’s ability to control emotions, make responsible decisions, and exhibit socially appropriate behavior, leading to antisocial traits. This is why antisocial behavior is often associated with prefrontal cortex damage. Incorrect Answers: B. Primary motor area of frontal lobe The primary motor cortex is responsible for voluntary muscle movements and motor control, particularly for movements of the contralateral side of the body. Damage to the primary motor area can cause motor deficits such as weakness or paralysis, but it does not directly affect behavior or personality. Therefore, damage to the primary motor area is unlikely to lead to antisocial behavior. C. Premotor area of frontal lobe The premotor area is involved in planning and coordinating voluntary movements, but like the primary motor cortex, it does not primarily control behavior, personality, or social interactions. Damage here would lead to issues related to movement coordination or motor planning, but not typically to antisocial behavior. Thus, the premotor area is not responsible for antisocial traits. D. Paracentral lobule of frontal lobe The paracentral lobule primarily governs the motor control of the lower extremities and plays a role in motor function. It is part of the somatomotor area and does not significantly contribute to higher cognitive functions such as behavior regulation or social interaction. Therefore, damage to the paracentral lobule would lead to motor deficits, not antisocial behavior.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Astereognosis Astereognosis refers to the inability to recognize objects by touch alone, without the use of vision. It is not a part of Gerstmann syndrome, which is specifically associated with damage to the left parietal lobe, particularly the angular gyrus. Gerstmann syndrome is characterized by a set of deficits involving specific cognitive functions, but astereognosis is not one of them. Therefore, astereognosis is not included in the classic components of Gerstmann syndrome. Incorrect Answers: A. Dysgraphia Dysgraphia is one of the hallmark symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome. It refers to difficulty with writing, despite normal intelligence and motor skills. This occurs due to damage to the parietal lobe, specifically the angular gyrus, which is responsible for processing the spatial and motor aspects of writing. Therefore, dysgraphia is a core feature of Gerstmann syndrome. B. Acalculia Acalculia is another core feature of Gerstmann syndrome. It is the inability to perform simple arithmetic calculations, typically caused by damage to the angular gyrus in the left parietal lobe. This deficit is often seen along with the other symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome, including dysgraphia, finger agnosia, and right-left disorientation. C. Finger agnosia Finger agnosia is a defining feature of Gerstmann syndrome. It refers to the inability to identify or differentiate between fingers, either on the individual’s own hands or someone else’s. This is due to damage to the left parietal lobe, which is involved in body image and spatial awareness, making finger agnosia a classic symptom of Gerstmann syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Apraxia Apraxia refers to a motor disorder where a person is unable to perform purposeful movements, despite having the physical ability and desire to do so. Apraxia is typically caused by lesions in the frontal lobe, specifically in areas related to motor planning, and not commonly associated with lesions in the temporal lobe. Therefore, apraxia would not typically result from a lesion of the left temporal lobe, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. Aphasia Aphasia is a language disorder caused by damage to the left temporal lobe, particularly the Wernicke’s area. The left temporal lobe is heavily involved in processing language, and a lesion here can lead to various types of aphasia, such as Wernicke’s aphasia (fluent but nonsensical speech and difficulty understanding language). Thus, aphasia is a common consequence of left temporal lobe lesions. B. Quadrantopia Quadrantopia refers to a visual field defect that affects one quadrant of the visual field, which can occur due to a lesion in the temporal lobe, particularly involving the optic radiations that transmit visual information from the eyes to the visual cortex. Lesions in the left temporal lobe can affect these visual pathways, leading to a quadrantopia, which is a common manifestation of temporal lobe damage. C. Anterograde Amnesia Anterograde amnesia is characterized by the inability to form new long-term memories, often associated with damage to the hippocampus or areas in the medial temporal lobe, including the left temporal lobe. The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory formation, and damage to this structure leads to difficulty in acquiring new memories, which is a key feature of anterograde amnesia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Correct Answer (A): Subarachnoid hemorrhage The Hunt and Hess scale is a grading system used specifically for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This scale is used to assess the clinical severity of the patient based on their level of consciousness, neurological function, and clinical presentation. The grading system ranges from Grade I (minimal symptoms) to Grade V (coma or deep unconsciousness with a poor prognosis). The Hunt and Hess scale is valuable for predicting outcomes and determining the course of treatment in SAH patients. Incorrect Answers: B. Intracranial hemorrhage Intracranial hemorrhage is a broad term that encompasses various types of bleeding within the brain, including subarachnoid, intracerebral, subdural, and epidural hemorrhages. While these conditions are serious and require grading, the Hunt and Hess scale is not used for grading general intracranial hemorrhages but is specific to subarachnoid hemorrhage. C. Subdural hemorrhage Subdural hemorrhage refers to bleeding between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane, often due to head trauma. It is typically evaluated using imaging techniques, but the Hunt and Hess scale is not used to grade subdural hemorrhage. Other grading systems, like the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), are more commonly used for patients with subdural hematomas. D. Extradural hemorrhage Extradural hemorrhage, also known as epidural hemorrhage, occurs between the dura mater and the skull, often resulting from trauma. This type of hemorrhage is managed and graded differently, typically using clinical findings and imaging. The Hunt and Hess scale does not apply to extradural hemorrhages.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hyponatremia Hyponatremia is not a component of the 3H therapy for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In fact, hyponatremia is typically a complication that occurs in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, often as a result of SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion) or other factors. Hyponatremia can worsen brain edema and increase intracranial pressure, which is why it is not a goal of treatment. In the context of SAH, 3H therapy aims to optimize cerebral perfusion and prevent complications like ischemia, and hyponatremia would be counterproductive. Incorrect Answers: A. Hypertension Hypertension is a critical component of 3H therapy for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The aim is to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) to improve cerebral perfusion, which helps to prevent ischemia in the brain following hemorrhage. The therapy involves maintaining controlled hypertension to ensure that the brain receives adequate blood flow despite the loss of vascular integrity after hemorrhage. B. Hemodilution Hemodilution refers to reducing the viscosity of the blood by increasing the plasma volume. This is done to reduce the risk of microthrombosis and improve blood flow through the brain vessels after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hemodilution is a key part of 3H therapy, as it helps maintain optimal cerebral perfusion in the event of decreased blood volume or clot formation. C. Hypervolumia Hypervolumia (increased blood volume) is another important component of 3H therapy. By increasing blood volume, it helps maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which is essential for preventing ischemic damage following the hemorrhage. This is achieved through intravenous fluids and sometimes blood products to maintain circulating volume and prevent further brain injury.",

Correct Answer (B): Subdural hemorrhage Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's history of progressive neurological symptoms (right-sided weakness, speech difficulty), papilledema, and a significant history of trauma (fall and head injury 2 months ago). Subdural hemorrhages occur due to trauma, especially when there is a shearing force to the bridging veins between the dura mater and the brain. Over time, these hemorrhages can expand and cause a progressive onset of neurological deficits, like weakness, speech difficulties, and raised intracranial pressure, which could explain the presence of papilledema (indicative of increased intracranial pressure). The timeline of gradual worsening over one month further supports SDH, as it may evolve slowly and be missed initially. Incorrect Answers: A. Intracerebral hemorrhage Intracerebral hemorrhage typically presents with a more abrupt onset of neurological deficits. The symptoms usually appear suddenly after the hemorrhage occurs, often with severe headache, loss of consciousness, or focal neurological deficits, but they don't typically progress over several weeks in the manner seen in this patient. The absence of a history of sudden neurological deterioration makes intracerebral hemorrhage less likely in this case. C. Extradural hemorrhage Extradural hemorrhage (or epidural hemorrhage) is less likely in this case because it typically results from direct trauma, usually involving a skull fracture, and symptoms develop very rapidly, often within hours. The patient’s presentation over a month, combined with the absence of a history of acute neurological symptoms following the head injury, does not match the typical presentation of an epidural hematoma, which would usually cause rapid deterioration in the first few hours to days. D. Diffuse axonal injury Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) generally presents immediately after the trauma with a prolonged coma or severe neurological impairment. It is typically seen in severe head trauma, especially in motor vehicle accidents, and involves widespread damage to the brain's white matter. While this patient has a history of head trauma, his gradual onset of symptoms over a month, without an immediate loss of consciousness or coma, makes DAI less likely. DAI typically results in a more acute presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In first 2 days The risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) is highest in the first 48 hours (2 days). The initial period after a TIA is a critical time, during which the likelihood of progression to a full-blown stroke is significantly elevated. This is why early recognition and prompt treatment of TIAs are essential to prevent major cerebrovascular events. Research and clinical data have consistently shown that the first 2 days after a TIA are the time of greatest risk for a stroke, with a substantial number of strokes occurring within this window. Incorrect Answers: A. In first 3 days While the risk of stroke is elevated in the first 3 days following a TIA, the highest risk is generally considered to be in the first 2 days. The risk decreases somewhat after the initial 48-hour period but remains elevated during the first week. Therefore, the 3-day period is slightly broader but doesn't represent the most specific high-risk window. C. In first 7 days The risk of stroke is still high within the first 7 days following a TIA, but the peak risk occurs within the first 2 days. After the initial 48 hours, the risk of stroke declines significantly but does not disappear entirely, hence the 7-day window is longer than the period of highest risk. D. In first 14 days The risk of stroke after a TIA continues to decrease over time, and while it remains elevated for up to 14 days, the highest risk still falls within the first 2 days. The 14-day period is too long a window for identifying the highest risk, as the risk drops considerably after the first 48 hours.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Diabetes (2 points) The ABCD2 score, which is used to predict the risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack (TIA), does not include diabetes as a parameter. Instead, it includes factors like age, blood pressure, clinical features (such as speech involvement), and duration of symptoms. Diabetes is not assigned any points in the ABCD2 score, which is why it is the correct answer for what is not included. Incorrect Answers: A. Age ≥ 60 years (1 point) Age ≥ 60 years is an important factor in the ABCD2 score, and it is assigned 1 point. The risk of stroke increases with age, which is why age is included as a significant parameter in this scoring system. B. Diastolic BP >90 (1 point) Diastolic blood pressure (BP) > 90 mmHg is also part of the ABCD2 score, contributing 1 point. Elevated blood pressure is a key factor in assessing the likelihood of a future stroke after a TIA, and high diastolic BP increases this risk. D. Speech involvement (1 point) Speech involvement is a component of the ABCD2 score, where 1 point is assigned for speech disturbances during the TIA. If the TIA involves speech deficits (aphasia), this is considered a higher-risk factor for subsequent stroke.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Embolic Embolic strokes are the most epileptogenic (i.e., most likely to cause seizures). This is because embolic strokes result from a blockage in a cerebral artery caused by a clot or embolus that travels from another part of the body, usually the heart. The abrupt disruption of blood flow to a specific area of the brain can lead to localized brain injury, which in turn increases the risk of developing seizures. The brain tissue that is deprived of oxygen and nutrients may become more excitable, predisposing to epileptic activity. Incorrect Answers: B. Hemorrhagic While hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding within the brain) can also lead to seizures, they are less commonly associated with epilepsy compared to embolic strokes. Hemorrhages cause damage to brain tissue due to the pressure exerted by the accumulating blood, which may trigger seizures, but this is generally seen less frequently than in embolic strokes. Seizures in hemorrhagic stroke may also occur later, as a result of the injury and inflammation caused by the bleeding. C. Thrombotic Thrombotic strokes, which occur due to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within an artery in the brain, also carry a risk of causing seizures. However, they are not as strongly associated with epilepsy as embolic strokes. Thrombotic strokes tend to cause gradual blockage of blood flow, and seizures might be a later consequence of the brain's adaptation to the reduced blood supply. D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which involves bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissues covering it, can lead to seizures, but this is relatively uncommon compared to embolic strokes. SAH may lead to cerebral vasospasm, increased intracranial pressure, and brain injury, which could contribute to seizures. However, it is not as directly associated with epilepsy as embolic strokes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Temporal lobe Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a condition where an individual is unable to recognize faces, even though their vision and intelligence remain intact. This condition is most commonly associated with damage to the temporal lobe, specifically in the fusiform gyrus (sometimes referred to as the fusiform face area). The fusiform gyrus is crucial for facial recognition and processing. When this area of the brain is impaired, the person cannot recognize familiar faces, though they might still recognize other objects or features. Incorrect Answers: B. Prefrontal lobe The prefrontal lobe is involved in higher cognitive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, and social behavior. While it plays an important role in executive functions, it is not typically associated with facial recognition. A lesion in the prefrontal lobe would affect a person's judgment, planning, and personality rather than causing prosopagnosia. C. Occipital lobe The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for processing visual information, including aspects of object and scene recognition. However, while it plays a role in visual processing, it is not specifically involved in facial recognition. Damage to the occipital lobe might impair vision but would not specifically cause prosopagnosia, which is a disorder of face processing that involves the temporal lobe. D. Parietal lobe The parietal lobe is involved in processing sensory information, spatial awareness, and coordination. Damage to the parietal lobe may lead to issues with spatial orientation or sensory neglect, but it is not responsible for recognizing faces. Prosopagnosia results from damage to the temporal lobe, particularly the fusiform gyrus, not the parietal lobe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) MCA (Middle Cerebral Artery) Dense hemiplegia, which refers to severe or complete paralysis on one side of the body, typically occurs due to occlusion of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). The MCA supplies a large portion of the motor and sensory areas of the cerebral cortex, including the primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex, which control movement and sensation on the opposite side of the body. When the MCA is occluded, it can cause a stroke with dense hemiplegia, often affecting the face, arm, and sometimes the leg on one side of the body. Incorrect Answers: A. ACA (Anterior Cerebral Artery) The Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) supplies the medial parts of the frontal lobe and parietal lobe, including the motor and sensory areas for the contralateral lower limb. An ACA occlusion typically causes leg weakness more than arm or facial involvement. It does not typically cause dense hemiplegia involving both the upper and lower extremities on one side of the body, which is characteristic of an MCA stroke. C. PCA (Posterior Cerebral Artery) The Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) primarily supplies the occipital lobe and parts of the temporal lobe, which are involved in vision and visual processing. An occlusion of the PCA would likely lead to visual deficits, such as visual field loss or cortical blindness, rather than dense hemiplegia. It does not typically affect motor control in the same way as MCA occlusion. D. Temporal artery The Temporal artery is a peripheral artery that supplies the scalp and face. It is not part of the brain's vascular supply, and occlusion of this artery does not result in hemiplegia. The temporal artery is more commonly associated with temporal arteritis or giant cell arteritis, which can cause symptoms like headache and scalp tenderness but does not cause hemiplegia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Homonymous hemianopia. The patient presents with acute onset headache and dizziness, and MRI shows acute occlusion in the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The PCA supplies the occipital lobe, which is primarily responsible for processing visual information. Occlusion of the PCA commonly leads to visual disturbances, specifically homonymous hemianopia, which is the loss of vision in the same field of both eyes (usually the left field if the right PCA is affected). This visual defect occurs because the optic radiation or the visual cortex can be affected by ischemia in the PCA territory, leading to loss of vision in the opposite field of view. Why other options are incorrect: B. Right-sided hemiplegia: Hemiplegia, or paralysis of one side of the body, is typically associated with damage to the motor cortex or corticospinal tract, which are supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) or anterior cerebral artery (ACA), not the PCA. The PCA is more related to visual processing and does not generally cause motor deficits like hemiplegia, especially not on the side opposite to the lesion (which would be the left side in this case). C. Aphasia: Aphasia, which is a disorder of language, usually results from lesions in the left hemisphere, specifically in regions like Broca’s area or Wernicke’s area. These areas are primarily supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA), not the PCA. Therefore, an occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery is less likely to cause aphasia. D. Paraplegia: Paraplegia, which refers to paralysis of the lower limbs, is usually caused by lesions affecting the spinal cord, or occasionally, the motor cortex areas that control leg movement. The PCA does not supply areas of the brain responsible for motor control of the lower extremities, so it is unlikely to result in paraplegia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Posterior circulation transient ischemic attack (TIA). This patient presents with a transient episode of vertigo, slurred speech, diplopia, and paresthesias, which resolved completely. These symptoms suggest a TIA involving the posterior circulation, which supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, and parts of the occipital lobe. The posterior circulation is more likely to cause symptoms such as diplopia, vertigo, ataxia, and slurred speech because it supplies structures involved in balance and coordination. The fact that the patient is symptom-free now, and has normal examination findings, supports the diagnosis of a TIA—a temporary blockage of blood flow that resolves quickly, often without permanent neurological deficits. His hypertension and dyslipidemia are risk factors for cerebrovascular events, further pointing toward a vascular cause for his symptoms. Why other options are incorrect: B. Anterior communicating artery aneurysm: An anterior communicating artery aneurysm typically presents with symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, and in more severe cases, subarachnoid hemorrhage. This aneurysm is not typically associated with transient episodes of vertigo, slurred speech, diplopia, or paresthesias without a more prominent headache or neurological deficits. This patient's symptoms are more characteristic of a posterior circulation TIA, not an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. C. Hypertensive encephalopathy: Hypertensive encephalopathy is a condition resulting from severe uncontrolled hypertension leading to cerebral edema and dysfunction. It typically causes symptoms such as headache, confusion, seizures, and visual disturbances. This patient does not present with the classic features of hypertensive encephalopathy, and his blood pressure of 138/80 mmHg is not elevated to the extent that would suggest a hypertensive emergency. The transient and specific nature of his symptoms is more consistent with a TIA. D. Pseudobulbar palsy: Pseudobulbar palsy is a condition characterized by dysarthria, dysphagia, and emotional lability (e.g., laughing or crying without control), typically due to bilateral corticobulbar tract lesions. It is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases or strokes affecting the upper motor neurons. This patient’s normal examination findings and lack of chronic neurological symptoms make pseudobulbar palsy less likely. Furthermore, the episodic nature of his symptoms is more suggestive of a TIA, rather than a chronic syndrome like pseudobulbar palsy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Left optic radiations Explanation: The most likely cause of right homonymous hemianopia in this patient is a lesion in the left optic radiations. The optic radiations carry visual information from the lateral geniculate body (LGN) to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. A lesion in the left optic radiations disrupts the visual pathways for the right visual field of both eyes, leading to a right homonymous hemianopia. The patient's visual symptoms, such as the right homonymous visual field defect, align with this anatomical location. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Right optic nerve: A lesion in the right optic nerve would cause a right monocular visual loss (blindness in the right eye). However, in this case, the patient has homonymous hemianopia, meaning the visual defect affects the same field in both eyes, ruling out the optic nerve as the cause. B. Chiasm: Lesions at the optic chiasm typically cause bitemporal hemianopia, where there is a loss of vision in the outer (temporal) fields of both eyes. Since the patient has a right homonymous hemianopia, the lesion is not at the chiasm. C. Right optic radiations: A lesion in the right optic radiations would cause a left homonymous hemianopia, where the left visual fields of both eyes are affected. This does not match the patient's presentation of a right homonymous hemianopia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Is venous in origin Explanation: The progressive headaches, light-headedness, drowsiness, and unsteady gait over a 6-week period in this 94-year-old man are suggestive of chronic intracranial hemorrhage. The CT scan revealing a hyperintense clot over the left cerebral cortex is indicative of intracranial hemorrhage. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, the most likely cause of the clot is venous in origin, specifically cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). CVT is a rare but serious condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the venous sinuses of the brain, leading to impaired venous drainage and increased intracranial pressure. This condition often presents with headaches, gait disturbances, and mental status changes such as drowsiness and light-headedness. The hyperintensity on CT is consistent with venous blood, which appears differently than arterial blood in imaging. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Is arterial in origin: An arterial origin for the clot would most likely present acutely with focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis or aphasia), as seen in ischemic strokes. The gradual progression of symptoms over 6 weeks and the lack of focal weakness or neurological deficits make an arterial origin less likely. Furthermore, an arterial clot would typically cause a stroke or infarction rather than the slow onset of headache and drowsiness. C. Is from injury to the middle meningeal artery: An injury to the middle meningeal artery would typically lead to a epidural hematoma, which presents acutely with headache, vomiting, and loss of consciousness following trauma. This patient’s history does not suggest recent trauma, and the chronic course of symptoms over 6 weeks does not match the usual presentation of an epidural hematoma, which would develop more rapidly after trauma and is usually not associated with venous blood in the clot. D. Is from a subarachnoid hemorrhage: A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) typically presents with a sudden, severe headache (often described as the “worst headache of my life”), nausea, and vomiting. It is generally caused by the rupture of an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, leading to bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The patient's gradual onset of symptoms over 6 weeks, the absence of sudden severe headache, and the hyperintensity on CT not being characteristic of an SAH make this diagnosis unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cerebellar hemorrhage Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including occipital headache, vomiting, dizziness, unsteadiness, and a decline in her level of consciousness, suggest a cerebellar hemorrhage. Cerebellar hemorrhages can present with a combination of headache, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, particularly due to the cerebellum's role in balance and coordination. The cerebellum is responsible for motor control, and when it is affected, it often causes ataxia, which leads to unsteadiness, as seen in this patient. Additionally, vomiting is a common symptom due to increased intracranial pressure or direct involvement of the cerebellum, while the decline in consciousness indicates worsening of the condition, likely from expanding hemorrhage. The occipital headache may be due to increased intracranial pressure as the hemorrhage enlarges. Hypertension is a common risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in the cerebellum, which is a common site for hypertensive hemorrhages. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Basal ganglia hemorrhage: While basal ganglia hemorrhages are common in hypertensive patients and can cause neurological deficits, they typically present with contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and hemispatial neglect, rather than the symptoms seen in this patient. Basal ganglia hemorrhage often involves the motor system, leading to movement abnormalities, such as rigidity or tremor, which are not present in this case. Headache and vomiting may be present, but the dizziness and unsteadiness are less prominent in basal ganglia hemorrhage compared to cerebellar hemorrhage. C. Pontine hemorrhage: Pontine hemorrhages can also present with altered consciousness, motor deficits, and cranial nerve abnormalities. However, pontine hemorrhage is more likely to present with quadriparesis, bilateral motor deficits, respiratory changes, and pupillary abnormalities, due to its involvement in brainstem functions. Although this patient has a decline in consciousness, her symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness, and headache are more typical of cerebellar hemorrhage rather than pontine hemorrhage. D. Lobar intracerebral hemorrhage: Lobar hemorrhages typically occur in the frontal, parietal, or temporal lobes and may present with focal neurological deficits, such as weakness, sensory changes, or aphasia, depending on the location. They are also associated with headache and vomiting but do not typically cause ataxia or unsteadiness unless the hemorrhage is near the cerebellar or brainstem regions. While lobar hemorrhages can cause headaches and vomiting, they are less likely to cause the dizziness and unsteadiness that are characteristic of cerebellar hemorrhage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypertensive encephalopathy Explanation: This patient's presentation of increasing headache, confusion, vomiting, and papilledema with severely elevated blood pressure (230/125 mm Hg) is highly suggestive of hypertensive encephalopathy. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a medical emergency that results from severe, poorly controlled hypertension leading to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. The patient exhibits symptoms such as confusion, headache, vomiting, and papilledema, all indicative of elevated intracranial pressure. This condition occurs due to loss of autoregulation in the cerebral vasculature, resulting in cerebral edema and a non-localizing encephalopathy without focal neurological deficits. The absence of focal findings (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia, etc.) supports the diagnosis of hypertensive encephalopathy, where cerebral dysfunction is diffuse rather than localized. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Basal ganglia hemorrhage: A basal ganglia hemorrhage typically presents with contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, or movement abnormalities such as rigidity or tremor. In this case, the patient lacks focal neurological deficits, such as motor or sensory impairments, which would be expected in a basal ganglia hemorrhage. Additionally, basal ganglia hemorrhages tend to present with symptoms localized to one side of the body, unlike the more diffuse encephalopathy seen in hypertensive encephalopathy. B. Cerebellar hemorrhage: A cerebellar hemorrhage typically presents with ataxia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and headache. The patient in this case does not exhibit the typical signs of cerebellar involvement such as gait ataxia or unsteady movement. Furthermore, cerebellar hemorrhages are often associated with nystagmus and dysarthria, which are not seen here. Papilledema and confusion in the context of hypertension is more consistent with hypertensive encephalopathy. C. Pontine hemorrhage: A pontine hemorrhage typically presents with motor deficits (often bilateral), cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., gaze abnormalities or facial weakness), and sometimes respiratory changes due to the involvement of the brainstem. This patient does not exhibit the motor weakness, facial droop, or other brainstem dysfunction signs that would point to a pontine hemorrhage. Additionally, pontine hemorrhages are often more devastating and present with more severe symptoms, including altered consciousness and respiratory irregularities, which this patient does not have.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CT scan without contrast Explanation: This 68-year-old woman with sudden-onset headache, vomiting, and left-sided weakness is presenting with signs that suggest a stroke (hemiparesis) or intracerebral hemorrhage. In the setting of a suspected acute neurological event, a non-contrast CT scan of the brain is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test. This is because a non-contrast CT scan is the fastest and most accessible method to assess for intracerebral hemorrhage, which is common in patients with hypertension. A CT scan without contrast can quickly identify the presence of blood, which is crucial to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and guide immediate management. Why the other options are incorrect: A. CT scan with contrast: A CT scan with contrast is typically used for detecting tumors, infections, or vascular malformations. In the acute setting of a suspected stroke or hemorrhage, contrast is not necessary and could potentially worsen the evaluation because it may obscure acute blood products. Contrast is more useful in chronic or non-acute cases to evaluate for masses or other pathologies. B. MR scan with gadolinium: While an MRI with gadolinium can provide highly detailed images of the brain and is excellent for identifying ischemic strokes, brain tumors, and vascular malformations, it is not the first-line test in the acute setting of suspected stroke or hemorrhage. MRI is more time-consuming and less accessible compared to a CT scan. In this case, a CT scan without contrast should be performed initially to assess for hemorrhage before moving to MRI if necessary. D. MR cerebral angiogram: An MR cerebral angiogram is typically used to evaluate cerebral blood vessels, such as in the case of suspected aneurysms or vascular malformations. However, in the acute phase of a stroke or hemorrhage, the priority is to first identify whether there is a hemorrhage or ischemic event in the brain. This is best done with a CT scan without contrast. An MR angiogram is not needed initially unless there is concern about specific vascular abnormalities after the initial CT scan.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cavernous sinus thrombosis Explanation: The most likely diagnosis for this 63-year-old man presenting with sudden onset headache, fever, eye pain, orbital pain, edema, chemosis, proptosis, diplopia, and ptosis is cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST). This condition occurs when a blood clot forms in the cavernous sinus, which is a venous structure located at the base of the skull behind the eyes. CST is often caused by infection (such as a sinus infection or facial cellulitis), but it can also arise from septic thrombophlebitis. The hallmark signs of CST are painful swelling of the eyelids, proptosis (bulging of the eyes), diplopia (double vision), ptosis (drooping eyelid), and pupil involvement (slow reaction). The orbital pain and chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva) in combination with these findings point to cavernous sinus thrombosis as the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, fever and headache are typical systemic manifestations of an infection or inflammatory process affecting the cavernous sinus. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Chorioretinitis: Chorioretinitis refers to inflammation of the choroid and retina, usually due to infection (e.g., toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus in immunocompromised patients). However, this condition typically presents with visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision or scotomas) and fundoscopic findings, rather than the orbital pain, ptosis, and proptosis seen in this case. The lack of visual changes and characteristic eye findings makes chorioretinitis an unlikely diagnosis here. C. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a bleeding into the subarachnoid space, typically from the rupture of an aneurysm. While it often presents with a severe headache, the associated findings would typically include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness, rather than the orbital pain, proptosis, and pupil changes seen in this patient. There is no mention of focal neurological deficits or signs of a stroke, which would also be expected in a subarachnoid hemorrhage. D. Brain abscess: A brain abscess is a localized collection of pus within the brain tissue, often caused by infection from surrounding areas (e.g., sinusitis or dental infections). While headache, fever, and neurological deficits can be present, proptosis, diplopia, ptosis, and orbital pain are not characteristic signs of a brain abscess. The findings in this case are more consistent with an issue involving the cavernous sinus rather than an intracranial abscess.",
