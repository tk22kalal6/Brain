      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) IgA nephropathy. Explanation: IgA nephropathy, also known as Berger’s disease, is typically characterized by the deposition of IgA in the glomeruli. Serum complement C3 levels are usually normal or slightly low in this condition, but they do not usually drop significantly. This is in contrast to other conditions associated with more pronounced complement activation and consumption. Therefore, IgA nephropathy is the exception, as it is not typically associated with a low C3 level. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis: This condition occurs after an infection with certain strains of Streptococcus bacteria, leading to immune complex formation and activation of the complement system. Serum C3 levels are low due to consumption during the immune response, making it a common feature of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. B. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: In this type of glomerulonephritis, the complement system is often activated, and low C3 levels are typically seen due to complement consumption. This is a hallmark of the disease, as both the classical and alternative complement pathways can be involved. C. Lupus nephritis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) often involves immune complex formation and deposition in the kidneys, which leads to complement activation. In lupus nephritis, C3 levels are commonly low, reflecting ongoing complement consumption as part of the disease’s pathophysiology.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (D+ HUS). Explanation: Diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (D+ HUS) is typically caused by infection with E. coli O157:H7 and is associated with the production of toxins that damage the endothelial cells in the kidneys. While D+ HUS can lead to kidney injury, it is not primarily associated with low complement levels. Instead, it is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury, but complement activation does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis compared to other conditions listed in the question. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Lupus nephritis: Lupus nephritis is an inflammatory kidney condition seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is associated with the formation of immune complexes that activate the complement system, leading to low C3 and C4 levels. Complement consumption due to immune complex deposition is a hallmark feature of lupus nephritis. B. Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis): This type of glomerulonephritis is characterized by immune complex deposition and complement activation, leading to low complement levels, especially C3. Complement consumption occurs as part of the immune response in this condition. D. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis: This condition typically follows a streptococcal infection and is known for the activation of the complement system due to immune complex formation. This activation leads to low C3 levels, which is a characteristic feature of post-infectious glomerulonephritis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inulin clearance. Explanation: Inulin clearance is considered the most specific and accurate marker of renal function because inulin is a substance that is freely filtered by the glomerulus and neither reabsorbed, secreted, metabolized, nor synthesized by the kidneys. This makes it an ideal marker for measuring the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is the best overall indicator of kidney function. Inulin clearance is considered the \"gold standard\" for assessing renal function, though it is not commonly used in clinical practice due to its complexity and cost. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Creatinine clearance: Although creatinine clearance is commonly used to estimate GFR, it is less specific than inulin clearance because creatinine is not only filtered by the glomerulus but also secreted by the renal tubules. This secretion leads to an overestimation of GFR, especially in patients with normal or mild impairment of renal function. C. Blood urea: Blood urea levels can indicate renal function but are influenced by non-renal factors such as protein intake, liver function, and hydration status. Urea is reabsorbed in the renal tubules, which makes it an unreliable marker for accurately assessing GFR or renal function. D. Serum creatinine: Serum creatinine is widely used as a marker of renal function due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, it is less specific than inulin clearance because its levels can be influenced by muscle mass, age, sex, and certain medications. It is a practical but not a precise measure of GFR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Preserved CMD on USG scan. Explanation: In acute kidney injury (AKI), the corticomedullary differentiation (CMD) on an ultrasound scan is usually preserved because the structural integrity of the kidney remains intact despite functional impairment. In contrast, chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to a loss of CMD due to long-standing damage, fibrosis, and scarring of renal tissues. Therefore, a preserved CMD on ultrasonography is a distinguishing feature that supports the diagnosis of AKI over CKD. Additionally, AKI often presents with normal-sized kidneys, whereas CKD typically results in shrunken, contracted kidneys. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. An increased urinary Na+: Increased urinary sodium excretion may be seen in AKI, particularly in intrinsic renal causes like acute tubular necrosis (ATN). However, urinary sodium levels are not specific to differentiate between AKI and CKD since sodium handling may also be impaired in advanced CKD. B. LVH on ECG: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on ECG is commonly associated with long-standing hypertension or volume overload, conditions frequently seen in CKD due to prolonged renal dysfunction. It is not specific for distinguishing between AKI and CKD, as it reflects chronic cardiovascular changes rather than acute kidney injury. C. Hypophosphatemia: Hypophosphatemia is not a typical finding in either AKI or CKD. Instead, hyperphosphatemia is often seen in CKD due to impaired phosphate excretion. Phosphorus levels can also increase in AKI, particularly in intrinsic renal causes, making this option irrelevant for differentiation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) IgA nephropathy. Explanation: IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) is the most likely cause of gross hematuria occurring shortly (typically within 1–3 days) after an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is characterized by the deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium. The hematuria is often recurrent and may coincide with infections such as pharyngitis or tonsillitis. IgA nephropathy is more common in young adults and can present with either gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria. The temporal relationship between the infection and hematuria is a hallmark feature of this condition, distinguishing it from other glomerular diseases. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Acute glomerulonephritis: While acute glomerulonephritis (e.g., post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) can present with hematuria, it typically occurs 10–14 days after an infection, not within 3 days as seen in IgA nephropathy. This delayed onset is due to the time required for immune complex formation and deposition. B. Minimal change disease: Minimal change disease is primarily associated with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, rather than hematuria. It is not linked to gross hematuria following a URTI. D. Membranous glomerulonephritis: Membranous glomerulonephritis usually presents with nephrotic syndrome rather than hematuria. While it can occasionally cause microscopic hematuria, it is not typically associated with gross hematuria or a temporal relationship with infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answe (C) Collapsing glomerulopathy. Explanation: HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a distinct renal pathology most commonly characterized by collapsing glomerulopathy, a variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This condition is marked by the collapse of the glomerular capillary tufts, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the overlying podocytes, and significant tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. HIVAN predominantly affects individuals of African descent due to genetic predisposition (e.g., APOL1 gene variants) and typically presents with nephrotic syndrome, progressive kidney dysfunction, and large echogenic kidneys on imaging. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Membranous glomerulopathy: Membranous glomerulopathy is characterized by subepithelial immune complex deposits leading to thickened glomerular capillary walls. While it can occur in association with infections, drugs, and autoimmune diseases, it is not the hallmark of HIVAN. B. Immunotactoid glomerulopathy: Immunotactoid glomerulopathy is a rare glomerular disease associated with organized microtubular deposits in the glomeruli. It is typically seen in systemic disorders like lymphoproliferative diseases, not HIV. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN). Explanation: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most likely renal lesion in this case, given the patient's history of prolonged hypotension and poor tissue perfusion, which are common causes of ischemic ATN. ATN is characterized by tubular epithelial cell injury due to hypoperfusion and ischemia, often in the setting of severe illness such as myocardial infarction with hemodynamic instability. The progressive rise in serum urea and creatinine levels over a few days, along with the presence of granular and hyaline casts in the urine, strongly supports the diagnosis. Granular casts are indicative of tubular cell damage and are commonly seen in ATN. The condition can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), which may be reversible with proper management once the underlying cause is addressed. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Minimal change disease: Minimal change disease is primarily associated with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease). Explanation: IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease) is primarily characterized by hematuria, either gross or microscopic, and is often triggered by infections such as upper respiratory tract infections. While proteinuria can be present in IgA nephropathy, it does not typically present as a classic nephrotic syndrome with heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The hallmark of IgA nephropathy is episodic hematuria, rather than proteinuria and edema, making it an exception among diseases that commonly lead to nephrotic syndrome. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Membranous glomerulopathy: Membranous glomerulopathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is characterized by the formation of immune complex deposits on the glomerular basement membrane, leading to heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, all hallmark features of nephrotic syndrome. C. Minimal change disease: Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and can also affect adults. It leads to massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia, which are all characteristic features of nephrotic syndrome. D. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is another major cause of nephrotic syndrome. It results in glomerulosclerosis with segmental scarring of the glomeruli, which leads to proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, fitting the criteria for nephrotic syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Long-term antistreptococcal prophylaxis is indicated after a prior documented case of PSGN. Explanation: While long-term antistreptococcal prophylaxis (such as penicillin) is commonly used to prevent recurrent streptococcal infections in patients who have had rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease, it is not routinely indicated following a prior case of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The main goal in PSGN treatment is to manage symptoms, prevent complications, and address the underlying streptococcal infection if it is still present. However, once PSGN has occurred, the risk of recurrence due to streptococcal infection is generally considered low, and long-term prophylaxis is not standard practice for preventing further episodes of PSGN. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. The latent period appears to be longer when PSGN is associated with cutaneous rather than pharyngeal infections: This statement is true. The latent period for developing PSGN after a cutaneous streptococcal infection (such as impetigo) is typically longer than after a pharyngeal (throat) infection. The latent period for pharyngeal infections is typically 10-14 days, while for cutaneous infections, it can be 3-6 weeks. B. Penicillin therapy is without value once renal disease is established: This statement is true. Penicillin is effective for eradicating the streptococcal infection and preventing complications like rheumatic fever, but it does not influence the course of PSGN once renal disease has already developed. The damage to the kidneys is due to immune complex deposition and inflammation, which is not directly affected by antibiotic therapy once PSGN is established. D. Progressive deterioration in renal function is more common in adults than in children with PSGN: This statement is true. Progressive renal failure and complications from PSGN are more likely to occur in adults than in children, who generally have a more favorable prognosis with most recovering fully. In adults, PSGN may lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in a small proportion of cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anemia, hematuria and proteinuria are common. Explanation: Anemia, hematuria, and proteinuria are not commonly the hallmark features of analgesic nephropathy. The main pathological findings in analgesic nephropathy are interstitial nephritis and renal papillary necrosis, and the condition primarily manifests with renal dysfunction, which can progress to chronic kidney disease. While some degree of proteinuria or hematuria can occur, anemia and hematuria are not as consistently associated with this condition as they might be with other forms of kidney disease. The absence of significant proteinuria or hematuria in analgesic nephropathy makes B the exception. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Caused by interstitial nephritis and renal hypoperfusion: This statement is true. Analgesic nephropathy is primarily caused by chronic use of analgesic medications, especially combinations of acetaminophen, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which lead to interstitial nephritis and renal papillary necrosis. The use of these medications can impair kidney function due to their toxic effects on renal tissue and their ability to induce ischemia, which can lead to renal hypoperfusion. C. Occurs with high dose, long-term use & combinations: This statement is true. Analgesic nephropathy typically occurs with the chronic use of high doses or combinations of analgesics (such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and aspirin). Long-term consumption of these drugs increases the risk of renal injury, especially when used together. The cumulative dose over years increases the likelihood of kidney damage, resulting in analgesic nephropathy. D. More often in elderly, DM, HTN, rheumatic diseases: This statement is true. Analgesic nephropathy is more commonly seen in individuals who are elderly and have underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and rheumatic diseases. These populations are more likely to use analgesics for pain management and are at higher risk for kidney injury due to pre-existing comorbidities that can worsen renal function. The elderly are especially vulnerable to renal damage from analgesic use because of decreased renal clearance and altered drug metabolism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Drug induced Interstitial nephritis. Explanation: Drug-induced interstitial nephritis (DIIN) is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation. The patient developed chills, fever, and a rash, which are common systemic symptoms of DIIN. The presence of eosinophilia and eosinophiluria are key diagnostic findings in DIIN, as this condition is often caused by an allergic reaction to medications, particularly antibiotics, NSAIDs, or diuretics. The proteinuria and lack of previous renal disease also support this diagnosis, as DIIN can lead to renal impairment and typically occurs within weeks of initiating a new medication. The patient’s recent treatment for bronchopneumonia raises suspicion for a possible drug-induced cause. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Acute serum sickness: While serum sickness shares symptoms such as fever, rash, and eosinophilia, it is more commonly associated with the administration of heterologous proteins (such as antiserum or monoclonal antibodies), not routine medications. Serum sickness typically occurs after exposure to certain drugs or foreign proteins, and while renal involvement can occur, the hallmark features would include a history of exposure to such agents, which is not present in this case. This makes acute serum sickness less likely than drug-induced interstitial nephritis. B. Acute Tubular necrosis (ATN): Acute tubular necrosis is a condition typically caused by ischemic or toxic injury to the renal tubules. While this could lead to proteinuria and renal dysfunction, the presence of eosinophilia and eosinophiluria is not characteristic of ATN. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of fever, rash, and eosinophilia point more toward a hypersensitivity reaction, which is more consistent with drug-induced interstitial nephritis rather than ATN. D. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN): PSGN is a post-infectious complication typically occurring 2-3 weeks after a streptococcal infection, such as pharyngitis or skin infection. The condition often presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and edema, and it typically affects children more than adults. The lack of a recent streptococcal infection in this patient, along with the eosinophilia and drug exposure history, makes PSGN less likely.",

Explanation: In Goodpasture’s syndrome, the autoantibodies are directed against the type IV collagen found in the basement membranes of the glomeruli in the kidneys and the alveoli in the lungs. This leads to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, which are characteristic features of Goodpasture’s syndrome. The antibodies specifically target the non-collagenous domain of type IV collagen, causing immune complex deposition in the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, resulting in inflammation and damage. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Mesangium: The mesangium is a structure in the glomerulus that supports the capillary loops, and it is not the target of antibodies in Goodpasture's syndrome. In some other glomerular diseases, such as IgA nephropathy, mesangial deposits may be involved, but this is not relevant in Goodpasture's syndrome. B. Parietal cells: The parietal cells are found in the Bowman’s capsule, and they do not play a central role in the pathophysiology of Goodpasture's syndrome. The antibodies in Goodpasture’s syndrome target the basement membrane, not the parietal cells. D.

Explanation: The patient’s presentation with hemoptysis (coughing up blood), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), and linear immunoglobulin (Ig) deposits along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) suggests Goodpasture's syndrome. Goodpasture's syndrome is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the alpha-3 subunit of type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the glomeruli and the lungs. The linear IgG deposits on the GBM, identified on immunofluorescence microscopy, are a hallmark of this condition. These antibodies target the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen, which is found in both the kidney and the lung. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Alpha 1 subunit of type 4 collagen: The alpha 1 subunit of type IV collagen is primarily involved in Alport syndrome, which presents with sensorineural hearing loss, ocular abnormalities, and glomerulonephritis, but it does not typically present with the linear IgG deposits seen in Goodpasture's syndrome. The antibodies in Goodpasture's syndrome specifically target the alpha 3 subunit, not the alpha 1 subunit. B. Alpha 2 subunit of type 4 collagen: The alpha 2 subunit of type IV collagen is involved in various forms of hereditary nephritis, such as Alport syndrome (specifically X-linked). However, Goodpasture's syndrome does not involve antibodies against the alpha 2 subunit, but rather against the alpha 3 subunit of type IV collagen. D. Alpha 4 subunit of type 4 collagen: The alpha 4 subunit is not a target of the autoimmune response in Goodpasture's syndrome. The key antigen in Goodpasture's syndrome is the alpha 3 subunit of type IV collagen, not the alpha 4 subunit. Antibodies against the alpha 4 subunit are not typically associated with RPGN or hemoptysis.",

Explanation: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus (DM), long-standing for 7 years, along with the presence of nephrotic syndrome (characterized by significant proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia), points strongly to Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). FSGS is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, especially in patients with diabetes. It is associated with proteinuria and may present with hypertension (as seen in this case with a blood pressure of 170/90 mmHg), which is a common feature in patients with diabetic nephropathy and FSGS. FSGS may cause glomerular scarring (segmental sclerosis), which leads to the nephrotic syndrome seen in this patient. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. MPGN (Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis): MPGN typically presents with nephrotic syndrome as well, but it is less common in patients with diabetes. MPGN can present with mixed nephritic and nephrotic features, including hematuria, low complement levels, and glomerular changes on biopsy that are different from FSGS. MPGN is also often associated with autoimmune diseases (such as lupus) or hepatitis C rather than diabetes. B. RPGN (Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis): RPGN is characterized by acute kidney failure with crescent formation on renal biopsy and is usually associated with glomerulonephritis and immunological diseases, such as Goodpasture’s syndrome, vasculitis, or lupus nephritis. It is unlikely in this patient who has nephrotic syndrome with a long-standing history of diabetes, and RPGN typically does not present with isolated nephrotic syndrome or longstanding diabetes. D. GPS (Goodpasture’s Syndrome): Goodpasture’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder involving anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, leading to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. It usually presents with hemoptysis, hematuria, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), and is not commonly associated with diabetes or nephrotic syndrome. The absence of pulmonary symptoms and the patient's underlying diabetes make GPS less likely in this case.",

The lab results show elevated potassium (6.8 mEq/L), elevated phosphate (7.0 mg/dL), and low calcium (6.8 mg/dL), all of which are consistent with rhabdomyolysis. The most immediate concern here is the hyperkalemia (elevated potassium) that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias. The peaked T waves on the ECG are suggestive of hyperkalemia. The next step in management is to stabilize the patient's heart and treat the hyperkalemia. IV calcium gluconate is used to stabilize the myocardium in cases of severe hyperkalemia and can help prevent fatal arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate does not lower potassium but works by protecting the heart from the dangerous effects of high potassium levels. Incorrect Options: B. IV mannitol: Mannitol is used to promote diuresis and can be helpful in rhabdomyolysis by flushing out the myoglobin from the kidneys. However, in this case, the priority is to address the hyperkalemia, which is potentially life-threatening. Mannitol does not immediately correct the hyperkalemia, so it is not the best first step in this scenario. C. IV furosemide: Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to treat fluid overload and help with diuresis. While it can be used to help eliminate excess potassium from the body, it is not the best first-line treatment for hyperkalemia in rhabdomyolysis. In fact, furosemide can exacerbate hypocalcemia and may not be effective enough to rapidly lower potassium levels, so it is not the first step in managing the patient's potassium levels. D. IV NaHCO3: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) can be used to shift potassium into cells in cases of severe hyperkalemia, but it is generally not as effective as calcium gluconate in stabilizing the myocardium in the acute setting. Sodium bicarbonate is typically used after addressing the immediate cardiac threat. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increased residual volume. The patient's history of dyspnea on exertion, cough with mucoid sputum, and the PFT findings (FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.65 and no improvement after a beta agonist) are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by airflow limitation, which leads to air trapping and an increase in residual volume (RV), the amount of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation. The physical sign of an abnormal chest shape, particularly a \"barrel-shaped\" chest, is due to hyperinflation and air trapping, where the lungs remain inflated due to the increased residual volume. This results in an increased anterior-posterior diameter of the chest and an overall change in chest shape. Incorrect Options: A. Increased fibrosis of lungs: Fibrosis typically occurs in restrictive lung diseases, not in obstructive diseases like COPD. In COPD, the main issue is airway obstruction and air trapping, not fibrosis. While COPD can involve some degree of lung tissue damage, fibrosis is not the primary pathophysiologic cause of the chest deformity seen in this patient. C. Decreased compliance: Decreased lung compliance refers to the stiffness of the lungs, which is a characteristic of restrictive lung diseases such as interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. In COPD, compliance is generally increased in the early stages due to hyperinflation and loss of lung elasticity. Decreased compliance would lead to difficulty in expanding the lungs, but it is not the primary cause of the chest deformity in this patient. D. Decreased FEV1: While a decreased FEV1 is a hallmark of COPD and contributes to the overall airflow limitation, it does not directly cause the chest shape deformity. The abnormal chest shape is more related to air trapping (increased RV) than to the reduction in FEV1 itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nephrotic syndrome. This patient's presentation is most consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by the following key features: Edema: The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema and mild periorbital edema, which are common in nephrotic syndrome due to the loss of protein (especially albumin) in the urine, leading to a reduction in oncotic pressure and subsequent fluid retention. Proteinuria: The urinalysis shows 4+ protein, which is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day). Oval fat bodies: These are also suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, as they represent lipiduria, commonly seen in this condition. Hypoalbuminemia: The serum albumin level of 2.1 g/dL is very low, which is another characteristic feature of nephrotic syndrome, resulting from the urinary loss of albumin. Hyperlipidemia: The elevated triglycerides (500 mg/dL) and LDL (145 mg/dL) are also commonly seen in nephrotic syndrome due to compensatory liver production of lipoproteins in response to the loss of protein. The combination of edema, significant proteinuria, low serum albumin, and hyperlipidemia points strongly towards nephrotic syndrome as the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A. Chronic liver disease: Chronic liver disease can lead to hypoalbuminemia and edema, as the liver is the primary site of albumin production. However, this patient's normal liver function tests make liver disease unlikely. Additionally, liver disease typically presents with other signs such as jaundice or ascites, which are not present in this patient. Therefore, chronic liver disease is not the most likely cause of his symptoms. B. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism can cause edema (especially myxedema) and hyperlipidemia, but it typically does not cause massive proteinuria or the other features seen in nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, the patient's normal thyroid function tests would rule out hypothyroidism. Therefore, hypothyroidism is an unlikely diagnosis here. C. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): Heart failure can cause peripheral edema, but the lack of heart failure signs, such as gallops, murmurs, or shortness of breath, along with a normal echocardiogram, makes this diagnosis unlikely. Additionally, heart failure does not cause significant proteinuria or hypoalbuminemia to the extent seen in nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, CHF is not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgG is lost in urine. In focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a type of nephrotic syndrome, there is significant proteinuria, which results in the loss of not only albumin but also immunoglobulins, particularly IgG, in the urine. IgG is crucial for the body's immune response, and its loss can impair the immune system's ability to fight infections. This can explain the patient's history of frequent respiratory infections, such as colds and sinus infections. The loss of IgG from the bloodstream reduces the body's ability to mount an effective immune response, making the individual more susceptible to infections. Incorrect Options: A. The function of the neutrophils is decreased. While neutrophil function can be impaired in various conditions, neutrophil dysfunction is not a characteristic of FSGS or nephrotic syndrome. The primary issue in this case is the loss of immunoglobulins, rather than neutrophil function, which makes the option of neutrophil dysfunction less likely. Neutrophils are part of the innate immune system, and their function is typically not directly impaired by the conditions associated with FSGS. C. Antibodies are not made when the albumin level is low. This statement is incorrect because antibodies (such as IgG) are still produced by the immune system, even when albumin levels are low in nephrotic syndrome. The primary problem is the loss of immunoglobulins in the urine, not a decrease in their production. Therefore, the production of antibodies is not directly affected by low albumin levels, making this option incorrect. D. Lipids inactivate lymphocytes. While lipid abnormalities are common in nephrotic syndrome, the idea that lipids inactivate lymphocytes is not the primary mechanism behind the increased susceptibility to infections. The lipid abnormalities (such as elevated cholesterol and triglycerides) in nephrotic syndrome are due to the liver's response to low serum albumin levels, but these lipids do not directly impair lymphocyte function. Therefore, this option does not accurately explain the patient's recurrent respiratory infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In this patient, with a presentation of nephrotic syndrome, NSAIDs are a known cause of drug-induced nephrotic syndrome. The prolonged use of NSAIDs can lead to renal damage by causing glomerulopathy. This damage can result in proteinuria and the development of nephrotic syndrome, as seen in this patient with frothy urine and 4+ protein on urine analysis. Given that this patient has no history of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, HIV, or hepatitis, and is also presenting with generalized edema (suggesting fluid retention), NSAIDs could be a contributing factor, especially if used for managing conditions like osteoarthritis, which this patient has. Incorrect Options: B. Lamotrigine: Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug that is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. While some drugs can cause renal side effects, lamotrigine is more commonly associated with skin rashes and hypersensitivity reactions rather than nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, lamotrigine is an unlikely contributor to this patient’s condition. C. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole and pantoprazole) are used to treat conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastritis, but they are not a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. While prolonged use of PPIs has been linked to some renal issues, including acute interstitial nephritis, they are less frequently associated with nephrotic syndrome itself. Therefore, this is not the most likely medication in this case. D. Quinolones: Quinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are antibiotics that are not typically linked to nephrotic syndrome. While some antibiotics can cause kidney damage, quinolones are not common culprits of nephrotic syndrome. The primary adverse effects of quinolones are related to tendonitis, CNS effects, and GI disturbances, rather than significant renal issues like nephrotic syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Urine loss of protein C, S, and antithrombin. In nephrotic syndrome, patients experience significant proteinuria, where large amounts of proteins such as albumin and other regulatory proteins, including protein C, protein S, and antithrombin, are lost in the urine. These proteins play critical roles in preventing clot formation and regulating coagulation. The loss of these anticoagulant proteins increases the risk of thrombosis, leading to conditions such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT). In this patient with membranous glomerulopathy and a protein-to-creatinine ratio of 7:1, the increased risk of thromboembolic events is due to the loss of these inhibitors of coagulation, making the blood more prone to clot formation. This is the primary mechanism behind DVT in nephrotic syndrome. Incorrect Options: A. Urine loss of clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X): While nephrotic syndrome does lead to the loss of proteins in the urine, clotting factors such as II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X are typically not lost in significant amounts in nephrotic syndrome. In fact, patients with nephrotic syndrome often have elevated levels of these clotting factors due to liver compensation for the loss of albumin. This overproduction of clotting factors contributes to the prothrombotic state, but it is not the main cause of DVT in this condition. B. Overproduction of clotting factors: While nephrotic syndrome is associated with increased production of clotting factors by the liver (due to hypoalbuminemia), the primary mechanism behind DVT in this case is the loss of antithrombotic proteins (like protein C, protein S, and antithrombin) in the urine. The overproduction of clotting factors is secondary and contributes, but it is not the primary driver of the thrombotic risk in nephrotic syndrome. D. Low albumin level leading to stasis: Although low albumin levels in nephrotic syndrome can lead to edema and a general fluid imbalance, stasis alone is not the main cause of thrombus formation. The primary cause of DVT in nephrotic syndrome is the loss of antithrombotic proteins (such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin) in the urine, which increases the likelihood of clot formation. Stasis may contribute, but it is a secondary factor in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) is unlikely to be a direct cause of confusion in this patient. While severe hyperkalemia (K+ >6.5 mEq/L) can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness, it typically does not cause confusion or altered mental status unless it is extremely severe. This patient, with lung cancer and new onset confusion, is more likely to be experiencing confusion due to other metabolic disturbances that are more commonly associated with malignancy, such as hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, or hypoxia. Incorrect Options: A. Hyponatremia: Hyponatremia (low sodium levels) is a common cause of confusion, especially in patients with cancer, as it can be associated with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In this condition, the body retains water, diluting the sodium levels, which can lead to confusion, lethargy, seizures, and in severe cases, coma. Hyponatremia is a frequent metabolic abnormality in patients with lung cancer, especially small cell lung cancer, and could certainly explain the patient's confusion. B. Hypoxia: Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) is another important cause of confusion, particularly in patients with lung cancer, where the tumor can impair the lungs' ability to oxygenate the blood. This can lead to hypoxemia, which can result in confusion, agitation, or even coma. Given that this patient has lung cancer, hypoxia should be considered a likely cause of his confusion. D. Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels) is common in cancer patients, particularly those with lung cancer. It often occurs due to bone metastasis, tumor secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), or lytic bone lesions. Symptoms of hypercalcemia include confusion, lethargy, polyuria, and in severe cases, coma. This patient's confusion could very well be caused by hypercalcemia, which is a well-known paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Central pontine demyelination. The patient's symptoms of weakness of all four limbs, difficulty in articulation, and difficulty swallowing are classic signs of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). CPM occurs as a result of rapid correction of hyponatremia, especially when the serum sodium is corrected too quickly. In this patient, the serum sodium was increased from 112 mmol/L to 132 mmol/L within 24 hours, which exceeds the recommended rate of sodium correction. The rapid correction of sodium leads to osmotic shifts, causing damage to the pons and other areas of the brainstem, resulting in demyelination. This can cause severe neurological symptoms, such as quadriparesis, dysarthria, and dysphagia, as seen in this patient. Incorrect Options: A. Stroke: While a stroke can cause neurological deficits such as weakness, difficulty in speaking, and swallowing, the symptoms in this patient are more likely related to demyelination than a stroke. Additionally, the rapid onset of these symptoms, following the treatment of hyponatremia, makes stroke less likely. Strokes usually present acutely with focal neurological deficits, and there is no mention of any acute vascular event in the patient's history. C. Cerebral edema: Cerebral edema can occur with rapid correction of hypernatremia or overcorrection of hyponatremia, but in this patient, the sodium was raised from 112 mmol/L to 132 mmol/L, which is still within the safe range for correction. Cerebral edema typically presents with headache, confusion, and possibly seizures. The specific symptoms of quadriparesis and dysphagia are more characteristic of central pontine demyelination rather than cerebral edema. D. Transverse myelitis: Transverse myelitis involves inflammation of the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as weakness, sensory disturbances, and bladder/bowel dysfunction. This condition is less likely in this patient, as the patient's neurological symptoms are more related to brainstem dysfunction, manifesting as difficulty in speaking, swallowing, and quadriparesis. Transverse myelitis does not typically present with this pattern of brainstem involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All. In this case, the patient has trace proteinuria on dipstick and 80 mg/day of protein excretion on a 24-hour urine collection. This amount of proteinuria is considered low-level (less than 150 mg/day), which is generally not indicative of any significant kidney pathology. The following points apply to this situation: No further investigation needed: In most cases, low-level proteinuria (such as 80 mg/day) in an otherwise healthy person without other clinical signs or risk factors does not necessitate further investigation. This is typically considered benign proteinuria, which could be due to factors like temporary illness or mild dehydration. This degree of proteinuria has no prognostic value: A proteinuria of less than 150 mg/day generally has no major prognostic significance and is not typically associated with kidney disease progression. It is often transient and may resolve without any long-term implications. Fever can be a cause: Fever and temporary illness can indeed lead to transient proteinuria. This type of proteinuria can occur in response to systemic inflammation or infection but usually resolves after the fever subsides. It is not considered a sign of chronic kidney disease in such cases. Given that all the provided statements are true in the context of mild, non-nephrotic proteinuria, option D (All) is correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Minimal change disease. In a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma, the most likely cause of nephrotic syndrome (which is characterized by proteinuria >3.5 g/day) is minimal change disease (MCD). MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in young adults, and it is strongly associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. The pathophysiology involves podocyte dysfunction, leading to selective loss of albumin in the urine. MCD often presents with proteinuria, edema, and normal kidney function, as seen in this patient. Treatment with corticosteroids is the mainstay of therapy, and most patients respond well. Incorrect responses: A. Membranous nephropathy: This is incorrect. While membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, it is more commonly seen in older adults and is often associated with malignancies, especially solid tumors (e.g., lung cancer). However, it is less commonly associated with Hodgkin lymphoma compared to minimal change disease. Membranous nephropathy is characterized by the presence of spike and dome appearance on electron microscopy, which is not the typical finding in this patient. C. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): This is incorrect. FSGS can lead to nephrotic syndrome, but it is not as strongly associated with Hodgkin lymphoma as minimal change disease. FSGS is more commonly seen in conditions like obesity, HIV, and heroin use, and it typically presents with progressive renal dysfunction. In contrast, minimal change disease usually presents with normal renal function and responds well to steroids. D. IgA nephropathy: This is incorrect. IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger’s disease) is the most common cause of glomerulonephritis worldwide, but it is typically not associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. IgA nephropathy usually presents with hematuria, not nephrotic syndrome, and is characterized by IgA deposits in the glomerular mesangium, which is not seen in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) ART (Antiretroviral Therapy). In a patient with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), the most important and effective treatment is antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIVAN is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in HIV-positive patients and is characterized by proteinuria, renal failure, and often edema. The primary treatment for HIVAN is ART, which helps to control viral replication, reduce the progression of kidney disease, and improve renal function. Initiating ART is essential for managing the underlying cause of the kidney disease and improving the overall prognosis for the patient. Incorrect responses: A. Steroids: This is incorrect. While steroids are commonly used in treating certain forms of nephrotic syndrome, HIVAN is not typically treated with steroids alone. The management of HIVAN primarily involves ART to control HIV replication and reduce the burden of viral particles on the kidneys. Steroids are not the first-line treatment for HIVAN, as ART is more effective in preventing the progression of kidney disease. C. ART + steroids: This is incorrect. While ART is indeed the mainstay of treatment for HIVAN, the addition of steroids is not necessary unless there is superimposed glomerulonephritis or another underlying inflammatory condition. In most cases of HIVAN, ART alone is sufficient to treat the condition, and the use of steroids is not indicated unless there is significant inflammation or other indications that would justify their use. D. Steroids + mycophenolate mofetil: This is incorrect. Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressive agent that is sometimes used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases or glomerulonephritis, but it is not the standard treatment for HIVAN. The first-line therapy for HIVAN remains ART, and steroids are typically not needed unless there is a separate indication for their use, such as significant immune-mediated inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All. This patient's presentation, which includes nausea, vomiting, anorexia, gross hematuria, high blood pressure, and pedal edema, along with a history of a sore throat 2 weeks ago, is highly suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is a type of glomerulonephritis that occurs after an infection with certain strains of group A Streptococcus (GAS), typically following a throat infection. The classic findings on electron microscopy in PSGN include: Hypercellularity of mesangial and endothelial cells due to proliferation in response to immune-mediated injury. Leukocyte infiltrations in the glomeruli, as part of the inflammatory response. Granular subendothelial deposits, which represent immune complex deposition as a result of the host’s immune response to the streptococcal antigens. These findings on electron microscopy are all consistent with PSGN, making D. All the correct answer. Incorrect responses: A. Hypercellularity of mesangial and endothelial cells: This is partially correct, as hypercellularity of mesangial and endothelial cells is a classic finding in PSGN due to immune-mediated inflammation. However, this answer alone does not encompass all the important features of PSGN. B. Leukocyte infiltrations in glomeruli: This is also correct but is not the full spectrum of findings in PSGN. Leukocyte infiltrations are commonly seen, but this answer does not cover all the characteristic findings, such as granular subendothelial deposits. C. Granular subendothelial deposits: This is correct but does not address the entire pathologic picture. The granular subendothelial deposits are a key feature in PSGN, but by themselves, they are not sufficient to make a diagnosis without the other findings, such as hypercellularity and leukocyte infiltrations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP). Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a form of vasculitis that typically affects small blood vessels and is most commonly seen in children and adolescents. The classic features of HSP include: Purpuric rash, often over the lower extremities (which the patient presents with). Arthralgia (joint pain), which the patient also reports. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal involvement, which can result in bloody stools as seen in this patient. Renal involvement, often presenting with hematuria (as evidenced by 3+ blood in the urine on urinalysis). These features, particularly the combination of rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and hematuria, point toward HSP as the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect responses: A. Goodpasture syndrome: Goodpasture syndrome is characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, which attack the lungs and kidneys, causing rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.

Moreover, the clinical presentation in Goodpasture syndrome typically involves hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which is not reported here. B. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS): HUS is often triggered by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, leading to thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. Although HUS can cause hematuria and abdominal pain, it does not typically present with the purpuric rash or arthralgia seen in HSP. The elevated platelet count in this patient further makes HUS less likely, as thrombocytopenia is characteristic of HUS. D. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN): PSGN typically follows a recent streptococcal infection, such as pharyngitis or skin infection. While PSGN can present with hematuria, it usually does not cause the characteristic rash and arthralgia seen in this patient. Additionally, the absence of a preceding streptococcal infection and the typical absence of other PSGN signs (such as edema and elevated blood pressure) make this diagnosis less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger’s disease) is the most common cause of glomerulonephritis in young adults. The key features in this patient that point toward IgA nephropathy are: Recent upper respiratory tract infection: This is a classic trigger for IgA nephropathy, where IgA deposits accumulate in the glomeruli in response to an infection. Hematuria and proteinuria: The patient has 2+ blood and 2+ protein on urinalysis, which is typical in IgA nephropathy. Normal C3 and C4 levels: This excludes other glomerulonephritides associated with complement activation, such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Negative ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies: This rules out diseases like granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Goodpasture syndrome, which typically have positive specific antibodies. Therefore, IgA nephropathy is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical setting of a respiratory infection, hematuria, and proteinuria, along with the lack of specific findings pointing to other causes. Incorrect responses: A. Alport syndrome: Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. While hematuria is a feature, Alport syndrome is typically associated with family history of the disease and abnormal eye findings (like lens dislocation or corneal dystrophy), which are not present in this patient. The absence of sensorineural hearing loss further makes this diagnosis less likely. B. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN): PSGN typically presents after a streptococcal infection, like pharyngitis or skin infection. While this patient does have a recent infection, the normal C3 and C4 levels and the absence of history of streptococcal infection make PSGN less likely. PSGN usually presents with low C3 and sometimes low C4, reflecting immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. D. Granulomatous polyangiitis (GPA): Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) typically presents with vasculitis, upper respiratory tract symptoms, and renal involvement in the form of glomerulonephritis. However, this patient does not have features suggestive of vasculitis (like sinusitis or pulmonary symptoms) or positive ANCA antibodies, which are crucial for diagnosis. Therefore, GPA is unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Wegener’s granulomatosis (now called Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis, GPA). Wegener’s granulomatosis (GPA) is a type of ANCA-associated vasculitis that commonly presents with a combination of upper respiratory tract symptoms, lung involvement, and renal manifestations. The key features in this case that point to Wegener’s granulomatosis are: Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) is a classic symptom due to pulmonary involvement, particularly the formation of cavitary lung lesions, as seen on the CXR. Frequent nosebleeds and nasal mucosa ulcers are typical of upper respiratory tract involvement in GPA, often associated with sinusitis and granulomatous inflammation. Proteinuria and red blood cells with casts in the urine suggest glomerulonephritis, a common manifestation of GPA. Positive ANCA serology (specifically c-ANCA, which targets proteinase-3, a component of neutrophils) is a hallmark diagnostic feature of GPA. Thus, the combination of upper respiratory tract symptoms, cavitary lung lesions, glomerulonephritis, and positive ANCA is highly suggestive of Wegener’s granulomatosis (GPA). Incorrect responses: B. Bacterial endocarditis: Bacterial endocarditis typically presents with fever, heart murmur, positive blood cultures, and embolic phenomena (such as splinter hemorrhages or septic emboli), but it is not associated with the characteristic ANCA positivity or the combination of upper respiratory symptoms, cavitary lung lesions, and renal involvement seen in this patient. The absence of a murmur or signs of infection makes this diagnosis less likely. C. Goodpasture’s syndrome: Goodpasture’s syndrome is characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, which target the basement membranes of the kidneys and lungs, causing hemoptysis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. However, this patient’s positive ANCA is not typical of Goodpasture’s syndrome, which would usually show anti-GBM antibodies. Furthermore, Goodpasture’s syndrome does not usually cause nasal ulcers or cavitary lung lesions, which are seen in GPA. D. Poststreptococcal GN: Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) typically occurs after a streptococcal infection and is characterized by hematuria, edema, hypertension, and sometimes proteinuria. However, PSGN does not cause cavitary lung lesions, nasal ulcers, or ANCA positivity, all of which are indicative of GPA. The patient’s recent upper respiratory symptoms (not associated with a strep infection) and the lack of a history of streptococcal infection make PSGN less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Oral corticosteroids Explanation: The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria of 8 g/24 hours, hypoalbuminemia (albumin 3.0 g/dL), and lower extremity edema, all suggesting significant kidney dysfunction. The kidney biopsy reveals minimal change glomerulopathy, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in young adults. This diagnosis is supported by the podocyte foot process effacement and microvillous transformation seen on electron microscopy, which is a hallmark of minimal change disease (MCD). The treatment for minimal change disease typically involves oral corticosteroids. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) are the first-line therapy and are highly effective in inducing remission of proteinuria in most patients with MCD, as it is considered an immune-mediated disorder with altered podocyte function. The steroid treatment leads to a significant reduction in proteinuria and improvement in renal function. Incorrect Responses: A. Supportive care with ACE inhibitor and an LDL-lowering agent: While ACE inhibitors are often used in the management of proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, they are typically used as part of supportive care. However, this patient requires more than just supportive care. Given the diagnosis of minimal change disease, the most appropriate next step is oral corticosteroids. An LDL-lowering agent may be considered later for managing hyperlipidemia, but corticosteroids are required to address the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome. C. Calcineurin inhibitor: Calcineurin inhibitors (such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus) are sometimes used for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or in cases of relapsing nephrotic syndrome. However, they are not first-line therapy for minimal change disease and would be considered if the patient did not respond to corticosteroids. Therefore, the appropriate initial treatment for this patient is oral corticosteroids. D. Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that is used in cases of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome or nephrotic syndrome associated with other systemic diseases (e.g., lupus nephritis). It is not first-line treatment for minimal change disease, as most patients respond well to steroids. Cyclophosphamide would be considered if the patient did not respond to steroids or if there was suspicion of a more severe underlying disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Collapsing FSGS Explanation: The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by severe edema (anasarca), proteinuria of 12 g/24 hours, hypoalbuminemia (albumin 1.5 g/dL), and lipiduria (numerous lipid droplets and fatty casts), which points to significant glomerular injury. A kidney biopsy reveals focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. The most clinically aggressive variant of FSGS is collapsing FSGS. This variant is characterized by global glomerular collapse, severe podocyte injury, and poor prognosis with a higher risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) despite treatment. It often presents with more severe proteinuria, rapid loss of renal function, and is associated with conditions like HIV-associated nephropathy, heroin use, and genetic mutations. This variant can also occur in patients without these secondary causes and is generally more difficult to treat. Incorrect Responses: A. Tip lesion FSGS: Tip lesion FSGS is a subtype of FSGS characterized by segmental glomerular sclerosis at the tip of the glomerulus. While it can cause nephrotic syndrome, it is usually associated with a better prognosis compared to the collapsing variant. This variant tends to respond better to steroid therapy and has a less aggressive course. B. FSGS not otherwise specified: This is the most common form of FSGS and is a broad category that encompasses cases of FSGS without a specific cause or distinct histologic subtype. It does not have the same poor prognosis or rapid disease progression as the collapsing variant, making it less clinically aggressive than collapsing FSGS. D. Perihilar FSGS: Perihilar FSGS is characterized by sclerosis around the vascular poles of the glomeruli and is generally considered a more indolent form of FSGS. It is associated with a moderate risk of progression to ESRD but is less aggressive than collapsing FSGS, which tends to have a faster decline in renal function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Corticosteroids Explanation: This patient has IgA nephropathy, which is suggested by her clinical presentation of recurrent macroscopic hematuria associated with upper respiratory tract infections, proteinuria of 3 g/24 hours, and a kidney biopsy showing mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis with mild endocapillary hypercellularity. IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger’s disease) is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis and presents with episodic hematuria typically triggered by upper respiratory infections. For patients with persistent proteinuria (despite optimal blood pressure control and ACE inhibitor therapy), the next step is to initiate corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids can help reduce proteinuria and prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with IgA nephropathy, especially those with moderate to severe proteinuria and risk factors for progression. Steroid therapy is typically used in patients with significant proteinuria (>1 g/day) and is shown to improve renal outcomes. Incorrect Responses: A. Fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids plus tonsillectomy: While there is some evidence suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids (from fish oil) may have a modest benefit in reducing proteinuria in IgA nephropathy, this approach is generally used as adjunctive therapy rather than a first-line treatment. Tonsillectomy has been proposed as a treatment for IgA nephropathy, especially in patients with recurrent episodes of hematuria. However, tonsillectomy is not routinely recommended for patients with persistent proteinuria or significant renal involvement, making it an inappropriate first-line option. C. Azathioprine: Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent used in autoimmune conditions or organ transplantation. It is not a first-line treatment for IgA nephropathy, especially when corticosteroids are available and effective. Azathioprine may be considered in cases of steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent disease, but corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy for IgA nephropathy with significant proteinuria. D. Plasma exchange: Plasma exchange is used in diseases with severe glomerular damage or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, such as Goodpasture syndrome or TTP-HUS, but it is not indicated in the management of IgA nephropathy unless the patient is experiencing severe acute kidney injury or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is not the case here. This patient's presentation is consistent with chronic IgA nephropathy, and plasma exchange is not appropriate.",

Although diabetic nephropathy can rarely progress rapidly, it would be unusual to develop red cell casts in the urine. The weight loss and catabolic state should lead to a decrease in serum creatinine rather than an increase. This result is unlikely to be a laboratory error, especially in the setting of his symptoms, and further investigation and management should not be delayed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Type 2 diabetes and stage 4 diabetes kidney disease. Explanation: This 25-year-old female presents with several signs and symptoms that strongly point to type 2 diabetes and stage 4 diabetic kidney disease. Her elevated fasting plasma glucose concentration of 382 mg/dL is a classic finding for uncontrolled diabetes, which is commonly seen in type 2 diabetes. The presence of acanthosis nigricans (a skin condition associated with insulin resistance), family history of type 2 diabetes, and obesity (BMI of 44 kg/m2) all support a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, her chronic kidney disease (CKD) is indicated by an eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73 m², which falls into stage 4 CKD. This stage is characterized by significant kidney dysfunction, often seen in advanced diabetic nephropathy. The albuminuria (2800 mg albumin per gram creatinine) indicates diabetic nephropathy, a common complication of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the retinal findings (small exudates and dot hemorrhages) suggest diabetic retinopathy, another common complication in diabetic patients. The absence of ketones in the urine further supports the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, as type 1 diabetes is more likely to present with ketones in the urine, especially in uncontrolled disease. Incorrect Responses: A. Type 1 diabetes and stage 4 diabetes kidney disease. This option is unlikely because type 1 diabetes typically presents earlier in life with a rapid onset of symptoms such as weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, and often ketonuria. This patient's presentation of no ketones in the urine, obesity, and insulin resistance with features like acanthosis nigricans and a family history of type 2 diabetes strongly suggest type 2 diabetes rather than type 1 diabetes. Additionally, the slow progression of her kidney disease is more typical of type 2 diabetes. C. Type 1 diabetes and stage 5 diabetes kidney disease. While stage 5 CKD (kidney failure) could be seen in any form of diabetic nephropathy, the patient's eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73 m² falls into stage 4 CKD, not stage 5. Stage 5 CKD typically requires dialysis and is characterized by an eGFR below 15 mL/min/1.73 m². The patient's condition is not yet at the level of end-stage renal disease, and she is more likely at a stage where interventions are still possible. D. Type 2 diabetes and stage 5 diabetes kidney disease. While this patient does have type 2 diabetes and is experiencing diabetic kidney disease, her eGFR of 22 mL/min/1.73 m² is categorized as stage 4 CKD, not stage 5 CKD. Stage 5 CKD represents a more severe level of kidney failure where dialysis is typically required. The patient's kidney function is impaired, but it has not yet progressed to end-stage kidney failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Diabetic kidney disease Explanation: This 38-year-old male with a 15-year history of type 1 diabetes and albuminuria with eGFR of 50 mL/min/1.73 m² most likely has diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The key finding here is the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the nontumoral portion of the kidney, which is characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. This is a common complication of long-standing diabetes and is caused by non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins in the kidney, including the GBM, leading to thickening and subsequent glomerular damage. The absence of immune deposits and negative immunofluorescence further supports this diagnosis, as diabetic nephropathy typically does not show the characteristic immune complex deposition seen in other kidney diseases. The presence of a renal cell carcinoma is an incidental finding unrelated to the diabetic kidney disease. Incorrect Responses: A. IgA nephropathy IgA nephropathy typically presents with hematuria, often following an upper respiratory tract infection, and is characterized by IgA deposition in the glomeruli. The biopsy findings in IgA nephropathy usually show mesangial proliferation and IgA deposits on immunofluorescence, neither of which is seen in this case. This patient's biopsy did not show IgA deposition and instead revealed glomerular basement membrane thickening, which points away from IgA nephropathy. B. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN) Postinfectious GN is typically seen after a streptococcal infection and is characterized by neutrophilic infiltrates, immune complex deposition, and positive immunofluorescence (particularly C3 and IgG deposits). This patient's biopsy did not show the characteristic immune complex deposits and had negative immunofluorescence, ruling out postinfectious GN. D. Alport syndrome Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane, leading to hematuria, proteinuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and visual disturbances. While glomerular basement membrane thickening can be seen in Alport syndrome, the lack of a family history of hearing loss and the fact that the patient is an adult with diabetes make diabetic kidney disease the more likely diagnosis. Additionally, Alport syndrome typically presents earlier in life and is often associated with kidney failure at a younger age.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Kidney biopsy Explanation: This 48-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, heart failure, and severe albuminuria despite being on maximal dose of ramipril presents with a urine albumin-creatinine ratio of 1600 mg/g, indicating significant proteinuria. Her history suggests that her diabetic kidney disease (DKD) may not be well controlled despite the use of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), and she does not have the typical signs of diabetic retinopathy. The key clinical concern is the possibility of a secondary renal pathology in addition to her diabetic nephropathy, which can occur in patients with long-standing diabetes. In this case, a kidney biopsy would be the most definitive diagnostic test to assess the underlying cause of the worsening proteinuria. The biopsy can reveal whether there is diabetic nephropathy or an alternative pathology, such as glomerulonephritis or other renal diseases, which may require a change in therapy. Given the severity of her albuminuria, a biopsy is warranted to guide treatment. Incorrect Responses: A. HA1C While HbA1c is useful for monitoring glycemic control, it does not directly address the current clinical concern of severe albuminuria. The patient’s HbA1c might provide information about her diabetes management, but it does not explain the cause of the uncontrolled albuminuria or whether she has additional renal pathology. The primary concern here is understanding the nature of her renal disease, which requires a more focused approach like a kidney biopsy. B. A peripheral blood smear A peripheral blood smear could be helpful in diagnosing conditions like hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or other blood abnormalities that could contribute to renal disease. However, in this case, the patient has normocytic anemia and a normal platelet count, so there is no indication of an underlying hematologic disorder that would necessitate a blood smear. The primary issue here is the severe albuminuria and the possible underlying kidney pathology, which is best assessed through a kidney biopsy. D. Repeat urine albumin-creatinine ratio While repeating the urine albumin-creatinine ratio could help monitor proteinuria over time, it will not provide the necessary insight into whether there is an additional renal pathology or how to manage her worsening condition. Since she has already shown significant albuminuria (1600 mg/g), further monitoring of proteinuria without addressing the potential underlying causes (via biopsy) is unlikely to yield actionable information. The kidney biopsy is the best next step to clarify the diagnosis.",
