      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mental deterioration. This patient presents with signs suggestive of Huntington's disease, a genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder that affects both motor and cognitive functions. His symptoms, such as involuntary facial grimacing, jerking movements, mood changes, and difficulty with rapid finger movements, all point towards Huntington’s disease. The disease typically progresses with both motor dysfunction (chorea, dystonia) and mental deterioration. Cognitive decline, including mental deterioration, is an integral part of the disease course, often resulting in dementia in the later stages. This patient's mood changes and mental difficulties are early indicators of the progressive cognitive impairment that occurs as the disease advances. Why other options are incorrect: A. A normal life span: Huntington's disease is progressive and fatal, typically leading to death within 15-20 years of onset. While life expectancy can vary slightly depending on the age at onset and other factors, normal life span is not expected. The patient will likely experience a significant decline in both motor and cognitive function, which will ultimately shorten life expectancy. B. A 50% chance of only male children being similarly affected: Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning there is a 50% chance of inheriting the gene from an affected parent, regardless of gender. Both male and female children have the same probability of being affected by the disease. The statement about only male children being affected is incorrect. D. Development of hemiparesis: While Huntington's disease involves motor dysfunction, it typically manifests with chorea, dystonia, and rigidity. Hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) is not characteristic of Huntington’s disease and is more commonly seen in conditions affecting the upper motor neurons, such as stroke or certain forms of brain injury. Hemiparesis is not a typical progression of Huntington’s disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dopamine receptor blockers. This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Huntington's disease, a genetic disorder characterized by involuntary movements (such as facial grimacing, jerking movements, and restlessness) along with mood changes and cognitive decline. The symptoms, including slow movements and decreased tone, point toward a hyperkinetic movement disorder, which is a hallmark of Huntington's disease. Dopamine receptor blockers, such as haloperidol or other antipsychotic medications, are often used to help manage chorea (the jerky, involuntary movements) in Huntington's disease by reducing dopamine activity. Dopamine plays a key role in the pathophysiology of hyperkinetic movements, and blocking its effects can alleviate the involuntary movements. Why other options are incorrect: A. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- mimetic agents: While GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) plays a role in regulating movement, GABA mimetic agents (such as benzodiazepines or baclofen) are not the primary treatment for Huntington's disease. These agents may be helpful for muscle spasticity or anxiety but are not effective in controlling the hyperkinetic movements seen in Huntington's disease. The use of dopamine receptor blockers is more appropriate for suppressing chorea. B. Inhibitors of GABA metabolism: Inhibitors of GABA metabolism, such as valproic acid, can sometimes be used in treating some movement disorders like myoclonus or epilepsy. However, they are not the first-line treatment for Huntington's disease or its characteristic chorea. As mentioned, dopamine receptor blockers are the preferred choice for controlling the movements seen in this disease. C. Cholinergic agents: Cholinergic agents are typically used to treat disorders such as Parkinson's disease, where there is a dopamine deficiency leading to tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, Huntington's disease is primarily a dopamine excess disorder, not a deficiency. Therefore, cholinergic agents would not be effective for treating the involuntary movements seen in Huntington's disease and are not appropriate in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Huntington’s chorea Explanation: The presentation of involuntary movements of the face, shoulders, and arms, along with restlessness, intermittent slow movements, difficulty performing rapid finger movements, and a family history of a similar condition, strongly suggests Huntington’s chorea, a genetic neurodegenerative disorder. The key features here are: Family history: Huntington's disease follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning an affected individual is likely to have a family history of similar symptoms, as seen in this patient’s father. Involuntary movements: Chorea, characterized by irregular, unpredictable, involuntary movements, is a hallmark of Huntington's disease. Mood changes: Depression and mood disturbances are common in Huntington's disease. Motor signs: The difficulty performing rapid finger movements and decreased tone are characteristic of the motor impairments seen in this condition. Age of onset: Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Parkinson’s disease: Parkinson’s disease is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. While it can lead to motor difficulties, Parkinson’s disease does not present with the chorea or the specific family history of a genetic disorder seen in this patient. Furthermore, Parkinson’s disease does not present with the mood changes seen here in the same context, and it is more progressive with a different motor pattern. C. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis primarily involves progressive muscle weakness due to the degeneration of motor neurons. It can lead to muscle wasting, fasciculations, and respiratory difficulties, but it does not present with the involuntary movements (chorea) or the restlessness seen in this patient. ALS also typically does not have a family history of similar symptoms in this form, unless it is familial ALS, which is rare and usually not associated with chorea. D. Sydenham’s chorea: Sydenham’s chorea, also known as St. Vitus' dance, is typically seen in children and adolescents following a streptococcal throat infection (rheumatic fever). While it also presents with chorea, it does not typically have the family history seen in Huntington’s disease, and it is usually self-limiting, unlike the progressive nature of Huntington’s disease. Sydenham's chorea is also associated with other features of rheumatic fever, such as carditis, which this patient does not show.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Spinal cord tracts Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this case is Friedreich’s ataxia, which is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the spinal cord and cerebellum, leading to progressive ataxia, loss of coordination, and sensory deficits. This condition is characterized by degeneration of the spinal cord tracts, particularly the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, which explain the sensory and motor deficits seen in the patient (such as ataxia of gait, difficulty running, and hand clumsiness). Other features such as pes cavus and kyphoscoliosis are also common in this condition, reflecting the involvement of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Friedreich’s ataxia is caused by mutations in the frataxin gene, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and neuronal degeneration in the spinal cord tracts, particularly the posterior columns, which carry sensory information, and the lateral corticospinal tracts, which are responsible for motor function. Therefore, A. Spinal cord tracts is the correct answer. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Basal ganglia: Although ataxia can involve basal ganglia dysfunction, particularly in conditions like Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease, Friedreich’s ataxia primarily affects the spinal cord and cerebellum, not the basal ganglia. The patient's presentation with progressive ataxia, sensory changes, pes cavus, and kyphoscoliosis is more consistent with spinal cord tract degeneration, not basal ganglia involvement. Therefore, B. Basal ganglia is an unlikely location for the pathological changes in this case. C. Cerebral cortex: The cerebral cortex is involved in higher cognitive functions and motor control, but in Friedreich's ataxia, the primary pathological changes are seen in the spinal cord and cerebellum, not the cerebral cortex. The patient's symptoms, such as ataxia and sensory deficits, are not typically associated with cortical involvement. Therefore, C. Cerebral cortex is not the correct answer. D. Peripheral autonomic nerves: While peripheral neuropathy can occur in Friedreich's ataxia, the main pathological changes are centrally located in the spinal cord tracts and cerebellum. The autonomic nervous system is not typically the primary site of degeneration in this condition. The symptoms of ataxia and sensory loss point to central nervous system involvement, rather than a primary autonomic nerve issue. Thus, D. Peripheral autonomic nerves is not the most likely site of pathology.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Greenish-brown pigmentation of the cornea Explanation: The most likely diagnosis for this 22-year-old man is Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that leads to copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver, brain, and corneas. The symptoms described—mild jaundice, tremor, rigidity, and personality changes—are characteristic of neurologic and hepatic involvement in Wilson's disease. The patient's icterus (jaundice) and liver enlargement point to liver dysfunction, while tremor, rigidity, and abnormal movement of the tongue and pharynx suggest neurologic impairment. A hallmark finding in Wilson’s disease is the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring, which is a greenish-brown pigmentation around the cornea due to the deposition of copper. This finding is highly suggestive of Wilson's disease and helps in differentiating it from other conditions with similar clinical features. Therefore, D. Greenish-brown pigmentation of the cornea is the correct answer. Why the other options are incorrect: A. A reduction of copper excretion in the urine: In Wilson's disease, the body cannot effectively excrete copper, which leads to copper buildup in tissues, but the copper excretion in the urine is often increased, not reduced. This increased excretion occurs because the liver’s ability to handle copper is impaired, and the excess copper is excreted through the kidneys. Therefore, A. A reduction of copper excretion in the urine is incorrect. B. An increase of the serum ceruloplasmin content: In Wilson’s disease, serum ceruloplasmin levels are typically low rather than elevated. Ceruloplasmin is a copper-carrying protein, and in Wilson's disease, copper is not properly incorporated into ceruloplasmin, leading to its decreased level in the blood. Therefore, B. An increase of the serum ceruloplasmin content is incorrect. C. Increase in serum total copper: In Wilson’s disease, although the total body copper is elevated due to copper accumulation, the serum total copper levels are often normal or low due to the impaired incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. Free copper in the serum is elevated, but serum total copper is usually not markedly increased. Therefore, C. Increase in serum total copper is also incorrect.",
