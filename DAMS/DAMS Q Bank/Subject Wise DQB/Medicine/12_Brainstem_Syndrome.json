      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Foville’s syndrome. Foville’s syndrome is not a midbrain syndrome; it is a pontine syndrome. It results from a lesion in the pons, specifically affecting the area around the facial nerve and other pathways that control eye movements and facial muscles. Foville's syndrome typically presents with a combination of facial weakness, horizontal gaze palsy, and other signs resulting from damage to the pontine region of the brainstem, rather than the midbrain. The other options are indeed midbrain syndromes, as they are caused by lesions in the midbrain: (A) Weber syndrome: This syndrome is caused by a lesion in the midbrain, specifically involving the cerebral peduncles. It results in ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (cranial nerve III) and contralateral hemiparesis, typically affecting the upper and lower limbs. This combination of signs makes Weber syndrome a classic midbrain syndrome. (C) Benedikt’s syndrome: Benedikt’s syndrome is also caused by a lesion in the midbrain, particularly in the red nucleus and substantia nigra. It presents with oculomotor nerve palsy (similar to Weber syndrome) and contralateral tremor or ataxia due to involvement of the rubrospinal tract. The presence of both oculomotor dysfunction and movement abnormalities makes it a distinct midbrain syndrome. (D) Claude’s syndrome: Claude’s syndrome is another midbrain syndrome caused by a lesion in the midbrain, affecting the oculomotor nerve (III) and the red nucleus. It results in oculomotor palsy and contralateral ataxia or tremor, similar to Benedikt's syndrome, but with specific differences in the affected structures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Millard-Gubler syndrome. Millard-Gubler syndrome is a pontine syndrome caused by a lesion in the pons, typically affecting the area around the abducens (sixth) and facial (seventh) nerves. The hallmark features of this syndrome include ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy (affecting lateral eye movement), ipsilateral seventh nerve palsy (causing facial weakness), and contralateral hemiplegia (weakness on the opposite side of the body) due to involvement of the corticospinal tract. These symptoms are characteristic of a lesion in the pons that affects both motor and cranial nerve functions. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: (B) Locked-in syndrome: Locked-in syndrome results from a lesion in the ventral pons, leading to total paralysis of voluntary muscles except for vertical eye movements and blinking. It does not typically present with sixth and seventh nerve palsies or contralateral hemiplegia, as the person is often fully aware and conscious, but unable to move or speak. (C) Weber’s syndrome: Weber’s syndrome is a midbrain syndrome, not a pontine one. It is caused by a lesion in the midbrain that affects the cerebral peduncle and oculomotor nerve. It presents with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (third nerve palsy) and contralateral hemiparesis, but it does not typically involve sixth or seventh nerve palsies. (D) Nothnagel’s syndrome: Nothnagel’s syndrome is also a midbrain syndrome caused by a lesion affecting the red nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncle. It typically presents with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral ataxia or tremor, rather than the specific combination of sixth and seventh nerve palsies along with hemiplegia seen in Millard-Gubler syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pons. The combination of right-sided facial paresis (suggesting a facial nerve lesion), inability to abduct the right eye (suggesting an abducens nerve lesion), and left-sided hemiparesis (paresis of the left arm and leg, suggesting corticospinal tract involvement) points to a lesion in the pons. This area of the brainstem contains the nuclei for cranial nerves VI (abducens) and VII (facial), and the corticospinal tract fibers that cross in the medulla, leading to contralateral weakness (left arm and leg). The pons, therefore, is the most likely site of the lesion. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: (A) Midbrain: A lesion in the midbrain could cause symptoms like oculomotor nerve palsy or hemiparesis, but it typically does not produce the combined signs of facial weakness, abduction difficulty, and contralateral limb weakness in the pattern described. Midbrain lesions often present with signs such as third nerve palsy (due to oculomotor nerve involvement) and other specific motor or sensory deficits. (B) Medulla: A medullary lesion could cause a combination of facial weakness (from involvement of the facial nerve) and contralateral hemiparesis (due to corticospinal tract involvement). However, it would not typically result in the inability to abduct the eye, as the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) originates in the pons, not the medulla. (D) Temporal lobe: A lesion in the temporal lobe would typically affect speech, memory, or auditory processing and would not cause the cranial nerve deficits (facial palsy, inability to abduct the eye) or contralateral hemiparesis described in this case. Temporal lobe lesions generally affect cortical functions and are not associated with cranial nerve deficits in the pattern presented here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Left lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome. This condition is caused by a lesion in the lateral part of the medulla, often due to a vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarction. The clinical features described—miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis on the left side (indicative of Horner’s syndrome), dysphagia, dysarthria, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side of the body and left side of the face—are classic for lateral medullary syndrome. The loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side of the body and same side of the face is due to the involvement of the spinothalamic tract and the trigeminal nerve in this region. Horner’s syndrome is associated with the disruption of sympathetic pathways, which are affected in lateral medullary syndrome. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: (A) Left medial medullary syndrome: This syndrome is caused by a lesion in the medial part of the medulla, typically from occlusion of the vertebral artery. It causes contralateral hemiparesis, loss of proprioception and vibration sense on the opposite side of the body, and ipsilateral tongue weakness (due to hypoglossal nerve involvement). However, it does not present with Horner's syndrome or the pain and temperature loss described here. (C) Right lateral medullary syndrome: A right lateral medullary syndrome would involve the opposite side of the body for pain and temperature loss, as well as ipsilateral face involvement. However, the symptoms described (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis on the left side) point to a lesion on the left side of the medulla, making this diagnosis less likely. (D) Right medial medullary syndrome: This would present with features like contralateral hemiparesis, loss of proprioception and vibration on the opposite side of the body, and tongue weakness. It does not explain the Horner's syndrome (which involves the sympathetic pathways) or the sensory loss pattern (which is not typical for medial medullary syndrome).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cycloplegia. Horner’s syndrome is a condition caused by disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathways to the eye. It results in a combination of symptoms that include miosis (constriction of the pupil), ptosis (drooping eyelid), and enophthalmos (sunken eye). Cycloplegia, which is paralysis of the ciliary muscle leading to loss of accommodation (the ability to focus on near objects), is not a characteristic of Horner’s syndrome. Cycloplegia is more commonly associated with other conditions, such as pharmacological dilation of the pupil or other types of autonomic dysfunction, but not typically with Horner's syndrome. The other features are correct in the context of Horner’s syndrome: (A) Miosis: Miosis, or constriction of the pupil, is one of the hallmark features of Horner’s syndrome. This occurs due to the loss of sympathetic input to the dilator pupillae muscle, which leads to an unopposed action of the parasympathetic system, causing the pupil to constrict. (B) Enophthalmos: Enophthalmos, the inward displacement or \"sunken\" appearance of the eye, is a characteristic feature of Horner’s syndrome due to the loss of sympathetic tone to the orbital muscles. This results in a slight recession of the eyeball. (C) Ptosis: Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, occurs in Horner’s syndrome due to the loss of sympathetic innervation to the Muller's muscle, which is responsible for maintaining the upper eyelid in its normal position. This causes a mild ptosis, which is a key sign of the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Right lateral medulla Explanation: This 75-year-old woman presents with a combination of hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, right-sided vertigo, and crossed signs (right-sided facial sensory loss with left-sided body sensory loss), which suggests a lateral medullary infarction or Wallenberg syndrome. The right lateral medulla is most commonly affected in this type of stroke, which can result in a constellation of symptoms such as: Dizziness (due to vestibular nuclei involvement) Vertigo Hoarseness and difficulty swallowing (due to damage to the nucleus ambiguus, affecting cranial nerves IX and X) Crossed sensory deficits (right side of the face and left side of the body due to involvement of the spinal trigeminal tract and spinothalamic tract) Ataxia (due to involvement of the cerebellar pathways) The lateral medulla houses key structures such as the vestibular nuclei, the nucleus ambiguus, the spinothalamic tract, and the cerebellar pathways, which together produce the symptoms observed in this patient. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Right medial medulla: A medial medullary stroke typically results in contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral loss of proprioception, and ipsilateral tongue weakness (due to damage to the pyramidal tract and medial lemniscus). This patient's symptoms are more consistent with a lateral medullary infarct, which involves the cranial nerves, sensory tracts, and cerebellar pathways, rather than the motor pathways. Therefore, a right medial medullary infarct is not the correct diagnosis. C. Right internal capsule: An internal capsule stroke typically causes contralateral motor weakness and sensory loss due to involvement of the corticospinal tract and sensory pathways. However, this patient's symptoms include hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, crossed sensory loss, and vertigo, which are more indicative of a brainstem lesion, particularly in the lateral medulla, rather than in the internal capsule. D. Right parietal cortex: A stroke in the right parietal cortex would cause contralateral sensory loss, neglect, or hemispatial neglect, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms. Additionally, the brainstem involvement causing hoarseness, dysphagia, and vertigo suggests that the lesion is in the brainstem, specifically the lateral medulla, rather than the parietal cortex.",
