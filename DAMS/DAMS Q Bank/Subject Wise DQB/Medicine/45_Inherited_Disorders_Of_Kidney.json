      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Primary amyloidosis. Explanation: In primary amyloidosis, the deposition of amyloid proteins in various organs, including the kidneys, can cause kidney enlargement due to amyloid infiltration into the renal parenchyma. This amyloid deposition leads to kidney dysfunction and can cause the kidneys to be normal-sized to enlarged despite the presence of chronic renal failure. The kidneys may not shrink early on, as the amyloid deposits cause swelling and thickening of the renal tissues, resulting in an increase in kidney size. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Benign nephrosclerosis: Benign nephrosclerosis, associated with chronic hypertension, typically leads to kidney shrinkage over time. The kidneys become contracted due to the progressive fibrosis and atrophy of the renal parenchyma, which is in contrast to the normal-sized or enlarged kidneys seen in amyloidosis. B. Chronic glomerulonephritis: Chronic glomerulonephritis can result in progressive renal damage, but it typically leads to shrunken kidneys in later stages due to fibrosis and scarring. In the early stages, kidneys may appear normal-sized, but the eventual outcome is usually kidney contraction rather than enlargement. C. Chronic interstitial nephritis: Chronic interstitial nephritis often results from long-term use of nephrotoxic drugs or persistent inflammation. This condition causes gradual scarring of the renal interstitium, leading to kidney shrinkage over time. Like benign nephrosclerosis, it is not typically associated with normal-sized or enlarged kidneys in the setting of chronic renal failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Absence of associated proteinuria is pathognomonic. Explanation: Berger’s disease (IgA nephropathy) is typically associated with hematuria, which may be gross or microscopic, and often accompanied by proteinuria. The presence of proteinuria is an important feature and indicates the degree of kidney involvement or progression of the disease. The statement \"absence of associated proteinuria is pathognomonic\" is incorrect because proteinuria, especially if persistent or in significant amounts, is common in IgA nephropathy and correlates with worse prognosis. Thus, the absence of proteinuria cannot be considered pathognomonic or characteristic of the condition. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. The pathologic changes are proliferation and usually confined to mesangial cells usually focal and segmental. This is true. The hallmark of IgA nephropathy is mesangial cell proliferation with immune deposits predominantly in the mesangium. The changes are typically focal and segmental, consistent with the pathology seen on kidney biopsy. B. Hematuria may be gross or microscopic. This is correct. Hematuria, either gross (visible) or microscopic (detected only on urinalysis), is a primary clinical feature of IgA nephropathy. Gross hematuria often occurs during or shortly after upper respiratory tract infections. C. On immune-fluorescence deposits contain both IgA and IgG maybe found. This is correct. Immune-fluorescence microscopy typically shows IgA deposits in the mesangium, often accompanied by smaller amounts of other immunoglobulins such as IgG or IgM, as well as complement components like C3.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Elevated IgA level. Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral loin pain, frank hematuria, and a history of sore throat followed by these symptoms strongly suggests IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease). This condition is commonly triggered by an upper respiratory infection, such as a sore throat, and typically presents with gross hematuria, often within 1-3 days following the infection. The renal pathology in IgA nephropathy is characterized by mesangial deposition of IgA, which can lead to kidney injury. Elevated IgA levels are often seen in these patients, as the disease is associated with abnormal IgA immune responses. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia is not typically associated with IgA nephropathy. It is more commonly seen in conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which often present with a triad of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal failure. The patient's presentation does not suggest these conditions. B. Low complement level: While low complement levels are characteristic of certain glomerulonephritides, such as lupus nephritis and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, they are not typically observed in IgA nephropathy. In IgA nephropathy, complement levels are usually normal or slightly altered, and the pathogenesis is primarily related to IgA deposition rather than immune complex formation that activates the complement system. C. Positive ANA & ANCA: ANA (antinuclear antibody) and ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) are commonly associated with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis, respectively. These markers are not typically positive in IgA nephropathy. The patient's presentation is more indicative of an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis involving IgA, rather than a systemic autoimmune disease like lupus or vasculitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hepatic dysfunction. Explanation: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys, leading to renal impairment over time. The most common extra-renal manifestation in ADPKD is hepatic cysts, which affect the liver in a majority of patients. These cysts are generally asymptomatic but may cause hepatic dysfunction in some cases, especially when the cysts are large or multiple. Hepatic involvement is present in approximately 70-80% of individuals with ADPKD, making it the most common extra-renal manifestation of the disease. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Sub-Arachnoid hemorrhage: While subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with ADPKD, it is not the most common extra-renal manifestation. SAH occurs due to the rupture of cerebral aneurysms, which are more prevalent in ADPKD patients, particularly when there is a family history of aneurysms. However, hepatic cysts are much more common and occur in a higher proportion of patients with ADPKD compared to SAH. C. Colonic diverticulosis: Colonic diverticulosis is another extra-renal manifestation seen in some patients with ADPKD, but it is less common than hepatic cysts. Although diverticulosis can occur due to the vascular abnormalities associated with ADPKD, it is not as prevalent as hepatic involvement. D. Oxalate renal calculi: Oxalate renal calculi (kidney stones) can be seen in ADPKD, but they are not considered the most common extra-renal manifestation. The kidney cysts in ADPKD primarily cause renal failure and hypertension, while oxalate stones are less commonly seen compared to hepatic dysfunction. Stones may develop as a secondary complication in some patients, but they do not occur as frequently as hepatic cysts in ADPKD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lung. Explanation: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It can also affect other organs, but the lungs are not typically involved in the cyst formation associated with PKD. Cysts in the kidneys can expand and cause kidney dysfunction over time, but cysts in the lungs are rare and not a typical manifestation of PKD. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Liver: The liver is one of the most common extra-renal organs involved in polycystic kidney disease. Hepatic cysts are found in a large proportion of patients with PKD, especially in autosomal dominant PKD. These cysts in the liver may be asymptomatic or cause mild to moderate enlargement of the liver, but they are a typical feature of the disease. C. Pancreas: Cysts can also develop in the pancreas in individuals with polycystic kidney disease, although they are less common than those in the kidneys and liver. Pancreatic cysts may not always be symptomatic, but their presence is recognized in some cases of PKD. D. Spleen: The spleen can also have cysts in patients with polycystic kidney disease. Splenic cysts are relatively uncommon compared to hepatic cysts but still occur in some individuals with PKD.

Explanation: In adult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the disease presents bilaterally, meaning both kidneys are affected with cysts. The cysts are distributed in both kidneys and they progressively enlarge over time. This bilateral nature of the disease makes statement B incorrect. Unilateral involvement is not typical in ADPKD. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Kidneys are enlarged in size: In ADPKD, the kidneys become enlarged due to the growth of numerous cysts within the kidneys. As the cysts expand, the kidneys can grow significantly larger, often leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain and discomfort. This statement is true. C. Intracranial aneurysms may be associated: Patients with ADPKD are at an increased risk of developing intracranial aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if they rupture. This association is well-documented and a key extra-renal manifestation of the disease. This statement is true. D. Typically manifests in the 4th-5th decade: ADPKD often manifests in adulthood, typically in the 4th or 5th decade of life, with signs of kidney dysfunction, hypertension, and hematuria.

Hematuria and renal colic: Hematuria (blood in the urine) can occur due to the rupture of cysts, which can cause renal colic (pain due to cyst rupture or kidney stones). These are common symptoms of PKD, especially as the cysts enlarge. This statement is correct. 3. Hypertension: Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a frequent complication of PKD, and it can develop early in the course of the disease. It is typically caused by the cysts affecting the kidneys' ability to regulate blood pressure. This statement is correct. 4. Accidental finding on routine examination of abdomen: In the early stages of PKD, many patients may have no symptoms. Often, the disease is accidentally discovered during routine abdominal imaging (such as ultrasound) when enlarged kidneys are detected. This statement is also correct.",

It is caused by mutations in type IV collagen, which affects the basement membranes in the kidneys, ears, and eyes. The syndrome typically presents with progressive renal disease (such as glomerulonephritis), hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. Sensorineural deafness is a hallmark feature, making this the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A. Fanconi’s syndrome: Fanconi’s syndrome is a disorder of the proximal tubule in the kidney that leads to the impaired reabsorption of various substances (e.g., glucose, amino acids, phosphate, bicarbonate). It does not typically present with sensorineural hearing loss, making this an incorrect choice. B. Berger’s disease (IgA nephropathy): IgA nephropathy is a kidney condition caused by the deposition of IgA in the glomeruli, leading to hematuria and possible kidney damage. It is not associated with sensorineural hearing loss, so this is not the correct answer. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Liddle’s syndrome. Explanation: Liddle's syndrome is a genetic disorder that leads to hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, and low renin levels. This condition is caused by mutations in the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the renal tubules, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and subsequent water retention, which increases blood pressure. The increased sodium retention also leads to metabolic alkalosis. The hallmark of Liddle’s syndrome is low renin levels, which is a key diagnostic feature. In this condition, despite the hypertension, there is a suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) due to the excessive sodium retention and resultant volume expansion. Furthermore, high urine chloride levels can be seen as a consequence of the metabolic alkalosis and the renal response to the condition. Incorrect Responses: A. Bartter’s syndrome: Bartter’s syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to impaired reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride. This causes hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, high renin levels, and elevated aldosterone levels. Therefore, the finding of low renin levels in this patient makes Bartter's syndrome unlikely. B. Gitelman’s syndrome: Gitelman’s syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule, resulting in hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia. However, renin levels are typically elevated in Gitelman’s syndrome due to the volume depletion caused by the defect in sodium reabsorption. The low renin levels in this case make Gitelman’s syndrome less likely. D. All of them: Since Liddle’s syndrome is the only condition among the options that is characterized by low renin levels, metabolic alkalosis, and high urine chloride levels, the option \"all of them\" is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CA defect (Carbonic Anhydrase defect). Explanation: Marble Brain disease, also known as Cerebral Autosomal Recessive Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), is associated with a defect in carbonic anhydrase (CA), specifically the CA II enzyme. This enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining the acid-base balance in the body, and its dysfunction leads to metabolic acidosis and various neurological symptoms, such as progressive brain atrophy and cognitive decline. The CA defect is considered the most common and primary abnormality associated with the disease. Incorrect Responses: B. Defect of H+-K+ ATPase pump: The H+-K+ ATPase pump is responsible for acid-base regulation in the kidneys, primarily in the distal nephron and the gastric parietal cells. A defect in this pump can lead to conditions like distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), but it is not associated with Marble Brain disease. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Defect of HCO3 reabsorption: A defect in bicarbonate (HCO3) reabsorption can lead to conditions like proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA). However, HCO3 reabsorption defects are not the primary pathology in Marble Brain disease, which is due to the carbonic anhydrase defect rather than a direct issue with bicarbonate reabsorption. D. Defect of Aldosterone: Aldosterone regulates sodium and potassium balance, as well as acid-base homeostasis in the kidneys, but Marble Brain disease is not associated with an aldosterone defect. The disease is primarily related to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme deficiency, not an issue with aldosterone production or action.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyperkalemia. Explanation: Barrter’s syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium, leading to salt wasting. It typically results from mutations in the sodium-potassium-chloride (Na-K-Cl) cotransporter or other related transport proteins in the thick ascending loop of Henle. The main features of Barrter’s syndrome include: A. Secondary hyper-aldosteronism: This is a feature of Barrter’s syndrome due to decreased sodium reabsorption, which leads to low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). This, in turn, triggers renin release, which stimulates aldosterone production, causing secondary hyper-aldosteronism. Aldosterone promotes sodium retention, potassium excretion, and hydrogen ion secretion. C. Metabolic alkalosis: Metabolic alkalosis occurs because of the increased loss of chloride and hydrogen ions in the urine, resulting from the inability to reabsorb sodium efficiently in the kidney tubules. This loss of chloride ions is accompanied by a compensatory increase in bicarbonate retention, causing alkalosis. D. Sensorineural hearing loss: Sensorineural hearing loss can be associated with Barrter’s syndrome, particularly in the classic type, where mutations affect the K+ channels in the inner ear. This type of hearing loss is often present alongside the renal manifestations of the disease. Incorrect Response: B. Hyperkalemia: Hyperkalemia is not a feature of Barrter’s syndrome. In fact, one of the key findings in Barrter’s syndrome is hypokalemia (low potassium levels). This occurs due to increased potassium secretion in the urine as a result of the compensatory mechanisms associated with secondary hyper-aldosteronism. The elevated aldosterone leads to increased potassium excretion, causing low potassium levels in the blood.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Beta-2 Microglobulin. Explanation: In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on maintenance dialysis, beta-2 microglobulin deposits are a common finding, especially in those undergoing long-term hemodialysis. These deposits are associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, which occurs because beta-2 microglobulin is not adequately cleared by dialysis. As a result, it accumulates in various tissues, particularly in the joints, and can lead to bone pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other symptoms. X-rays in these cases may show calcific deposits in the bones and soft tissues, including the hand. Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis is a recognized complication of chronic dialysis, and this is the most likely cause of the deposits in this patient. Incorrect Responses: A. Calcium oxalate: Calcium oxalate crystals can form in the kidneys and other tissues in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those with chronic kidney stones or those receiving oxalate-rich diets. However, calcium oxalate crystals are less commonly seen in the bones or soft tissues and would not be the likely cause of the X-ray findings in this case. B. Hemosiderin: Hemosiderin is a pigment that results from the breakdown of hemoglobin and is typically deposited in tissues following hemorrhage or chronic blood transfusions. It is not typically associated with bone pain or carpal tunnel syndrome in dialysis patients. This would not be the most likely cause of the deposits seen on the X-ray. D. Transthyretin: Transthyretin amyloidosis is a form of amyloidosis caused by deposits of transthyretin, a protein produced by the liver. While it can cause systemic involvement, including cardiac and neurological symptoms, it is less commonly associated with bone pain and carpal tunnel syndrome compared to beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis in dialysis patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gitelman syndrome. Gitelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the renal tubular system, leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, which are present in this patient. Key features in Gitelman syndrome include: Hypokalemia (serum potassium 2.3 mmol/L): This is one of the hallmark signs of Gitelman syndrome due to defective sodium-chloride cotransport in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidneys, which leads to increased potassium excretion. Metabolic alkalosis (serum HCO3- 28 mmol/L, pH 7.48): This is seen in Gitelman syndrome due to the kidney’s inability to appropriately handle chloride, leading to bicarbonate retention and a rise in blood pH. Low urine calcium: Gitelman syndrome is associated with low urinary calcium excretion, unlike other conditions like Bartter syndrome where urine calcium tends to be high due to increased renal calcium wasting. Thus, Gitelman syndrome fits well with this patient's presentation of fatigue, growth retardation, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low urine calcium. Incorrect responses: A. Bartter's syndrome: Bartter syndrome also causes hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but it is different from Gitelman syndrome because it typically results in high urine calcium levels due to increased calcium excretion by the kidneys. The low urine calcium in this case makes Bartter syndrome less likely. C. Liddle syndrome: Liddle syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes hypertension and hypokalemia, typically due to the abnormal activation of the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the distal nephron. This would result in sodium retention, leading to hypertension, which is absent in this patient. Additionally, the metabolic alkalosis observed in Liddle syndrome is usually accompanied by high blood pressure, making it an unlikely diagnosis here. D. Conn's syndrome: Conn's syndrome, or primary hyperaldosteronism, is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis due to excessive aldosterone production. However, the patient here has a normal blood pressure (BP 100/60 mmHg), which makes Conn's syndrome less likely. In addition, serum sodium is not markedly elevated in this case, which is another reason Conn's syndrome is unlikely.",

Hypomagnesemia, which is commonly seen in Gitelman syndrome, though not specifically mentioned here, but it could be inferred by the presence of muscle cramps and spasms. Sodium depletion, although the serum sodium in this case (134 mEq/L) is only slightly decreased, and the body compensates for the defect in electrolyte handling by normal sodium levels. Gitelman syndrome is due to mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to sodium and chloride wasting, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia. Given the constellation of fatigue, muscle spasms, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, Gitelman syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Type 1 Pseudohypoaldosteronism: Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism is a rare condition that causes salt wasting, leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis. The electrolyte abnormalities seen in this case (low potassium, normal sodium, and metabolic alkalosis) do not fit the profile of pseudohypoaldosteronism, as the latter usually presents with hyperkalemia and acidosis rather than hypokalemia and alkalosis. B. Diuretic abuse: Diuretic abuse would cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis, similar to what is seen here. However, the negative urine screen for diuretics and the lack of a history of diuretic use make this diagnosis unlikely. Moreover, diuretic abuse typically presents with more pronounced volume depletion and associated symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension, which are not seen in this patient. D. Liddle syndrome: Liddle syndrome is a condition characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low renin/low aldosterone levels due to mutations in the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the kidneys. However, Liddle syndrome usually presents with hypertension, which this patient lacks. The absence of elevated blood pressure makes Liddle syndrome an unlikely diagnosis in this case.",
