      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30-40% of all cases. It is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that can occur in any part of the body and often presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes or masses. It is characterized by large, atypical B lymphocytes in the affected tissue and has a relatively poor prognosis if not treated promptly, but it is also one of the most treatable subtypes with chemotherapy. Incorrect Answers: B. Follicular lymphoma: Follicular lymphoma is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but it is a slower-growing or indolent lymphoma compared to DLBCL. Although it is common, it does not surpass DLBCL in terms of frequency and is typically associated with a more indolent clinical course. C. MALT lymphoma: MALT lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that typically arises in mucosal sites such as the stomach, intestines, or lungs, often associated with chronic inflammation or infection (e.g., Helicobacter pylori in the stomach). While it is important and has a good prognosis with treatment, it is much less common than DLBCL. D. Burkitt’s lymphoma: Burkitt's lymphoma is an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma, but it is much less common than DLBCL. It is particularly seen in children and young adults, and while it is known for its rapid growth, it represents a small percentage of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Burkitt’s lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma, particularly in endemic regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa. EBV infection plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this highly aggressive lymphoma, as it is thought to contribute to the transformation of B-cells into malignant lymphoma cells. Burkitt’s lymphoma is characterized by a rapid growth rate and is often linked to EBV in both the endemic and sporadic forms of the disease. Incorrect Answers: A. Primary effusion lymphoma: Primary effusion lymphoma is a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma typically seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. While EBV is associated with some cases of primary effusion lymphoma, the primary cause is typically associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), not EBV. B. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by infection with the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), not Epstein-Barr virus. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of this disease, which is more commonly found in certain regions like Japan and the Caribbean. C. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is most commonly associated with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and is not directly linked to EBV infection. The pathogenesis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is typically not related to EBV, but rather to chronic antigenic stimulation and genetic mutations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All the above. Lymphomas, which are cancers of the lymphatic system, can develop in the context of several underlying conditions. In Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects exocrine glands, there is an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly MALT lymphoma. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system, leading to an increased susceptibility to infections and malignancies, including lymphoma, particularly in childhood. Klinefelter’s syndrome, a genetic condition where males have an extra X chromosome, is also associated with an elevated risk of developing various types of cancers, including lymphomas. Therefore, all of these conditions can be linked to lymphoma development, making D the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. Sjogren’s syndrome: This autoimmune disorder is known to increase the risk of lymphoma, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including MALT lymphoma. However, because this condition is included in the correct answer (D), it doesn't provide a complete response on its own. B. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency disease, does increase the risk of lymphoma due to immune system dysfunction. However, this is not the only condition associated with lymphoma, and thus this option alone does not fully explain the range of conditions related to lymphoma development. C. Klinefelter’s syndrome: Klinefelter's syndrome, although primarily associated with infertility and other hormonal issues, has also been shown to increase the risk of developing lymphoma, particularly in males. However, as with the other options, this condition alone does not encompass all the conditions associated with lymphoma, which is why D is the most comprehensive answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All the above Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most common types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment for DLBCL generally includes a combination of chemotherapy and targeted therapies. The standard treatment regimen is R-CHOP, which involves four key agents: Rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) targets and kills B cells, which are the cells involved in the lymphoma. It is an essential part of the treatment protocol for DLBCL. Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapy agent that works by interfering with DNA replication, leading to the death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Vincristine is a chemotherapy drug that inhibits the ability of cancer cells to divide by interfering with microtubules, which are essential for cell division. Each of these agents is integral to the successful treatment of DLBCL, making option D, “All the above,” the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A. Cyclophosphamide: While cyclophosphamide is a key component in treating DLBCL, it is not the sole agent used. Its effectiveness is maximized when combined with rituximab and vincristine as part of the R-CHOP regimen, so it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment. B. Rituximab: Rituximab is a crucial agent in the treatment of DLBCL, but on its own, it is not enough to provide comprehensive treatment. It is used in combination with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and vincristine to effectively treat the disease. C. Vincristine: Although vincristine is an important chemotherapy drug in the treatment of DLBCL, it works best when paired with other drugs like rituximab and cyclophosphamide. By itself, it does not provide the broad-spectrum treatment necessary for treating this aggressive lymphoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) HHV-8 Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) is a rare type of lymphoma typically associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HHV-8 infection plays a central role in the development of PEL, as it causes malignant transformation of B cells. PEL is most commonly found in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, and is characterized by the accumulation of malignant cells in body cavities, such as the pleura or peritoneum, leading to effusions. Incorrect Responses: A. Hepatitis C: Hepatitis C is a virus primarily affecting the liver and is associated with chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, it is not the causative agent of Primary Effusion Lymphoma. While Hepatitis C may be involved in other types of cancers, it does not play a role in PEL development. C. Hepatitis B: Hepatitis B virus is another hepatotropic virus, primarily associated with chronic liver disease and liver cancer. It is not responsible for causing Primary Effusion Lymphoma. Although Hepatitis B may contribute to other cancers, including liver cancer, it does not directly cause PEL. D. HTLV-1: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and certain other T-cell malignancies. It does not play a role in the development of Primary Effusion Lymphoma, which is primarily linked to HHV-8 infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Facial bone tumor The endemic form of Burkitt’s lymphoma primarily affects children in sub-Saharan Africa and is strongly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). One of the hallmark clinical presentations of this form of Burkitt's lymphoma is the development of a tumor in the facial bones, particularly the jaw or mandible. These tumors are often rapidly growing and can lead to facial deformity, which is characteristic of the endemic form. In this setting, the tumor may present as a large, swollen mass in the face, often involving the maxilla or mandible, making A. Facial bone tumor the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: B. Massive ascites: While ascites may occur in various cancers, it is not typically associated with the endemic form of Burkitt's lymphoma. This lymphoma is more likely to present as a rapidly growing facial tumor, rather than with significant fluid accumulation in the abdomen. Therefore, B. Massive ascites is not the correct answer. C. Acute leukemia: Although Burkitt's lymphoma can be aggressive and share some similarities with acute leukemia, it is not typically characterized by the clinical presentation of acute leukemia.
