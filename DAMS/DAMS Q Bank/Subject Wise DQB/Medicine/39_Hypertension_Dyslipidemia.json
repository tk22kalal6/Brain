      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Essential Hypertension. Essential hypertension, also known as primary hypertension, is the most common cause of hypertension in adults, accounting for approximately 90-95% of all cases. The exact cause of essential hypertension is often unclear, but it is thought to be influenced by a combination of genetic factors and lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and stress. Unlike secondary hypertension, which is due to an underlying medical condition, essential hypertension typically does not have a specific identifiable cause and tends to develop gradually over time. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Pheochromocytoma Pheochromocytoma is a rare cause of secondary hypertension, typically due to a tumor of the adrenal glands that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines (like adrenaline and noradrenaline). These hormones cause episodic increases in blood pressure, which can be severe. Although pheochromocytoma can lead to hypertension, it is much less common than essential hypertension, accounting for a small fraction of hypertensive cases. C. Renal Artery Stenosis Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the renal arteries) is another cause of secondary hypertension, often caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. This condition reduces blood flow to the kidneys, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which increases blood pressure. While renal artery stenosis can cause hypertension, it is still less common than essential hypertension. D. Chronic Glomerulonephritis Chronic glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease that can result in secondary hypertension. It is caused by long-standing inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys, leading to reduced kidney function and, eventually, elevated blood pressure. However, chronic glomerulonephritis is not as common as essential hypertension, and it represents a specific underlying cause of hypertension rather than the more prevalent idiopathic form.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gender. Gender is a non-modifiable risk factor for hypertension. Men are more likely to develop hypertension at an earlier age compared to women, while postmenopausal women tend to have a similar risk as men. Gender is considered non-modifiable because it cannot be changed through lifestyle or medical interventions. While the exact mechanisms behind gender differences in hypertension risk are not fully understood, hormonal influences and genetic factors are thought to play a role. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Obesity Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for hypertension. Excess body weight contributes to increased blood pressure by promoting insulin resistance, increasing sympathetic nervous system activity, and affecting the renal sodium retention. Unlike gender, obesity can be controlled through lifestyle changes such as diet and physical activity. C. Salt intake Salt intake is another modifiable risk factor for hypertension. Consuming too much salt increases sodium levels in the body, leading to fluid retention and elevated blood pressure. Reducing dietary salt is a common recommendation for managing and preventing hypertension, making it a modifiable factor. D. Cultural characteristic acquired over time Cultural characteristics are modifiable risk factors as they often involve behaviors, traditions, and dietary habits that can change over time. For example, cultural dietary preferences such as high salt intake or a sedentary lifestyle can be modified through education and intervention, thus altering the risk of developing hypertension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Renal Artery Stenosis. Renal artery stenosis is the most likely diagnosis in a patient with hypertension, hypokalemia, and elevated aldosterone and renin levels. Renal artery stenosis leads to decreased renal blood flow to the kidneys, which triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This results in increased production of renin and aldosterone in an attempt to restore renal perfusion. The elevated aldosterone causes potassium excretion, leading to hypokalemia. The elevated renin is due to the kidneys sensing low blood flow, which increases renin release. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s Syndrome) Primary hyperaldosteronism is characterized by an elevated aldosterone level due to an overproduction of aldosterone, usually from an aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. In this condition, renin levels are usually low, not elevated, because the excess aldosterone suppresses renin production through a negative feedback loop. Therefore, the finding of elevated renin in the context of primary hyperaldosteronism is inconsistent with this diagnosis. C. Addison’s Disease In Addison’s disease, there is a deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone due to adrenal insufficiency. Patients may present with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension due to low aldosterone. Therefore, hypokalemia and elevated aldosterone are not characteristic features of Addison's disease. Additionally, renin levels would typically be elevated in Addison's disease due to lack of negative feedback from aldosterone. D. Cushing’s Syndrome Cushing's syndrome is caused by excess cortisol, which can lead to secondary hypertension. While hypertension can occur in Cushing's syndrome, the characteristic electrolyte abnormalities are usually hypokalemia due to cortisol's mineralocorticoid-like effects. However, in Cushing’s syndrome, the renin levels would be low, not elevated, because high cortisol suppresses renin production. Elevated aldosterone is also not a primary feature of Cushing's syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Beta Blockers. Beta blockers are the first-line drug choice for managing hypertension in patients with angina. They are effective because they reduce heart rate and contractility, thus decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, which is crucial for angina management. Beta blockers also help in reducing blood pressure by blocking the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, and they improve symptoms of angina by decreasing the frequency of anginal attacks. In addition, beta blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with both hypertension and coronary artery disease. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. ACE Inhibitors ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril, lisinopril) are commonly used in patients with hypertension and heart failure or those at high risk for cardiovascular events. While they have benefits in patients with angina and coronary artery disease, such as improving endothelial function and providing cardioprotective effects, they are not the first-line choice for managing hypertension in angina. They are often used in conjunction with other medications, such as beta blockers, especially in cases with heart failure or diabetes. C. Calcium Channel Blockers Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, diltiazem) can be used to treat both hypertension and angina by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. However, they are typically second-line agents for hypertension in angina patients, after beta blockers. They are more commonly prescribed when beta blockers are contraindicated or not well tolerated. Additionally, while they provide symptom relief in angina, they are not as effective as beta blockers in reducing myocardial oxygen demand. D. Hydralazine Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator used in cases of severe hypertension or hypertensive emergencies, particularly when other antihypertensive drugs are not effective. However, it is not commonly used in the routine management of hypertension in patients with angina because it primarily causes vasodilation and may lead to reflex tachycardia, which can worsen angina symptoms. It does not have the same heart rate and contractility-reducing effects as beta blockers, making it less appropriate in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lisinopril. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is the most suitable drug for a 45-year-old diabetic with high blood pressure (150/95 mmHg). ACE inhibitors like lisinopril are particularly beneficial in diabetic patients because they provide renal protection by reducing glomerular pressure and decreasing the risk of diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, ACE inhibitors help lower blood pressure by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). They have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with diabetes, making them the drug of choice in this case. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Amlodipine Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that can effectively treat hypertension by causing vasodilation. While it is useful in lowering blood pressure, it does not have the specific renal protective benefits seen with ACE inhibitors. For a diabetic patient, an ACE inhibitor is preferred over a calcium channel blocker due to the added benefits of renal protection and cardiovascular risk reduction. C. Propranolol Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can lower blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and contractility. While it may be used in hypertensive patients, beta-blockers are typically not the first-line treatment for diabetes-related hypertension, as they can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia and may worsen insulin resistance over time. ACE inhibitors are a better choice due to their beneficial effects on renal function and cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients. D. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is commonly used to treat hypertension, but it may not be the best choice for a diabetic patient. Thiazide diuretics can increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance, which is a concern in diabetic individuals. While it can effectively lower blood pressure, the potential negative effects on glucose metabolism make it a less favorable option compared to ACE inhibitors in this patient population.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in young adults. It is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory vascular disease that affects the renal arteries, often leading to narrowing or fibrous thickening of the vessel walls, which can impede blood flow to the kidneys. FMD is more common in younger women and is often associated with hypertension. Unlike atherosclerosis, FMD does not involve lipid plaque formation and is more commonly diagnosed in patients younger than 40 years old. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in older adults, particularly those with risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. It involves the buildup of atheromatous plaques within the arteries, leading to their narrowing and hardening. However, atherosclerosis is less likely to be the cause of renal artery stenosis in young adults, where fibromuscular dysplasia is more commonly seen. B. Non-specific aorto-arteritis Non-specific aorto-arteritis, also known as Takayasu's arteritis, is a rare inflammatory disease that can affect the aorta and its branches, including the renal arteries. It is more common in young women and can lead to vascular stenosis. However, it is not the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in young adults. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a more prevalent cause in this age group. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bone morphogenetic protein receptor II (BMPR2). Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a rare and progressive disorder characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular remodeling. In the majority of cases, the genetic abnormality lies in the BMPR2 gene, which encodes the bone morphogenetic protein receptor II. Mutations in this gene impair the normal signaling pathway that regulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, leading to vascular remodeling and the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mutations in BMPR2 are found in about 70% of familial cases and in a smaller percentage of sporadic cases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Endothelin Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays a role in regulating vascular tone and can be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. Elevated levels of endothelin contribute to vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, but it is not the primary genetic abnormality in primary pulmonary hypertension. Instead, endothelin is considered a secondary factor in the disease progression, rather than the initial genetic defect. C. Homebox gene The homebox gene is a type of regulatory gene involved in controlling the development and differentiation of various tissues during embryogenesis. While mutations in some homeobox genes are implicated in developmental disorders, they are not the basic abnormality in primary pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. D. PAX – 11 PAX-11 is a gene involved in the development of kidney and urinary system structures, not in the pathophysiology of primary pulmonary hypertension. There is no evidence to suggest that mutations in PAX-11 play a role in the development of pulmonary hypertension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Replace simvastatin with high dose rosuvastatin The most appropriate recommendation for this patient is to replace simvastatin with a high-dose rosuvastatin (Choice C). This patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (elevated LDL cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, family history of premature coronary disease), and despite being on simvastatin, his LDL cholesterol remains elevated at 166 mg/dL. Given the high cardiovascular risk, achieving a lower LDL level is essential. A high-dose statin, like rosuvastatin, is likely to be more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol further, particularly since this patient is not achieving target LDL levels with simvastatin 20 mg. Additionally, rosuvastatin has been shown to have a more potent effect on LDL reduction compared to simvastatin. Incorrect Options: No further adjustment in medication is required (Choice A): This option is incorrect because the patient’s LDL cholesterol remains high despite being on simvastatin, which suggests that further adjustment is necessary. A higher-intensity statin therapy is recommended to reduce LDL cholesterol to a target level, especially given the patient’s elevated cardiovascular risk. Simvastatin should be increased (Choice B): While increasing the dose of simvastatin could further lower LDL cholesterol, rosuvastatin is generally preferred over simvastatin for high-intensity therapy because of its more potent LDL-lowering effect and lower risk of side effects at higher doses. This makes increasing simvastatin less ideal than switching to a more effective statin like rosuvastatin. Gemfibrozil should be added (Choice D): Gemfibrozil is a fibrate that primarily lowers triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol. While this patient has elevated triglycerides (210 mg/dL), the main concern here is the elevated LDL cholesterol, which is the primary target for lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk. Fibrates are not first-line treatments for elevated LDL cholesterol, and adding gemfibrozil would not address the primary issue in this case, making it less appropriate than adjusting statin therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Liraglutide. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. More importantly, it has demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, including reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with established cardiovascular disease. This patient has a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease, making him a candidate for liraglutide, as it not only helps lower blood sugar but also reduces cardiovascular risk. Liraglutide may also help with weight loss, which is beneficial given the patient's risk factors and potential for further cardiovascular deterioration. Incorrect Responses: A. Pioglitazone Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity and lowers blood glucose levels. However, it has significant side effects, including fluid retention, which could worsen this patient's peripheral edema and heart failure symptoms. Additionally, pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions like this one, and would not be a first-line treatment in a patient with known heart failure and peripheral edema. C. Empagliflozin Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which helps lower blood glucose and has shown cardiovascular and renal benefits in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, the patient's serum creatinine is elevated (1.14 mg/dL), and while this is not above the threshold for avoiding SGLT2 inhibitors, renal function should be closely monitored, and the current clinical status of this patient, with stable claudication and worsening peripheral edema, raises concerns about potential side effects such as dehydration and hypotension. Liraglutide is a more appropriate choice due to its more established benefit in this particular patient group. D. Linagliptin Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which also improves blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, while it is generally well tolerated and does not have significant adverse effects like other drugs in this class, it does not offer the same cardiovascular benefits as liraglutide. DPP-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, have not been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in the same way GLP-1 receptor agonists have, making liraglutide the more appropriate choice in a patient with a history of cardiovascular disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) His target blood pressure should be <130/80. According to current hypertension guidelines (including the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines), the target blood pressure for adults with hypertension or at high risk for cardiovascular events is <130/80 mm Hg. This patient has a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 12%, which is considered elevated, and he falls into the category of individuals who should aim for a blood pressure target of <130/80 mm Hg to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Incorrect Responses: A. Serial monitoring of blood pressure While serial monitoring of blood pressure is an important aspect of managing hypertension, it is not a specific recommendation for this patient's scenario. The guidelines emphasize appropriate management of blood pressure through lifestyle modifications and/or antihypertensive medications based on the patient's risk factors and blood pressure readings, rather than relying solely on serial monitoring without active intervention in a high-risk patient. B. Lifestyle Modifications Without Antihypertensive Drugs Lifestyle modifications are recommended as the first step in managing elevated blood pressure, but this patient has a 10-year ASCVD risk of 12%, which is above the threshold for initiating antihypertensive treatment (generally >10% risk). Given his elevated cardiovascular risk and current blood pressure of 138/84 mm Hg, lifestyle changes alone would not be sufficient, and antihypertensive medications would be warranted according to the guidelines. C. Lifestyle Modifications and Beta Blocker Although lifestyle modifications are important, a beta blocker is not typically the first-line choice for managing hypertension, particularly in patients without specific indications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. The first-line antihypertensive agents recommended by guidelines include ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), rather than beta blockers, which are not considered optimal for initial hypertension management in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. This patient has hyperkalemia (serum potassium of 6.8 mmol/L) following the prescription of a potassium-sparing diuretic (triamterene plus hydrochlorothiazide). Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can contribute to hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. In patients with diabetes, especially those with long-standing insulin-requiring diabetes, hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is a common underlying condition. This condition is characterized by reduced renin and aldosterone production, leading to impaired potassium excretion in the kidneys. This can exacerbate the potassium-retaining effects of potassium-sparing diuretics, making it the most likely cause of the patient's elevated potassium level. Incorrect Responses: B. A recent urinary tract infection A urinary tract infection (UTI) does not typically cause hyperkalemia directly. While infections can sometimes lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal dysfunction, there is no indication in this patient’s history that suggests a UTI is responsible for the hyperkalemia. Additionally, the patient’s serum creatinine and BUN have not shown significant changes, making a UTI unlikely as the primary cause of his hyperkalemia. C. Primary hyperaldosteronism Primary hyperaldosteronism is characterized by excess aldosterone secretion, which leads to sodium retention, hypertension, and potassium wasting. This patient's blood pressure is elevated, but the presence of hyperkalemia is inconsistent with primary hyperaldosteronism. In primary hyperaldosteronism, potassium levels typically decrease due to excessive aldosterone, not increase. Therefore, primary hyperaldosteronism is not the likely cause of his elevated potassium. D. Cushing syndrome Cushing syndrome, which results from excess cortisol, can cause hypertension and hypokalemia due to cortisol’s mineralocorticoid-like effects. However, hyperkalemia, as seen in this patient, is not a typical feature of Cushing syndrome. Furthermore, there is no indication of other signs of Cushing syndrome (such as central obesity, moon facies, or purple striae). Therefore, this diagnosis is unlikely in this case.",

Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and dilatation may develop over time . The only effective treatment for patients with COPD and pulmonary hypertension is supplemental oxygen, with several studies showing an improvement in morbidity and mortality. Long-term oxygen therapy is recommended if the resting PaO2 is <60 mmHg. Although digoxin may improve the RV ejection fraction in some patients with RV dilation and dysfunction, it can also contribute to adverse pulmonary vasoconstriction and has not been shown to have a beneficial effect on survival. Furthermore, digitalis toxicity may be precipitated by the hypoxemia and acidemia often associated with COPD. Theophylline, beta-agonists, hydralazine, and other pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., phosphodiesterase inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists such as bosentan) have not been shown to improve survival of patients with pulmonary hypertension due to COPD.",

In elderly patients with hypertension, diuretics have been shown to provide superior cardiovascular protection compared to beta blockers. This is particularly evident in the prevention of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular events. Correct Response: B. Clinical trials have shown that beta blockers offer less cardiovascular protection than diuretic therapy This statement is correct. Large clinical trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), have demonstrated that diuretics (e.g., thiazides) are more effective in reducing the risk of stroke and heart failure in elderly hypertensive patients compared to beta blockers. While beta blockers can effectively lower blood pressure and reduce heart rate, they have been associated with less favorable outcomes in terms of cardiovascular event reduction when used as first-line therapy for hypertension in the elderly. Incorrect Responses: A. Therapy for isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly does not reduce the incidence of future cardiac events This statement is incorrect. Clinical trials have consistently shown that treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly significantly reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial was pivotal in proving the benefits of treating isolated systolic hypertension. C. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients >65 years is not an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes This statement is incorrect. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a well-established independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. In elderly patients with hypertension, LVH signifies chronic pressure overload and significantly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. D. Hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of the elderly is more common in men This statement is incorrect. Hypertensive heart disease, including hypertrophic changes due to chronic pressure overload, does not show a significant gender predilection. Both men and women can develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to hypertension, especially in older age groups.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cardiac catheterization plays an important role in patients with suspected pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to confirm the diagnosis, establish the severity of disease, and determine prognosis. Patients with PAH demonstrate a normal or low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), distinguishing PAH from pulmonary venous hypertension. A vasodilator challenge during catheterization allows assessment of pulmonary vasoreactivity and helps to guide therapy. Such a challenge can be accomplished with intravenous adenosine, intravenous epoprostenol, or inhaled nitric oxide. A favorable acute effect of these vasodilators (i.e., >10 mm Hg decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] to an absolute mean PAP lower than 40 mm Hg) without adverse effects (e.g., a decline in cardiac output or systemic blood pressure, or a rise in PCWP) is predictive of a favorable response to oral calcium channel blockers. An increase in PCWP during vasodilator testing would be consistent with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease or impending left ventricular failure. When oral calcium channel blockers are used to treat PAH, high doses are required to achieve full clinical benefit.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypotension. Hypotension is not a common cardiac finding in hypothyroidism. Instead, hypothyroidism is typically associated with normal or elevated blood pressure due to increased systemic vascular resistance, particularly diastolic hypertension. Correct Response: A. Hypotension This statement is incorrect as a common cardiac finding in hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, which often leads to diastolic hypertension rather than hypotension. Hypotension is more commonly seen in conditions such as adrenal insufficiency or sepsis but not in hypothyroidism. Incorrect Responses: B. Decreased heart rate This statement is correct as a common cardiac finding in hypothyroidism. Bradycardia is a hallmark of hypothyroidism due to the diminished effects of thyroid hormones on the sinoatrial node. These hormones normally stimulate heart rate through increased beta-adrenergic receptor activity. C. Pericardial effusion This statement is correct as a common cardiac finding in hypothyroidism. Pericardial effusions occur due to increased capillary permeability and reduced lymphatic drainage, leading to fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac. These effusions are usually non-inflammatory and rarely cause tamponade. D. Decreased cardiac output This statement is correct as a common cardiac finding in hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism results in reduced myocardial contractility and heart rate, leading to a decline in stroke volume and cardiac output. This reduced output contributes to symptoms such as fatigue and exercise intolerance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sinus tachycardia. Correct Response: Sinus tachycardia Sinus tachycardia is the most common ECG finding in pulmonary embolism (PE). It occurs as a physiological response to hypoxemia, increased sympathetic activation, or right ventricular strain caused by the obstruction in the pulmonary arteries. While specific ECG changes like S1Q3T3 pattern or T-wave inversions may occur, sinus tachycardia is the most frequently observed and least specific finding in patients with PE. It is a sensitive marker for cardiovascular stress but is not diagnostic of PE. Incorrect Responses: (B) T wave inversion in V1-4 This statement is incorrect as T-wave inversion in the anterior leads (V1-V4) is seen in some cases of PE, particularly when there is significant right ventricular strain or dysfunction. However, it is much less common than sinus tachycardia. It is a more specific but less frequent ECG finding associated with severe PE. (C) Prominent Q wave in lead III This statement is incorrect because while a prominent Q wave in lead III can be a component of the S1Q3T3 pattern, which is associated with acute cor pulmonale due to PE, it is not the most common ECG finding. The S1Q3T3 pattern is seen in only a small percentage of PE cases and is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis. (D) Deep S wave in Lead I This statement is incorrect because a deep S wave in lead I is also part of the S1Q3T3 pattern. Similar to the Q wave in lead III, this finding is relatively uncommon and occurs in cases with acute right ventricular strain. While it can suggest PE in the right clinical context, it is far less frequently observed than sinus tachycardia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Should be controlled with medications. Correct Response: Should be controlled with medications This patient is presenting with gestational hypertension (also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension), which is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. While she may be asymptomatic, this condition requires management to prevent complications, including progression to preeclampsia. In preeclampsia, hypertension and proteinuria can cause end-organ damage, particularly to the kidneys, liver, and brain. Therefore, medication is required to control blood pressure and prevent maternal and fetal complications. Common medications include labetalol, methyldopa, and nifedipine, which are considered safe in pregnancy. Incorrect Responses: (A) Improves in the third trimester This statement is incorrect because gestational hypertension typically worsens as pregnancy progresses, especially if it progresses to preeclampsia. It does not usually improve in the third trimester. In fact, the condition can cause more severe complications like eclampsia (seizures) and maternal organ dysfunction as it advances. Therefore, it requires careful monitoring and management. (B) Leads to large-birth-weight babies This statement is incorrect because gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are more often associated with small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies due to uteroplacental insufficiency. This condition impairs fetal growth by reducing placental blood flow, which can result in restricted fetal growth and low birth weight. Large birth weight babies are more commonly seen in cases of gestational diabetes. (D) Spares maternal kidney function This statement is incorrect because gestational hypertension can lead to renal damage in the mother, especially if it progresses to preeclampsia. Proteinuria, which this patient exhibits, is a sign of kidney involvement, as it indicates damage to the glomeruli. If left untreated or uncontrolled, this condition can cause kidney injury, along with other organ complications such as liver damage and cerebrovascular events.",
