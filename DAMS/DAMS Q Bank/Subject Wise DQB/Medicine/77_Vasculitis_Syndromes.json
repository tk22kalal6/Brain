      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis that affects medium and small arteries, typically resulting in vascular inflammation, which can cause organ damage due to poor blood flow. PAN is known to have a wide range of manifestations depending on the organs involved. Digital infarcts (as seen in this patient, involving the 2nd and 3rd fingers of the right side and 5th finger of the left side) are highly suggestive of PAN, as it can cause ischemic damage to fingers and toes due to compromised blood flow from affected vessels. Hypertension is common in PAN due to renal involvement (leading to renovascular hypertension from renal artery inflammation). Neuropathy (asymmetrical neuropathy in this case) can also occur in PAN due to involvement of the peripheral nerves by the vasculitis. The proteinuria and RBCs in urine indicate possible renal involvement, which is a common feature in PAN, though renal failure may not always occur in the early stages. This patient's presentation of digital infarcts, asymmetrical neuropathy, proteinuria, and hypertension makes Polyarteritis nodosa the most likely diagnosis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): While SLE can present with renal involvement (proteinuria), SLE typically presents with a butterfly-shaped rash, joint involvement, and other autoimmune features (such as positive ANA). The digital infarcts and asymmetrical neuropathy in this patient are more consistent with vasculitis, which is characteristic of polyarteritis nodosa rather than SLE. SLE does not typically cause digital infarcts or the same pattern of neuropathy. C) Wegener’s granulomatosis (now known as Granulomatosis with polyangiitis): Wegener’s granulomatosis usually affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. It often presents with sinusitis, pulmonary nodules, or renal involvement, and is associated with c-ANCA positivity. This patient’s lack of respiratory symptoms and digital infarcts make Wegener's granulomatosis less likely. Additionally, proteinuria in this patient is not associated with the typical renal findings of glomerulonephritis seen in Wegener’s. D) Mixed cryoglobulinemia: Mixed cryoglobulinemia often presents with purpura, arthralgia, and glomerulonephritis, but it is typically associated with chronic hepatitis C infection and has cryoglobulins in the blood. It also presents with more systemic symptoms like Raynaud’s phenomenon and skin lesions (such as purpura). The absence of cryoglobulins in this case and the lack of hepatitis C symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki disease). Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that primarily affects children and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in pediatric patients. It commonly causes coronary artery aneurysms and arterial dilation, which can lead to sudden cardiac death if left untreated. The cardiac complications of Kawasaki disease, particularly coronary artery abnormalities, are the most frequent cause of cardiac death in children from acquired heart diseases. Early recognition and appropriate treatment (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin) can reduce the risk of long-term cardiovascular complications. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Takayasu disease: Takayasu arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis that most commonly affects young women and involves the aorta and its branches. It is less common in children, and while it can cause cardiovascular issues, including aortic aneurysms, it is not the most common cause of cardiac death in children due to acquired heart disease. This condition is more prevalent in adults. C) Henoch-Schonlein purpura: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that typically presents with purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal involvement in children. While HSP can lead to renal complications, it is not commonly associated with significant cardiac death or major heart complications in children. HSP's cardiovascular impact is usually much less pronounced than in conditions like Kawasaki disease. D) Rheumatic heart disease: Rheumatic heart disease is a sequela of rheumatic fever, which is a complication of group A streptococcal infections. It primarily affects the heart valves, leading to valvular heart disease. While it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, it is less common in children in developed countries due to better treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and prophylactic antibiotics. Thus, rheumatic heart disease is not the most common cause of cardiac death in children today, particularly in areas with appropriate medical intervention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Blood in stool. Anaphylactoid purpura, also known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), is a small vessel vasculitis that commonly affects children. One of the hallmark features of HSP is the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloody stools. This is often due to vasculitis affecting the small vessels of the gastrointestinal system, leading to hemorrhage in the bowel. Thus, blood in the stool is a classic symptom in this condition. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, is not a typical feature of anaphylactoid purpura (HSP). In fact, platelet counts are usually normal in HSP, and the condition is more associated with vasculitis and purpura (a type of rash). Thrombocytopenia is more commonly seen in other conditions such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), where low platelet counts lead to increased bleeding tendencies, but it is not characteristic of HSP. C) Intracranial hemorrhage: Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious complication of many vasculitides, but it is not a common feature of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). Although HSP can affect various organs, including the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract, intracranial hemorrhage is not typically seen in HSP. Neurological involvement in HSP is rare, and when it occurs, it usually presents as seizures or headaches rather than significant bleeding in the brain. D) Susceptibility to infection: Susceptibility to infection is not a characteristic of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. HSP is an immune-mediated disease and not primarily a disorder of immune deficiency. While the condition may occasionally be triggered by infections (such as upper respiratory tract infections), it does not typically lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Susceptibility to infection is more characteristic of conditions like immunodeficiencies or when the immune system is suppressed by medications, such as corticosteroids or chemotherapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Wegener’s granulomatosis (now known as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - GPA). Wegener’s granulomatosis is a type of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which is a form of small-vessel vasculitis. It commonly involves the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. The clinical features in this case, including bilateral conductive deafness, palpable purpura, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), a thin-walled lung cavity, and renal involvement (cellular casts and elevated serum creatinine), all point towards this condition. Conductive deafness can occur due to involvement of the middle ear and nasal passages, both of which are commonly affected in GPA. The palpable purpura is a typical feature of vasculitis, especially in GPA. Hemoptysis and a thin-walled lung cavity are classic findings in GPA, where the disease causes granulomatous inflammation and cavitary lesions in the lungs. Renal involvement in GPA often manifests with glomerulonephritis, which can lead to renal impairment, as seen in this case with cell casts and elevated serum creatinine. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP): HSP is a form of small-vessel vasculitis, primarily affecting the skin, kidneys, joints, and gastrointestinal system. While palpable purpura is a feature of HSP, the other clinical findings in this patient, such as bilateral conductive deafness, hemoptysis, and a lung cavity, are not typical for HSP. Furthermore, HSP does not commonly cause glomerulonephritis with such significant renal impairment or cavitary lung lesions. B) Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA): Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is another small-vessel vasculitis, often presenting with renal and pulmonary involvement, like in this case. However, MPA typically does not cause granulomatous inflammation or the formation of cavitary lung lesions. Additionally, conductive deafness is not a common feature of MPA. The presence of granulomas (in the lungs and upper respiratory tract) in this patient makes Wegener's granulomatosis a more likely diagnosis. D) Goodpasture’s syndrome: Goodpasture's syndrome involves anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. While the patient’s hemoptysis and renal involvement might suggest this condition, Goodpasture's syndrome does not typically present with palpable purpura, bilateral conductive deafness, or thin-walled lung cavities. The radiological finding of a cavity is more consistent with granulomatous inflammation seen in Wegener’s granulomatosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Takayasu’s arteritis. Takayasu’s arteritis is a large-vessel vasculitis that typically affects young women, especially those under 40 years of age. It commonly presents with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, chronic diarrhea, and postprandial abdominal pain due to mesenteric ischemia (lack of blood supply to the intestines). The high blood pressure (160/100 mm Hg) observed in this patient could indicate renal artery involvement, a common feature in Takayasu’s arteritis, leading to renal artery stenosis and secondary hypertension. This patient's clinical presentation, along with the inconclusive abdominal ultrasound and negative serologies for autoimmune conditions (antinuclear antibodies and anti-endomysial antibodies), makes Takayasu's arteritis the most likely diagnosis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (Celiac disease): Celiac disease typically presents with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain; however, the patient’s negative anti-endomysial antibody result makes this diagnosis unlikely. Celiac disease is associated with autoantibodies such as anti-endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. The absence of these markers in this patient significantly reduces the likelihood of celiac disease. Additionally, the hypertension and the systemic symptoms are not typical for this condition. B) Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN): Polyarteritis nodosa is another vasculitis that can affect medium-sized arteries and presents with a variety of systemic symptoms, including weight loss, abdominal pain, and hypertension. However, PAN typically affects medium-sized arteries rather than the large vessels seen in Takayasu's arteritis. Additionally, PAN is often associated with positive hepatitis B serologies or other underlying infections, which are not mentioned in this case. Furthermore, the inconclusive abdominal ultrasound in this case does not point to PAN, which typically affects organs such as the kidneys, heart, and gastrointestinal tract in a different pattern. D) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Systemic lupus erythematosus can also cause weight loss, abdominal pain, and hypertension, but it is usually accompanied by positive autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies. The negative ANA result in this patient rules out SLE as a likely diagnosis. Additionally, while SLE can cause renal involvement and hypertension, the abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea in the absence of other typical SLE findings (like a malar rash or photosensitivity) make this diagnosis less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chronic Granulomatous Polyangiitis (CGPA), also known as Wegener's Granulomatosis. Chronic Granulomatous Polyangiitis (CGPA) is a form of small-vessel vasculitis that commonly affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. The typical features of CGPA include: Pulmonary cavities (resulting from granulomatous inflammation in the lungs, which can lead to necrosis and cavity formation). Hematuria (blood in the urine, a result of glomerulonephritis, which is commonly associated with CGPA). Red blood cell casts in the urine, indicating glomerular injury, which is characteristic of glomerulonephritis in this condition. The combination of pulmonary cavities, hematuria, and red blood cell casts points towards CGPA, as these are hallmark signs of the disease affecting both the lungs and kidneys. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Anti-GBM Disease: Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is also known as Goodpasture's syndrome. It primarily affects the lungs (causing alveolar hemorrhage) and kidneys (leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis). However, pulmonary cavities are not a feature of Goodpasture's syndrome. Instead, this disease tends to present with hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and renal failure, but not typically with pulmonary cavities. B) Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA): EGPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) is another small-vessel vasculitis, but it is typically associated with eosinophilia (high eosinophil count) and features such as asthma and sinusitis. While EGPA can cause pulmonary infiltrates, it is less likely to present with pulmonary cavities. Hematuria can be seen in EGPA, but it is more associated with eosinophilic granulomas rather than the granulomatous inflammation seen in CGPA. C) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease that can affect the kidneys (lupus nephritis), leading to hematuria and red blood cell casts. However, pulmonary cavities are not typically seen in SLE. In SLE, the pulmonary involvement is more commonly associated with pleuritis or interstitial lung disease, rather than cavitary lung lesions. Therefore, the presence of pulmonary cavities makes SLE less likely in this case.",

Wegener's granulomatosis (now called Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - GPA) is a type of small-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. The auto-antibody most specifically associated with Wegener's granulomatosis is anti-proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). This auto-antibody targets proteinase 3, which is an enzyme found in neutrophil granules. PR3-ANCA is highly specific for GPA, making it a key diagnostic marker for the disease. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO): Anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies are associated with another form of ANCA-associated vasculitis, called Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis). While MPO-ANCA can be present in Wegener's granulomatosis, it is more commonly seen in MPA, making it less specific than PR3-ANCA for Wegener's granulomatosis. B) Antinuclear antibody (ANA): Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are non-specific auto-antibodies commonly seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. ANA is not specific for Wegener's granulomatosis and is not typically used to diagnose this condition. The presence of ANA does not help in distinguishing Wegener's granulomatosis from other autoimmune diseases. C) Anti-double stranded DNA antibody (anti ds DNA): Anti-double stranded DNA antibodies are highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially in active renal lupus. These antibodies are not associated with Wegener's granulomatosis and do not play a role in its diagnosis. Hence, anti-ds DNA is not relevant to Wegener's granulomatosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) ESR – Giant cell arteritis. The patient presents with severe unilateral headache, scalp tenderness, and bilateral shoulder and neck pain, which are hallmark features of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. Giant cell arteritis is an inflammatory condition that affects the large and medium arteries, primarily the temporal arteries. The elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is the most useful screening test for diagnosing GCA, as it is typically elevated in active cases. Scalp tenderness and a headache involving the temporal area are also classic symptoms of GCA. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications such as vision loss. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) CPK levels – Polymyositis: CPK (creatine phosphokinase) levels are typically elevated in muscle diseases, such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis, which cause muscle inflammation. However, polymyositis is not consistent with the patient's presentation of unilateral headache, scalp tenderness, and neck/shoulder pain. This condition primarily affects the muscles and is not related to arterial inflammation like GCA. Therefore, CPK is not the ideal test for this case. C) ANA – SLE: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including joint pain, rash, and organ involvement. However, the patient’s symptoms—headache, scalp tenderness, and neck pain—are more characteristic of Giant Cell Arteritis rather than SLE, and ANA would not be the most appropriate screening test here. D) Clinical evaluation for Migraine: While migraine can cause unilateral headache, the other symptoms in this patient—scalp tenderness and shoulder/neck pain—are not typical for a migraine. The presence of scalp tenderness and elevated ESR suggests an inflammatory condition like Giant Cell Arteritis rather than a primary headache disorder. Migraine is less likely to explain the full range of symptoms presented by the patient.",

Behçet’s syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by oral and genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and thrombophlebitis, but myocarditis is not typically associated with this condition. While Behçet's syndrome can involve various organ systems, including the eyes, skin, and vascular system, it does not commonly cause myocarditis, which refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis is not a hallmark feature of Behçet's syndrome, making A the correct answer. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Erythema Nodosum: Erythema nodosum is a skin manifestation often associated with Behçet’s syndrome. It appears as painful, red nodules, usually on the shins, and is a common finding in Behçet’s syndrome. Therefore, this option is a characteristic feature of the disease, not an exception. C) Oral and genital ulcers: Oral and genital ulcers are the hallmark symptoms of Behçet’s syndrome. These painful ulcers typically appear repeatedly and are often the first signs of the disease. They are key diagnostic features of Behçet’s syndrome, so this statement is correct and not an exception. D) Thrombophlebitis: Thrombophlebitis, which is the inflammation of a vein associated with a blood clot, is another common feature of Behçet’s syndrome. It can lead to venous thrombosis and is often seen in Behçet's syndrome due to the underlying vascular inflammation. Hence, this is a feature of the condition, not an exception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Post-capillary venules. Hypersensitivity vasculitis (also known as allergic vasculitis) primarily affects the post-capillary venules. This form of vasculitis is typically immune-mediated, often triggered by an antigen-antibody complex deposited in the small vessels. The post-capillary venules are most susceptible to these complexes, leading to inflammation, leakage of fluid, and the formation of purpura (a characteristic skin lesion in hypersensitivity vasculitis). Therefore, the most commonly involved vessels in hypersensitivity vasculitis are post-capillary venules. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Capillaries: Capillaries can be affected in various types of vasculitis, but they are not the primary site of involvement in hypersensitivity vasculitis. The post-capillary venules are typically more involved in this condition, as they are the site where immune complexes are deposited and trigger the inflammatory response. B) Arterioles: Arterioles are less commonly involved in hypersensitivity vasculitis. While they can be affected in certain forms of vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa, they are not typically the primary site of inflammation in hypersensitivity vasculitis, which primarily targets the post-capillary venules. D) Medium sized arteries: Medium-sized arteries are typically affected in conditions like polyarteritis nodosa or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, in hypersensitivity vasculitis, the vessels involved are usually smaller vessels, specifically post-capillary venules, and not larger arteries.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Proteinase 3. c-ANCA (cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) is most commonly associated with Wegener's granulomatosis (now called granulomatosis with polyangiitis). These antibodies are directed against Proteinase 3 (PR3), which is a protein found in the granules of neutrophils. The presence of c-ANCA is a key diagnostic marker for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, where it plays a role in the inflammatory process of small- to medium-sized blood vessels. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Myeloperoxidase: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the target antigen for p-ANCA (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody), not c-ANCA. p-ANCA is more commonly seen in microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome), not in granulomatosis with polyangiitis where c-ANCA is the dominant marker. C) Cytoplasmic Anti-Nuclear Antibody: Cytoplasmic anti-nuclear antibodies (CANA) are not a specific target for c-ANCA. c-ANCA specifically targets Proteinase 3 within neutrophils, and it is distinct from anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), which are typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases but are not relevant to the classification of c-ANCA positivity. D) Anti-centromere antibody: Anti-centromere antibodies are associated with limited scleroderma (a subtype of systemic sclerosis). They are not related to c-ANCA or proteinase 3 and are typically used in diagnosing scleroderma, not vasculitis diseases like granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",

Granulomatous pathology refers to the formation of granulomas, which are organized collections of macrophages that often form as a result of chronic inflammation. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) does not typically involve granulomatous inflammation. PAN is a type of vasculitis that affects medium-sized arteries and can cause tissue damage due to ischemia, but it is characterized by a necrotizing inflammation rather than granulomatous formation. Therefore, it is not associated with granulomatous pathology. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Wegener’s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis): Wegener’s granulomatosis (now referred to as granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is a granulomatous vasculitis that primarily affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. It is one of the classic examples of a disease associated with granulomatous inflammation. The disease is characterized by granuloma formation in the upper and lower airways, as well as in the kidneys, making it a prime example of granulomatous pathology. B) Takayasu’s Arteritis: Takayasu’s arteritis is a type of large vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and its branches. It can lead to granulomatous inflammation in the affected vessels. The granulomatous changes in the vessel wall are a hallmark of Takayasu’s arteritis, which makes it associated with granulomatous pathology. D) Giant Cell Arteritis: Giant cell arteritis (also known as temporal arteritis) is a form of vasculitis that predominantly affects large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the temporal arteries. It is associated with granulomatous inflammation of the vessel walls, characterized by the presence of giant cells (multinucleated giant cells) within the vessel walls.

Wegener’s granulomatosis, now known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), is a type of granulomatous vasculitis that primarily affects the lungs, kidneys, and upper respiratory tract. It is associated with the formation of granulomas, particularly in the respiratory tract, and it often leads to pulmonary involvement (such as lung nodules or cavitary lesions) and renal involvement (typically rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis). It can also affect the eyes, leading to symptoms such as conjunctivitis, scleritis, or retro-orbital masses. However, the liver is not typically affected in Wegener’s granulomatosis. Therefore, the liver is the organ least likely to be involved in this disease. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Lung: The lungs are one of the most commonly affected organs in Wegener’s granulomatosis. Patients often present with pulmonary symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath, and chest imaging may show nodules, cavitary lesions, or infiltrates. Lung involvement is a hallmark feature of GPA. C) Kidney: The kidneys are also commonly affected in Wegener’s granulomatosis. The disease can lead to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which can result in kidney failure if not treated promptly. Renal involvement is significant and requires monitoring of renal function in affected patients. D) Eyes: Ocular involvement is seen in about 10-30% of patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HSP (Henoch-Schonlein purpura). Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that primarily affects children but can also occur in adults. It is characterized by a classic tetrad of palpable purpura, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. The rashes in HSP are typically purpuric and are often located on the lower extremities. The abdominal pain is usually related to intestinal ischemia, and patients may experience bloody stools or vomiting. Arthritis typically affects the knees and ankles. The most probable diagnosis in this case, based on the symptoms of abdominal pain, palpable purpura, and arthritis, is HSP. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Sweet syndrome: Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare condition characterized by fever, erythematous or raised skin lesions, and neutrophilic infiltration on biopsy. While it can present with rash, it is typically not associated with palpable purpura, arthritis, or abdominal pain. This makes Sweet syndrome less likely in this scenario. C) Hemochromatosis: Hemochromatosis is a condition characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body. It may lead to organ damage, especially to the liver, heart, and pancreas, but it does not typically present with rash, arthritis, or abdominal pain.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Polyarteritis nodosa. The patient's presentation of fever, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy (including left foot drop) strongly suggests a systemic vasculitis. Given the absence of positive ANCA, ANA, and the negative urinalysis for casts, protein, and red blood cells, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is the most likely diagnosis. Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium-vessel vasculitis that can involve multiple organs, including the nervous system, leading to peripheral neuropathy. The foot drop and bilateral sensory peripheral neuropathy in this patient are classic signs of peripheral nerve involvement. PAN can also present with systemic features such as fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss, without significant renal involvement or positive serological markers like ANCA or ANA, making it distinct from other vasculitides like Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangitis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Good Pasture syndrome: Goodpasture syndrome typically presents with glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, characterized by hemoptysis and renal dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, hematuria). This patient does not exhibit signs of renal involvement (no proteinuria or hematuria) or pulmonary symptoms (like hemoptysis or cough). Therefore, Goodpasture syndrome is unlikely in this case. B) Wegener’s granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis): Wegener's granulomatosis, now called granulomatosis with polyangiitis, typically presents with upper respiratory tract involvement (such as sinusitis or nasal ulcers), lung involvement (hemoptysis or pulmonary infiltrates), and renal involvement (glomerulonephritis). While this patient has neurological symptoms, she lacks the characteristic respiratory and renal findings seen in Wegener's granulomatosis, and the negative ANCA result further rules it out. C) Microscopic polyangitis: Microscopic polyangitis (MPA) is a small-vessel vasculitis that usually presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary involvement (hemoptysis). The negative ANCA test in this case makes MPA less likely, as ANCA is typically positive in MPA. Additionally, the patient does not show signs of renal dysfunction or pulmonary hemorrhage, which are common in MPA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Arteritis with giant cells. This 70-year-old woman presents with symptoms suggestive of temporal arteritis (also called giant cell arteritis), a common cause of headaches, fatigue, weight loss, and jaw claudication in older adults. The brief loss of partial vision (amaurosis fugax) is concerning for ischemia of the optic nerve, which can be a complication of giant cell arteritis if left untreated, potentially leading to permanent blindness. Biopsy of the temporal artery typically reveals granulomatous inflammation with giant cells, which is the hallmark of giant cell arteritis. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the temporal arteries, and this finding is diagnostic. The patient is already started on prednisone (steroid therapy) to manage the condition, which is the mainstay of treatment to prevent complications like blindness or stroke. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Immune complex deposition: Immune complex deposition is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis. However, giant cell arteritis is not caused by immune complexes but by an inflammatory response within the arterial wall, specifically granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. This option is more typical of diseases that involve systemic vasculitis with immune complex formation, not giant cell arteritis. C) Lymphocytic infiltration: Lymphocytic infiltration is typically seen in conditions like T-cell mediated vasculitis or viral infections. While some vasculitides might show lymphocytic infiltration, giant cell arteritis is most notably characterized by granulomatous inflammation with giant cells, rather than just lymphocytic infiltration. The granulomas formed in giant cell arteritis are distinct from the more common lymphocytic infiltrates found in other types of vasculitis. D) Type II muscle fiber atrophy: Type II muscle fiber atrophy occurs in the context of neuromuscular disorders, particularly in conditions like muscular dystrophies, myopathies, or prolonged immobilization. It is unrelated to giant cell arteritis, which primarily affects arteries, not muscles. This option is not relevant to the patient’s presentation or diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Combination Therapy with Steroids and Cyclophosphamide. This patient's presentation is most consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries. The symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, and the livedo reticularis rash (a sign of impaired circulation in the skin due to small vessel inflammation) are characteristic of PAN. PAN is often associated with neurologic manifestations such as peripheral neuropathy and foot drop, which can occur due to involvement of the small vessels supplying the nerves. The patient also has an elevated ESR and WBC, which suggest active inflammation, and the biopsy showing small blood vessel inflammation further supports the diagnosis. The management of polyarteritis nodosa typically involves immunosuppressive therapy, and the combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide is the recommended treatment for severe or systemic PAN, particularly when there is evidence of significant organ involvement or active inflammation, as in this case. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis is generally used for conditions involving autoimmune diseases that are associated with circulating autoantibodies or immune complexes, such as goodpasture syndrome or certain cases of lupus nephritis. However, polyarteritis nodosa is not typically treated with plasmapheresis, as it does not involve circulating autoantibodies or immune complexes. Plasmapheresis would not be the most appropriate next step in this patient’s management. B) Steroid Therapy Alone: While steroids are an important part of the treatment for polyarteritis nodosa, they are usually not sufficient as monotherapy in severe cases or those involving multiple organs. This patient has systemic manifestations and active inflammation, which requires additional immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclophosphamide. Using steroids alone might not adequately control the disease, which is why combination therapy with cyclophosphamide is preferred in such cases. D) Cyclophosphamide Therapy Alone: Cyclophosphamide is an effective immunosuppressive agent used in polyarteritis nodosa, particularly for more severe or life-threatening cases. However, in most cases, cyclophosphamide is used in combination with steroids for a synergistic effect. Steroids alone help control inflammation early on, while cyclophosphamide is used for more aggressive suppression of the immune response. Using cyclophosphamide alone would not address the initial inflammatory response and would likely result in a delay in symptom control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hemolytic anemia. This patient has Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and the symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia are confirmed by her laboratory results. The key findings that point towards hemolytic anemia in this case include: Jaundice, which indicates increased bilirubin (total bilirubin of 4 mg/dL). Positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), which is indicative of autoimmune hemolysis. The DAT tests for the presence of antibodies or complement on the surface of red blood cells, which is characteristic of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a common complication of SLE. The reticulocyte count of 4% is elevated, indicating increased red blood cell production in response to anemia. Hemoglobin of 9 g/dL and increased LDH (300 U/L) are also indicative of red blood cell destruction (hemolysis). SLE is commonly associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and this patient's presentation (fatigue, jaundice, positive DAT, low hemoglobin, elevated reticulocytes, and LDH) is consistent with this diagnosis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Autoimmune hepatitis: While autoimmune hepatitis can cause jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, this patient's liver function tests (AST 20 U/L, ALT 15 U/L) are normal, and there is no history of significant liver disease. The positive DAT, elevated reticulocytes, and elevated LDH suggest a hemolytic process, not a primary liver issue. Therefore, autoimmune hepatitis is unlikely. C) Viral hepatitis: Viral hepatitis could cause jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, but this patient's AST and ALT levels are normal, and there is no indication of a viral infection. Additionally, the presence of positive DAT and hemolysis indicators (e.g., elevated reticulocyte count, LDH, and jaundice) points towards a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia, not viral hepatitis. D) Gilbert syndrome: Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition characterized by elevated unconjugated bilirubin due to a mild defect in bilirubin conjugation. However, in this case, the total bilirubin is elevated, and the direct bilirubin is also slightly elevated (0.5 mg/dL). This suggests conjugated (direct) bilirubin elevation, which is more consistent with hemolytic anemia or liver dysfunction rather than Gilbert syndrome, where the unconjugated bilirubin is typically elevated. Additionally, the presence of positive DAT and elevated reticulocyte count further supports the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia rather than Gilbert syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Aortic dilatation. This 16-year-old boy is presenting with features strongly suggestive of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The characteristic signs of Marfan syndrome include long fingers (arachnodactyly), pectus excavatum, high arched palate, joint hypermobility, positive wrist and thumb signs, and increased arm span relative to height (ratio >1.05). Additionally, the presence of a diastolic murmur could suggest aortic insufficiency, a common cardiovascular complication in Marfan syndrome, resulting from aortic dilation. Aortic dilatation is a well-known and potentially life-threatening feature of Marfan syndrome due to weakness in the connective tissue of the aortic wall, which can lead to aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection. A chest X-ray (CXR) in this case may reveal aortic dilatation, particularly at the ascending aorta, which is a hallmark of Marfan syndrome. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Dextrocardia: Dextrocardia, a condition where the heart is located on the right side of the chest instead of the left, is typically a congenital anomaly and is not associated with Marfan syndrome. There is no evidence in the clinical presentation of this patient to suggest dextrocardia. C) Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax (air in the pleural space causing lung collapse) can occasionally be seen in Marfan syndrome due to the association with lung apices and blebs (small air-filled sacs). However, there are no clinical signs (e.g., acute chest pain, dyspnea, asymmetrical chest expansion) to suggest a pneumothorax in this patient. Moreover, a pneumothorax would typically present with acute respiratory symptoms, which are absent here. D) Apical interstitial fibrosis: Apical interstitial fibrosis refers to a condition where there is scarring of the lung tissue, often seen in diseases like sarcoidosis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but it is not typically associated with Marfan syndrome. The patient's clear chest examination and absence of respiratory complaints make this less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Abdominal angiography. This patient presents with systemic symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, peripheral neuropathy (left foot drop), and elevated ESR. These features are suggestive of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that predominantly affects medium-sized arteries. The absence of ANCA and eosinophilia further supports the diagnosis, as PAN is classically ANCA-negative and not associated with eosinophilia. Abdominal angiography is a key diagnostic tool for PAN. It can demonstrate microaneurysms, irregular arterial narrowing, and stenosis in medium-sized arteries, which are characteristic of the disease. These vascular abnormalities confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Testicular biopsy: While testicular biopsy can sometimes aid in the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis, it is only appropriate when there are specific symptoms or findings involving the testes. This patient has no testicular symptoms, so this method would not provide relevant diagnostic information. B) Skin biopsy: A skin biopsy is helpful in diagnosing vasculitis if skin lesions, such as palpable purpura or ulcers, are present. However, this patient has no skin involvement, so a biopsy would not be diagnostic in this case. C) CT chest: A CT chest is more useful in diagnosing vasculitis involving the lungs, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pain in the jaw when chewing. This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, a condition that commonly occurs in older adults. The triad of headaches, systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss), and proximal muscle pain and stiffness (indicative of associated polymyalgia rheumatica) strongly points toward GCA. One of the hallmark symptoms of GCA is jaw claudication, characterized by pain or fatigue in the jaw muscles during chewing, caused by ischemia to the masseter muscles due to inflammation of the temporal artery or other branches of the external carotid artery. Jaw claudication is a highly specific symptom for GCA and provides strong diagnostic support. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Throat pain on swallowing: Throat pain is not a typical feature of GCA. While GCA can involve other branches of the carotid artery, causing pain in the head or neck, this symptom is less specific and is not as diagnostically helpful as jaw claudication. C) Malaise: Malaise is a nonspecific symptom seen in many systemic inflammatory conditions, including GCA. Although it supports the presence of a systemic illness, it is not as specific or diagnostically useful as jaw claudication. D) Fatigue: Fatigue is another nonspecific symptom that can be seen in a wide variety of conditions, including GCA, polymyalgia rheumatica, infections, and malignancies. While it contributes to the overall clinical picture, it does not provide specific diagnostic value.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Churg-Strauss disease Churg-Strauss disease, also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), is a type of small-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the lungs, skin, peripheral nerves, and kidneys. The following points support this diagnosis: Clinical features: The patient has a history of asthma and nasal allergies, which are common in Churg-Strauss disease. This disease often presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis. The acute development of left foot drop (a sign of peripheral neuropathy) is a hallmark feature of vasculitis affecting the peripheral nervous system. Laboratory findings: The patient’s elevated ESR, WBC with 10% eosinophils, and 1+ proteinuria are consistent with an eosinophilic vasculitis. Eosinophilia is a key marker in Churg-Strauss disease. Chest findings: The bilateral pulmonary infiltrates seen on CXR are suggestive of pulmonary involvement, which is common in Churg-Strauss disease. This often leads to asthma exacerbations and can progress to more severe pulmonary involvement. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN): Polyarteritis nodosa is a type of vasculitis affecting medium and small-sized arteries. PAN typically presents with constitutional symptoms, skin lesions, and possible renal or gastrointestinal involvement, but it is not commonly associated with eosinophilia or asthma. Furthermore, PAN does not typically cause the peripheral neuropathy with eosinophilia seen here. C) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP): HSP is a vasculitis that primarily affects small vessels and typically presents with palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis, and renal involvement (often hematuria and proteinuria). It is most common in children and is not usually associated with eosinophilia or asthma. The absence of purpura or a history of gastrointestinal symptoms makes HSP unlikely in this patient. D) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, kidneys, and central nervous system. While SLE can cause renal issues and systemic inflammation, it is less likely to present with eosinophilia or the combination of asthma and peripheral neuropathy seen in this case. The lack of classic features such as a malar rash, photosensitivity, or positive ANA makes SLE less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Polyarteritis nodosa Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects medium and small-sized arteries, and it is typically negative for both ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) and ANA (antinuclear antibodies). PAN is characterized by the following: Negative ANCA and ANA: PAN is not associated with ANCA or ANA positivity, which helps distinguish it from other vasculitides like Churg-Strauss disease or SLE, which commonly present with these antibodies. Clinical Features: PAN can affect multiple organ systems, particularly the kidneys, skin, peripheral nerves, and gastrointestinal system. It presents with a range of nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue, but the absence of ANCA and ANA supports a diagnosis of PAN in this case. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Churg-Strauss disease: Churg-Strauss disease (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is often positive for ANCA, particularly perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA), and is commonly associated with eosinophilia. This makes it unlikely to be negative for both ANCA and ANA. The presence of asthma and eosinophilia would also point toward this diagnosis. C) Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP): HSP is a small-vessel vasculitis that typically affects children and is not associated with ANCA or ANA. However, the disease usually presents with palpable purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal involvement (hematuria). The absence of purpura or GI symptoms in this patient makes HSP unlikely despite the negative ANCA/ANA test. D) Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic condition that does not cause vasculitis or require the testing of ANCA or ANA. While diabetes can lead to microvascular and macrovascular complications, it does not directly cause the systemic vasculitis seen in conditions like PAN or Churg-Strauss disease. Diabetes is unlikely to be the cause of symptoms related to vasculitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Wegener’s granulomatosis Wegener’s granulomatosis (now known as Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is a type of ANCA-associated vasculitis that most commonly affects small to medium-sized blood vessels. This diagnosis is supported by the following findings in this case: Positive c-ANCA: The presence of c-ANCA (cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) is highly suggestive of Wegener’s granulomatosis, which is characterized by vasculitis, particularly involving the upper respiratory tract (e.g., nasal ulcers), lungs (pulmonary infiltrates), and kidneys (proteinuria with red cell casts). This is the hallmark of this disease. Nasal ulcer: A nasal septal ulcer is a classic finding in Wegener’s granulomatosis due to the involvement of the upper respiratory tract. Pulmonary involvement: The patient presents with cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, all of which are common in Wegener’s granulomatosis, where the lungs are frequently affected. Renal involvement: The presence of proteinuria with red cell casts suggests glomerulonephritis, a typical feature of Wegener’s granulomatosis, where the kidneys are often affected in this vasculitis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Giant cell arteritis: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the temporal arteries and is characterized by symptoms like headache, visual disturbances, and jaw claudication, rather than pulmonary or renal involvement. It is not associated with c-ANCA, nasal ulcers, or the findings seen in this case. Therefore, GCA is unlikely. B) Churg-Strauss disease: Churg-Strauss disease (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is another ANCA-associated vasculitis, but it is typically characterized by eosinophilia (which is absent in this case) and is more likely to present with asthma and sinusitis. It often involves the lungs, but the nasal ulcer and glomerulonephritis seen in this case make Churg-Strauss less likely. Additionally, c-ANCA is typically negative in Churg-Strauss, whereas it is positive in this patient. C) Henoch-Schönlein purpura: Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small-vessel vasculitis that commonly affects children and is characterized by palpable purpura, arthritis, and renal involvement (usually as hematuria).

This diagnosis is supported by the following key findings in the case: Palpable purpuric rash: The palpable purpura is a classic manifestation of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, typically seen on the lower extremities (as in this case), resulting from small vessel vasculitis. Abdominal pain: Abdominal discomfort is a common feature in HSP and can range from mild discomfort to severe abdominal pain. This is often caused by intestinal vasculitis and can lead to complications like bowel perforation or bleeding. Proteinuria and elevated creatinine: Renal involvement, manifesting as proteinuria and sometimes hematuria, is commonly seen in Henoch-Schönlein purpura. This can progress to renal impairment (as in this patient with an elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL), particularly in adults. IgA and C3 deposition: The biopsy showing IgA and C3 deposition on immunofluorescence is a hallmark of HSP, as this disease is characterized by IgA-mediated vasculitis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Giant cell arteritis: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects older adults (typically >50 years) and involves arteries like the temporal artery. It presents with headache, visual disturbances, and jaw claudication, rather than the palpable purpura and renal involvement seen in this case.

The key features in this case that support this diagnosis include: Recurrent oral and genital ulcers: Behcet's syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, which this patient has. These painful ulcers are often one of the first signs of the disease and are a hallmark feature. Eye involvement: The red and tearing left eye suggests uveitis, which is common in Behcet's syndrome. Eye inflammation, especially uveitis, is a significant and often debilitating manifestation of the disease. Arthritis: The painful, inflamed joints (left wrist and right knee) are consistent with Behcet's syndrome, which can cause arthritis, typically in the form of non-erosive, intermittent joint inflammation. Thrombosis history: The history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in this patient is also a potential clue. Behcet's syndrome can be associated with thrombophilic states and vascular involvement, leading to an increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis. Elevated ESR and CRP: These markers of inflammation are often elevated in Behcet's syndrome, which is a systemic inflammatory condition. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Churg-Strauss disease: Churg-Strauss disease (now called eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is an ANCA-associated vasculitis characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis. The patient does not have symptoms of asthma, nor does he have eosinophilia, and his ANCA test is negative, making this diagnosis unlikely. Also, oral and genital ulcers and uveitis are not typical for Churg-Strauss. C) Henoch-Schönlein purpura: Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small-vessel vasculitis primarily seen in children and characterized by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, and renal involvement (proteinuria or hematuria). It does not typically present with recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, or arthritis as seen in this patient. Additionally, the patient’s negative eosinophil count and normal ANCA further differentiate HSP from Behcet's syndrome. D) Wegener’s granulomatosis: Wegener's granulomatosis (now called granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is another ANCA-associated vasculitis. It is typically associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as sinusitis, nasal ulcers, and lung infiltrates, as well as renal involvement.
