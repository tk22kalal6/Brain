      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) MCTD (Mixed Connective Tissue Disease). The combination of polyarthritis, oral ulcers, dryness of the eyes, and positive anti-U1RNP antibodies is highly suggestive of Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD). MCTD is a condition that shares features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic sclerosis. It is characterized by the presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies, which is a key marker distinguishing MCTD from other autoimmune diseases. The presence of elevated ANA (antinuclear antibody) and RF (rheumatoid factor) further supports this diagnosis. MCTD typically presents with a combination of symptoms that resemble multiple connective tissue diseases, and anti-U1RNP antibodies are often found in the majority of MCTD patients. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus): While SLE can present with symptoms such as polyarthritis, oral ulcers, and dry eyes (xerophthalmia), the positive anti-U1RNP antibodies are not characteristic of SLE. In SLE, common autoantibodies include anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and anti-Ro antibodies, rather than anti-U1RNP. Additionally, the presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies makes MCTD more likely than SLE. B) RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis): Rheumatoid arthritis primarily involves joint inflammation (typically affecting the hands and feet) and is strongly associated with rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. While polyarthritis is common in both RA and MCTD, oral ulcers and dry eyes are not typical features of RA. The presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies further points away from RA, as they are not characteristic of this disease. D) RHUPUS (Rheumatoid Arthritis + Lupus): RHUPUS is a term used to describe patients who present with features of both rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. While the patient in this scenario has polyarthritis and oral ulcers, which are seen in both conditions, RHUPUS is less commonly associated with anti-U1RNP antibodies. The presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies is more specific to MCTD than to RHUPUS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). HLA-B27 is a genetic marker that is primarily associated with several spondyloarthropathies. It is not commonly associated with SLE, a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations such as skin rashes, renal involvement, and more. While SLE involves autoantibodies like anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and ANA, HLA-B27 is not typically a marker for SLE. Therefore, SLE is the condition in this list where HLA-B27 is least likely to be detected. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Ankylosing spondylitis: HLA-B27 is strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a form of spondyloarthritis that primarily affects the axial skeleton, especially the spine and sacroiliac joints. Over 90% of individuals with ankylosing spondylitis test positive for HLA-B27, making it a crucial genetic marker in the diagnosis of AS. Therefore, this option is correct in the context of conditions where HLA-B27 is typically detected. C) Psoriatic arthritis: HLA-B27 is also commonly detected in individuals with psoriatic arthritis, particularly those with axial involvement (i.e., sacroiliitis or spondylitis). This condition is associated with psoriasis and is part of the group of spondyloarthropathies, where HLA-B27 can be present. Hence, psoriatic arthritis is another condition where HLA-B27 can be detected, making this option incorrect as HLA-B27 is found in psoriatic arthritis. D) Reactive arthritis: HLA-B27 is also strongly associated with reactive arthritis, which is a form of spondyloarthropathy triggered by an infection, often in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract (e.g., Chlamydia, Salmonella, or Shigella infections). Around 70-80% of patients with reactive arthritis are positive for HLA-B27. Therefore, reactive arthritis is another condition where HLA-B27 is commonly detected, making this option incorrect as well.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Reiter’s syndrome. Reiter's syndrome, also known as reactive arthritis, is strongly associated with the HLA-B27 genetic subtype. HLA-B27 is a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that has been linked to an increased risk of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, particularly those involving the spine and joints. Reiter's syndrome classically involves the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis. Patients with this condition, especially in the presence of a previous infection (such as a urinary or gastrointestinal infection), are more likely to have the HLA-B27 allele. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Addison’s disease: Addison’s disease is an endocrine disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency. While autoimmune processes can contribute to Addison's disease, it is not associated with HLA-B27. Addison's disease typically involves autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands but is not a disease associated with the spinal or joint issues that are seen with HLA-B27-related conditions. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B) Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness of voluntary muscles due to autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor. This condition is not associated with HLA-B27. Instead, myasthenia gravis is linked to other autoimmune markers, but HLA-B27 is not one of them. Therefore, this option is incorrect. D) Psoriasis: While psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disorder, it is not directly associated with HLA-B27. However, psoriatic arthritis, which is a form of inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, can sometimes be linked with HLA-B27 in some cases. But psoriasis alone does not have the strong association with HLA-B27 seen in Reiter's syndrome or ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Poor response to NSAIDs. Axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), which includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), is characterized by inflammatory back pain and involvement of the sacroiliac joints and spine. NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are effective in controlling inflammation and relieving pain in most patients with axial spondyloarthritis. In fact, NSAIDs are the first-line treatment for managing the symptoms of AxSpA and are known to provide significant symptomatic relief. Therefore, poor response to NSAIDs is not a typical feature of axial spondyloarthritis. Why the Other Options Are Correct: A) Enthesitis: Enthesitis, which is inflammation at the sites where tendons or ligaments attach to bone, is a hallmark feature of axial spondyloarthritis. It commonly affects areas such as the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia, but it can also involve other tendinous insertions. Enthesitis is frequently observed in ankylosing spondylitis and other forms of spondyloarthritis and is a key diagnostic feature. B) Inflammatory bowel disease: There is a strong association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and axial spondyloarthritis. Patients with AxSpA, particularly those with colonic involvement or Crohn’s disease, often present with gastrointestinal symptoms. IBD and AxSpA share common genetic and inflammatory pathways, and it is not uncommon for individuals with one condition to have the other. This association is a recognized feature of axial spondyloarthritis. D) Family history of spondyloarthropathy: A positive family history of spondyloarthropathy, including conditions like ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis, is common in patients with axial spondyloarthritis. The presence of the HLA-B27 gene is a significant genetic risk factor for AxSpA, and family history of spondyloarthritis increases the likelihood of the disease, indicating a genetic predisposition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Interleukin-1 (IL-1) Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. By binding to and inhibiting IL-1β, Canakinumab helps reduce the inflammation associated with conditions like Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and gout. Its selective action against IL-1β makes it distinct from other biologics that target different inflammatory pathways. Incorrect Options: (A) Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) Canakinumab does not target TNF-α. TNF-α is another pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. However, TNF inhibitors such as infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept are designed to target and inhibit TNF-α, not Canakinumab. Therefore, TNF-α is not the correct target for Canakinumab. (C) Interleukin-12 (IL-12) IL-12 is another pro-inflammatory cytokine, but Canakinumab does not target it. IL-12 plays a role in promoting the differentiation of T cells into Th1 cells and stimulating the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Drugs like ustekinumab target IL-12 and IL-23, but Canakinumab specifically targets IL-1β, not IL-12. (D) Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM) ICAMs are adhesion molecules involved in the interaction between immune cells and the endothelium during inflammation. However, Canakinumab does not target ICAMs. Drugs that block ICAMs or their receptors, like enlimomab, focus on reducing immune cell adhesion, but Canakinumab’s primary mechanism of action is inhibiting IL-1β, not interfering with adhesion molecules like ICAM.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sulfasalazine. This patient is presenting with a pattern of symptoms suggestive of axial spondyloarthritis, also known as ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The main features include chronic lower back pain and stiffness, especially in the morning, which improves with physical activity, along with a positive HLA-B27 test. Sulfasalazine is an appropriate first-line treatment in early axial spondyloarthritis, especially in patients with symptoms affecting the peripheral joints or extra-articular manifestations (such as enthesitis or dactylitis). It is considered effective in treating inflammatory back pain and can help manage disease activity. Sulfasalazine is a DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) that can help slow disease progression and reduce inflammation, making it an appropriate choice for this patient at this stage. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) There is no need of medicine right now: While early-stage axial spondyloarthritis may initially be managed with physical therapy, this patient's symptoms (including the characteristic morning stiffness and pain that improves with activity) are indicative of an inflammatory condition that could benefit from medical treatment. Early treatment with DMARDs like sulfasalazine can help control inflammation, prevent joint damage, and improve quality of life, especially given the chronicity of symptoms. So, delaying treatment would not be appropriate. C) TNF inhibitors: TNF inhibitors such as adalimumab and etanercept are powerful biologic therapies that are typically used for moderate to severe cases of spondyloarthritis or when the disease does not respond to conventional DMARDs like sulfasalazine. In this case, the patient has no indication for biologic therapy yet, as his symptoms seem to be manageable with sulfasalazine. TNF inhibitors are generally reserved for more advanced disease or when other treatments have failed, so starting a TNF inhibitor at this stage is premature. D) Steroids: While steroids (such as prednisone) are used for short-term flare-ups in many inflammatory conditions, they are not typically recommended as the first-line treatment for axial spondyloarthritis. Steroids do not modify the course of the disease and can lead to long-term side effects when used chronically. Sulfasalazine or other DMARDs are preferred for long-term disease management, as they have a better effect on slowing disease progression and managing inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterior uveitis. The patient described is most likely suffering from ankylosing spondylitis (AS), given the clinical presentation of chronic back pain, especially with morning stiffness, decreased chest expansion, positive HLA-B27, and sacroiliitis changes on MRI. These features point towards axial spondyloarthritis, a condition primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. One of the most common extra-articular manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis is anterior uveitis. This refers to inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye, which can cause pain, redness, blurred vision, and light sensitivity. It occurs in about 30-40% of patients with AS and is often associated with acute attacks. Uveitis can sometimes be the first sign of AS and can lead to complications such as glaucoma or cataracts if left untreated. Therefore, anterior uveitis is the most common extra-articular manifestation in ankylosing spondylitis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Aortic regurgitation: While aortic regurgitation can occur in ankylosing spondylitis due to aortic root dilation, it is much less common than anterior uveitis. Aortic involvement in AS typically occurs in advanced cases, leading to valvular dysfunction. It is a rare manifestation compared to uveitis, which is more common and occurs early in the disease course. C) Atrioventricular conduction block: Atrioventricular (AV) conduction block can occur in ankylosing spondylitis due to cardiac involvement from the inflammation of the conduction system or the aortic valve. However, like aortic regurgitation, it is not as frequent as anterior uveitis. This type of conduction abnormality is relatively rare and is not typically the most common extra-articular manifestation. D) Skin rashes: Skin rashes are generally not a primary extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. Conditions like psoriasis or reactive arthritis (which can be associated with HLA-B27) can cause skin issues, but these are not common features of AS. While patients with AS can have some skin changes, such as psoriasis, these are not as characteristic or common as anterior uveitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dermatomyositis. The patient presents with a classic set of findings, including progressive muscle weakness without muscle pain, joint pain, and a characteristic red-purple rash around her eyes (known as heliotrope rash). The presence of a V-shaped red rash on her chest (known as Shawl sign) and rough patches on the backs of her hands (often referred to as Gottron's papules) further supports the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. This disease is an inflammatory muscle disease that primarily affects the proximal muscles (shoulders, hips, and girdles), leading to muscle weakness. Additionally, dermatomyositis is often associated with skin changes, such as the heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules, both of which the patient exhibits. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Polymyositis: Polymyositis is another inflammatory muscle disorder that also causes proximal muscle weakness, but it typically lacks the distinctive skin findings seen in this patient, such as the heliotrope rash, Shawl sign, and Gottron's papules. Polymyositis can present with muscle weakness similar to dermatomyositis, but it does not have the characteristic skin manifestations that help differentiate it. C) Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness, but it is not typically associated with progressive muscle weakness. The absence of skin rashes and proximal muscle weakness (which is characteristic of dermatomyositis) makes fibromyalgia an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Additionally, fibromyalgia usually does not present with the specific dermatologic findings observed in this patient. D) SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus): While SLE can present with muscle weakness and skin rashes, it typically has a butterfly-shaped rash on the face, which is not described in this case. Moreover, the patient's proximal muscle weakness and specific dermatologic findings (heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules) are more consistent with dermatomyositis. SLE can also cause joint pain, but the hallmark features of dermatomyositis, particularly the distinctive skin rashes and muscle weakness without muscle tenderness, point away from SLE as the most likely diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rituximab. In cases of dermatomyositis that do not respond to initial treatments with steroids and azathioprine, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20-positive B cells, is often used as the next step in treatment. Rituximab is especially useful for patients with refractory dermatomyositis, as it has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation, improving muscle strength, and controlling autoimmune responses. It is considered a second-line treatment for dermatomyositis when conventional immunosuppressive agents fail to achieve control. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Methotrexate: While methotrexate can be used in the treatment of dermatomyositis and has immunosuppressive effects, it is generally considered as an alternative treatment when azathioprine fails or is not well tolerated. It may be effective, but in this case, rituximab is preferred over methotrexate for patients with refractory symptoms after failure of both steroids and azathioprine, as rituximab has shown more success in clinical trials for difficult-to-treat cases. C) Androgens: Androgens, such as methyltestosterone, have been used in the past for conditions like dermatomyositis with muscle weakness, but their use is now less common due to their side effects and the availability of more effective and safer treatments. Androgens are generally not the treatment of choice in cases of refractory dermatomyositis, especially with modern immunosuppressive therapies. D) 6-Mercaptopurine: 6-Mercaptopurine is another immunosuppressive agent similar to azathioprine, and while it may be an option in some cases of dermatomyositis, it is typically considered when azathioprine is not effective or well tolerated. Since azathioprine has already been used in this patient with insufficient response, the next step is often to try rituximab before considering other thiopurine derivatives like 6-mercaptopurine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mechanical back bracing. The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of Marfan syndrome, such as long arm span, flexible joints, high arched palate, and scoliosis (curvature of the spine). In Marfan syndrome, patients are prone to developing scoliosis due to the connective tissue abnormalities. Since this patient has already developed a curvature of the thoracic spine, mechanical back bracing is the most appropriate next step. This can help manage the spinal deformity and prevent further progression of scoliosis. In cases where the curve is significant or worsening, bracing can be a non-surgical intervention to manage the condition and improve posture. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) A vigorous exercise program: Although regular physical activity is important for overall health, particularly in managing conditions like Marfan syndrome, a vigorous exercise program may not be recommended at this point for this patient. Given the spinal curvature (scoliosis), vigorous exercise could potentially worsen the spine's curvature or increase the strain on the joints. The first step in managing scoliosis in Marfan syndrome is typically back bracing to provide stability and prevent worsening of the curvature. B) Bisphosphonate therapy: Bisphosphonates are generally used in conditions associated with low bone mineral density (like osteoporosis) or to prevent bone fractures. However, Marfan syndrome does not typically involve low bone density or fragility fractures unless there are secondary issues. This patient's primary issue is the spinal deformity (scoliosis), which is more appropriately managed with bracing or monitoring for progression, rather than bisphosphonates. D) A prophylactic surgical procedure: While surgical intervention may be necessary for severe scoliosis or when the curve significantly affects function or causes pain, the initial management of mild to moderate scoliosis in Marfan syndrome is typically non-surgical. Bracing is usually the first line of management. Surgery would be considered if the curvature worsens despite non-surgical management or if it becomes symptomatic or severe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aortic insufficiency. The patient presents with symptoms of inflammatory back pain, nighttime stiffness, and sacroiliac joint tenderness, which are highly suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a type of spondyloarthritis. Aortic insufficiency (AI) is a known cardiovascular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis, often due to aortic root dilation or valvular degeneration related to the chronic inflammatory process. The diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal border radiating to the apex is characteristic of aortic insufficiency, which occurs when the aortic valve fails to close properly, causing regurgitation of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. Therefore, the most likely cause of the diastolic murmur in this patient with ankylosing spondylitis is aortic insufficiency. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Mitral stenosis: Mitral stenosis typically presents with diastolic rumbling murmurs heard at the apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. However, mitral stenosis is not commonly associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Additionally, it would not typically present with a murmur radiating to the apex from the left sternal border. The patient's clinical findings suggest a diastolic murmur related to aortic insufficiency, not mitral stenosis. B) Tricuspid stenosis: Tricuspid stenosis presents with diastolic murmurs heard along the lower left sternal border and is typically associated with right-sided heart failure symptoms such as ascites, edema, and jugular venous distention. There is no indication of these findings in this patient. Furthermore, tricuspid stenosis is rare and less likely to be the cause of the murmur in this patient, whose clinical presentation is more indicative of aortic insufficiency. D) Pulmonic insufficiency: Pulmonic insufficiency (also called pulmonary regurgitation) is a diastolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border and may radiate to the right upper sternal border. It is usually caused by pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart defects. This condition is unlikely to be the cause of the murmur in this patient. Moreover, there is no mention of conditions that would predispose to pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic insufficiency in this case. The patient's sacroiliac joint tenderness and aortic insufficiency symptoms point more toward aortic insufficiency as the underlying cause of the murmur.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Noninflammatory effusion. This patient has trauma-related knee swelling and the synovial fluid analysis suggests a noninflammatory effusion. Let's break down the findings: White blood cell (WBC) count of 1000/mL: A WBC count below 2000/mL is considered noninflammatory. Inflammatory effusions typically have WBC counts between 2000 and 100,000/mL, with a high percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Glucose equal to plasma: Normal synovial fluid glucose levels typically match plasma glucose levels. In inflammatory or septic arthritis, glucose levels in synovial fluid tend to be low. Viscosity is high: This indicates the fluid has good quality and does not suggest an inflammatory or septic cause. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is low: LDH levels in synovial fluid are typically elevated in inflammatory conditions or infections. The low LDH suggests the fluid is more consistent with noninflammatory causes. Thus, the patient's synovial fluid analysis points to a noninflammatory effusion, likely due to the recent trauma (fall) causing the knee swelling. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Normal synovial fluid: While normal synovial fluid is typically clear, has low WBC count, and normal glucose, this patient's WBC count of 1000/mL is slightly elevated compared to the normal value (usually less than 200). Therefore, this is not normal synovial fluid, though it is consistent with noninflammatory effusion. C) Inflammatory effusion: An inflammatory effusion would typically present with a WBC count higher than 2000/mL and a predominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), usually seen in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or gout. The low WBC count in this patient rules out an inflammatory effusion. D) Septic arthritis: Septic arthritis usually presents with elevated WBC count (often greater than 50,000/mL) and a low glucose level in synovial fluid, as the infection consumes glucose. In this case, the WBC count of 1000/mL and normal glucose exclude the possibility of septic arthritis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acute anterior uveitis. This patient's presentation of low back pain, stiffness, worse pain at night, and sacroiliitis on x-rays is highly suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a type of spondyloarthritis. AS is characterized by chronic inflammation of the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to pain and stiffness, particularly in the lumbar spine. In addition to spinal symptoms, extra-articular manifestations are common in AS. The most common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis is acute anterior uveitis, which is an inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye. This condition often presents with eye pain, photophobia (sensitivity to light), redness, and sometimes visual disturbances, as seen in this patient who reports left eye discomfort and sunlight bothering his eyes. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a chronic eye condition characterized by increased intraocular pressure, which can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss. It is not an extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. While some inflammatory diseases may have a relationship with secondary glaucoma, it is not typically associated with AS. The eye involvement seen in AS is more commonly acute anterior uveitis. C) Keratitis: Keratitis refers to inflammation of the cornea, which can cause eye pain, redness, and blurred vision. While it can be seen in inflammatory diseases, keratitis is not the most common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. In fact, acute anterior uveitis is far more common and is more specifically linked to AS. D) Conjunctivitis: Conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the conjunctiva, can be seen in various systemic diseases, but it is not the most common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. Acute anterior uveitis is more specific to AS and tends to occur more frequently than conjunctivitis in this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aortic Root Dilatation and Aortic Regurgitation. This young, tall and thin patient with long arms and poor visual acuity likely has Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that often leads to aortic root dilatation and subsequent aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation presents as a diastolic murmur, which is precisely what is described in this case (3/6 early diastolic murmur at the right second intercostal space radiating to the apex). This type of murmur is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, where blood flows back from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. The bounding pulses (also known as water-hammer pulses) are a common finding in aortic regurgitation due to the large stroke volume and rapid runoff of blood from the left ventricle. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Aortic Root Dilatation and Aortic Stenosis: Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic murmur rather than a diastolic murmur. The murmur described in this patient is an early diastolic murmur, which is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, not aortic stenosis. While aortic root dilatation can occur in Marfan syndrome, it is more commonly associated with aortic regurgitation, not stenosis. B) Left Ventricular Dilatation and Mitral Valve Prolapse: Mitral valve prolapse typically presents with a systolic click and murmur, not a diastolic murmur. Left ventricular dilatation could cause a systolic murmur (e.g., due to mitral regurgitation), but it would not explain the diastolic murmur described in this patient. This presentation is inconsistent with the diagnosis. D) Mitral Stenosis: Mitral stenosis typically causes a diastolic murmur, but it is usually associated with a rumbling murmur heard at the apex, often with a presystolic accentuation. The diastolic murmur in mitral stenosis is distinct from the early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation. The patient's findings, including bounding pulses and a soft second heart sound, point more towards aortic regurgitation rather than mitral stenosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Asymmetric Migratory Polyarthritis Involving The Large Joints Of The Arms And Legs. This patient is presenting with symptoms highly suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), likely ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease. One of the common extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD is arthritis. The arthritis associated with IBD is often asymmetric and migratory, meaning it affects different joints over time, typically the large joints, such as the knees, elbows, and ankles. This type of arthritis is typically self-limiting and tends to improve or resolve when the underlying intestinal disease is controlled. The migratory nature means that the joint pain can shift from one joint to another, and this arthritis often worsens during disease flare-ups of IBD. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Not Usually Associated With Intestinal Disease Flares: This statement is incorrect because IBD-associated arthritis is often associated with disease flares. The symptoms of arthritis can worsen when the intestinal disease activity increases, and the arthritis can improve or remit when the intestinal inflammation is controlled. It is not typically independent of the gastrointestinal symptoms. C) A Progressive Course: IBD-associated arthritis typically has an episodic or self-limiting course, not a progressive one. The arthritis generally improves or resolves with treatment of the underlying IBD, and it is not known for causing ongoing joint damage. A progressive course would be more characteristic of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other forms of autoimmune arthritis, not the arthritis associated with IBD. D) Symmetrical Small Joint Involvement: Symmetrical small joint involvement is more typical of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but not of the arthritis commonly seen in IBD. IBD-associated arthritis primarily affects the large joints, and it is often asymmetric (not symmetrical). The involvement of small joints in a symmetrical pattern would not match the typical presentation of arthritis in ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) ESR. The patient's symptoms — including headaches, back/shoulder/hip discomfort, morning stiffness, and fatigue — are suggestive of a condition called polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). This is a common inflammatory disorder seen in older adults, particularly those over 50, and is characterized by musculoskeletal pain and stiffness in the proximal joints (shoulders, hips) and often accompanied by systemic symptoms like fatigue and low-grade fever. The most appropriate initial diagnostic test for polymyalgia rheumatica is an elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), which reflects the level of systemic inflammation. ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation, and while it is not diagnostic on its own, an elevated ESR is highly suggestive of inflammatory conditions such as PMR. If PMR is suspected, ESR is typically the first test ordered. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Immunoelectrophoresis: Immunoelectrophoresis is a test used primarily to detect abnormal proteins or monoclonal gammopathies, such as in multiple myeloma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. This test would not be helpful in diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica, as it does not directly relate to the inflammatory processes involved in PMR. Thus, it is not the first-line test for this patient. B) c-ANCA levels: c-ANCA (cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) are primarily used in the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a vasculitis that can cause systemic symptoms, including sinus and lung involvement. The patient does not have symptoms or clinical findings suggestive of GPA, such as respiratory symptoms, renal involvement, or sinusitis. Therefore, testing for c-ANCA is not appropriate in this case. D) Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK): CPK (creatine phosphokinase) is a marker of muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis and is commonly elevated in conditions like muscle trauma, myositis, or muscular dystrophies. However, in polymyalgia rheumatica, the muscle involvement is usually not inflammatory or not severe enough to cause significant muscle injury that would elevate CPK levels. Therefore, this test is unlikely to provide useful information in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hepatitis B. This patient presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, and lack of energy. The neurological symptoms of left foot drop and bilateral sensory peripheral neuropathy suggest the presence of a vasculitic or inflammatory condition, particularly one affecting the small to medium vessels. The elevated ESR and WBC count, along with the negative ANCA and ANA, point toward an autoimmune or inflammatory disease, but not specifically vasculitis like granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known to be associated with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic vasculitis that can present with the symptoms seen in this patient, including fever, weight loss, and neuropathy. PAN is a medium-vessel vasculitis that can be triggered by chronic viral infections, particularly hepatitis B. In fact, hepatitis B is one of the most recognized chronic viral infections associated with PAN, which often involves peripheral neuropathy and renal involvement. Therefore, testing for hepatitis B markers is important in a case with suspected PAN. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) CMV (Cytomegalovirus): Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause a variety of systemic symptoms, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. However, CMV is not commonly associated with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). While CMV can cause neurological symptoms or peripheral neuropathy, it is not a typical trigger for the vasculitis seen in this patient. Therefore, CMV is not the most likely viral cause here. B) Herpesvirus: Herpesviruses (e.g., HSV, VZV) can lead to neurological issues, but they are not typically associated with PAN or other systemic vasculitis diseases. Herpesvirus infections may cause localized symptoms such as herpes zoster or encephalitis, but they are not linked to the broader systemic inflammatory condition or polyneuropathy seen in this case. Therefore, herpesvirus is not the most likely viral association. D) Coxsackie B virus: Coxsackie B virus is associated with viral myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly in children and young adults. While it may cause cardiac symptoms, including chest pain, it does not have a recognized association with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) or the neurological and systemic inflammatory features that this patient presents with. Thus, Coxsackie B virus is not the correct choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare condition characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilage and can affect various sites in the body, including the auricles (ears), nose, and joints. The patient's history of intermittent swelling and pain in the superior part of the auricles (ear), along with arthritis and swelling over the bridge of the nose, is strongly suggestive of relapsing polychondritis, which commonly involves the cartilage of the ears and nose. The absence of trauma, diabetes, and hypertension, along with the negative RA factor, ANCA, and the positive ASCA (which may suggest an inflammatory bowel disease component), further supports this diagnosis. Relapsing polychondritis is not typically associated with positive serologic markers like RA factor or ANCA. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Psoriatic arthritis: Psoriatic arthritis primarily affects the joints and can be associated with psoriasis. The typical presentation includes skin lesions, dactylitis (swelling of fingers and toes), and axial involvement. However, psoriatic arthritis is not known to cause the auricular cartilage and nasal bridge involvement as seen in relapsing polychondritis. The absence of skin lesions and the pattern of joint involvement make psoriatic arthritis less likely. B) Behçet’s syndrome: Behçet’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition that often presents with recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions such as erythema nodosum. While it can cause arthritis and vascular inflammation, it is not typically associated with cartilage inflammation like relapsing polychondritis. The patient's symptoms, particularly the involvement of the auricles and nose, do not fit with Behçet’s syndrome. C) Wegener’s granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis): Wegener’s granulomatosis (now called granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is an ANCA-associated vasculitis that typically affects the upper and lower respiratory tract (sinuses, lungs) and the kidneys. It can cause nasal deformities, but it is usually associated with granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis, which is not described in this case. Furthermore, ANCA is negative in this patient, which makes Wegener’s granulomatosis unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Oral NSAIDs. This patient presents with a swollen and painful knee, and the joint fluid aspiration shows rhomboid crystals with weak-positive birefringence, which is characteristic of pseudogout. Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition disease, occurs when these crystals accumulate in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain, often following trauma or injury. The first-line treatment for an acute attack of pseudogout involves managing pain and inflammation. Oral NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) are the most appropriate option for reducing inflammation and controlling pain in this condition. They are commonly used for acute episodes of pseudogout and provide effective symptomatic relief. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Oral prednisone: While oral prednisone (a corticosteroid) can be used to treat inflammatory conditions like pseudogout, it is typically reserved for cases where NSAIDs are contraindicated (e.g., in patients with peptic ulcer disease or renal dysfunction) or for more severe, persistent symptoms. Since NSAIDs are the first-line treatment for an acute attack of pseudogout, prednisone would be an inappropriate first-line choice in this patient without further indication for corticosteroid use. B) Intravenous antibiotics: The joint fluid is described as opaque, which could raise concern for an infection; however, the presence of rhomboid crystals with weak-positive birefringence clearly points to pseudogout, not infection. Additionally, there is no fever or other signs of infection (e.g., erythema or warmth) in this case. Intravenous antibiotics would be indicated if there was suspicion of septic arthritis, but the crystal analysis in this case rules out that diagnosis, making antibiotics unnecessary. D) Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an analgesic but lacks anti-inflammatory properties. It may be useful for mild pain relief, but in cases of pseudogout, where inflammation is a significant component of the condition, NSAIDs are generally preferred because they also address inflammation. Acetaminophen alone would not provide the same level of symptom control as NSAIDs in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Testing of muscle strength. This patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory muscle disease. The characteristic findings include proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels, and a heliotrope rash (blue-purple rash on the eyelids), which is typical of dermatomyositis. When managing patients with inflammatory myopathy such as dermatomyositis, monitoring muscle strength is the most important aspect of evaluating response to therapy. This is because the primary concern in dermatomyositis is muscle involvement, and the goal of treatment (e.g., with prednisone) is to improve muscle strength and function. Changes in muscle strength directly reflect the effectiveness of treatment. Regular muscle strength testing helps track improvements or worsening of the condition and can guide treatment decisions. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) ESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a marker of general inflammation, but it is not specific to muscle inflammation or dermatomyositis. Although ESR may be elevated in inflammatory diseases, it does not directly correlate with muscle strength or function. Therefore, ESR is not the best measure for monitoring response to therapy in this case. Muscle strength testing provides a more direct assessment of treatment efficacy. C) ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase): ALP is primarily a marker of bone or liver disease and is not typically elevated in dermatomyositis or other inflammatory myopathies. It would not be helpful in monitoring muscle function or response to corticosteroid therapy. While CK (creatinine kinase) is more directly relevant to muscle damage, ALP is not. Therefore, ALP is not useful in this context. D) EMG (Electromyography): EMG can be used to assess muscle function and diagnose neuromuscular disorders, but it is not routinely used to monitor the response to treatment in patients with dermatomyositis. Muscle strength testing is more practical and easier to perform regularly in clinical practice, and it provides a better real-time measure of recovery. EMG may be useful for initial diagnosis or in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, but once a diagnosis of dermatomyositis is established, testing of muscle strength becomes more critical for assessing treatment response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Doxycycline. This patient presents with intermittent joint pain and swelling in both knees, as well as a history of a pruritic skin lesion (which may suggest erythema migrans, a characteristic rash of Lyme disease). The positive IgG serology for Borrelia burgdorferi supports a diagnosis of Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted through the bite of infected ticks. Lyme disease can present with musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthritis, often affecting the knees. The most appropriate next step is to treat the underlying infection with doxycycline, an effective antibiotic for Lyme disease. Treatment with antibiotics like doxycycline is recommended for Lyme disease to eradicate the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, reduce inflammation, and prevent further complications, including chronic Lyme arthritis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) High-dose glucocorticoids: High-dose glucocorticoids are generally used to treat conditions involving significant inflammation, but in the context of Lyme disease, steroids are not first-line therapy. In fact, they could worsen the disease by suppressing the immune response and hindering bacterial clearance. The patient’s symptoms are more likely to improve with antibiotic therapy rather than steroids. B) Low-dose glucocorticoids: Low-dose glucocorticoids are also not appropriate for treating Lyme disease itself, as they do not target the underlying bacterial infection. While they might provide some relief for inflammation, they would not address the root cause, which is the Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Therefore, antibiotic therapy is preferred. C) High-dose NSAID therapy: NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) are used to relieve pain and inflammation, and while they may help with symptomatic relief in Lyme arthritis, they do not treat the underlying infection. The primary treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics, and NSAIDs are generally used as adjuncts to help manage symptoms, not as the primary treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Positive serology and clinical symptoms. The patient presents with intermittent joint pain and swelling, especially in the knees, and a history of a pruritic skin lesion in his groin after a camping trip, which suggests a possible history of Lyme disease. The round, pruritic skin lesion described could be erythema migrans, the characteristic rash seen in Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by ticks. The most appropriate initial diagnostic approach would be to perform serologic studies for Borrelia burgdorferi to confirm the diagnosis, as the patient’s clinical symptoms and the history of possible tick exposure are suggestive of Lyme disease. Testing for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies (such as IgG and IgM tests) would help establish the diagnosis, particularly when there is a clinical history suggestive of Lyme disease (e.g., the erythema migrans rash and arthritis symptoms). Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Positive serologic studies only: While positive serologic studies are an important component of diagnosing Lyme disease, they are not sufficient by themselves to establish a definitive diagnosis. Clinical symptoms (e.g., joint pain and swelling, history of erythema migrans, exposure to ticks) should also be considered. The combination of positive serology and clinical symptoms provides the most comprehensive approach to diagnosis. B) Synovial fluid analysis: Synovial fluid analysis could be helpful if the patient develops joint effusions or if there's concern for an infection, but it is not the initial diagnostic step for Lyme disease. Synovial fluid analysis might be used if there is suspicion of Lyme arthritis, but serologic tests and clinical findings are the first-line approach to confirm Lyme disease. C) Skin biopsy: A skin biopsy may be helpful for diagnosing certain skin conditions, but it is not necessary in this case. The clinical history of a pruritic skin lesion after a camping trip, which resembles erythema migrans, and the presence of joint symptoms, strongly point to Lyme disease. A skin biopsy would not add significant diagnostic value here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to pain and stiffness in the lower back, particularly during the night and in the early morning. The hallmark of AS is morning stiffness, which improves with movement or exercise. This patient presents with typical features of AS, including low back pain, stiffness, and restricted spinal mobility, along with the progression of symptoms over several months. The x-ray findings would likely show sacroiliitis and the early stages of vertebral fusion, both characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Reiter syndrome (Reactive arthritis): Reiter syndrome is a type of reactive arthritis that often follows an infection, particularly genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. It can present with symptoms of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis (the classic \"cant see, cant pee, cant climb a tree\"). While it can cause arthritis and sometimes affects the spine, it typically presents with acute arthritis that is often asymmetrical, and it usually involves lower extremity joints rather than the spine. The absence of an infectious trigger and the progressive back pain and stiffness in this patient make reactive arthritis less likely. B) Marfan syndrome: Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder primarily affecting the skeletal system, cardiovascular system, and eyes. It leads to features such as tall stature, long limbs, and hypermobility of joints, but low back pain and stiffness are not characteristic of Marfan syndrome. The primary musculoskeletal manifestation of Marfan syndrome is scoliosis or pectus excavatum (sunken chest), not inflammatory back pain. Marfan syndrome does not cause the type of back stiffness described in this case. D) RA (Rheumatoid arthritis): Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that typically affects the small joints (e.g., MCP, PIP joints) of the hands and feet in a symmetric manner. While RA can cause joint pain and stiffness, it does not typically cause axial (spine) involvement or the morning stiffness that is characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. RA also does not typically lead to the kind of restrictive spinal mobility observed in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Stiffness and pain of proximal muscles. This patient is likely presenting with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a condition commonly seen in individuals over 50 years of age, characterized by muscle stiffness and pain, particularly in the proximal muscles (shoulders, hips). The hallmark of PMR is morning stiffness that improves with activity, and patients may experience fatigue and elevated ESR (as seen here). The dramatic response to low-dose prednisone further supports the diagnosis of PMR, as this condition is highly responsive to corticosteroids. PMR does not typically involve muscle weakness, but rather muscle pain and stiffness. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Heliotrope rash: A heliotrope rash is a characteristic skin finding seen in dermatomyositis, not polymyalgia rheumatica. It presents as a purple or violet rash over the eyelids and may be associated with muscle weakness and other systemic symptoms. This is not a typical feature of PMR. B) Proximal muscle weakness: Proximal muscle weakness is more characteristic of dermatomyositis or myositis, not polymyalgia rheumatica. PMR primarily causes muscle pain and stiffness, but weakness is not a prominent feature. In fact, PMR typically does not result in muscle atrophy or significant weakness, distinguishing it from conditions like myositis. C) Painful peripheral neuropathies: Painful peripheral neuropathies are not a hallmark of polymyalgia rheumatica. While neuropathies can occur in a variety of systemic conditions, they are not typically associated with PMR. The main features of PMR are musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly proximal muscle pain and stiffness.",

This patient is presenting with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a condition typically seen in individuals over the age of 50, characterized by muscle stiffness and pain in the shoulders, hips, and neck, often worse in the morning. He also reports jaw pain while chewing, which is a concerning sign of giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. GCA is a condition that often coexists with PMR, and one of the most feared complications of GCA is blindness due to ischemic optic neuropathy caused by inflammation of the temporal arteries. This can lead to sudden and irreversible vision loss if not treated promptly with corticosteroids. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: B) Cortical stroke: While GCA can cause ischemia in various parts of the body due to vascular involvement, cortical strokes are not a typical or common complication of this condition. Blindness is a much more common and feared complication, particularly because of the risk of vision loss due to ischemic optic neuropathy. C) Limb claudication: Limb claudication can occur in GCA due to large-vessel involvement, but it is not the most feared or common complication. Blindness remains the most serious and acute risk in patients with GCA. Limb claudication would be more concerning in conditions like peripheral artery disease or vasculitis affecting smaller vessels, but blindness is still the primary concern in GCA. D) Renal infarction: Renal infarction is generally associated with other conditions, such as vasculitis or embolic events, and is not typically a complication of GCA. While GCA affects the blood vessels, its main complications are blindness and, less commonly, stroke. Renal infarction is not a major concern in this clinical context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Spirochetal infection. This patient’s symptoms of intermittent arthralgias and knee swelling, in conjunction with a history of a round, red rash (likely erythema migrans) at the belt line following outdoor exposure, strongly suggest Lyme disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted via tick bites. Lyme disease can progress to late-stage manifestations, including Lyme arthritis, which is characterized by intermittent or persistent joint inflammation, most commonly affecting large joints like the knees. The underlying mechanism of this syndrome is persistent infection with the spirochete, which can localize to the joints and elicit inflammatory responses. Effective treatment of Lyme arthritis requires antibiotic therapy to eradicate the spirochetal infection, confirming that the mechanism of the condition is directly related to the ongoing presence of Borrelia burgdorferi. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Autoimmune: While autoimmune mechanisms can sometimes be involved in post-infectious syndromes, the persistent presence of the spirochete in Lyme disease is the primary driver of Lyme arthritis. Autoimmune processes may contribute to chronic inflammation if the infection is not eradicated, but this is not the primary mechanism in this case. B) Viral infection: Lyme disease is caused by a bacterial spirochete, not a viral agent. Viral infections can cause arthralgia and arthritis, but they do not explain the findings or history in this case, such as the erythema migrans rash and the response to antibiotic treatment. D) Circulating immune complexes: Although immune complex deposition can occur in certain infectious or autoimmune diseases, it is not the main mechanism in Lyme arthritis. The inflammation in Lyme arthritis is due to localized infection and immune activation in the joints, not systemic immune complex-mediated processes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) OBESITY. This patient presents with symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, leading to joint pain, stiffness, and functional limitation. OA commonly affects weight-bearing joints like the knees, as well as the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in the hands. Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for OA because it increases mechanical stress on weight-bearing joints, especially the knees. Additionally, obesity contributes to systemic inflammation through the release of adipokines, which may accelerate cartilage degradation. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Age: Age is indeed a strong risk factor for OA as it is more prevalent in older adults due to cumulative wear and tear on the joints and age-related changes in cartilage. However, it is not the most prominent risk factor in this patient compared to obesity, which directly contributes to mechanical and inflammatory stress. B) Male gender: Male gender is not a significant risk factor for OA. In fact, postmenopausal women have a higher risk of developing OA, likely due to hormonal changes that affect joint health. This patient’s obesity is a more relevant risk factor for his condition. D) All: While age and male gender may contribute to the background risk, obesity is the most significant risk factor in this particular patient. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it is the factor most closely linked to the patient’s presentation and OA progression.",

Due to progressive nature of CKD and development of refractory fluid overload she was started on hemodialysis. After 3 years of chronic hemodialysis she presents with severe pain in her left knee. On examination, the knee is warm, swollen, and painful to move. Diagnostic joint aspiration is performed. Which of the following is the most likely finding in her joint fluid?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Calcium hydroxyapatite crystals. Calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HA crystal deposition) is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms given her history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and prolonged hemodialysis. HA crystals can deposit in joints and periarticular tissues, leading to inflammation and a condition called basic calcium phosphate arthritis or Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (though it can affect other joints). Chronic hemodialysis increases the risk of such deposition due to impaired calcium-phosphorus metabolism and hyperparathyroidism often associated with CKD. Joint aspiration in such cases would reveal calcium hydroxyapatite crystals, which may not be visible on standard microscopy but can be identified using special staining techniques. Why the Other Options Are Incorrect: A) Uric acid crystals: Uric acid crystals are seen in gout, which presents with needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polarized light microscopy. While CKD is a risk factor for hyperuricemia and gout, this patient’s presentation (severe joint inflammation after years of hemodialysis) is more consistent with HA crystal deposition. Furthermore, gout typically affects smaller joints like the big toe (podagra) rather than the knee. B) Calcium pyrophosphate crystals (CPPD): CPPD crystals are seen in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), which can also cause acute joint inflammation. However, CPPD is less commonly associated with CKD or long-term hemodialysis. The crystals are rhomboid-shaped and weakly positive birefringent under polarized light. The patient’s chronic hemodialysis history points more strongly toward HA crystal deposition. D) Calcium oxalate crystals: Calcium oxalate crystals are associated with oxalosis, a condition seen in advanced CKD or primary hyperoxaluria. Oxalate crystals can deposit in tissues, including joints, but this is less common than HA crystal deposition in patients on long-term hemodialysis. Additionally, oxalate crystals are bipyramidal and not associated with the typical inflammatory joint findings seen here.",
