      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Early onset of memory loss. Correct Answer (C): Early onset of memory loss Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene. While cognitive decline is a feature of HD, it typically manifests later in the disease progression, often after the appearance of motor symptoms such as chorea (involuntary, jerky movements). Memory loss is not an early or primary presenting symptom; instead, the early cognitive changes are more subtle, involving executive function, planning, and decision-making rather than frank memory deficits. Early-onset memory loss is more characteristic of other conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, and is not a hallmark of HD. Incorrect Options: A. Chorea This is correct as Huntington’s disease is classically associated with chorea. It is one of the hallmark symptoms and often the presenting feature. Chorea refers to involuntary, irregular, and dance-like movements caused by basal ganglia dysfunction, a key area affected in HD. B. Increased CAG repeats This is correct because Huntington’s disease is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene located on chromosome 4. The greater the number of CAG repeats, the earlier the onset and the more severe the progression of the disease. This is a definitive molecular marker of HD. D. Seizure This is incorrect because seizures are not a typical or prominent feature of Huntington’s disease. While they can occur in advanced stages of the disease due to significant neuronal loss and brain dysfunction, they are not considered a primary or characteristic symptom. Seizures are more commonly associated with other neurological disorders such as epilepsy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) APO E2 gene. Correct Answer (D): APO E2 gene The APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene has three major alleles: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. Among these, the APOE4 allele is strongly associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), particularly late-onset AD. In contrast, the APOE2 allele is considered protective against Alzheimer’s disease and is associated with a reduced risk. This protective role is due to its influence on lipid metabolism and amyloid beta deposition, which are key factors in the pathophysiology of AD. Therefore, the presence of APOE2 decreases rather than increases the risk of Alzheimer’s, making it the correct choice as the exception. Incorrect Options: A. Old age This is correct because advancing age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The majority of cases occur in individuals over the age of 65, and the prevalence continues to increase with age. B. Positive family history This is correct as a family history of Alzheimer’s disease increases the risk of developing the condition. This may be due to genetic predispositions, particularly in cases involving mutations in genes like APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 for early-onset familial Alzheimer’s, or the inheritance of risk alleles like APOE4 for late-onset AD. C. Female gender This is correct because women are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease compared to men. This increased risk is thought to be partially due to longer life expectancy in women and potential hormonal factors, such as the loss of estrogen after menopause, which may contribute to neurodegeneration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Correct Answer (C): Amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles The hallmark histopathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are amyloid-beta (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid plaques are extracellular deposits of misfolded amyloid-beta protein, which disrupt cell communication and trigger inflammatory responses, contributing to neuronal damage. Neurofibrillary tangles consist of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which accumulates within neurons, disrupting their structural integrity and leading to neuronal death. These pathological changes primarily affect regions of the brain involved in memory and cognition, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and are definitive diagnostic markers of Alzheimer’s disease upon histological examination. Incorrect Options: A. A decrease in substance P in the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation This is incorrect because substance P, a neuropeptide, is not significantly implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. While it may play a role in pain transmission and other processes, changes in substance P levels are not characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease or its hallmark neurochemical alterations. B. Marked degeneration of most myelinated pathways This is incorrect as Alzheimer’s disease primarily involves gray matter structures rather than widespread degeneration of myelinated pathways, which are part of the white matter. White matter changes may occur later in the disease as a secondary effect, but they are not the defining feature of AD pathology. D. Marked retrograde degeneration in sensory neurons of the brainstem This is incorrect because Alzheimer’s disease does not primarily affect sensory neurons in the brainstem. The disease predominantly targets areas of the brain responsible for memory, learning, and cognition, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Sensory neurons of the brainstem are not typically involved in the early or primary pathological processes of Alzheimer’s.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Trisomy 21. Correct Answer (C): Trisomy 21 Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, is strongly associated with Alzheimer’s dementia. Individuals with Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21, which contains the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP). Overexpression of APP leads to increased production of amyloid-beta, a key protein involved in the formation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. As a result, individuals with Down syndrome are at a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s-like pathology, often at an earlier age (as early as their 40s or 50s). This connection highlights the role of chromosome 21 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Incorrect Options: A. Trisomy 18 This is incorrect because Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) is associated with severe developmental delays, congenital anomalies, and early mortality, but it does not have a known connection with Alzheimer’s dementia. Neurological complications in Trisomy 18 are different from those observed in Alzheimer’s disease. B. Patau syndrome This is incorrect because Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13) is primarily associated with severe physical abnormalities and profound developmental delays. Like Trisomy 18, it is not linked to Alzheimer’s disease or its characteristic neuropathology. D. Turner’s syndrome This is incorrect because Turner’s syndrome, characterized by the presence of a single X chromosome (45,X), is associated with features like short stature and ovarian insufficiency but has no known connection with Alzheimer’s dementia or the amyloid-related pathology seen in the disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ataxia, urinary incontinence, dementia. Correct Answer (C): Ataxia, urinary incontinence, dementia The classic triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) includes: Ataxia: This typically manifests as a \"magnetic gait,\" where patients have difficulty lifting their feet, leading to a slow, shuffling gait. Urinary incontinence: Often an early symptom, this is due to the disruption of periventricular white matter tracts controlling bladder function. Dementia: Cognitive decline in NPH is usually subcortical in nature, presenting as bradyphrenia (slowness of thought), difficulty concentrating, and apathy, rather than profound memory loss as seen in Alzheimer’s disease. These symptoms are caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles, leading to compression of adjacent brain structures. Importantly, NPH is one of the few reversible causes of dementia if treated early with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting or other CSF-diverting procedures. Incorrect Options: A. Tremors, aphasia, dementia This is incorrect because these symptoms are not characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Tremors are more commonly associated with Parkinson's disease, and aphasia (difficulty speaking or understanding language) is more typical of stroke or primary progressive aphasia than NPH. B. Ataxia, aphasia, gait disorder This is incorrect because while ataxia and gait disorder are components of the NPH triad, aphasia is not. Aphasia is typically associated with cortical brain lesions, such as those caused by a stroke or focal neurodegenerative conditions, rather than the ventricular enlargement seen in NPH. D. Ataxia, urinary incontinence, dysarthria This is incorrect because dysarthria (difficulty with articulation) is not a typical feature of normal pressure hydrocephalus. While ataxia and urinary incontinence are part of the triad, dysarthria is more often seen in conditions affecting the motor components of speech, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis, rather than NPH.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cogwheel rigidity. Correct Answer (A): Cogwheel rigidity Cogwheel rigidity is not a feature of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. This symptom is typically associated with Parkinson’s disease, a condition characterized by bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity due to basal ganglia dysfunction. Wernicke’s encephalopathy, in contrast, is a neurological condition caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often related to chronic alcoholism or malnutrition, and does not involve the extrapyramidal motor system, which is responsible for cogwheel rigidity. Incorrect Options: B. Alteration in mental function This is correct because changes in mental status, such as confusion, disorientation, or apathy, are hallmark features of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. If left untreated, this can progress to stupor or coma. These alterations result from thiamine deficiency affecting the thalamus and hypothalamus. C. Ophthalmoplegia This is correct because ophthalmoplegia, often presenting as nystagmus, lateral rectus palsy, or conjugate gaze palsy, is a cardinal feature of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. It occurs due to thiamine deficiency affecting the cranial nerve nuclei, particularly in the midbrain and pons. D. Ataxia This is correct as ataxia, particularly gait ataxia, is a common feature of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. It results from thiamine deficiency impairing the cerebellum and its connections, leading to difficulty in coordinating movements.",

While the hippocampus plays a critical role in memory formation and is associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, it is not typically affected by the thiamine deficiency that underlies Wernicke’s encephalopathy. The primary brain regions impacted in Wernicke’s encephalopathy are those involved in ocular movement, coordination, and consciousness, rather than structures associated with long-term memory consolidation like the hippocampus. Incorrect Options: A. Mamillary body This is correct because the mammillary bodies are one of the primary structures affected in Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Thiamine deficiency leads to neuronal loss and gliosis in the mammillary bodies, which are part of the limbic system and play a role in memory and emotional regulation. B. Thalamus This is correct as the thalamus is commonly affected in Wernicke’s encephalopathy. The thalamus has a high metabolic demand and is particularly sensitive to thiamine deficiency, leading to damage that contributes to altered mental status, a key feature of the condition. C. Periventricular grey matter This is correct because periventricular gray matter, particularly around the third and fourth ventricles, is a site of pathology in Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Damage in these areas can result in symptoms such as ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and alterations in mental status.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) This presentation is most consistent with Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Key features of early Alzheimer's include: • Memory impairment (especially recent/short-term memory) • Impaired executive function (e.g., finances) • Difficulty with tasks involving visuospatial and language skills Pathological hallmark: • Atrophy of the medial temporal lobes, especially the hippocampus, which plays a key role in forming new memories. • MRI in Alzheimer's often shows medial temporal lobe volume loss early in the disease. B. Atrophy of the entire frontal and temporal lobe This pattern is more characteristic of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), which presents with: • Personality changes • Disinhibition • Apathy or compulsive behaviors Memory may be relatively preserved early on. C. Cranial nerve involvement Cranial nerves are not primarily involved in neurodegenerative dementias like Alzheimer’s. Their involvement would suggest brainstem or localized lesions, not generalized cortical atrophy. D. Atrophy of the caudate This is typical of Huntington’s disease, a genetic neurodegenerative condition that presents with: • Chorea (involuntary movements) • Behavioral changes • Cognitive decline, but not memory loss as the first symptom Also, it typically starts in younger adults (30s-50s).",
