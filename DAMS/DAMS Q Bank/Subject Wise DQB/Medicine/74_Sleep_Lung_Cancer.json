      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Intra-arterial oxygen monitoring. Polysomnography (PSG) is a comprehensive sleep study used to diagnose various sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome. It involves the monitoring of multiple physiological parameters during sleep, but intra-arterial oxygen monitoring is not typically included in a standard polysomnography. Instead, oxygen levels are usually monitored using pulse oximetry, a non-invasive method that measures oxygen saturation in the blood, rather than using an invasive intra-arterial approach. Why the other options are correct: A. EEG (Electroencephalogram): EEG is a standard component of polysomnography. It measures brain electrical activity and is essential for identifying different sleep stages (e.g., REM and non-REM sleep). The EEG allows for the assessment of brain wave patterns during sleep and plays a crucial role in diagnosing disorders like narcolepsy and parasomnias. B. EOG (Electrooculogram): EOG records eye movements, which is vital for assessing REM sleep and identifying events such as rapid eye movements during sleep. It helps differentiate between different sleep stages and is essential for accurate sleep staging and diagnosis. D. Limb movements: Limb movement monitoring is another important component of polysomnography, as it helps diagnose restless leg syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder. This is typically measured using electromyography (EMG) sensors attached to the legs to track movements during sleep.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Impotence. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep due to the obstruction of the upper airway. While OSA has several well-documented complications, impotence (or erectile dysfunction) is not typically listed as a direct, recognized complication of OSA, although there may be some indirect associations. Impotence is often multifactorial, involving various physical and psychological factors such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and hormonal imbalances, all of which may be influenced by OSA but are not necessarily a direct consequence of the disorder itself. Why the other options are correct: B. Arrhythmias: Arrhythmias are a recognized complication of OSA. The intermittent drops in oxygen levels (hypoxia) and the repeated arousals from sleep can trigger arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias. This can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly in individuals with pre-existing heart disease. C. Cerebrovascular disease: Cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, is a well-known complication of OSA. The episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia (elevated carbon dioxide levels) that occur during apneic episodes can increase the risk of stroke, particularly in individuals with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. D. Systemic hypertension: Systemic hypertension is another common and well-recognized complication of OSA. Repeated episodes of oxygen desaturation and arousals during sleep lead to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can cause elevated blood pressure. Over time, this contributes to the development of systemic hypertension.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Personality changes may be the presenting complaint. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is commonly associated with a variety of symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and interrupted sleep. However, some patients may not present with these classic symptoms. Instead, personality changes such as irritability, mood swings, and even depression may be the first noticeable symptoms, especially in cases where sleep disturbances have been present for a long time. These changes are often related to the poor quality of sleep and the resultant cognitive and mood disturbances caused by frequent apneas, oxygen desaturation, and disrupted sleep patterns. Therefore, personality changes can be a key presenting complaint in individuals with undiagnosed OSA. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Men and women are equally affected: This statement is incorrect. While OSA can affect both men and women, men are more commonly affected than women, especially in younger and middle-aged adults. The prevalence of OSA in women increases significantly after menopause, but overall, the condition is more prevalent in men. B. Cor pulmonale and not systemic hypertension is usually seen: This statement is incorrect. Systemic hypertension is much more commonly associated with obstructive sleep apnea than cor pulmonale. The repeated episodes of hypoxia and arousals during sleep lead to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which in turn raises blood pressure. While cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure due to lung disease) can occur in severe OSA with chronic hypoxia, systemic hypertension is a far more common and early manifestation. C. Sedatives are often useful in the improvement of quality of sleep: This statement is incorrect. Sedatives are not typically recommended for improving sleep quality in OSA. In fact, they may exacerbate the problem, as sedatives can relax the upper airway muscles and worsen airway obstruction. The treatment for OSA generally involves positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP or BiPAP), weight loss, or surgery, rather than the use of sedatives.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Small cell lung cancer is more radiosensitive. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is known for its high radiosensitivity. This means that SCLC cells are more responsive to radiation therapy compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a result, SCLC is often treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, especially in the limited stage of the disease. The rapid growth and high mitotic rate of small cell tumors contribute to their increased sensitivity to radiation. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Small cell lung cancer is less chemosensitive: This statement is incorrect because SCLC is actually more chemosensitive than NSCLC. Chemotherapy is considered the mainstay of treatment for SCLC, as these tumors are more likely to respond to chemotherapeutic agents, especially in the early stages. Non-small cell lung cancers are generally less responsive to chemotherapy. C. Small cell lung cancer is more likely to present peripherally in the lung: This statement is incorrect because SCLC tends to present centrally in the lung, usually near the hilum or bronchi. In contrast, NSCLC, particularly adenocarcinoma, is more likely to present peripherally, in the outer regions of the lungs. D. Small cell lung cancer has better prognosis: This statement is incorrect. Small cell lung cancer has a poorer prognosis compared to non-small cell lung cancer. It is more aggressive, grows rapidly, and is more likely to metastasize early. Even though SCLC can initially respond well to chemotherapy and radiation, it often recurs, and survival rates are generally lower than for NSCLC, which tends to have a better overall prognosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) A 45-year-old woman who has never smoked with an adenocarcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are more commonly found in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, these mutations are more frequent in patients who are non-smokers, younger, and female. These factors make adenocarcinoma in a non-smoker woman particularly likely to harbor an EGFR mutation, making targeted therapy against EGFR a potentially effective treatment option. Why the other options are incorrect: A. A 23-year-old man with a hamartoma: This statement is incorrect because hamartomas are benign lung tumors and are not typically associated with EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are more commonly linked with malignant lung cancers, particularly adenocarcinomas of the non-small cell variety. B. A 33-year-old woman with a carcinoid tumor: This is incorrect because carcinoid tumors are low-grade neuroendocrine tumors and are not typically associated with EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are more commonly found in non-small cell lung cancers like adenocarcinoma and are not a hallmark of neuroendocrine tumors. D. A 56-year-old man with a 100-pack-year history of tobacco use with small-cell lung carcinoma: This is incorrect because small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is typically not associated with EGFR mutations. SCLC is highly aggressive and generally does not benefit from EGFR-targeted therapies, which are more commonly used in non-small cell lung cancers, particularly adenocarcinomas. Additionally, smokers (particularly heavy smokers) are less likely to have EGFR mutations compared to non-smokers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Oat cell variant is typically associated with hilar adenopathy. The oat cell variant, which refers to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), is a highly aggressive form of lung carcinoma that frequently presents with hilar lymphadenopathy. The tumors typically involve the central lung regions, and hilar lymphadenopathy is a common finding due to the tendency of small cell tumors to spread early to the lymph nodes. This makes it one of the characteristic features of SCLC. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Squamous cell variant accounts for 70% of all lung cancers: This is incorrect because squamous cell carcinoma of the lung actually accounts for about 20-25% of all lung cancers, not 70%. The most common type of lung cancer overall is adenocarcinoma, which is more prevalent in non-smokers, especially women. B. Oat cell variant typically presents with cavitation: This is incorrect because small cell lung cancer (SCLC), or oat cell carcinoma, rarely presents with cavitation. Cavitation is more commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which tends to develop in the peripheral regions and may cavitate due to necrosis. SCLC is typically central, aggressive, and doesn't usually form cavities. D. Adenocarcinoma variant is typically central in location: This is incorrect because adenocarcinoma of the lung typically arises peripherally rather than centrally. Adenocarcinoma tends to form peripheral masses, and is the most common type of lung cancer in non-smokers and is often associated with lung nodules in the outer regions of the lungs. Central lung cancers are more commonly squamous cell carcinomas and small cell lung cancers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cough. The most common symptom of lung cancer is cough, particularly in the early stages of the disease. This can be a new onset cough or a change in a chronic cough in smokers or those with a history of chronic lung disease. The cough may be dry or productive, and is often the first symptom that leads patients to seek medical attention. Lung cancer can irritate the airways, causing persistent coughing, which is why it is so common. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Hemoptysis: Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, is a less common symptom of lung cancer. It tends to occur more frequently in advanced stages of the disease or in cases where a tumor invades blood vessels or causes bleeding in the airways. While it can be a sign of lung cancer, it is not the most common initial symptom. C. Dyspnea: Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, is a common symptom in lung cancer, particularly in advanced stages when the tumor obstructs airways, causes pleural effusions, or leads to collapse of lung tissue. However, it is generally not as early or frequent as cough in the initial stages of lung cancer. D. Chest pain: Chest pain can occur in lung cancer, especially when a tumor invades the pleura or chest wall. However, it is less common as an initial symptom compared to cough. Many patients with early-stage lung cancer do not experience significant chest pain until the tumor has grown larger or spread to adjacent structures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Squamous cell. In this patient with hypercalcemia, the most likely histological variant of bronchogenic carcinoma is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is strongly associated with hypercalcemia, which often results from parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) secretion by the tumor. This leads to increased calcium release from bones and elevated calcium levels in the blood. Hypercalcemia is one of the paraneoplastic syndromes commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which is why this is the most probable diagnosis. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Small cell: Small cell lung cancer can also cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), which results in hyponatremia, not hypercalcemia. While small cell carcinoma can present with a variety of paraneoplastic syndromes, hypercalcemia is more typical of squamous cell carcinoma rather than small cell carcinoma. B. Large cell: Large cell carcinoma is a rare form of lung cancer and is not particularly associated with hypercalcemia. While paraneoplastic syndromes can occur with large cell carcinomas, hypercalcemia is not as characteristic of this histological type. C. Adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer, but it is not typically associated with hypercalcemia. While adenocarcinomas can cause paraneoplastic syndromes, they are more likely to be associated with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy or thrombophlebitis rather than hypercalcemia. Adenocarcinomas tend to present with symptoms related to pleural effusion and pulmonary symptoms, rather than paraneoplastic manifestations like hypercalcemia.",

While vitamin C is essential for general health and immunity, its deficiency does not have a direct association with the development of lung cancer. Studies have not established a causal link between low levels of vitamin C and lung cancer incidence. Therefore, Vitamin C deficiency is not a significant risk factor for lung cancer. Why the other options are correct: A. Decreased fruit intake in childhood: Decreased fruit intake during childhood can be a risk factor for lung cancer later in life. A poor diet, especially one low in fruits and vegetables, has been associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Fruits and vegetables provide antioxidants and other nutrients that are thought to protect against cancer development, and inadequate intake may increase vulnerability to carcinogens. B. Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB), especially in its chronic form, is a known risk factor for lung cancer. TB causes chronic inflammation and scarring of lung tissue, which increases the risk of mutations and malignant transformations in the affected cells. A history of pulmonary tuberculosis is associated with a higher risk of lung cancer, particularly in individuals with long-standing lung damage. D. Radon: Radon exposure is a well-established risk factor for lung cancer, especially in people who are exposed to high levels of radon in their homes or workplaces. Radon is a radioactive gas that naturally occurs from the decay of uranium in the soil and rocks. Inhalation of radon gas can lead to lung cancer, particularly in individuals who are exposed over long periods.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung tumor in women, never-smokers, and individuals younger than 45 years of age. This type of lung cancer is characterized by glandular differentiation and mucin production. In recent years, adenocarcinoma has become more prevalent, particularly in non-smokers, compared to other types of lung cancer. It is commonly found in the peripheral lung and is associated with genetic mutations such as EGFR mutations, which are more commonly seen in women and never-smokers. Therefore, adenocarcinoma is the correct answer because it fits the profile of the most common lung tumor in this specific demographic. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is often associated with smoking and is typically found in the central portions of the lungs. While it can occur in non-smokers, it is much less common in never-smokers and individuals younger than 45. Squamous cell carcinoma is more commonly diagnosed in older smokers, making it an unlikely answer for this specific population. B. Large cell carcinoma: Large cell carcinoma is a less common type of lung cancer and is often associated with a more aggressive clinical course. While it can occur in both smokers and non-smokers, it is less frequently observed in never-smokers and is not typically the most common type of lung cancer in women or younger individuals compared to adenocarcinoma. D. Small cell carcinoma: Small cell lung carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking and is typically seen in older individuals. It tends to present at an advanced stage and is rarely the most common lung cancer type in young non-smokers or women. While it is an aggressive form of lung cancer, it is not the most prevalent in the demographic described.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Adenocarcinoma. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) is most commonly associated with adenocarcinoma, particularly in lung cancer. HPOA is a paraneoplastic syndrome that is characterized by clubbing of the fingers, pain in the joints (arthralgia), and periostitis (inflammation of the bone membrane), especially affecting the long bones. Adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of lung cancer in both non-smokers and younger individuals, has a well-established association with HPOA. This syndrome is thought to result from the release of growth factors and other substances by the tumor that stimulate bone and joint changes. Therefore, adenocarcinoma is the most frequent type of cancer associated with HPOA. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Squamous cell carcinoma: While squamous cell carcinoma is a common form of lung cancer, it is less frequently associated with HPOA compared to adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is more commonly linked to paraneoplastic syndromes like hypercalcemia, rather than hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Hence, squamous cell carcinoma is not the correct answer. C. Small cell carcinoma: Small cell lung cancer is typically associated with paraneoplastic syndromes like Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) and Cushing's syndrome, but it is not the most common type associated with HPOA. Small cell carcinoma, due to its aggressive nature, is more often linked to these other syndromes rather than hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. D. Large cell carcinoma: Large cell carcinoma, like small cell carcinoma, is an aggressive form of lung cancer. It is generally less common than adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and while it can cause various paraneoplastic syndromes, it is not most commonly associated with HPOA. Adenocarcinoma remains the leading type of lung cancer linked with this syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Small cell carcinoma. The patient's presentation is most consistent with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Several factors point toward this diagnosis: History of smoking: The patient has a significant history of cigarette smoking (45 pack-years), which is a strong risk factor for small cell lung carcinoma. Small cell lung cancer is closely associated with heavy smoking and accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers. Symptoms: The patient presents with a productive cough with blood-streaked sputum and normal physical examination findings, which are typical for SCLC. The blood-streaked sputum can be due to the tumor causing irritation or obstruction of the airways, which is common in SCLC. Hyponatremia (serum Na+ of 124 meq/L): Small cell carcinoma often causes paraneoplastic syndromes, one of which is Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), which leads to hyponatremia. SIADH can be seen in SCLC due to the secretion of ADH-like substances by the tumor cells. Radiologic findings: The CXR shows findings typical of central lung masses, which are characteristic of SCLC, especially when they involve the mainstem bronchus, leading to partial occlusion. Cytology findings: The brush cytology being positive for tumor cells further supports the presence of a central lung mass causing obstruction, a pattern commonly seen in small cell carcinoma. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma: Large cell carcinoma is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that tends to present as a peripheral mass rather than a central mass. It is not typically associated with SIADH or significant hyponatremia. Additionally, this type of cancer is less likely to cause the classic paraneoplastic syndrome seen with small cell carcinoma. B. Adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth: Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer in non-smokers, but it usually presents as a peripheral mass rather than a central obstructing mass. Adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth typically manifests as ground-glass opacities on imaging and does not usually cause bronchial obstruction leading to SIADH. It is less likely to present with blood-streaked sputum as the primary complaint. C. Squamous cell carcinoma: While squamous cell carcinoma is commonly found centrally and may present with a cough and blood-streaked sputum, it is less likely to cause SIADH or profound hyponatremia. Moreover, squamous cell carcinoma is often more smoking-associated and can present with cavitary lesions, but the lack of other features such as paraneoplastic syndrome makes this diagnosis less likely compared to small cell carcinoma.",
