      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The thymine nucleotide required for DNA synthesis The variant of N5,N10-methylene-FH4 reductase described in the question is involved in the folate metabolism pathway, where it plays a role in the conversion of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (5,10-methylene-FH4) to 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-FH4). This enzyme is critical for the synthesis of thymidylate (dTMP), a nucleotide essential for DNA synthesis. At the nonpermissive temperature (37°C), the reduced activity of this enzyme would hinder the production of 5,10-methylene-FH4, which is required for the synthesis of dTMP. Without adequate dTMP, thymine, a crucial component for DNA synthesis, cannot be effectively produced, leading to difficulty in DNA replication. Therefore, the person would specifically have difficulty producing the thymine nucleotide required for DNA synthesis. Incorrect Answers: A. Creatine phosphate from creatine Creatine phosphate is synthesized from creatine by the enzyme creatine kinase, which is not related to the folate metabolism pathway or the activity of N5,N10-methylene-FH4 reductase. This metabolic pathway is independent of the enzyme in question, and thus a deficiency in N5,N10-methylene-FH4 reductase would not affect the production of creatine phosphate. B. Pyrimidines required for RNA synthesis Pyrimidine synthesis involves several steps in the metabolism of amino acids and other intermediates, but it is not directly dependent on N5,N10-methylene-FH4 reductase activity. While folate is involved in the synthesis of pyrimidines, the primary issue in this case is the inability to generate thymine for DNA synthesis. The reduced activity of this enzyme would not primarily affect the production of pyrimidines for RNA synthesis, which mainly involves uracil and cytosine. D. All deoxyribonucleotides While a deficiency in thymidine (dTMP) synthesis would affect the production of thymine, this would not necessarily affect all deoxyribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides are produced from ribonucleotides through a process of reduction, and the synthesis of other deoxyribonucleotides (such as deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine, and deoxyadenosine) is not as directly dependent on the N5,N10-methylene-FH4 reductase enzyme. Therefore, only thymidine would be specifically affected in this case, not all deoxyribonucleotides.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Guanosine. Guanosine is not a nitrogenous base; it is a nucleoside, which consists of the nitrogenous base guanine attached to a sugar molecule (ribose in RNA or deoxyribose in DNA). In contrast, nitrogenous bases are the individual molecules that make up the genetic code, such as adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Adenine – This is correct because adenine is a nitrogenous base. It is one of the purine bases in DNA and RNA, pairing with thymine (in DNA) or uracil (in RNA). (B) Cytosine – This is correct because cytosine is a nitrogenous base. It is one of the pyrimidine bases in DNA and RNA, pairing with guanine in both DNA and RNA.

Pyrimidines are a class of nitrogenous bases, and thiamine contains a pyrimidine ring structure as part of its molecular composition. Thiamine is essential for energy metabolism and plays a crucial role in cellular function. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Flavin mononucleotide – This is incorrect because flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is a nucleotide that contains the purine derivative riboflavin (vitamin B2), not a pyrimidine. FMN is involved in various redox reactions in cellular metabolism, but it does not contain a pyrimidine base. (C) Theophylline – This is incorrect because theophylline is a xanthine derivative, a purine alkaloid, not a pyrimidine. It is used in the treatment of respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but it does not contain a pyrimidine structure. (D) Theobromine – This is incorrect because theobromine is another purine derivative, specifically a methylated form of xanthine, and is found in chocolate.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Glycosidic. A glycosidic bond is formed between the sugar and the nitrogenous base in nucleotides. In DNA and RNA, the nitrogenous base is attached to the sugar molecule (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA) via a glycosidic bond. This bond forms between the 1' carbon of the sugar and the nitrogenous base, specifically at either the N9 position in purines (adenine and guanine) or the N1 position in pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Ionic bond – This is incorrect because ionic bonds involve the electrostatic attraction between positively and negatively charged ions, which is not the case between the sugar and nitrogenous base. The sugar-nitrogenous base bond is a covalent bond, not ionic. (B) Phosphodiester – This is incorrect because a phosphodiester bond forms between the sugar molecules of adjacent nucleotides in a polynucleotide chain, linking the 3' carbon of one sugar to the 5' carbon of the next sugar. It is not the bond formed between the sugar and nitrogenous base. (C) Acid anhydride – This is incorrect because an acid anhydride bond involves the reaction between two acids to form a compound that releases a molecule of water. It is not involved in the attachment of the sugar to the nitrogenous base in nucleotides.",

In nucleic acids, the 1st carbon of the pentose sugar (either ribose in RNA or deoxyribose in DNA) forms a glycosidic bond with the N1 atom of a pyrimidine base (cytosine, thymine, or uracil). This connection is part of the nucleotide structure, where the nitrogenous base is linked to the sugar. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) N1 of purine – This is incorrect because in purines (adenine and guanine), the 1st carbon of the pentose sugar forms a glycosidic bond with the N9 position of the purine base, not N1. (C) N8 of purine – This is incorrect because N8 is not the position that forms the glycosidic bond in purines. As mentioned, purines form the glycosidic bond at N9, not at N8. (D) None of the above – This is incorrect because the correct answer is indeed (B). The glycosidic bond between the sugar and pyrimidine base is formed at the N1 position.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Uric acid. Uric acid is the most oxidized form of purine. During the purine metabolism pathway, purines like adenine and guanine are broken down into intermediate compounds, eventually leading to the formation of uric acid. Uric acid is the final product of purine catabolism in humans and is highly oxidized because it contains multiple oxygen atoms in its structure. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Adenine – This is incorrect because adenine is a purine base and is not fully oxidized. It is an intermediate in purine metabolism and gets converted into hypoxanthine, which is then further oxidized to xanthine and uric acid. (C) Hypoxanthine – This is incorrect because hypoxanthine is an intermediate in purine metabolism. It is a partially oxidized form of adenine, but it is not as oxidized as xanthine or uric acid. (D) Xanthine – This is incorrect because xanthine is a step before uric acid in purine metabolism. It is less oxidized than uric acid but more oxidized than hypoxanthine and adenine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 3’-5’ Phosphodiester linkage In a polynucleotide chain (DNA or RNA), nucleotides are linked together by phosphodiester bonds, which form between the 3’-hydroxyl (-OH) group of one nucleotide's sugar (deoxyribose or ribose) and the 5’-phosphate group of the next nucleotide. This forms a sugar-phosphate backbone, which provides structural integrity and directionality to the nucleic acid strand. The 3’-5’ linkage is essential for replication and transcription, ensuring the correct sequence arrangement for genetic information storage and transmission. Incorrect Options: (B) 5’-3’ Phosphodiester linkage Although phosphodiester bonds are formed between the 5’-phosphate of one nucleotide and the 3’-OH of another, the standard nomenclature describes DNA and RNA as having a 3’-5’ directionality. Thus, 5’-3’ phosphodiester linkage is not the correct terminology. (C) β-N-glycosidic linkage This linkage is responsible for attaching the nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil) to the sugar molecule (ribose or deoxyribose) in a nucleotide. While crucial in nucleotide structure, it does not link nucleotides together in a chain. (D) Hydrogen bond Hydrogen bonds are essential in holding together complementary DNA strands in a double helix (e.g., A-T with two hydrogen bonds, G-C with three hydrogen bonds). However, they do not link nucleotides within a single polynucleotide chain—they are instead responsible for stabilizing the double-stranded DNA structure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Negatively charged. DNA molecules are negatively charged at physiological pH due to the presence of phosphate groups in the sugar-phosphate backbone of the molecule. Each phosphate group contains a negative charge on its oxygen atom, making the overall DNA molecule negatively charged under normal physiological conditions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Neutral – This is incorrect because DNA is not neutral at physiological pH. The phosphate groups in the backbone contribute a negative charge to the molecule, making it negatively charged rather than neutral. (C) Positive charge – This is incorrect because DNA is not positively charged at physiological pH. A positively charged molecule would have a surplus of protons, which is not the case with DNA, as the phosphate groups impart a negative charge. (D) Amphipathic – This is incorrect because while DNA has hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, it is not classified as amphipathic. Amphipathic molecules typically have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions that are able to interact with both water and lipid environments, which does not accurately describe the overall charge characteristics of DNA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aspartate acts as the amino group donor for forming guanine. This statement is incorrect because the amino group in guanine does not come from aspartate. Instead, the amino group at position 2 of guanine is typically donated by glutamine during the biosynthesis of guanine, not aspartate. Therefore, option (D) is not true for the guanidine ring. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Carbonyl group at C6 acts as hydrogen acceptor – This is correct. The carbonyl group at position C6 of the guanine ring can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, helping guanine form hydrogen bonds with cytosine in DNA base pairing. (B) It contains 9 atoms – This is correct. The guanidine ring contains 9 atoms in total, including carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen, which makes it a heterocyclic structure. (C) It forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine – This is correct. In the context of DNA base pairing, guanine forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine, which is critical for the stability of the DNA double helix.",

It does not derive from nucleotides or nucleotide derivatives, making it the exception in this list.

This is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, which are essential for DNA synthesis. The enzyme specifically acts on the diphosphate form of the nucleoside, converting it into its deoxyribonucleotide counterpart. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Nucleoside triphosphate – This is incorrect because the ribonucleotide reductase does not directly act on nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) for the reduction process. The reduction happens at the nucleoside diphosphate level, not triphosphate. (C) Nucleoside monophosphate – This is incorrect because ribonucleotide reductase does not work on nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs). The reduction process occurs at the nucleoside diphosphate stage, not on the monophosphate form. (D) All of the above – This is incorrect because ribonucleotide reductase specifically acts on nucleoside diphosphates, not all the forms of nucleotides listed.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Adenosine. Adenosine is a nucleoside, which consists of a purine base (adenine) attached to a sugar molecule (deoxyribose in DNA). Upon complete hydrolysis of DNA, adenosine is not directly produced because the sugar and base are separated into their individual components (deoxyribose and adenine, respectively), and nucleosides are not part of the final breakdown products. Therefore, adenosine is not a product of DNA hydrolysis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Purine bases – This is incorrect because purine bases (adenine and guanine) are the breakdown products of DNA hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, the purine bases are released when the nucleotides are broken down into their components. (B) Deoxy pentose sugar – This is incorrect because deoxyribose (the sugar component of DNA) is also a product of DNA hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds between the nucleotides releases deoxyribose sugar. (C) Phosphoric acid – This is incorrect because phosphoric acid (or phosphate groups) is a product of complete DNA hydrolysis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aspartate, glycine, glutamate. Purines, such as adenine and guanine, are synthesized through a complex pathway known as the purine biosynthesis pathway, and they are formed by the contribution of several amino acids. Among the important contributors are aspartate, glycine, and glutamate, which provide carbon and nitrogen atoms that are incorporated into the purine ring structure. These amino acids play crucial roles at different steps in the biosynthetic pathway. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Aspartate, glycine – This is incorrect because while aspartate and glycine are indeed involved in purine biosynthesis, glutamate is also an essential contributor. Without glutamate, the pathway would be incomplete, so this option does not account for all necessary amino acids. (B) Aspartate, glutamate – This is incorrect because although aspartate and glutamate are involved in purine biosynthesis, glycine is also required for the formation of purine rings. Omitting glycine makes this option incomplete. (D) Aspartic acid, glycine, uric acid – This is incorrect because uric acid is not a precursor in the synthesis of purines. Uric acid is actually the end product of purine metabolism, formed when purines are broken down, not a building block in their synthesis.",

However, tetrahydrofolate (THF) does not directly contribute nitrogen atoms to the purine ring. THF is primarily involved in transferring one-carbon units (such as methyl groups) during various biochemical processes, but it does not directly provide nitrogen atoms in purine biosynthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Aspartate – This is incorrect because aspartate contributes nitrogen atoms to the purine ring. Specifically, one of the nitrogen atoms in the purine ring comes from the amino group of aspartate during the biosynthesis pathway. (B) Glutamine – This is incorrect because glutamine contributes nitrogen atoms to the purine ring as well. Glutamine provides nitrogen through its amino group in several steps of purine biosynthesis.

Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Glutamine – This is incorrect because glutamine is a common substrate for both purine and pyrimidine synthesis. In purine synthesis, glutamine provides nitrogen atoms, and in pyrimidine synthesis, it also donates nitrogen in the formation of the pyrimidine ring. (C) Aspartic acid – This is incorrect because aspartic acid is involved in both purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.

IMP is synthesized via a series of steps, including the addition of atoms from various sources like glycine, glutamine, and formate, to form the purine ring structure. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) AMP (Adenosine Monophosphate) – This is incorrect because AMP is not the first purine nucleotide formed during de novo synthesis. It is derived from IMP (Inosine Monophosphate) after further modifications. AMP is synthesized by the addition of an amino group to IMP via the action of adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinate lyase. (B) UMP (Uridine Monophosphate) – This is incorrect because UMP is a pyrimidine nucleotide, not a purine nucleotide. UMP is synthesized via a separate pathway called pyrimidine biosynthesis, not purine de novo synthesis.

PRPP amidotransferase is a key enzyme in the purine biosynthesis pathway, responsible for the conversion of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to 5-phosphoribosylamine, an essential step in purine nucleotide synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is regulated by the availability of PRPP and the levels of purine nucleotides. In the liver, the enzyme's activity is particularly important because the liver plays a central role in metabolic processes, including nucleotide synthesis. In response to high metabolic demand, such as during periods of growth or cell division, the liver increases PRPP amidotransferase activity to ensure adequate purine synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) RBC (Red Blood Cells) – This is incorrect because red blood cells do not have nuclei and thus do not engage in purine synthesis. Red blood cells rely on the external supply of purines rather than synthesizing them. (B) Brain – This is incorrect because while the brain requires purines for its cellular activities, purine synthesis is not regulated by PRPP amidotransferase activity to a great extent in the brain. The liver plays a more prominent role in purine biosynthesis regulation. (D) Polymorphs (Polymorphonuclear leukocytes) – This is incorrect because while polymorphs (neutrophils) are involved in immune responses, they do not significantly increase PRPP amidotransferase activity for purine synthesis. Their primary role is in fighting infections rather than in regulating metabolic pathways like purine biosynthesis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Liver. The salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis involves the recycling of purine bases (such as adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine) into purine nucleotides, rather than synthesizing them de novo. This pathway is energetically efficient because it conserves the energy required for new synthesis. The liver is not the primary site for the salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis. Although the liver does play an important role in metabolism and other biosynthetic pathways, purine salvage primarily occurs in tissues with high turnover of purine nucleotides, such as the brain, red blood cells, and leukocytes. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Brain – This is incorrect because the brain uses the salvage pathway for purine synthesis. Neurons, which are metabolically active, rely on the recycling of purines to meet their nucleotide needs, since purine synthesis de novo is less efficient in the brain. (B) RBC (Red Blood Cells) – This is incorrect because red blood cells also rely on the salvage pathway for purine synthesis. Since red blood cells do not have nuclei, they cannot carry out purine biosynthesis de novo, and thus rely on the recycling of purines to maintain their nucleotide pool. (C) Leukocyte – This is incorrect because leukocytes (white blood cells) also utilize the salvage pathway for purine synthesis. As immune cells with high metabolic activity, leukocytes recycle purines through the salvage pathway to support their functions, especially during immune responses.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Synthesis of purine nucleotides from purine bases. The salvage pathway of purine synthesis refers to the recycling of purine bases, such as adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine, to synthesize purine nucleotides like AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (guanosine monophosphate). This pathway is an efficient way to maintain purine nucleotide pools without the need for de novo synthesis, which is energetically costly. In the salvage pathway, enzymes such as HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) or APRT (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) help convert the free purine bases into their respective nucleotides using PRPP (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Synthesis of purine from ribose-5-phosphate – This is incorrect because purine synthesis from ribose-5-phosphate occurs in the de novo synthesis pathway, not in the salvage pathway. In the de novo pathway, ribose-5-phosphate is converted into inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is then used to synthesize AMP and GMP. The salvage pathway does not involve starting from ribose-5-phosphate but instead recycles existing purine bases. (C) Synthesis of purine from pyrimidine – This is incorrect because purine synthesis is not derived from pyrimidines. Purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways are separate, and although they may share some common intermediates (such as ribose-5-phosphate), purines are not synthesized from pyrimidine bases. (D) None of the above – This is incorrect because option (A) is the correct description of the salvage pathway, making \"None of the above\" an incorrect answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Salvage pathway of purine synthesis. Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) plays a crucial role in the salvage pathway of purine synthesis. It catalyzes the conversion of adenine and PRPP (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate) to AMP (adenosine monophosphate). This process is part of the recycling mechanism where free purine bases like adenine are recycled into nucleotides, conserving energy and resources for the cell. APRT is one of the key enzymes involved in the salvage of purine bases, ensuring that adenine can be reutilized efficiently for nucleotide synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) De novo synthesis of purine – This is incorrect because APRT is not involved in the de novo synthesis of purines. De novo purine synthesis starts from simple precursors like ribose-5-phosphate and amino acids (glycine, glutamine, etc.) to build purine nucleotides like AMP and GMP. APRT specifically works in the salvage pathway, not in de novo purine synthesis. (C) Purine catabolism – This is incorrect because APRT does not participate in purine catabolism. Purine catabolism involves the breakdown of purine nucleotides and bases to uric acid or other metabolites, a process that is handled by enzymes like xanthine oxidase and adenosine deaminase, not by APRT. (D) None of the above – This is incorrect because, as explained, APRT is specifically involved in the salvage pathway of purine synthesis, making option (B) the correct choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Xanthine. In purine catabolism, the first significant product formed is xanthine. Purine nucleotides like AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (guanosine monophosphate) are first broken down into their respective purine bases, adenine and guanine. These bases are then metabolized through a series of enzymatic reactions. Adenine is converted into hypoxanthine, while guanine is converted into xanthine. The xanthine is then further metabolized into uric acid by the action of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. This process is important for the breakdown and excretion of purines. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) β-alanine-alanine – This is incorrect because β--alanine is not a product of purine catabolism. This option seems to be a typographical or conceptual error. The catabolism of purines leads to purine bases and eventually to uric acid, not to amino acids like β--alanine. (B) CO2 – This is incorrect because CO2 is a byproduct of many metabolic processes, including the citric acid cycle, but not the first direct product of purine catabolism. While CO2 is released during the breakdown of purines, the first product specifically in purine catabolism is xanthine, not CO2 (D) Uric acid – This is incorrect because uric acid is the final product of purine catabolism, not the first. It is formed after xanthine undergoes oxidation by xanthine oxidase. Uric acid is the end-product of purine metabolism, which is excreted in the urine in humans.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aspartate transcarbamylase. In pyrimidine synthesis, the rate-limiting step is catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, where it catalyzes the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate to form carbamoyl aspartate, which is an early intermediate in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. The regulation of this enzyme is tightly controlled because it sets the pace for the entire pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. It is inhibited by CTP (cytidine triphosphate) and activated by ATP, reflecting the cell’s need for pyrimidine nucleotides. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Dihydroorotase – This is incorrect because dihydroorotase catalyzes a step further down the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. It is involved in converting carbamoyl aspartate to dihydroorotate. While important in pyrimidine synthesis, it is not the rate-limiting step. (C) CPS-I (Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I) – This is incorrect because CPS-I is involved in the urea cycle, not pyrimidine synthesis. It catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate. The correct form of CPS involved in pyrimidine synthesis is CPS-II, which participates in the formation of carbamoyl phosphate specifically for pyrimidine biosynthesis. (D) Ornithine transcarbamylase – This is incorrect because ornithine transcarbamylase is involved in the urea cycle, not pyrimidine synthesis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Xanthinuria. Xanthinuria is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for converting hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Since the body cannot convert xanthine to uric acid, individuals with xanthinuria accumulate xanthine rather than uric acid. As a result, hyperuricemia (elevated levels of uric acid in the blood) does not occur in xanthinuria, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Psoriasis – This is incorrect because psoriasis can lead to hyperuricemia. Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that often results in increased turnover of skin cells, which can lead to increased purine metabolism. This elevated purine metabolism can cause hyperuricemia, as uric acid is a byproduct of purine breakdown. (C) Von Gierke’s disease – This is incorrect because Von Gierke’s disease (also known as glycogen storage disease type I) is associated with hyperuricemia. In this disorder, there is a defect in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which leads to the accumulation of glycogen in tissues and causes metabolic disturbances, including increased purine breakdown. This results in elevated levels of uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. (D) Cancer – This is incorrect because cancer is often associated with hyperuricemia. Tumors undergo rapid cell division and turnover, leading to increased breakdown of purines and, consequently, elevated levels of uric acid. This is a common phenomenon in individuals with malignancies, particularly those undergoing chemotherapy (due to tumor lysis).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, also known as Von Gierke's disease, is a metabolic disorder that leads to hyperuricemia due to both increased production and decreased excretion of uric acid. In this condition, the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase impairs the final step in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, leading to glycogen accumulation in the liver and kidneys. The buildup of lactic acid and purines from increased glycogen metabolism leads to increased production of uric acid. Additionally, renal dysfunction often occurs, impairing the excretion of uric acid, contributing further to hyperuricemia. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Renal failure – This is incorrect because renal failure can lead to decreased excretion of uric acid, but it does not necessarily lead to increased production of uric acid. In renal failure, the kidneys are less able to excrete waste products, including uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. However, it is primarily due to decreased excretion rather than increased production. (C) Xanthine oxidase deficiency – This is incorrect because xanthine oxidase deficiency leads to xanthinuria, where xanthine accumulates, not uric acid. In this condition, the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid is impaired. As a result, uric acid production is reduced, not increased, so hyperuricemia is not observed. (D) PRPP synthetase overactivity – This is incorrect because PRPP synthetase overactivity does lead to increased purine synthesis, and as a result, increased production of uric acid. However, it does not typically lead to a decrease in uric acid excretion. Hyperuricemia in this case occurs primarily due to increased production of uric acid, rather than due to both increased production and decreased excretion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Due to increased metabolism of pyrimidines. Gout is primarily caused by increased metabolism of purines, not pyrimidines. This leads to the accumulation of uric acid, which forms crystals that deposit in joints, particularly in the great toe, causing the characteristic pain and inflammation of gout. In gout, purine metabolism is disturbed, leading to elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia), which can result in urate crystal formation in tissues, especially the joints. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Uric acid level may not be elevated – This is correct. While elevated uric acid levels are commonly seen in gout, it is possible for gout to occur even when uric acid levels are not significantly elevated. This can occur in certain situations such as during intermittent gout attacks or in individuals with under-excretion of uric acid where levels may fluctuate. (B) Due to increased metabolism of purine – This is correct. Gout is most commonly caused by increased purine metabolism. Purines are metabolized into uric acid, and when the body produces excess uric acid or cannot efficiently excrete it, hyperuricemia occurs, leading to the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints and tissues, causing inflammation and pain typical of gout. (D) Has a predilection for the great toe – This is correct. Gout frequently affects the great toe due to the cooler temperature of the extremities, which facilitates the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints. The big toe (hallux) is often the first and most common site of a gout attack, resulting in intense pain and swelling.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) HGPRTase deficiency. The child presents with hyperuricemia, delayed developmental milestones, poor concentration, and habit of biting fingers and nails. These symptoms are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase). This deficiency leads to the inability to recycle purines via the salvage pathway, causing an accumulation of uric acid (hyperuricemia), and the development of neurological and behavioral abnormalities, including self-mutilating behaviors such as biting fingers and nails. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Adenosine deaminase – This enzyme deficiency leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, and failure to thrive, but not hyperuricemia or the behavioral symptoms seen in the case. While adenosine deaminase deficiency can lead to increased purine metabolism, it does not cause the specific constellation of delayed development and self-mutilating behavior seen in this child. (B) Hexosaminidase A – This enzyme is deficient in Tay-Sachs disease, which primarily affects the nervous system and leads to neurodegeneration, loss of motor skills, and cherry-red spots in the retina. There is no association with hyperuricemia or self-harming behaviors in this disorder. (D) Phenylalanine hydroxylase – This enzyme deficiency causes phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder in which phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to intellectual disability and developmental delay. However, PKU does not present with hyperuricemia or the self-mutilation behaviors associated with HGPRTase deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Uric acid. The 10-year-old boy presents with rashes and a family history of self-mutilation behavior, which raises suspicion for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), leading to an accumulation of uric acid. The elevated levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) are a hallmark of the disease. The self-mutilation behaviors (such as biting fingers and nails), developmental delays, and hyperuricemia strongly suggest this diagnosis, making uric acid measurement the most crucial investigation in confirming the diagnosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Alkaline phosphatase – Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are typically associated with conditions like bone disease (e.g., Paget’s disease, osteomalacia, or rickets) or liver diseases. It is not a key marker for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or the symptoms presented in this case. (B) Lead – Lead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms including abdominal pain, developmental delays, and neurological issues, but it does not cause the self-mutilation behavior or the specific hyperuricemia seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. While lead poisoning can sometimes present with some similar symptoms, it is not the first investigation to pursue in this clinical context. (C) LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) – LDH is an enzyme that is elevated in various conditions such as hemolysis, liver disease, or muscle injury. It is not specific for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and would not be helpful in diagnosing the hyperuricemia or self-mutilating behavior seen in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) UMP synthase. Hereditary orotic aciduria type-I is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme UMP synthase, which is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of orotic acid to UMP (uridine monophosphate). This enzyme has two activities: orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and orotic acid decarboxylase, and a defect in UMP synthase leads to orotic acid accumulation in the urine. This disorder results in symptoms such as megaloblastic anemia, growth retardation, and orotic aciduria. Supplementation with uridine can often help reverse these symptoms, as uridine can bypass the metabolic block. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Orotic acid decarboxylase – This enzyme is part of the UMP synthase complex but is not the primary cause of hereditary orotic aciduria type-I when deficient alone. The defect causing the disease is in the whole UMP synthase complex, which includes both the orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and orotic acid decarboxylase activities. (B) Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase – This enzyme is also part of the UMP synthase complex and, when deficient in combination with orotic acid decarboxylase, leads to orotic aciduria. However, the defect in orotic aciduria type-I is in the entire UMP synthase enzyme complex rather than just one specific part of it. (D) All of the above – While orotic acid decarboxylase and orotate phosphoribosyl transferase are components of the UMP synthase complex, deficiency of the entire UMP synthase enzyme is what causes hereditary orotic aciduria type-I. Therefore, the answer is not \"all of the above,\" as the deficiency is specific to UMP synthase rather than isolated deficiencies of the individual enzymes.",
