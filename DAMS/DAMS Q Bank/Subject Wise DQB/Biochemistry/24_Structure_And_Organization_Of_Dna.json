      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) It will lack introns Pseudogenes produced by reverse transcription of mRNA typically lack introns. This is because the process of reverse transcription generates a complementary DNA (cDNA) copy of the mRNA, which is a mature form of the gene without any introns. When the resulting cDNA is inserted back into the genome, it will not contain the introns that are present in the genomic DNA of the functional gene. This is a key distinction between functional genes and pseudogenes, as pseudogenes are generally considered non-functional due to their lack of regulatory elements (like promoters) and inability to produce the corresponding protein. Therefore, lack of introns is a primary characteristic of pseudogenes generated by reverse transcription. Incorrect Answers: A. It will contain an oncogenic mutation While it is possible for mutations to arise during the reverse transcription process or subsequent insertion into the genome, the primary feature of a pseudogene produced in this manner is its lack of introns and functional regulatory elements. Oncogenic mutations are not a defining feature of pseudogenes. The absence of a promoter and the inability to express the gene are more critical in defining pseudogenes. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B. It will contain nested genes for antibiotic resistance Nested genes, which are genes that exist within the coding sequence of another gene, are not a feature of pseudogenes produced by reverse transcription. While nested genes can be present in genomes, they are not a consequence of the reverse transcription process that creates pseudogenes. Thus, this answer is not correct. C. It will have lost some coding regions While pseudogenes may have various mutations that could lead to the loss of some coding regions, the defining feature of pseudogenes generated by reverse transcription is the lack of introns, not necessarily the loss of coding regions. The cDNA copy of the mRNA can still be a full-length copy of the coding sequence, but it will be devoid of introns. Therefore, this option is less relevant than option D.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) D. The nucleotide of one strand forms bonds with a nucleotide of the opposite strand.\" This is describing the base pairing that occurs in the double-stranded structure of DNA. In DNA, nitrogenous bases on one strand form hydrogen bonds with complementary bases on the opposite strand: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This complementary base pairing is critical for the double helix structure and for DNA replication. Incorrect Options: A. Cytosine and uracil differ by one ribose sugar: This is incorrect because cytosine and uracil are both pyrimidines, but they differ by a functional group, not a sugar. Cytosine contains an amino group (-NH2) at the 4-position, while uracil has a carbonyl group (=O) at the same position. Both cytosine (found in DNA) and uracil (found in RNA) are nucleobases, but they do not differ by a sugar. Additionally, the ribose sugar is found in RNA, and DNA contains deoxyribose sugar. B. The information from DNA is copied in the form of tRNA: This statement is incorrect because the information from DNA is first transcribed into mRNA (messenger RNA), not tRNA. The mRNA carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis. tRNA (transfer RNA) plays a role in translating the mRNA codons into amino acids during translation, but it is not directly involved in copying the information from DNA. C. Each nucleotide pair includes two purines: This statement is incorrect because in DNA, each nucleotide pair consists of one purine and one pyrimidine. Purines (adenine and guanine) pair with pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine) according to the base-pairing rules. For example, adenine (a purine) pairs with thymine (a pyrimidine), and guanine (a purine) pairs with cytosine (a pyrimidine).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Double stranded DNA. In double-stranded DNA, the base pairing follows Chargaff's rule, where adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C) in roughly equal proportions. The given nucleic acid has 32% adenine (A) and 33% thymine (T), which are very close in percentage, showing that these two bases are paired. Similarly, the percentages of guanine (18%) and cytosine (17%) are also very close, indicating base pairing between these two as well. These base pairings and the near equality in their respective percentages strongly suggest a double-stranded DNA structure. A. Single stranded RNA is incorrect because in RNA, uracil (U) pairs with adenine (A), not thymine. In addition, the base composition in single-stranded RNA would not follow the same percentage relationships as seen in double-stranded DNA, especially since thymine is not present in RNA. The presence of thymine and the near-equal distribution of adenine and thymine rule out this option. B. Single stranded DNA is incorrect because single-stranded DNA does not follow the same base pairing rules as double-stranded DNA. While adenine and thymine should still be in close proximity in terms of percentage, the base composition would not show such a direct complementarity without the other strand to base-pair with, as seen in double-stranded DNA. C. Double stranded RNA is incorrect because RNA is typically single-stranded, and even in rare cases where RNA is double-stranded, it still follows the A-U and G-C base-pairing rules. The presence of thymine (T), which is absent in RNA, makes this option incorrect. Additionally, the percentages of bases in double-stranded RNA would be unlikely to match these proportions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 35%. According to Chargaff's rule, in double-stranded DNA, the amount of adenine (A) is equal to thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) is equal to cytosine (C). If the content of adenine (A) is 15%, then thymine (T) must also be 15%. This means that the remaining 70% of the DNA must be composed of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) in equal amounts, meaning each must be 35%. Therefore, the amount of guanine (G) in this DNA is 35%. A. 15% is incorrect because if guanine were 15%, it would not follow Chargaff's rule, which requires the amount of guanine to be equal to the amount of cytosine, and the sum of adenine and thymine must match the sum of guanine and cytosine. C. 70% is incorrect because this value would imply that guanine makes up 70% of the total, which would be inconsistent with the base pairing rules of DNA. Given the fixed amount of adenine (15%), thymine (15%), and the need for an equal amount of guanine and cytosine, 70% would exceed the available space in the total 100%. D. 85% is also incorrect because if guanine were 85%, it would make up the vast majority of the DNA, leaving only a very small percentage for adenine, thymine, and cytosine. This would violate the requirement for balanced base pairing in double-stranded DNA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A → T, C → G. Watson and Crick's base pairing rule states that in double-stranded DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This is due to complementary hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases: two hydrogen bonds form between adenine and thymine, and three hydrogen bonds form between cytosine and guanine. This pairing ensures the stability and proper structure of the DNA double helix. B. A → G, T → U is incorrect because adenine does not pair with guanine in DNA, and thymine does not pair with uracil in DNA either. Uracil is found in RNA, not DNA, and adenine pairs with thymine in DNA, not guanine. C. A → C, T → G is incorrect because adenine does not pair with cytosine, nor does thymine pair with guanine. This would violate the established base pairing rules in both DNA and RNA. D. A → G, T → C is incorrect because adenine does not pair with guanine, and thymine does not pair with cytosine.

The coding strand of DNA is also known as the plus strand because it has the same sequence as the mRNA (except with thymine (T) replaced by uracil (U) in RNA). The coding strand directly carries the genetic information that is used to produce proteins, and its sequence matches the RNA transcript that encodes for a protein. During transcription, the mRNA is synthesized by reading the complementary minus strand (template strand) of DNA, but it mirrors the sequence of the coding (plus) strand. A. Minus strand is incorrect because the minus strand is the template strand for RNA transcription, not the coding strand. It is complementary to the coding strand and is used to generate the mRNA. D.

This form is stable and most commonly observed in the natural state of DNA. B.

C DNA is incorrect because C DNA, like A DNA, is also a right-handed helix, but it is not the predominant form of DNA in most living cells. It occurs under certain conditions but does not dominate biological DNA structures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) What is DNA Hyperchromatism? DNA hyperchromicity refers to the increase in absorbance (optical density, OD) at 260 nm when double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is denatured into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This occurs because bases in dsDNA are stacked and hydrogen-bonded, limiting their ability to absorb UV light. When the DNA is denatured (by heat or chemicals), the bases become more exposed, leading to increased UV absorption (hyperchromic effect). Evaluating the Options: A. Measured by absorbance at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer → TRUE Nucleic acids absorb light at 260 nm, and spectrophotometers are used to measure this absorbance. B. It occurs when the DNA duplex is denatured → TRUE Denaturation (heat, pH, or chemical agents) disrupts hydrogen bonds, increasing absorbance. C. It is an increase of absorbance → TRUE The hyperchromic effect results in a significant increase in absorbance at 260 nm when DNA unwinds.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hydrogen bond. During DNA denaturation, the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine) are broken, causing the two strands of the DNA double helix to separate. This is the key process in denaturation, where the double-stranded DNA becomes single-stranded. The covalent bonds, such as phosphodiester bonds and glycosidic bonds, remain intact during denaturation. A. Phosphodiester is incorrect because the phosphodiester bonds are the covalent bonds linking the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA. These bonds are not broken during denaturation; instead, they remain intact as the strands separate. B. ?-N Glycosidic bond is incorrect because the glycosidic bond connects the nitrogenous bases to the sugar molecule in the nucleotides, but these bonds are not affected by denaturation. Denaturation involves the breaking of hydrogen bonds, not the glycosidic bonds. D. O-Glycosidic bond is incorrect because this term typically refers to a type of bond in carbohydrates, not in the structure of nucleic acids.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Restriction endonuclease. Restriction endonucleases, or restriction enzymes, are enzymes that recognize specific palindromic DNA sequences and cut within or near these sequences. These enzymes are naturally found in bacteria and serve as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA, such as viral DNA. The cutting action of restriction endonucleases occurs at specific sites within the recognized palindromic sequence, resulting in the fragmentation of the DNA. A. Methylase is incorrect because methylases are enzymes that add methyl groups to specific bases in the DNA, typically at adenine or cytosine residues. They do not cut the DNA but are often involved in protecting the bacterial genome from its own restriction endonucleases by methylating the recognition sites. B. Modified enzyme is incorrect because this is a general term and does not specify an enzyme type that cuts DNA. Modified enzymes may refer to enzymes that have been altered for a specific purpose, but they are not specifically responsible for recognizing palindromic sequences and cutting DNA. D. Exonuclease is incorrect because exonucleases are enzymes that remove nucleotides from the ends of a DNA molecule, rather than cutting within the DNA at specific sequences. Exonucleases typically act on single-stranded DNA or the ends of double-stranded DNA, not at specific recognition sites like restriction endonucleases.",

This is a unique characteristic of the mitochondrial translation system compared to the universal genetic code used in the cytoplasm, where UGA typically functions as a stop codon. A. N-formyl methionine is incorrect because N-formyl methionine (fMet) is the initiating amino acid in mitochondrial protein synthesis, but it is not encoded by UGA. Instead, it is encoded by the codon AUG in the mitochondria. C. Methionine is incorrect because in mitochondria, methionine is encoded by the codon AUG, not UGA.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mitochondrial. MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) and NARP (Neuropathy, Ataxia, and Retinitis Pigmentosa) are both disorders caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. These diseases follow mitochondrial inheritance, which means they are passed down exclusively from mother to offspring. This is because mitochondria, and therefore mitochondrial DNA, are inherited maternally. Mitochondrial diseases affect the cells' energy production and can result in a variety of neurological and muscular symptoms. A. AD (Autosomal Dominant) is incorrect because MELAS and NARP are not inherited via autosomal dominant patterns. In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of the mutated gene is required for the trait to be expressed, and the gene is located on one of the non-sex chromosomes. However, these conditions are due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA, not nuclear DNA. B. AR (Autosomal Recessive) is incorrect because MELAS and NARP do not follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, where both copies of a gene must be mutated for the disease to manifest. Instead, the inheritance is mitochondrial, and it is passed from mother to offspring regardless of the offspring's gender. C. X-linked is incorrect because MELAS and NARP are not inherited through the X chromosome. X-linked inheritance involves mutations on the X chromosome, and while such disorders can affect males and females differently, MELAS and NARP are linked to mutations in the mitochondrial genome, not the X chromosome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Glycosylation. Histones are subject to various post-translational modifications that play crucial roles in regulating gene expression and chromatin structure. Glycosylation is one of the rare but known post-translational modifications of histones, where sugar molecules are added to specific residues, which can influence chromatin interaction and function, although it is less commonly discussed compared to other modifications. A. Acylation is incorrect because histones can undergo acylation, such as acetylation, which is a well-known post-translational modification that typically regulates gene expression by loosening the chromatin structure, making it more accessible for transcription. However, acylation is not the best answer in this case compared to glycosylation. B. Methylation is incorrect because while methylation is a very important post-translational modification of histones, particularly in the regulation of gene silencing and chromatin structure, it is not the modification specifically referred to by this question, which focuses on glycosylation. C. Phosphorylation is incorrect because phosphorylation of histones also plays a significant role in regulating chromatin structure and function, especially in processes like DNA repair and cell division. However, phosphorylation is not the modification specified in this particular question.",

These positive charges enable histones to interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA, facilitating the wrapping of DNA into nucleosomes and contributing to the formation of chromatin. A. Their amino acid sequences are highly variable among organisms is incorrect because histones are highly conserved across species, particularly the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, H4). This conservation is critical for their role in DNA packaging and chromatin structure. Variability is relatively low in comparison to other proteins. C. They do not undergo any covalent modification is incorrect because histones undergo various covalent modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. These modifications play significant roles in regulating gene expression and chromatin structure, influencing processes like transcription, DNA repair, and cell division. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 146. A single nucleosome consists of approximately 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins. This is the fundamental structural unit of chromatin, where DNA is coiled around histone octamers, helping to package the DNA in the nucleus. A. 73 is incorrect because while DNA wrapped around histones is about 146 base pairs long, 73 base pairs would be too short for a full nucleosome core, and it does not match the standard length of DNA associated with a nucleosome. C. 246 is incorrect because 246 base pairs would refer to a longer length of DNA than what is typically wrapped around a single nucleosome. While some linker DNA may be included in the measurement for chromatin structure, the core DNA around the histones is about 146 base pairs. D. 1460 is incorrect because 1460 base pairs would be much longer than the DNA wrapped around a nucleosome. This number could refer to a larger segment of chromatin that includes multiple nucleosomes, but it is not the length of DNA associated with a single nucleosome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prokaryotic DNA topoisomerase II. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme in prokaryotes that functions as a type of topoisomerase II. It is responsible for introducing negative supercoils into DNA, which helps alleviate the torsional strain generated during DNA replication and transcription. By doing so, it allows the DNA to remain unwound and accessible for these processes. DNA gyrase also has the ability to \"untwist\" DNA by breaking and rejoining the DNA strands in a controlled manner. A. Prokaryotic DNA topoisomerase I is incorrect because topoisomerase I primarily works by making transient single-strand cuts to relieve supercoiling, and it does not introduce supercoils like DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase functions more specifically as topoisomerase II, which makes double-strand cuts. C. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I is incorrect because eukaryotic topoisomerase I operates similarly to its prokaryotic counterpart, relieving supercoiling by introducing single-strand cuts. However, DNA gyrase is specific to prokaryotes and has a different function related to supercoiling. D. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is incorrect because although eukaryotic topoisomerase II has a similar role in relieving supercoiling, DNA gyrase is a prokaryotic enzyme. Eukaryotic cells have their own topoisomerase II, but it is distinct from DNA gyrase in terms of origin and specific mechanisms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Telomerase. Telomerase is an enzyme responsible for maintaining and replicating the ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres. Since the DNA replication machinery cannot fully replicate the very ends of chromosomes, telomerase extends the telomeres by adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to them. This process helps prevent the loss of important genetic information during cell division, ensuring chromosome stability. A. DNA reverse transcriptase is incorrect because although reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that synthesizes DNA from an RNA template (as seen in retroviruses), it is not involved in replicating the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase, which has reverse transcriptase activity, is the enzyme specifically responsible for extending telomeres. B. RNA polymerase is incorrect because RNA polymerase is involved in the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, not in replicating chromosome ends. It plays a crucial role in transcription but does not have a role in telomere maintenance or replication. D. DNA polymerase is incorrect because while DNA polymerase is involved in replicating the majority of the DNA during cell division, it cannot fully replicate the ends of chromosomes (the telomeres).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Longevity of cell aging. Telomerase plays a crucial role in counteracting the shortening of telomeres, which occurs with each cell division. By adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of chromosomes, telomerase helps maintain chromosomal integrity and prevents premature cell aging. In many somatic cells, telomerase activity is low or absent, leading to progressive telomere shortening and cellular senescence. However, in stem cells, germ cells, and certain cancer cells, telomerase is active, allowing for prolonged cell division and longevity. A. DNA repair is incorrect because telomerase does not function as a DNA repair enzyme. While it maintains chromosome stability by elongating telomeres, it does not repair damaged DNA strands or correct mutations. C. Breakdown of telomere is incorrect because telomerase does the opposite—it extends and maintains telomeres rather than breaking them down. Telomere shortening occurs naturally in most somatic cells due to the end-replication problem, but telomerase counteracts this process in specific cell types. D. None is incorrect because telomerase has a well-defined role in extending cellular lifespan by maintaining telomere length, which directly impacts aging and cell longevity.",
