      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Runs at 5’-3’ direction. The coding strand of DNA, also known as the sense strand, has the same sequence as the mRNA (except that thymine (T) in DNA is replaced by uracil (U) in RNA). This strand runs in the 5’-3’ direction, and it is the complementary strand to the template (anti-sense) strand. The coding strand provides the genetic code that is transcribed into mRNA for protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B: Runs at 3’-5’ direction – This is incorrect because the coding strand runs in the 5’-3’ direction, not the opposite. The template strand runs in the 3’-5’ direction, providing the complementary sequence used for mRNA synthesis. Option C: Minus strand – This is incorrect because the minus strand refers to the template strand, which runs in the 3’-5’ direction. The coding strand is the plus strand, which is used as a reference for the mRNA sequence. Option D: Anti-sense strand – This is incorrect because the anti-sense strand is another name for the template strand, which runs in the 3’-5’ direction. The anti-sense strand is complementary to the mRNA, which is synthesized from the coding strand. Option E: Template strand – This is incorrect because the template strand refers to the strand that is used as a template during transcription to generate mRNA. The template strand runs in the 3’-5’ direction, while the coding strand is the 5’-3’ direction strand.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Template. The template strand of DNA is the strand that is used during transcription to form the mRNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase reads the template strand in the 3’-5’ direction, synthesizing the mRNA in the 5’-3’ direction. The mRNA sequence is complementary to the template strand and is identical to the coding strand (except for the substitution of uracil (U) for thymine (T)). Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Coding – This is incorrect because the coding strand is the one that has the same sequence as the mRNA, except for thymine (T) being replaced by uracil (U) in RNA. However, the mRNA is not directly formed from the coding strand; it is synthesized from the template strand. Option C: Anti template – This is incorrect because the term anti template is not a standard term in molecular biology. The proper term for the strand that serves as the template for mRNA synthesis is the template strand, not anti template. Option D: Transcript – This is incorrect because transcript refers to the mRNA molecule itself, which is synthesized from the template strand, not the strand from which mRNA is derived.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) New strand of DNA. A new strand of DNA is not a product of transcription. Transcription is the process by which RNA molecules are synthesized from a DNA template strand. The products of transcription are mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA), all of which are involved in protein synthesis or other cellular functions. However, the creation of a new strand of DNA occurs during DNA replication, not transcription. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: mRNA – This is incorrect because mRNA is indeed a product of transcription. It is synthesized from the DNA template and carries the genetic information to the ribosome for translation into a protein. Option B: tRNA – This is incorrect because tRNA is also a product of transcription. tRNA is transcribed from DNA and plays a crucial role in translating the genetic code into a polypeptide chain by bringing the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome. Option C: rRNA – This is incorrect because rRNA is another product of transcription. It is transcribed from DNA and forms the structural and catalytic components of the ribosome, facilitating protein synthesis. Option E: cDNA – This is incorrect because cDNA (complementary DNA) is synthesized through reverse transcription of mRNA, not directly through transcription of DNA. Reverse transcription is carried out by the enzyme reverse transcriptase and is typically used in research to create a complementary DNA copy of an mRNA molecule.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A: 5’ to 3’. Both DNA replication and transcription occur in the 5’ to 3’ direction. During DNA replication, the new DNA strand is synthesized in the 5’ to 3’ direction by DNA polymerase, using the template strand as a guide. Similarly, during transcription, RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA in the 5’ to 3’ direction using the DNA template strand. This directionality is essential because nucleotides are added to the growing strand at the 3’ end, and the strands are synthesized by the enzymes in this orientation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B: 5’ to 5’ – This is incorrect because both DNA replication and transcription do not occur in the 5’ to 5’ direction. The synthesis of DNA and RNA always adds nucleotides to the 3’ end, which makes the 5’ to 5’ direction incompatible with the natural mechanisms of replication and transcription. Option C: 3’ to 5’ – This is incorrect because while the template strand of DNA is read in the 3’ to 5’ direction during both replication and transcription, the synthesis of the new strand (whether DNA or RNA) occurs in the 5’ to 3’ direction, meaning nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the new strand. Option D: 3’ to 3’ – This is incorrect because 3’ to 3’ direction is not applicable for either DNA replication or transcription. The synthesis of DNA or RNA strands always occurs in the 5’ to 3’ direction, so this direction is not consistent with the processes involved.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 5’-CGU-3’. The RNA code is complementary to the DNA coding strand, except that uracil (U) is used in RNA instead of thymine (T). The DNA coding sequence provided is 5’-CGT-3’. During transcription, the corresponding RNA sequence is created by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U). So, the RNA sequence will be 5’-CGU-3’. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: 5’-GCA-3’ – This is incorrect because GCA does not match the complementary RNA sequence. In RNA, the C from the coding strand would pair with G in the RNA, the G would pair with C, and the T would pair with A, which should result in CGU, not GCA. Option B: 5’-UGC-3’ – This is incorrect because the T in the DNA coding strand should be replaced by U in RNA, but the sequence should still be complementary. UGC would correspond to a different DNA sequence, not the given CGT. Option D: 5’-ACG-3’ – This is incorrect because ACG does not match the transcriptional result. The complementary RNA sequence would have C matching G, G matching C, and T matching A, which gives CGU, not ACG.",

Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B: DNA polymerase I – This is incorrect because DNA polymerase I is involved in DNA replication and repair, not in transcription.

Option C: DNA polymerase III – This is incorrect because DNA polymerase III is also involved in DNA replication, specifically in adding nucleotides to the growing DNA strand during replication, not in the transcription process.

Option B: RNA dependent DNA polymerase – This is incorrect because RNA-dependent DNA polymerase refers to reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that synthesizes DNA from an RNA template.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Primer. RNA polymerase does not require a primer to initiate transcription. Unlike DNA polymerase, which needs a primer to begin DNA synthesis, RNA polymerase can initiate the synthesis of an RNA strand de novo (from scratch) using a DNA template. The enzyme simply requires the template DNA, activated nucleotide precursors (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP), and metal ions to start transcription. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Activated precursors like ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP – This is incorrect because RNA polymerase requires activated nucleotide precursors (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP) to synthesize RNA. These nucleotides are used to build the RNA strand during transcription, as RNA polymerase adds the appropriate nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction. Option B: Divalent metal ions like Mn²+, Mg²+ – This is incorrect because RNA polymerase requires divalent metal ions, such as Mg²+ or Mn²+, for catalytic activity. These ions help stabilize the RNA polymerase-DNA complex and are essential for the enzyme's ability to form phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides. Option C: Template ds DNA – This is incorrect because RNA polymerase does require a template DNA strand for transcription. It reads the single-stranded template DNA in the 3’ to 5’ direction to synthesize the RNA strand in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The template DNA provides the sequence information for the RNA molecule.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Promoter region. The TATA box is a short, conserved sequence found in the promoter region of many eukaryotic genes. It plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription by providing a binding site for transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. The TATA box is typically located about 25-30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site and is essential for the formation of the transcription initiation complex. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Enhancer region – This is incorrect because enhancer regions are DNA sequences that enhance the transcription of specific genes but are not directly associated with the TATA box. Enhancers are located far from the promoter region and can increase transcription by interacting with transcription factors, but they do not contain the TATA box. Option C: Silencer region – This is incorrect because silencer regions are DNA sequences that repress gene transcription. They function by binding repressive transcription factors, but they do not contain the TATA box, which is associated with transcription initiation. Option D: Palindromic region – This is incorrect because the TATA box is not a palindromic sequence. A palindromic sequence is one that reads the same backward and forward, but the TATA box is a non-palindromic sequence with a conserved pattern of bases (TATAAA). The TATA box specifically functions in transcription initiation rather than being a palindromic sequence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A. Poly A tail occurs at 3’ end • Poly A tail occurs at 3’ end • This statement is correct. The poly A tail is added to the 3’ end of eukaryotic mRNA after transcription. The addition of the poly A tail is an essential post-transcriptional modification that: • Increases mRNA stability by protecting it from exonucleases. • Facilitates mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. • Assists in translation by aiding ribosome recognition. The poly A tail is a universal modification for almost all eukaryotic mRNAs, making it a fundamental and consistent feature in the maturation of mRNA. D. Intron excision by spliceosome This statement is also correct. Splicing is a process that removes non-coding regions called introns from pre-mRNA and joins the coding regions, called exons, together. This process is carried out by the spliceosome, a complex of proteins and small RNA molecules. Splicing is essential for most eukaryotic genes, especially those with multiple introns, and is a vital step in converting pre-mRNA into mature mRNA. While both A and D describe essential post-transcriptional modifications, option A is more universally applicable. The addition of a poly A tail occurs in virtually all eukaryotic mRNAs, making it a consistent and widespread modification. In contrast, splicing (option D) is not always required for all RNA molecules, as some genes may not have introns, and in simpler organisms or some types of RNA, splicing might not occur at all. Incorrect Options: B. Primarily occurs in cytoplasm • This statement is incorrect. Post-transcriptional modifications like capping, splicing, and polyadenylation occur primarily in the nucleus, not the cytoplasm. • Capping occurs at the 5’ end of the pre-mRNA in the nucleus. • Splicing (removal of introns) occurs in the nucleus, facilitated by the spliceosome. • Polyadenylation occurs at the 3’ end of the pre-mRNA in the nucleus. Once these modifications are complete, the mature mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Therefore, the statement that post-transcriptional modification primarily occurs in the cytoplasm is incorrect. C. All RNA undergoes post-transcriptional modification • This statement is incorrect because not all RNA types undergo post-transcriptional modification. For example: • rRNA and tRNA are also transcribed, but they undergo different types of processing, and not all forms of RNA undergo the same modifications as mRNA. • In prokaryotes, RNA typically undergoes very little post-transcriptional modification compared to eukaryotes. • Some small RNAs in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes are not subjected to the extensive modifications seen in mRNA. Therefore, stating that all RNA undergoes post-transcriptional modification is not accurate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ribosylation. Ribosylation is not typically considered a post-transcriptional modification of RNA. It is a modification that usually occurs to proteins, where a ribose sugar is added to the protein, often as part of signaling processes. In the context of RNA, post-transcriptional modifications include processes like capping, splicing, and polyadenylation, but ribosylation is not one of them. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: 5’ capping – This is correct because 5' capping is a key post-transcriptional modification of RNA. It involves the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA. This cap protects the RNA from degradation, helps in its export from the nucleus, and assists in the initiation of translation. Option C: Splicing – This is correct because splicing is an essential post-transcriptional modification where introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA and exons (coding regions) are joined together. This results in the formation of mature mRNA that can be translated into protein. Option D: 3’ polyadenylation – This is correct because 3' polyadenylation is a post-transcriptional modification where a poly A tail is added to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA. This modification stabilizes the mRNA, aids in its export to the cytoplasm, and is involved in translation initiation.",

Introns are spliced out during post-transcriptional modification before the mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm for translation. The exons, which are the coding regions, remain in the mature mRNA. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Exon – This is incorrect because an exon is a part of the gene that remains in the mature mRNA after splicing. Exons are the coding sequences that are translated into protein. Unlike introns, exons are expressed in the final mRNA. Option B: TATA box – This is incorrect because the TATA box is a promoter sequence found in the upstream region of the gene, not part of the gene itself. It serves as a binding site for transcription factors and RNA polymerase during transcription initiation, but it is not part of the mature mRNA. Option D: Plasmid – This is incorrect because a plasmid is a small, circular DNA molecule found in some bacteria, not a part of eukaryotic genes.

In mRNA, a poly A tail is added to the 3' end to enhance stability, facilitate nuclear export, and aid translation. However, tRNA undergoes different modifications, such as methylation and CCA tailing, but poly A tailing is not one of them. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Methylation of bases – This is correct because methylation of certain bases in tRNA is a common modification. These methylated bases help stabilize the tRNA structure and ensure proper functioning during translation. Option C: CCA tailing – This is correct because CCA tailing involves the addition of the sequence CCA (cytosine-cytosine-adenine) to the 3' end of tRNA. This modification is essential for the attachment of the amino acid to the tRNA during protein synthesis. Option D: Trimming of 5’ end – This is correct because trimming of the 5' end of the precursor tRNA is part of the post-transcriptional processing.

Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: rRNA – This is incorrect because ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural and catalytic component of ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis, not in splicing. It does not participate in the removal of introns from pre-mRNA. Option B: mRNA – This is incorrect because messenger RNA (mRNA) is the product of transcription and the molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for translation. While mRNA is involved in the process, it does not perform splicing itself; rather, splicing occurs to generate mature mRNA from pre-mRNA.

This leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin and the development of thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Marfan syndrome – This is incorrect because Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, a structural protein involved in the formation of elastic fibers. It is not related to defects in snRNPs or RNA splicing. Option C: EDS (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) – This is incorrect because Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of connective tissue disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding collagen or collagen-processing enzymes. While it affects connective tissues, it is not linked to defects in snRNPs involved in RNA splicing.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Peptidyl transferase activity. Ribozymes are RNA molecules that have catalytic activity, meaning they can catalyze biochemical reactions without the need for protein enzymes. One of the key examples of a ribozyme is the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome. This activity is responsible for forming peptide bonds between amino acids during protein synthesis, which is a critical function of the ribosome, involving RNA as the catalytic component (specifically, rRNA). Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: GTPase activity – This is incorrect because GTPase activity refers to the ability of an enzyme or protein to hydrolyze GTP to GDP. While GTPases are important in cellular processes, they are not ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA molecules, not proteins, and their activity is generally catalytic RNA activity, not GTP hydrolysis. Option C: Participate in DNA synthesis – This is incorrect because DNA synthesis is typically carried out by DNA polymerase, not ribozymes. Ribozymes are involved in catalyzing RNA-based reactions, not DNA synthesis. They do not directly participate in DNA replication or synthesis. Option D: Cut DNA at specific site – This is incorrect because the ability to cut DNA at specific sites is typically associated with restriction enzymes or other DNA-cleaving proteins, not ribozymes. Ribozymes can catalyze reactions involving RNA, including RNA splicing and cleavage, but they do not generally act on DNA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Deamination of cytidine to uridine. The difference between Apo B48 and Apo B100 arises from a RNA editing process where the mRNA undergoes cytidine deamination to uridine. This editing event occurs in the intestine and results in the production of Apo B48, which is a truncated form of Apo B100. The deamination process converts a cytidine (C) into a uridine (U), causing a stop codon to be introduced in Apo B48, thus producing a shorter protein compared to Apo B100. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Allelic exclusion – This is incorrect because allelic exclusion refers to a process in immunology where only one allele of a gene is expressed in a given cell, ensuring that only one version of the gene product is produced. This concept is unrelated to the synthesis of Apo B48 and Apo B100. Option B: Upstream repression – This is incorrect because upstream repression generally refers to the regulation of gene expression where regulatory elements upstream of a gene can inhibit its transcription. While this might affect gene expression, it does not account for the specific difference between Apo B48 and Apo B100, which is caused by RNA editing, not transcriptional regulation. Option C: RNA splicing – This is incorrect because RNA splicing involves the removal of introns and joining of exons in pre-mRNA to form mature mRNA. While splicing is an important post-transcriptional modification, the difference between Apo B48 and Apo B100 is specifically due to RNA editing (deamination), not splicing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Differential RNA processing. Immunoglobulin (Ig) diversity arises through a process of differential RNA processing, which allows the same gene to produce different types of antibodies (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA, etc.) from a single mRNA transcript. This is achieved through mechanisms like alternative splicing and differential polyadenylation, which can result in different immunoglobulin isotypes being synthesized based on which exons are included or excluded in the final mRNA product. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Gene switching – This is incorrect because gene switching (or class switch recombination) refers to a process by which a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (e.g., from IgM to IgG), but it is not the main mechanism for generating the diversity of immunoglobulins in the first place. This occurs after initial immunoglobulin synthesis and is not related to the differential processing of RNA. Option B: Allele exclusion – This is incorrect because allele exclusion refers to the phenomenon where only one allele of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes is expressed in a single B cell. It ensures that each B cell produces a unique antibody. However, allele exclusion does not directly relate to the synthesis of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Option D: Codominance – This is incorrect because codominance refers to the situation where both alleles of a gene contribute equally to the phenotype, such as in blood group inheritance. It is not involved in the synthesis of immunoglobulins or in the process by which different antibody isotypes are generated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) rRNA. The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the most abundant type of RNA in cells. It makes up the core structure of the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis. The majority of RNA in a cell is rRNA, as it forms the ribosome subunits and plays a crucial role in translating mRNA into proteins. In fact, rRNA constitutes about 80% of the total RNA in a cell. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: mRNA – While messenger RNA (mRNA) is crucial for conveying genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis, it is not the most abundant form of RNA in the cell. mRNA is transcribed from DNA, but it represents a smaller portion of the total RNA compared to rRNA. Option C: tRNA – Transfer RNA (tRNA) is responsible for bringing amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. It is also an essential type of RNA, but it is present in smaller quantities than rRNA. tRNA plays a key role in translation, but its abundance in the cell is less than that of rRNA. Option D: hnRNA – Heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) refers to the initial precursor mRNA found in the nucleus before splicing and processing. hnRNA is less abundant than rRNA, as it is a transient intermediate form of mRNA in the nucleus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nucleolus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is primarily produced in the nucleolus, which is a substructure within the nucleus. The nucleolus is the site of rRNA gene transcription and processing. It is also where the initial assembly of the ribosome subunits occurs. The rRNA produced in the nucleolus combines with proteins to form the small and large subunits of the ribosome, which are then exported to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Ribosomes – While ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis, they are not the location where rRNA is produced. Ribosomes are made up of rRNA and proteins but are assembled in the nucleolus before being transported to the cytoplasm. Therefore, ribosomes are not responsible for producing rRNA. Option B: Endoplasmic reticulum – The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism but is not the site of rRNA production. The rough ER, in particular, has ribosomes attached to it but does not produce rRNA. The rRNA is produced in the nucleolus and then used in ribosome assembly. Option C: Nucleus – Although the nucleus is where DNA is located and mRNA is transcribed, the specific location within the nucleus where rRNA is synthesized is the nucleolus. The nucleus houses the nucleolus, but it is the nucleolus itself that directly produces rRNA.",

Transfer RNA (tRNA) contains the highest percentage of modified bases among all types of RNA. tRNA molecules undergo significant post-transcriptional modifications, including the addition of modified nucleotides, such as pseudouridine, dihydrouridine, and ribothymidine, to ensure proper folding and function. These modifications play a key role in stabilizing the tRNA structure and its interaction with the ribosome during protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: rRNA – While ribosomal RNA (rRNA) also undergoes some modifications, including methylation and pseudouridylation, the percentage of modified bases is lower than that of tRNA. rRNA modifications are essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, but tRNA still has a higher modification rate. Option B: mRNA – Messenger RNA (mRNA) does not undergo extensive base modifications like tRNA. mRNA mainly undergoes modifications such as 5' capping, polyadenylation, and splicing, but it lacks the complex base modifications found in tRNA. mRNA modifications are more focused on stability and translation efficiency rather than base modifications. Option D: snRNA – Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is involved in RNA splicing, and while it does have some modifications, its base modification percentage is lower compared to tRNA. The modifications in snRNA are important for its role in splicing but not as abundant or diverse as those found in tRNA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inhibition of gene expression. MicroRNA (miRNA) plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in the mRNA, typically in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). This binding can result in mRNA degradation or inhibition of translation, effectively silencing the expression of specific genes. miRNAs are involved in post-transcriptional regulation, helping control the abundance of proteins and influence various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and disease progression. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Splicing – Splicing refers to the process of removing introns from pre-mRNA and joining exons together to form mature mRNA. This is primarily carried out by the spliceosome, a complex of snRNAs and proteins, not by miRNA. While miRNAs affect gene expression, they do not directly participate in splicing. Option C: Post-transcriptional modification – Post-transcriptional modifications include processes such as 5' capping, polyadenylation, and splicing, which modify the pre-mRNA to produce mature mRNA. miRNA, while it influences gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, does not directly modify the RNA itself in the same way that capping or polyadenylation does. miRNA's role is more about regulating the translation of mRNA rather than modifying the RNA structure. Option D: All of the above – While miRNAs do play a role in gene regulation and post-transcriptional control, they are not directly involved in splicing or other post-transcriptional modifications.

This arm helps in stabilizing the tRNA structure and assists in the proper interaction between tRNA and the ribosome during the initiation phase of protein synthesis. The pseudouridine modification in the tRNA helps maintain its correct conformation, ensuring efficient and accurate decoding of the mRNA during translation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Serves as the recognition site of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase – The recognition site for aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is primarily located in the anticodon loop of the tRNA, where the enzyme specifically binds to the tRNA based on its anticodon sequence and amino acid. While modifications like pseudouridine may affect the tRNA's overall structure, the main recognition for aminoacylation happens via the anticodon. Option B: Helps in initiation of transcription – Transcription initiation involves processes like RNA polymerase binding to the promoter region of DNA, and it is not directly related to tRNA. The pseudouridine arm of tRNA is not involved in the initiation of transcription, as transcription occurs before translation, involving mRNA production from DNA. Option D: Recognizes the triplet nucleotides codon present in mRNA – The anticodon loop of tRNA is responsible for recognizing and pairing with the mRNA codons during translation. The pseudouridine arm does not directly participate in codon recognition; it is involved more in stabilizing the tRNA for proper function during translation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Spinal muscular dystrophy. hnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear RNA) is a precursor to mature mRNA, which is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Spinal muscular dystrophy (SMD) is a genetic disorder that involves defects in the splicing or processing of hnRNA, leading to faulty mRNA and, consequently, defective protein production. This alteration in the processing of hnRNA is one of the key features in SMD, which is a neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Sickle cell disease – Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene (HBB gene) that leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS). This genetic defect does not directly involve issues with hnRNA processing. Instead, sickle cell disease is a result of a point mutation in the gene's DNA, leading to an abnormal hemoglobin protein. Option B: Alpha-thalassemia – Alpha-thalassemia is a blood disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-globin gene, resulting in reduced or absent production of the alpha-globin subunit of hemoglobin. While the mutation affects the mRNA produced from the alpha-globin gene, it is not primarily associated with issues in hnRNA processing but rather in the translation or synthesis of the alpha-globin protein. Option D: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome – Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the LMNA gene, leading to abnormal nuclear lamin proteins and premature aging. While mutations in hnRNA processing can occur in some diseases, HGPS is more closely associated with defects in nuclear envelope proteins and not directly with hnRNA processing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Polylysine. The poly(A) tail is a stretch of adenine nucleotides (A) added to the 3’ end of eukaryotic mRNA molecules during post-transcriptional modification. The poly(A) tail does not directly translate into a specific amino acid sequence in the protein; instead, it plays a role in the stability, export, and translation of the mRNA. The concept of \"translating\" a poly(A) tail into polylysine, polyproline, or other amino acid sequences is a misinterpretation. The poly(A) tail itself is not translated into amino acids, but it's involved in regulating the translation process. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Polyalanine – The poly(A) tail is composed of adenine nucleotides, not alanine. Thus, it does not translate into a sequence of alanine residues. Polyalanine refers to a chain of alanine amino acids, which is unrelated to the poly(A) tail. Option C: Polyproline – Similar to polyalanine, polyproline refers to a sequence of proline amino acids. The poly(A) tail is made up of adenine bases and does not translate into proline residues. Option D: Polyglycine – Polyglycine refers to a sequence of glycine amino acids, which is not related to the poly(A) tail. The poly(A) tail is a sequence of adenine nucleotides, not glycine amino acids.",
