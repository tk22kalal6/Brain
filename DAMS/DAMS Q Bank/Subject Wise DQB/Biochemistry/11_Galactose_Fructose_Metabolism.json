      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Death in infancy The infant described in the case most likely has galactosemia, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). This enzyme deficiency impairs the metabolism of galactose, a sugar found in milk. When galactose cannot be properly metabolized, it accumulates as galactose-1-phosphate and other toxic metabolites, leading to a range of serious complications. If untreated, galactosemia can result in severe hepatic damage, cataract formation, growth failure, and neurological impairment. The most severe outcomes can include death in infancy due to liver failure or sepsis, particularly if the baby continues to ingest galactose-containing formula. Early diagnosis and strict removal of galactose from the diet (e.g., lactose-free formula) are essential to prevent these life-threatening complications. Incorrect Answers: A. Benign disease except for cataract formation While cataract formation is indeed one of the complications of galactosemia, the disease is not benign and can lead to serious complications such as liver failure, sepsis, neurological damage, and even death if left untreated. Therefore, this option is incorrect because the disease is not benign and can cause life-threatening consequences. B. Chronic emphysema appearing in early adulthood Chronic emphysema is not associated with galactosemia. Emphysema is more commonly seen in diseases that affect the lungs, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is usually related to smoking or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. It is not a characteristic feature of galactosemia, making this option incorrect. C. Chronic renal failure appearing in adolescence Chronic renal failure in adolescence is not typically seen in galactosemia. The most common kidney-related complications in galactosemia involve renal tubular dysfunction, but chronic renal failure is not a primary manifestation. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase Galactosemia is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). This enzyme is crucial in the metabolism of galactose, a sugar derived from lactose. Without GALT, galactose-1-phosphate accumulates in tissues, leading to toxic effects, particularly in the liver, eyes, and brain. The accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate causes the characteristic symptoms of galactosemia, such as jaundice, cataracts, liver damage, and developmental delay if untreated. Incorrect Answers: A. Aldolase B Aldolase B deficiency is associated with hereditary fructose intolerance, not galactosemia. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, causing symptoms such as hypoglycemia, vomiting, and liver dysfunction when fructose is ingested. B. UDP galactose-4-epimerase UDP galactose-4-epimerase deficiency causes a different type of galactosemia, often referred to as epimerase deficiency galactosemia, but it is not the most common cause of galactosemia. The deficiency in this enzyme leads to a milder form of the disorder, with symptoms generally less severe than those caused by GALT deficiency. C. Fructokinase Fructokinase deficiency is associated with essential fructosuria, a condition in which fructose is excreted in the urine but does not cause the severe metabolic disturbances seen in hereditary fructose intolerance. This enzyme defect does not lead to galactosemia and does not affect the metabolism of galactose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase The newborn's symptoms are highly suggestive of galactosemia, a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). This enzyme deficiency prevents the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate to UDP-galactose, leading to the accumulation of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate in the liver, eyes, and brain. Key symptoms of this condition in the newborn include jaundice, hepatomegaly, cataracts, and diarrhea. The positive urine test for reducing sugars and low blood glucose levels are indicative of disrupted galactose metabolism. Since the baby refuses to breast milk (which contains lactose, a galactose-containing sugar), these symptoms are highly consistent with GALT deficiency. Incorrect Answers: A. Beta galactosidase Beta-galactosidase deficiency is associated with Lactose intolerance, not galactosemia. Lactose intolerance is caused by a defect in the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose. Symptoms are typically less severe and include bloating, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea when lactose is ingested, but it doesn't lead to jaundice, hepatomegaly, or cataracts. It is not the cause of this clinical presentation. B. Galactokinase Galactokinase deficiency leads to galactosemia as well, but it is typically less severe than GALT deficiency. In this condition, the buildup of galactose results in cataracts and possibly mild hepatomegaly, but the classic severe presentation with jaundice and hepatomegaly seen in this case is more characteristic of GALT deficiency rather than galactokinase deficiency. D. Glucose-6-phosphate A deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase causes von Gierke's disease, a type of glycogen storage disorder, which presents with symptoms such as hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and growth failure. However, this condition does not present with jaundice, cataracts, or a positive urine test for reducing sugars, making it unlikely to be the cause of this baby's symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Galactosemia The positive Benedict's test indicates the presence of reducing sugars in the urine. This is a key feature of galactosemia, a disorder of galactose metabolism. In galactosemia, due to a deficiency of enzymes such as galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, galactose and its metabolites accumulate in the body and are excreted in the urine as reducing sugars. A normal blood glucose level measured by the glucose oxidase method is consistent with galactosemia because the disorder affects galactose metabolism rather than glucose metabolism. Therefore, the presence of reducing sugars in the urine without abnormal blood glucose levels points to galactosemia as the most likely cause. Incorrect Answers: B. Latent diabetes mellitus Latent diabetes mellitus typically does not result in the presence of reducing sugars in the urine, especially when blood glucose levels are normal. In latent diabetes, there is usually no significant glycosuria unless the blood glucose levels exceed renal threshold levels (usually around 180 mg/dL). Therefore, the normal blood glucose levels and the presence of reducing sugars in the urine are not typical of latent diabetes. C. Glucose intolerance Glucose intolerance refers to an impaired ability to regulate blood glucose levels, usually diagnosed through an oral glucose tolerance test. In cases of glucose intolerance, blood glucose levels are typically elevated, especially after glucose ingestion. There would not be a normal blood glucose level in this scenario, and the presence of reducing sugars in the urine would be unusual for glucose intolerance. D. Von-Gierke’s disease Von-Gierke's disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type I, is characterized by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase. This leads to hypoglycemia and the accumulation of glycogen in the liver and kidneys. The condition does not result in reducing sugars being excreted in the urine. Therefore, the presence of reducing sugars in the urine and normal blood glucose levels is not consistent with Von-Gierke’s disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lactase Lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance, does not typically present with the features of bilateral lenticular opacities (cataracts) and hepatomegaly in newborns. Lactase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose in the small intestine. In lactase deficiency, lactose cannot be properly digested and absorbed, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain after milk consumption. However, lactase deficiency does not cause cataracts or hepatomegaly, which are symptoms seen in metabolic disorders related to galactose metabolism. Incorrect Answers: A. Galactokinase A deficiency in galactokinase leads to galactosemia and is associated with bilateral lenticular opacities (cataracts) and hepatomegaly. In this condition, galactose accumulates in the body, leading to these symptoms, particularly cataracts in infancy. Galactosemia due to galactokinase deficiency is a well-known cause of early-onset cataracts in newborns. B. UDP galactose-4-epimerase Deficiency of UDP galactose-4-epimerase is another form of galactosemia, which is also associated with bilateral cataracts and hepatomegaly. In this condition, the metabolism of galactose is impaired, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites that cause liver damage and the formation of cataracts. C. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase This enzyme deficiency is the most common cause of classic galactosemia, which results in cataracts, hepatomegaly, and neonatal jaundice. Without this enzyme, galactose-1-phosphate accumulates in tissues, leading to liver damage, cataracts, and other systemic symptoms in affected newborns.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Galactosemia Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder caused by the deficiency of enzymes involved in the metabolism of galactose, such as galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, galactokinase, or UDP galactose-4-epimerase. One of the complications of galactosemia, particularly classic galactosemia (due to galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency), is immune system dysfunction, which increases susceptibility to infections like E. coli sepsis. Newborns with untreated galactosemia have a build-up of galactose and its metabolites, which leads to liver damage, kidney failure, cataracts, and a weakened immune system, making them more prone to infections, including E. coli sepsis. Incorrect Answers: A. Glycogen storage disorder Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies that affect the storage and release of glycogen. Although GSDs can lead to a variety of complications, including hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and muscle weakness, they are not typically associated with an increased risk of E. coli sepsis. The immune system in these disorders is not generally compromised in the same way as in galactosemia, and thus the risk for infections like E. coli sepsis is not as high. B. Lysosomal storage disorder Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Gaucher's disease and Tay-Sachs disease, are caused by enzyme deficiencies that result in the accumulation of substrates in the lysosomes. While these disorders can have serious effects on various organs and systems, including the nervous system and spleen, they do not specifically increase the risk of E. coli sepsis. Infections in LSDs are more likely due to organ dysfunction (like splenomegaly in Gaucher's), but they are not as strongly associated with an increased risk of E. coli sepsis as in galactosemia. D. Urea cycle disorder Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) result from deficiencies in enzymes that are involved in converting ammonia to urea for excretion. These disorders often lead to a build-up of toxic ammonia in the body, which can cause neurological damage, lethargy, and other symptoms. While UCDs are associated with metabolic crises, they do not specifically predispose individuals to E. coli sepsis. The major concerns with UCDs are hyperammonemia and its effects on the brain, not bacterial infections like E. coli sepsis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dulcitol Oil drop cataract is a specific type of cataract that is often seen in certain metabolic disorders, most notably in galactosemia. The accumulation of dulcitol (a sugar alcohol) in the lens of the eye is primarily responsible for the development of this cataract. Dulcitol is formed from galactose when galactose is not properly metabolized due to a deficiency in the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase or other enzymes involved in the galactose metabolism pathway. When galactose accumulates, it is converted to dulcitol, which is osmotically active and leads to the swelling of lens fibers, eventually causing the characteristic oil drop cataracts. Incorrect Answers: A. Galactose While galactose is the precursor for the accumulation of dulcitol, galactose itself does not directly cause oil drop cataracts. The damage occurs when galactose is not properly processed and is instead converted into toxic metabolites like dulcitol, which is responsible for cataract formation. Galactose accumulation leads to more severe complications in galactosemia, but it is dulcitol that is directly responsible for cataract development. B. Aldonic acid Aldonic acid is another metabolite that can accumulate in the body during carbohydrate metabolism, but it is not involved in the formation of oil drop cataracts. Aldonic acid is a product of the oxidation of sugars, and its accumulation might contribute to other metabolic problems, but it does not directly cause cataract formation, particularly the oil drop type seen in galactosemia. C. Sorbitol Sorbitol, another sugar alcohol, accumulates in certain conditions like diabetes due to the activity of aldose reductase, which converts glucose to sorbitol. While sorbitol is known to contribute to osmotic damage in tissues (such as the lens in diabetes), it is not the cause of oil drop cataracts, which are specifically linked to dulcitol accumulation in galactosemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aldose reductase Sorbitol is formed from glucose through the action of the enzyme aldose reductase. This enzyme reduces glucose to sorbitol using NADPH as a cofactor. Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol, and this reaction is part of the polyol pathway. When glucose is elevated (such as in conditions like diabetes), aldose reductase can convert excess glucose into sorbitol, which can accumulate in tissues like the retina, kidneys, and nerves, potentially leading to complications like cataracts and neuropathy. Incorrect Answers: B. Aldolase B Aldolase B is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose, not glucose. It plays a role in the fructose metabolism pathway and is notably associated with hereditary fructose intolerance. This enzyme does not catalyze the conversion of glucose into sorbitol. C. UDP-galactose-4-epimerase UDP-galactose-4-epimerase is an enzyme involved in the conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose in the galactose metabolism pathway. It has no role in the conversion of glucose to sorbitol, so it is not relevant in this context. D. Sorbitol dehydrogenase Sorbitol dehydrogenase is involved in the conversion of sorbitol to fructose, not the conversion of glucose to sorbitol. It acts on sorbitol, oxidizing it to fructose using NAD+ as a cofactor, which is the reverse of the aldose reductase reaction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyperglycemia Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B, which is responsible for breaking down fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, kidneys, and intestines. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in tissues, causing toxic effects and metabolic disturbances. HFI typically presents with symptoms like hypoglycemia, rather than hyperglycemia. Incorrect Answers: B. Accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in tissues This statement is true. In hereditary fructose intolerance, the lack of aldolase B causes the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in tissues, primarily in the liver, kidneys, and intestines. This accumulation disrupts cellular metabolism, depletes ATP, and leads to symptoms such as vomiting, hypoglycemia, and liver damage. C. Deficiency of fructose-1-phosphate aldolase This statement is also true. The hallmark of hereditary fructose intolerance is the deficiency of aldolase B, the enzyme responsible for splitting fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate during fructose metabolism. Without this enzyme, fructose-1-phosphate accumulates in the liver, leading to severe metabolic disturbances. D. Liver and kidney are involved This is correct. The liver and kidneys are the primary organs affected in hereditary fructose intolerance due to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in these tissues. The liver is responsible for metabolizing fructose, and the kidneys also play a role in handling the increased levels of fructose. These organs experience the most damage from the toxic effects of the accumulated metabolite, leading to complications such as liver failure, kidney dysfunction, and hypoglycemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aldolase B The baby boy's symptoms of vomiting, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and irritability upon starting weaning with fruit juice strongly suggest hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). This disorder is caused by a deficiency of aldolase B, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate. In HFI, the inability to metabolize fructose properly leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, which results in toxic effects such as liver damage, hypoglycemia, and the symptoms described. Incorrect Answers: A. Fructokinase A fructokinase deficiency can lead to essential fructosuria, a benign condition where fructose is not properly phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate. This leads to the presence of fructose in the urine but does not cause severe clinical symptoms such as vomiting, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. Fructokinase deficiency does not produce the toxic effects seen in hereditary fructose intolerance. B. Glucose-6-phosphatase A deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase causes von Gierke's disease, a form of glycogen storage disorder. This disease results in hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and growth failure, but it is not specifically triggered by fructose ingestion. The symptoms described in the baby’s case are more characteristic of a fructose intolerance disorder, not a glycogen storage disorder. C. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase A deficiency in galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase leads to galactosemia, which results in symptoms such as vomiting, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cataracts in newborns. However, the specific trigger for these symptoms in galactosemia is usually the consumption of galactose (found in breast milk and dairy products), not fructose. The symptoms in this case appear after the baby started weaning with fruit juice, suggesting a problem related to fructose metabolism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hypertriglyceridemia Excessive intake of fructose leads to hypertriglyceridemia. This occurs because fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it is converted into glucose and fatty acids. Fructose metabolism bypasses the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, leading to the excessive formation of fatty acids and triglycerides. As a result, excessive fructose consumption has been linked to the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver and increased plasma triglyceride levels, contributing to hypertriglyceridemia and a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Incorrect Answers: A. Hypouricemia Excessive fructose intake does not lead to hypouricemia. In fact, it can lead to hyperuricemia, which is an increase in uric acid levels in the blood. The metabolism of fructose increases the production of uric acid by promoting the breakdown of purine nucleotides. Elevated uric acid levels can lead to gout and other related conditions, but hypouricemia (low uric acid) is not a consequence of excessive fructose intake. B. Hypoglycemia Excessive fructose intake is unlikely to cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). In fact, the liver converts fructose into glucose and other metabolites, which are released into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. While fructose does not directly trigger insulin secretion like glucose, it still contributes to overall glucose metabolism, and its intake would not typically result in hypoglycemia. D. Hyperphosphatemia Excessive intake of fructose does not cause hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels in the blood). Hyperphosphatemia is usually caused by conditions such as renal failure or increased phosphate intake. While fructose is metabolized in the liver, it does not directly influence phosphate levels in the bloodstream in the way that certain kidney disorders or excessive phosphate intake might.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hexokinase can phosphorylate fructose Familial fructokinase deficiency is a condition in which the enzyme fructokinase is deficient or absent. Fructokinase is the enzyme responsible for the initial phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate in the liver. However, despite this deficiency, the condition does not cause significant symptoms because hexokinase, an enzyme present in many tissues including muscle and adipose tissue, can also phosphorylate fructose. Hexokinase converts fructose into fructose-6-phosphate, bypassing the need for fructokinase and allowing fructose to enter glycolysis, where it can be metabolized further. This allows the body to handle fructose even in the absence of fructokinase, hence no major symptoms develop. Incorrect Answers: A. Liver aldolase can metabolize it While aldolase is involved in the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate, it is not directly responsible for metabolizing fructose itself. Aldolase B acts on fructose-1-phosphate, which is formed after fructokinase phosphorylates fructose. In familial fructokinase deficiency, the main issue is the lack of fructokinase to create fructose-1-phosphate, not the inability of aldolase to metabolize fructose-1-phosphate. B. Excess fructose converts into glucose Fructose does not directly convert into glucose under normal circumstances. Fructose is primarily converted into intermediates like fructose-6-phosphate and then enters the glycolytic pathway or gluconeogenesis. While some glucose can be produced from fructose intermediates (via gluconeogenesis), this is not the primary mechanism that compensates for fructokinase deficiency. The metabolism of fructose primarily bypasses the step involving glucose production. C. Excess fructose excretes through feces Excess fructose does not get excreted through feces under normal circumstances. In conditions like fructose malabsorption, unabsorbed fructose might reach the colon, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating and diarrhea. However, this is not related to familial fructokinase deficiency, and fructose is absorbed and processed by the body.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Diabetic cataract Aldose reductase is an enzyme responsible for converting glucose to sorbitol in tissues that are involved in the polyol pathway, such as the lens of the eye, nerves, and kidneys. In diabetes mellitus, where hyperglycemia is prevalent, the excessive conversion of glucose to sorbitol by aldose reductase can lead to complications. Sorbitol, being osmotically active, accumulates in cells, causing them to swell and leading to osmotic stress. In the lens of the eye, this can result in the formation of cataracts. Inhibiting aldose reductase can prevent the accumulation of sorbitol and thereby prevent the development of diabetic cataracts, making this the most appropriate answer. Incorrect Answers: B. Diabetic neuropathy While aldose reductase is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (due to sorbitol accumulation in nerve tissues), inhibiting aldose reductase does not completely prevent diabetic neuropathy. It may reduce some aspects of nerve damage by preventing sorbitol accumulation, but neuropathy has multiple other contributing factors, including microvascular damage and inflammation, that are not solely related to the polyol pathway. C. Diabetic nephropathy Similar to neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy also involves the polyol pathway, but it is primarily due to glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration, along with increased extracellular matrix production and renal fibrosis. While aldose reductase inhibitors may have a minor impact on preventing some renal complications by reducing sorbitol accumulation, they do not fully prevent diabetic nephropathy. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving advanced glycation end products (AGEs), inflammation, and hyperglycemia-induced kidney damage. D. Deafness Deafness in diabetes mellitus can occur due to microvascular changes or nerve damage, particularly in the auditory pathway, but it is not specifically related to aldose reductase activity. Aldose reductase inhibitors would not prevent diabetic-induced hearing loss, as this is not typically a direct result of the polyol pathway in the same way as cataract formation.",
