      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Isoleucine The case describes an infant with a musky, sweet odor to the urine, which is a classic sign of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism. MSUD results from a deficiency in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, which is responsible for the breakdown of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. When this enzyme complex is deficient, the corresponding amino acids and their metabolites, including isoleucine, accumulate in the body, leading to toxic effects. The sweet or maple syrup odor in the urine is characteristic of the elevated levels of these branched-chain amino acids and their byproducts, making isoleucine the correct choice here. Incorrect Answers: A. Phenylalanine Phenylalanine is an amino acid involved in phenylketonuria (PKU), another inborn error of metabolism, but it is not related to the musky odor seen in this case. PKU results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and its conversion into phenylketones. However, PKU presents with a distinct set of symptoms and urine odor, not the maple syrup-like odor seen in MSUD. B. Phenylketones Phenylketones are associated with phenylketonuria (PKU) and are produced when phenylalanine accumulates in the body due to a defect in phenylalanine metabolism. Although phenylketones lead to a distinct musty odor in urine, this is not the cause of the musky, sweet odor described in this case, which is characteristic of MSUD and involves the branched-chain amino acids, such as isoleucine. D. Acetone Acetone is a type of ketone body produced during fat metabolism, especially when carbohydrate intake is low or during starvation. While elevated levels of acetone may be seen in diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation, it does not cause the sweet, musky odor in the urine observed in this case. The odor here is specific to maple syrup urine disease due to the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids, such as isoleucine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Transaminases. Transaminases (aminotransferases) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of an amino group from an amino acid to an alpha-keto acid. This process, called transamination, is a key step in amino acid metabolism. It allows for the interconversion of amino acids and keto acids, facilitating the synthesis of non-essential amino acids and the removal of excess nitrogen. The most common transaminases include alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), which play a vital role in nitrogen metabolism by transferring the amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. Glutamate then serves as an amino donor in further biochemical reactions. This reaction is essential for the biosynthesis and catabolism of amino acids. Incorrect Options: A. Aminases Aminases are not involved in transamination. These enzymes typically catalyze reactions involving the addition of amine groups to molecules, rather than transferring an amino group between an amino acid and a keto acid. B. Deaminases Deaminases catalyze the removal of an amino group from an amino acid, leading to the formation of ammonia and a keto acid. This is known as deamination, which is different from transamination because it does not involve the direct transfer of the amino group to another molecule. D. Transketolases Transketolases are enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, where they transfer a two-carbon ketone group between sugar molecules. They do not participate in amino acid metabolism or transamination reactions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Biotin is required as a coenzyme – Incorrect. Transamination reactions do not require biotin as a coenzyme. Instead, they depend on pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), which is derived from vitamin B6. PLP serves as a coenzyme for aminotransferases (transaminases) by temporarily holding the amino group during the transfer process. Biotin, on the other hand, is a coenzyme involved in carboxylation reactions, such as in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis, but it does not play a role in transamination. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Correct Options: A. Alpha-Ketoglutarate is the most common acceptor In most transamination reactions, alpha-ketoglutarate serves as the primary amino group acceptor. When an amino acid donates its alpha-amino group, alpha-ketoglutarate accepts it, forming glutamate. This allows for the transfer of nitrogen between amino acids and plays a crucial role in nitrogen metabolism. C. Transfer of alpha-amino group from alpha-amino acid to keto acid Transamination reactions involve the transfer of an alpha-amino group from an alpha-amino acid to a keto acid. This process helps in the interconversion of amino acids and keto acids, allowing for amino acid synthesis and catabolism. The reaction is catalyzed by transaminases and requires PLP as a coenzyme. D. Threonine does not undergo transamination Unlike most amino acids, threonine (along with lysine and proline) does not undergo transamination. This is because threonine lacks a suitable primary amine group in the correct orientation for transaminase enzymes to act upon. Instead, threonine undergoes deamination or other metabolic pathways for its catabolism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pyruvate. During transamination, alanine donates its alpha-amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate and leaving behind pyruvate as the keto acid product. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. The equation for this reaction is: Alanine + α-Ketoglutarate → Pyruvate + Glutamate Since pyruvate is the direct keto acid formed from alanine in transamination, option D is correct. Incorrect Options: A. Aspartate Aspartate is not directly formed from alanine transamination. Instead, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) catalyzes a separate transamination reaction where aspartate donates its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming oxaloacetate. However, this reaction is independent of alanine metabolism. B. Arginine Arginine is not produced in transamination reactions. It is a basic amino acid synthesized primarily from the urea cycle and does not participate in direct transamination pathways involving alanine. C. Oxaloacetate Oxaloacetate is the keto acid formed from aspartate transamination, not alanine. When aspartate transaminates, it donates its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming oxaloacetate and glutamate. Since alanine transamination leads to pyruvate instead, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aspartate. Oxaloacetate is synthesized from aspartate through transamination. In this reaction, aspartate donates its alpha-amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate and leaving oxaloacetate as the keto acid product. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. Aspartate + α-Ketoglutarate → Oxaloacetate + Glutamate Since aspartate is the direct precursor of oxaloacetate in transamination, option D is correct. Incorrect Options: A. Serine Serine is not a direct precursor of oxaloacetate. Instead, serine is converted into pyruvate through serine dehydratase, which removes its amino group. Pyruvate can then enter gluconeogenesis or other metabolic pathways, but it does not directly form oxaloacetate. B. Valine Valine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) that is metabolized through a different pathway. It undergoes transamination to form alpha-ketoisovalerate, which then enters the propionyl-CoA pathway leading to succinyl-CoA, not oxaloacetate. C. Glycine Glycine is a non-essential amino acid that is primarily converted into serine or can enter the one-carbon metabolism pathway. It does not participate in the direct formation of oxaloacetate.",

Lysine does not undergo transamination because it lacks a suitable primary alpha-amino group in the correct orientation for transaminase enzymes to act upon. Instead, lysine undergoes oxidative deamination or other catabolic pathways, such as conversion into acetoacetyl-CoA, which eventually leads to ketone body formation. Additionally, if lysine were to undergo transamination, its reactive side chain could form unwanted cyclic intermediates, making the reaction chemically unfavorable. Incorrect Options: A. Aspartate – Incorrect Aspartate readily undergoes transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate to form oxaloacetate and glutamate. This reaction is catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism and the urea cycle. B. Alanine – Incorrect Alanine undergoes transamination through the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme, transferring its alpha-amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming pyruvate and glutamate. This reaction is significant in nitrogen transport between muscles and the liver. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Deamination. Deamination is the process of removing an amino (-NH2) group from an amino acid, resulting in the formation of a keto acid and the release of ammonia or ammonium ion. This process is crucial in nitrogen metabolism, as excess ammonia is toxic and must be converted into urea in the liver through the urea cycle for excretion. Deamination typically occurs in the liver and can be either oxidative (catalyzed by enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase) or non-oxidative. The oxidative deamination of glutamate, for example, produces alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia, which can then enter metabolic pathways. Incorrect Options: B. Transamination – Incorrect Transamination is the transfer of an amino group from one amino acid to a keto acid, forming a new amino acid and a new keto acid. Unlike deamination, transamination does not involve the removal of the amino group as free ammonia. It is catalyzed by transaminases (aminotransferases) and requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. C. Glucuronidation – Incorrect Glucuronidation is a phase II detoxification process in which a glucuronic acid molecule is added to substances (e.g., drugs, bilirubin, toxins) to make them more water-soluble for excretion. It is not related to amino acid metabolism or the removal of an amino group. D. Methylation – Incorrect Methylation involves the transfer of a methyl group to a molecule, often for regulatory purposes (e.g., DNA methylation, neurotransmitter metabolism). It does not involve amino group removal and is not part of amino acid catabolism.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mitochondria of hepatocytes. Oxidative deamination is the process in which an amino group is removed from an amino acid, resulting in the formation of a keto acid and free ammonia. This reaction primarily occurs in the mitochondria of hepatocytes (liver cells) because the liver is the central organ for nitrogen metabolism. The mitochondria provide an optimal environment for this process, as they contain the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidative deamination of glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia. Glutamate + NAD+ + H2O → α-Ketoglutarate + NH3 + NADH + H+ The ammonia produced is highly toxic and must be converted into urea in the liver through the urea cycle, which also occurs in the mitochondria. This localization helps prevent ammonia accumulation in the cytoplasm, which could be harmful to the cell. Incorrect Options: A. Cytoplasm of hepatic cells – Incorrect Oxidative deamination does not occur in the cytoplasm of liver cells because the enzymes required for this process, especially glutamate dehydrogenase, are localized in the mitochondria. While some transamination reactions occur in the cytoplasm, the actual deamination process is confined to the mitochondria. B. Cytoplasm of all cells – Incorrect Not all cells carry out oxidative deamination efficiently, as it is primarily a liver-specific process for nitrogen disposal. Additionally, oxidative deamination requires glutamate dehydrogenase, which is predominantly found in hepatic mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm of all cells. D. Mitochondria of all cells – Incorrect While mitochondria are present in all cells, oxidative deamination is mainly restricted to hepatic mitochondria because the liver is the main site of nitrogen metabolism and ammonia detoxification through the urea cycle. Other cells do not actively deaminate amino acids for nitrogen removal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) NAD. Oxidative deamination is the process in which an amino group (-NH2) is removed from an amino acid in the presence of oxidizing agents, leading to the formation of a keto acid and free ammonia (NH3). This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that requires NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) or NADP+ as an electron acceptor. The oxidative deamination of glutamate is a key example: Glutamate + NAD+ + H2O → α-Ketoglutarate + NH+ + NADH + H+ Here, NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which then enters the electron transport chain for ATP generation. The ammonia released is processed in the urea cycle to prevent toxicity. Since NAD+ is essential for the oxidation step in this reaction, option D is correct. Incorrect Options: A. TDP (Thiamine diphosphate) – Incorrect TDP (also called TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate) is a coenzyme involved in decarboxylation reactions, particularly in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the pentose phosphate pathway. It is not required for oxidative deamination. B. PLP (Pyridoxal phosphate) – Incorrect PLP (derived from vitamin B3) is a coenzyme involved in transamination reactions, where it helps transfer amino groups between amino acids and keto acids. However, oxidative deamination is a separate process that removes the amino group, making PLP unnecessary for this reaction. C. FAB (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide) – Incorrect FAB is not a standard biochemical term, but if referring to FAD (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide), FAD is typically involved in redox reactions in enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase. Oxidative deamination primarily relies on NAD+, not FAD, for electron transfer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Can use NADH or NADPH. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of glutamate, converting it into alpha-ketoglutarate and releasing ammonia. This reaction occurs in the mitochondria of hepatocytes and plays a critical role in amino acid catabolism and nitrogen metabolism. A unique feature of glutamate dehydrogenase is its ability to use both NAD+ and NADP+ as electron acceptors, meaning that it can produce either NADH or NADPH depending on cellular conditions. This flexibility allows GDH to function in both energy metabolism (via NADH production for ATP synthesis in the electron transport chain) and biosynthetic pathways (via NADPH production for reductive biosynthesis). Glutamate + NAD(P)+ + H2O → α-ketoglutarate + NH3 + NAD(P)H + H+ Since GDH can use both NADH and NADPH, option D is correct. Incorrect Options: A. PLP acts as coenzyme – Incorrect PLP (pyridoxal phosphate) is a coenzyme required for transamination reactions, where amino groups are transferred between amino acids and keto acids. However, oxidative deamination (catalyzed by GDH) does not require PLP. Instead, it relies on NAD+ or NADP+ as coenzymes for oxidation. B. Ammonium ion is not released as a free form – Incorrect In oxidative deamination, free ammonia is released as a byproduct, which is later converted into urea in the urea cycle to prevent toxicity. Since ammonium ion is released in free form, this statement is incorrect. C. It is an enzyme of transaminases – Incorrect Transaminases (also called aminotransferases) are a different class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of amino groups between amino acids and keto acids, without releasing ammonia. Glutamate dehydrogenase is not a transaminase; instead, it is involved in oxidative deamination, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Riboflavin. L-amino oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of L-amino acids, releasing ammonia and producing corresponding keto acids. Riboflavin, in the form of its active coenzyme flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), acts as a cofactor for L-amino oxidase. These flavin cofactors play a crucial role in the oxidation-reduction reactions facilitated by the enzyme, enabling the transfer of electrons during the deamination process. Incorrect Options: A. Folic acid – Incorrect Folic acid is a vitamin B9 that functions primarily in one-carbon metabolism, including the synthesis of nucleic acids and the transfer of methyl groups. It does not act as a cofactor for L-amino oxidase, which requires flavin derivatives (FMN/FAD). C. Niacin – Incorrect Niacin, or vitamin B3, is a precursor for the cofactors NAD+ and NADP+, which are involved in redox reactions. While niacin is important for energy metabolism and some enzymatic functions, it does not serve as a cofactor for L-amino oxidase. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) NH3 transporter. Glutamine in the blood acts as a transporter of ammonia, which is toxic at high concentrations. Glutamine is synthesized in tissues like muscles and the brain by the enzyme glutamine synthetase, which incorporates ammonia into glutamate, forming glutamine. This allows ammonia to be safely transported through the bloodstream to the liver, where it can be converted into urea through the urea cycle for excretion. This mechanism helps prevent the toxic buildup of ammonia in tissues. Incorrect Options: A. Stored energy – Incorrect While glutamine can be utilized as an energy source in some tissues, its primary role in the blood is not as a direct storage form of energy. Instead, it is primarily involved in ammonia transport. Other molecules, such as glycogen and fatty acids, serve as primary energy storage. B. Toxic element – Incorrect Glutamine is not a toxic element. On the contrary, it plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism and in maintaining acid-base balance in the body. It acts as a safe carrier of ammonia, preventing the toxicity of free ammonia. C. Abnormal metabolite – Incorrect Glutamine is not considered an abnormal metabolite.

In muscles, amino acids undergo transamination, where the amino group is transferred to pyruvate, forming alanine. Alanine then travels through the bloodstream to the liver, where its amino group is transferred to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process allows for the safe transport of nitrogen from peripheral tissues to the liver, where it can be processed for urea synthesis in the urea cycle. Incorrect Options: B. Aspartate – Incorrect Aspartate is involved in the transamination reactions and participates in nitrogen metabolism, but it is not primarily responsible for transporting nitrogen from muscle to liver. Aspartate is more involved in the urea cycle and intermediary metabolism within the liver rather than directly transporting nitrogen from muscle tissues. C. Lactate – Incorrect Lactate is produced during anaerobic glycolysis in muscles but does not play a role in nitrogen transport. Instead, it is involved in lactic acid fermentation and can be converted back into glucose in the liver via the Cori cycle, but it does not carry nitrogen from the muscle to the liver. D. Glutamine – Incorrect While glutamine does transport ammonia in the blood, it is not the primary molecule for transporting nitrogen from the muscle to the liver. Glutamine’s main role is in ammonia transport and acid-base balance, especially in organs like the brain and kidneys, rather than in the glucose-alanine cycle between muscle and liver.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased breakdown of muscle protein. During prolonged fasting, the body begins to rely on protein catabolism to supply amino acids for gluconeogenesis, which is the process of producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, primarily in the liver. Alanine plays a significant role in the glucose-alanine cycle, where it is produced in muscles and transported to the liver to contribute to gluconeogenesis. The increased concentration of alanine during prolonged fasting suggests that the body is breaking down muscle protein to provide amino acids (like alanine) for gluconeogenesis, as the body seeks to maintain glucose levels for vital functions, especially for the brain and red blood cells. Incorrect Options: A. Impaired renal function – Incorrect Impaired renal function can lead to issues like amino acid imbalances and difficulty in excreting waste products, but it is not directly related to the increased concentration of alanine during prolonged fasting. In fact, renal issues would more likely cause urea buildup in the blood, not an increase in alanine. B. Decreased utilization of amino acids from gluconeogenesis – Incorrect In prolonged fasting, the body actually increases its utilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis to maintain glucose supply. A decreased utilization would result in lower levels of amino acids like alanine, not higher levels. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the metabolic response during fasting. D. Leakage of amino acids from cells due to plasma membrane damage – Incorrect Leakage of amino acids from cells would generally be associated with cellular damage or trauma, not fasting. During prolonged fasting, the body typically increases the breakdown of muscle protein to release amino acids for metabolic processes, rather than causing leakage from cells due to membrane damage.",

In this period, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) like valine, leucine, and isoleucine are predominantly extracted by the muscles for protein synthesis and energy production. The liver spares the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) by not extracting them for gluconeogenesis, instead allowing them to be used primarily in the muscle. Valine is a key example of an amino acid that is spared by the liver and preferentially taken up by muscles after a meal. Incorrect Options: A. Alanine – Incorrect Alanine is involved in the glucose-alanine cycle, where it is primarily synthesized in muscle tissue during periods of protein breakdown and then shuttled to the liver for gluconeogenesis.

Glutamate – Incorrect Glutamate is a non-essential amino acid that is involved in various metabolic processes, including the transamination reactions in the liver.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Glutaminase. Ammonia in the urine primarily comes from the breakdown of glutamine in the kidneys. Glutaminase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, releasing ammonia in the process. This ammonia is then excreted in the urine after being neutralized by bicarbonate. This process plays a role in acid-base regulation in the kidneys, where ammonia helps buffer excess hydrogen ions in the urine. Incorrect Options: A. Arginase – Incorrect Arginase is an enzyme involved in the urea cycle, where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine to produce ornithine and urea. Urea is ultimately excreted in the urine, but argninase does not directly contribute to the production of ammonia in the urine. Ammonia released in urine primarily comes from the breakdown of glutamine via glutaminase. B. Urease – Incorrect Urease is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is commonly found in bacteria, not human cells, and plays a role in some infections (e.g., Helicobacter pylori in the stomach). While urease produces ammonia, it does not directly contribute to the ammonia found in human urine under normal physiological conditions. D. Glutamate dehydrogenase – Incorrect Glutamate dehydrogenase is involved in the oxidative deamination of glutamate to produce alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia. However, the source of ammonia in the urine is primarily glutamine metabolism via glutaminase, not glutamate dehydrogenase. While glutamate dehydrogenase produces ammonia, it is not the main source in urine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Glutamate. Glutamate binds covalently with ammonium ions to form glutamine through the action of the enzyme glutamine synthetase. This process allows NH4+, which is toxic in high concentrations, to be safely transported in the bloodstream. By incorporating NH4+ into the amide group of glutamine, the body prevents the harmful effects of ammonia while facilitating its transport to the liver and kidneys for further processing, primarily for excretion as urea. Incorrect Options: A. Aspartate – Incorrect Aspartate is involved in nitrogen metabolism, particularly in the urea cycle and transamination reactions, but it does not directly bind to NH4+ to form a non-toxic compound. It plays a role in transferring amino groups but does not specifically neutralize or transport ammonia as glutamate does. B. Histidine – Incorrect Histidine is an essential amino acid and plays key roles in enzyme active sites and acid-base balance, but it does not directly interact with NH4+ to form a non-toxic compound for transportation. It does not have the same capacity to bind and detoxify ammonia as glutamate. C. Serine – Incorrect Serine is involved in various metabolic processes, including the one-carbon metabolism pathway, but it does not bind NH4+ to make it non-toxic for transport. Glutamate is the primary amino acid involved in the binding and safe transport of ammonia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Alpha-Ketoglutarate. In the brain, alpha-ketoglutarate plays a crucial role in the detoxification of ammonia through its involvement in the glutamate-glutamine cycle. When ammonia is produced in the brain, it reacts with alpha-ketoglutarate to form glutamate, which is then further converted into glutamine by glutamine synthetase. This helps to safely transport ammonia out of the brain and prevents its toxic accumulation. alpha-Ketoglutarate serves as the primary acceptor of ammonia in the brain, converting it into a non-toxic form for further processing. Incorrect Options: A. Citrate – Incorrect Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle and is involved in energy production, but it does not play a direct role in ammonia detoxification in the brain. Its primary role is in energy metabolism, not in processing or detoxifying ammonia. B. Oxaloacetate – Incorrect Oxaloacetate is another important intermediate of the TCA cycle, but it is not involved in ammonia detoxification in the brain. While it participates in gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle, it does not directly bind to ammonia like alpha-ketoglutarate does. D. Succinate – Incorrect Succinate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle that contributes to energy production, but it is not involved in the detoxification of ammonia. It does not participate in the conversion of ammonia to non-toxic forms in the brain.",
