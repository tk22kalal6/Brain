An analysis of his DNA, from isolated fibroblasts, indicated an increased level of thymine dimers when the cells were exposed to UV light. The boy developed a skin tumor owing to an increased mutation rate, which was caused by which one of the following?",

      "solution": "Correct answer (B). Loss of nucleotide excision repair activity The boy’s increased sensitivity to sunlight, skin cancer development, and elevated levels of thymine dimers after UV exposure all point to a defect in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. NER is responsible for repairing UV-induced DNA damage, such as thymine dimers, which are formed when adjacent thymine bases in DNA are covalently bonded by UV radiation. Without effective NER, these thymine dimers are not repaired properly, leading to mutations and, ultimately, the development of cancer. The mutation in the NER pathway in this case explains the boy’s increased mutation rate and skin cancer susceptibility. Incorrect Answers: A. A lack of DNA primase activity DNA primase is involved in the synthesis of RNA primers during DNA replication. While a defect in DNA primase would impair DNA replication, it would not specifically affect the repair of UV-induced thymine dimers. Therefore, a lack of DNA primase activity would not explain the boy’s increased mutation rate related to UV exposure. C. Increased recombination during mitosis Recombination during mitosis refers to the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes during cell division. While errors in recombination can lead to genetic instability, they are not directly involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Therefore, increased recombination would not explain the accumulation of thymine dimers or the associated mutation rate in this case. D. Loss of base excision repair activity Base excision repair (BER) is responsible for fixing smaller lesions in DNA, such as those caused by oxidative damage or deamination. While BER plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability, it does not specifically repair thymine dimers caused by UV radiation. Therefore, a loss of BER would not account for the boy’s increased mutation rate due to thymine dimers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer D. Inability to correct mismatched bases in newly synthesized DNA The patient’s family history of early-onset colon cancer, along with a history of ovarian and uterine cancers in his paternal grandmother, strongly suggests a hereditary cancer syndrome. Given the presence of multiple cancers in the family, the most likely genetic condition here is Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, leading to an inability to correct mismatched bases that occur during DNA replication. This results in microsatellite instability and an increased risk of various cancers, including colon, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, as seen in this patient’s family history. The defective process in Lynch syndrome is specifically the inability to correct mismatched bases in newly synthesized DNA. Incorrect Answers: A. Removal of thymine dimers from the DNA The removal of thymine dimers from DNA is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which fixes UV-induced damage. This is more characteristic of conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum, where patients have defective NER. However, the family history and the cancers described here do not suggest a defect in NER, but rather a mismatch repair defect, making this option incorrect. B. Inability to remove the base U from DNA The process of removing uracil (which results from deamination of cytosine) is part of base excision repair (BER). Although defects in BER can lead to some cancers, it is not the primary defect in Lynch syndrome. The patient’s symptoms align more with a mismatch repair defect, not an issue with uracil excision, so this option is also incorrect. C. Loss of DNA ligase activity DNA ligase is involved in sealing nicks in the DNA backbone, which is essential for proper DNA replication and repair. While DNA ligase deficiencies can lead to issues with DNA replication and repair, the clinical presentation in this case does not suggest a defect in ligase activity. The pattern of cancers and the specific mutation in Lynch syndrome involves mismatch repair, not DNA ligase, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) A helicase The patient's symptoms, including photophobia, a butterfly rash, small stature, and recurrent pneumonias, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Cockayne syndrome (CS), a rare genetic disorder. One of the characteristic findings in CS is an increased rate of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), which reflects genomic instability. The defect in CS is due to mutations in genes that code for helicases, particularly the ERCC6 or ERCC8 genes, which are involved in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathway. These helicases are crucial for unwinding DNA during repair and replication processes. The defective helicase activity in CS leads to the clinical symptoms observed, including developmental delays, photosensitivity, and premature aging features. Thus, the enzymatic defect in this patient can be traced to a defective helicase. Incorrect Answers: A. A DNA polymerase DNA polymerases are responsible for synthesizing DNA during replication and repair. While defects in DNA polymerase can cause issues in DNA replication, this is not the primary defect in Cockayne syndrome. The condition is linked to defective helicase activity rather than DNA polymerase dysfunction, making this option incorrect. B. An RNA polymerase RNA polymerases are responsible for synthesizing RNA from a DNA template during transcription. Though defects in RNA polymerase can lead to transcriptional issues, the hallmark feature of Cockayne syndrome is defective DNA repair, specifically involving helicase activity. RNA polymerase is not directly implicated in this disorder, so this option is also incorrect. D. An endonuclease Endonucleases are enzymes responsible for cleaving the phosphodiester bonds within a DNA strand. While endonucleases are involved in DNA repair, Cockayne syndrome is primarily caused by a defect in helicase enzymes that facilitate DNA unwinding during repair processes. Endonuclease dysfunction is not the key issue in this case, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Photoactivatable thymine dimer removal Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin's ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In XP, the defect lies in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for recognizing and removing thymine dimers (a type of DNA damage caused by UV light). In XP patients, the ability to remove these dimers is impaired, leading to a mutagenic effect and an increased risk of skin cancer and other skin issues, such as blistering, freckling, and telangiectasia, upon exposure to sunlight. Photoactivatable thymine dimer removal is an essential function of NER, making C the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. DNA polymerase proof-reading activity DNA polymerase proofreading is essential for ensuring the accuracy of DNA replication by correcting base-pairing errors during replication. However, this process is not the primary defect in xeroderma pigmentosum. The condition is caused by defective DNA repair, not replication accuracy, and specifically impacts the repair of DNA damage caused by UV light. Thus, A is incorrect. B. Double-strand break repair during replication Double-strand breaks in DNA are repaired by mechanisms such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. While defects in these pathways can cause a variety of diseases, including some forms of cancer predisposition, they are not the cause of xeroderma pigmentosum. XP primarily involves defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER), not double-strand break repair. Therefore, B is incorrect. D. Removal of uracil from DNA The removal of uracil from DNA is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which fixes DNA damage caused by deamination of cytosine (resulting in uracil incorporation into DNA). This process is unrelated to the UV-induced damage seen in xeroderma pigmentosum. As XP involves defective nucleotide excision repair, not base excision repair, D is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Three Phases DNA replication follows a well-coordinated sequence of steps to ensure accurate duplication of genetic material before cell division. Initiation: This phase begins at specific sequences called the origin of replication. Enzymes such as helicase unwind the DNA, creating a replication fork, while single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) prevent the strands from reannealing. Primase synthesizes RNA primers to provide a starting point for DNA polymerase. Elongation: During this phase, DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand. Leading strand synthesis is continuous, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase. Termination: Replication ends when the replication forks meet, or specific termination sequences and proteins halt the process. The newly formed DNA strands undergo proofreading and error correction to ensure fidelity. Incorrect Options: Option A (Two Phases): DNA replication is more complex than just two phases. If only initiation and elongation were considered, termination would be overlooked, leading to incomplete replication. Option C (Four Phases): There is no recognized fourth phase in DNA replication. The three-phase model sufficiently describes the process from start to finish. Additional steps such as proofreading and repair are part of elongation and termination rather than separate phases. Option D (Five Phases): While DNA replication involves multiple enzymatic steps, it is categorized into three main phases. Some molecular processes like priming, proofreading, and ligation occur within these phases rather than being considered separate stages.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 5’-3’ Polymerase Activity DNA polymerases are essential enzymes responsible for synthesizing new DNA strands during replication. They catalyze the addition of nucleotides to the growing DNA chain in the 5’-3’ direction. This means that new nucleotides are continuously added to the 3’ end of the newly forming strand, using the template strand in an antiparallel fashion. This activity is fundamental to DNA replication because it ensures the accurate duplication of genetic material before cell division. Without 5’-3’ polymerase activity, DNA synthesis would not proceed, making it a crucial function of DNA polymerase. Incorrect Options: Option B (3’-5’ Polymerase Activity): DNA polymerase does not have 3’-5’ polymerase activity. DNA synthesis only occurs in the 5’-3’ direction because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to a free 3' hydroxyl (-OH) group. If DNA polymerase worked in the 3’-5’ direction, it would not be able to properly link nucleotides, as energy from nucleotide triphosphates is needed for polymerization. Option C (5’-3’ Exonuclease Activity): While some DNA polymerases, such as DNA polymerase I in prokaryotes, exhibit 5’-3’ exonuclease activity, this function is not related to the polymerization of DNA. Instead, this activity is used for removing RNA primers and replacing them with DNA nucleotides. However, not all DNA polymerases have this function, making it incorrect in this context. Option D (3’-5’ Exonuclease Activity): Some DNA polymerases have 3’-5’ exonuclease activity, but this is specifically for proofreading. This function helps correct errors by removing incorrectly incorporated nucleotides, ensuring high fidelity in DNA replication. However, this activity does not contribute to DNA synthesis itself, making it an incorrect answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Beta DNA polymerase beta plays a crucial role in the repair of mammalian DNA. It is primarily involved in base excision repair (BER), a pathway that corrects small DNA lesions such as single-base damage caused by oxidation, alkylation, or deamination. Pol beta fills in the missing nucleotides after the damaged section of DNA has been removed by specialized enzymes. Unlike other polymerases, it lacks proofreading activity, as its primary function is repair rather than replication. Its ability to insert correct nucleotides and interact with DNA ligases makes it essential for maintaining genomic integrity. Incorrect Options: Option A (Alpha): DNA polymerase alpha is involved in DNA replication, not repair. It synthesizes short RNA-DNA primers during the initiation of replication on both the leading and lagging strands. However, it lacks exonuclease proofreading activity, making it unsuitable for repair functions. Option C (Gamma): DNA polymerase gamma is responsible for replicating and repairing mitochondrial DNA, not nuclear DNA. It plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial genomes, but it does not contribute significantly to the repair of mammalian nuclear DNA. Option D (Delta): DNA polymerase delta is involved in DNA replication and some repair processes, particularly in lagging strand synthesis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Short Pieces of DNA on the Lagging Strand Okazaki fragments are short sequences of DNA synthesized on the lagging strand during DNA replication. Since DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in the 5’-3’ direction, continuous synthesis is not possible on the lagging strand, which runs in the opposite 3’-5’ direction relative to the replication fork. To overcome this, DNA polymerase synthesizes short Okazaki fragments in a discontinuous manner, each initiated by an RNA primer. These fragments are later joined together by DNA ligase to form a continuous strand. This process ensures that both strands of DNA are copied efficiently despite their antiparallel orientation. Incorrect Options: Option A (Long Pieces of DNA on Lagging Strand): Okazaki fragments are not long; they are short fragments typically 100-200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes and 1000-2000 nucleotides long in prokaryotes. Long DNA strands are only found on the leading strand, where synthesis is continuous. Option C (Long Pieces of DNA on Leading Strand): The leading strand is synthesized continuously, not in fragments. DNA polymerase moves in the same direction as the replication fork, allowing the strand to be replicated as one long piece, not in Okazaki fragments. Option D (Short Pieces of DNA on Leading Strand): The leading strand does not require short fragments for synthesis. Since replication on this strand is continuous, it does not need multiple RNA primers or discontinuous synthesis. Short DNA fragments are a feature of the lagging strand, not the leading strand.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Synthesized by DNA Polymerase delta in Eukaryotes In eukaryotic cells, Okazaki fragments are synthesized by DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) during DNA replication. Since DNA polymerase can only synthesize in the 5’-3’ direction, replication of the lagging strand occurs discontinuously. Okazaki fragments are formed as short DNA segments, each starting with an RNA primer laid down by DNA polymerase delta and primase complex. After the primer is added, DNA polymerase delta extends the fragment by adding nucleotides until it reaches the next RNA primer. These fragments are later processed and joined together by other enzymes, ensuring the formation of a continuous DNA strand. Incorrect Options: Option A (Synthesized by DNA Polymerase I): DNA polymerase I is primarily found in prokaryotes, where it plays a role in removing RNA primers and filling in gaps rather than synthesizing Okazaki fragments. In eukaryotes, DNA polymerase delta, not Pol I, is responsible for Okazaki fragment synthesis. Option B (Joined by Flap Endonuclease I): Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN1) does not join Okazaki fragments but instead helps in removing RNA primers and processing the lagging strand before ligation. The actual joining of Okazaki fragments is performed by DNA ligase I, which seals the nicks in the DNA backbone. Option C (Synthesized Along Leading Strand): Okazaki fragments are synthesized on the lagging strand, not the leading strand. The leading strand is synthesized continuously by DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) without the need for Okazaki fragments or multiple RNA primers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) DNA Topoisomerase DNA topoisomerase is an enzyme responsible for cutting and rejoining DNA strands to relieve supercoiling and tension generated during DNA replication and transcription. As the DNA helix unwinds, it creates excessive twisting and strain ahead of the replication fork. Topoisomerase helps by making temporary single-strand (Type I) or double-strand (Type II) cuts in the DNA, allowing the strands to unwind and relax. After reducing the strain, topoisomerase reseals the breaks, ensuring the integrity of the DNA molecule. Without this enzyme, DNA replication and transcription would be hindered due to excessive supercoiling. Incorrect Options: Option A (DNA Polymerase): DNA polymerase is responsible for synthesizing new DNA strands by adding nucleotides in a 5’-3’ direction. It does not cut DNA; instead, it extends an existing strand during replication. Some DNA polymerases have exonuclease activity for proofreading, but they do not make intentional strand cuts like topoisomerase. Option C (Helicase): Helicase unwinds the DNA double helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs. However, it does not cut the DNA backbone. Its function is to separate the strands, allowing replication to proceed, but it relies on topoisomerase to relieve the resulting tension. Option D (DNA Ligase): DNA ligase is responsible for joining DNA fragments, particularly during replication and repair. It seals nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone, such as those between Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. Unlike topoisomerase, it does not cut DNA; rather, it helps in sealing and maintaining DNA integrity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Seals the Single-Strand Nick Between the Nascent Chain and Okazaki Fragments on the Lagging Strand DNA ligase is an essential enzyme in DNA replication and repair, responsible for sealing nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. On the lagging strand, replication occurs discontinuously, producing Okazaki fragments that need to be joined together to form a continuous DNA strand. DNA ligase facilitates this process by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond between adjacent DNA fragments, ensuring strand integrity. It also plays a role in DNA repair mechanisms, such as base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER), where it seals single-strand breaks. Incorrect Options: Option A (Initiation of DNA Synthesis and Ligation): DNA ligase does not initiate DNA synthesis. Instead, it joins DNA fragments after synthesis is complete. The initiation of DNA synthesis is carried out by DNA polymerases, not ligase. Option B (Initiates Synthesis of RNA Primer): The synthesis of RNA primers is performed by primase, not DNA ligase. Primase lays down short RNA primers that provide a starting point for DNA polymerase to begin replication. DNA ligase functions after replication by sealing nicks, not by initiating primer synthesis. Option C (Underwinding of dsDNA to Provide an ssDNA Template): Underwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to provide a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) template is the role of topoisomerase and helicase, not DNA ligase.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) dsDNA Restriction endonucleases are enzymes that specifically cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at or near specific recognition sequences, known as restriction sites. These enzymes play a crucial role in molecular biology, particularly in genetic engineering and recombinant DNA technology. They recognize short palindromic sequences in dsDNA and cut either at the recognition site (Type II restriction enzymes) or at variable distances from it (Type I and Type III restriction enzymes). This cleavage can result in blunt ends or sticky ends, which are useful in cloning and DNA manipulation. Restriction enzymes are naturally found in bacteria, where they serve as a defense mechanism against invading viral DNA. Incorrect Options: Option A (ssDNA): Restriction endonucleases do not cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) because their recognition sites require a double-stranded structure for binding and cleavage. Some nucleases, like single-strand-specific endonucleases, can act on ssDNA, but restriction enzymes specifically target dsDNA. Option B (ssRNA): Restriction endonucleases do not cleave single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) because RNA has a different structure and lacks the specific restriction sites recognized by these enzymes. Enzymes like RNases (ribonucleases) are responsible for degrading RNA, not restriction endonucleases. Option D (Polypeptide): Restriction endonucleases target nucleic acids, not proteins. The cleavage of polypeptides is performed by proteases or peptidases, such as trypsin or pepsin, which break peptide bonds in proteins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reverse Transcriptase Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template. This enzyme is used by retroviruses, such as HIV, to convert their single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), allowing integration into the host genome. In molecular biology, reverse transcriptase is widely used for cDNA synthesis in research applications, such as RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) and gene expression studies. The enzyme reads the RNA template and synthesizes a complementary DNA strand, enabling further amplification or cloning. Incorrect Options: Option A (Helicase): Helicase is responsible for unwinding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by breaking hydrogen bonds between the base pairs during DNA replication. It does not synthesize cDNA from RNA, as it has no polymerization function. Option C (DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase): DNA-dependent DNA polymerase requires a DNA template to synthesize a new DNA strand. It cannot use RNA as a template, unlike reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that can convert RNA into DNA. Option D (Topoisomerase): Topoisomerase helps relieve supercoiling stress in DNA by cutting and rejoining the DNA strands during replication and transcription. However, it does not synthesize cDNA or interact with RNA in the process of reverse transcription.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase Reverse transcriptase and telomerase are both RNA-dependent DNA polymerases because they use an RNA template to synthesize DNA. Reverse transcriptase is found in retroviruses, where it converts single-stranded viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), which can then integrate into the host genome. Telomerase, on the other hand, is an enzyme responsible for maintaining the ends of chromosomes (telomeres) by using its own RNA template to extend the DNA strand, preventing loss of genetic information during replication. Both enzymes function by reading an RNA sequence and synthesizing a complementary DNA strand, which is why they are classified as RNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Incorrect Options: Option B (RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase): RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an enzyme found in RNA viruses, where it replicates RNA directly by synthesizing an RNA strand from an RNA template. Reverse transcriptase and telomerase do not perform this function; instead, they produce DNA from RNA. Option C (DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase): DNA-dependent DNA polymerase requires a DNA template to synthesize DNA, as seen in DNA replication by enzymes like DNA polymerase III in prokaryotes and DNA polymerase α, δ, and ε in eukaryotes. Reverse transcriptase and telomerase do not use DNA templates; they use RNA as a template to create DNA. Option D (DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase): DNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA from a DNA template, as seen in transcription, where RNA polymerase creates messenger RNA (mRNA) from DNA. Reverse transcriptase and telomerase function oppositely, producing DNA from an RNA template, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Nucleotide Excision Repair The child’s symptoms—blisters on exposure to sunlight and irregular dark spots on the skin—are characteristic of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. NER is responsible for repairing UV-induced DNA damage, particularly thymine dimers and other bulky lesions caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In individuals with a defective NER system, UV-induced DNA damage remains unrepaired, leading to skin abnormalities, increased sun sensitivity, and a high risk of skin cancer. The inability to remove these damaged DNA segments leads to mutations, manifesting as skin pigmentation defects, lesions, and extreme photosensitivity. Incorrect Options: Option A (Mismatch Repair): Mismatch repair (MMR) corrects errors made during DNA replication, such as base-pair mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops. Defects in this pathway are linked to Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) rather than UV-induced skin damage. Since the child’s symptoms are related to UV exposure, mismatch repair is not the affected pathway. Option C (Recombination Repair): Recombination repair, specifically homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), is involved in repairing double-strand breaks rather than repairing UV-induced damage. Although recombination repair is essential for genome stability, it does not directly repair thymine dimers or other UV-induced DNA lesions. Option D (Thymine Dimers): Thymine dimers are a type of DNA damage caused by UV radiation, but they are not a repair mechanism. Instead, they are the lesions that nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes. If NER is defective, thymine dimers accumulate, leading to skin abnormalities and increased cancer risk. Therefore, thymine dimers are the cause of the problem, not the repair mechanism itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) dsDNA Break Repair Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is caused by a defect in double-strand DNA (dsDNA) break repair, specifically due to mutations in the ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) gene. The ATM protein is a key regulator of the DNA damage response, particularly in repairing double-strand breaks via the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. Defects in ATM lead to an accumulation of DNA damage, causing progressive neurodegeneration (ataxia), immune deficiencies, increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and a high risk of cancer. The hallmark symptoms of AT include gait instability (ataxia), dilated blood vessels (telangiectasia), immune dysfunction, and hypersensitivity to radiation. Incorrect Options: Option A (Mismatch Repair): Mismatch repair (MMR) fixes base-pair mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops that occur during DNA replication. Defects in MMR are linked to Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) but not to ataxia telangiectasia. Since AT is caused by double-strand break repair failure, mismatch repair defects are not responsible. Option B (Nucleotide Excision Repair): Nucleotide excision repair (NER) corrects UV-induced DNA damage, such as thymine dimers and bulky adducts. Disorders caused by NER defects include xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome, which primarily affect the skin and neurological development. AT, however, is caused by dsDNA break repair defects, not faulty nucleotide excision repair. Option D (Base Excision Repair): Base excision repair (BER) corrects small, non-helix-distorting lesions, such as oxidative damage, deaminated bases, and alkylation damage. Defects in BER are associated with increased susceptibility to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases but do not cause ataxia telangiectasia, which is specifically linked to dsDNA break repair failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) NHEJ Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) is caused by defects in Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ), making option D the correct answer. NHEJ is a critical DNA repair mechanism that resolves double-strand breaks (DSBs) by directly ligating the broken ends together. It is crucial in the development of immune cells, especially T and B lymphocytes, through V(D)J recombination, a process responsible for generating diverse antigen receptors. Without proper functioning of NHEJ, V(D)J recombination cannot occur, leading to a severely compromised immune system, as seen in SCID. This condition impairs immune cell maturation, leaving individuals vulnerable to infections. Incorrect Options: A. Homologous recombination: Homologous recombination is a repair mechanism that operates during DNA replication, particularly in the S and G2 phases when a sister chromatid is available as a template. While important for maintaining genomic stability, its defects are not the cause of SCID. Instead, defects in homologous recombination are more commonly linked to Fanconi anemia or certain cancers. B. Mismatch repair (MMR): MMR is involved in correcting errors that occur during DNA replication, such as base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops. MMR deficiencies are associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), but they do not impact the immune system in the way that NHEJ does. Therefore, it is not related to the development of SCID. C. Nucleotide excision repair (NER): NER is responsible for removing bulky DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV radiation or chemical damage. Defects in NER lead to conditions like Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) or Cockayne syndrome, which affect skin and neurological systems, but not immune development. Therefore, NER is not associated with SCID.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The correct sequence of the cell cycle is G0-G1-S-G2-M, making option C the correct answer. The cell cycle consists of phases that allow for proper cell growth, DNA replication, and division. The sequence starts with G0, a resting phase where cells are not actively dividing. Cells can then enter the G1 phase, where they grow and prepare for DNA replication. The S phase is where DNA is synthesized (replicated). After that, cells move to the G2 phase, during which they continue to grow and prepare for mitosis. Finally, the M phase is mitosis, where the cell divides into two daughter cells. Incorrect Options: A. G0-G1-G2-S-M: This sequence is incorrect because the S phase (synthesis phase) should come after G1, not after G2. The cell first undergoes growth and preparation in G1, then replicates its DNA during the S phase, followed by further growth and preparation in G2 before mitosis (M phase). B. G0-M-G2-S-G1: This sequence is incorrect because M (mitosis) should come after G2, not before it. The cell cannot enter mitosis directly from the resting state (G0), nor can it skip the G1 and S phases that are crucial for growth and DNA replication. Mitosis follows the completion of DNA replication and growth in the S and G2 phases. D. G0-G1-S-M-G2: This sequence is incorrect because G2 should come after M (mitosis), not after S. After mitosis, the cell enters G1 to begin a new cycle, and the correct sequence for the cell cycle is completed when the cell progresses through G1, S, G2, and then mitosis again.",
