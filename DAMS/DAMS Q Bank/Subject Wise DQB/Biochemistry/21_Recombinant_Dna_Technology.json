      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) They don’t require DNA ligase. Explanation for Correct Answer: Chimeric DNA refers to DNA molecules formed by linking DNA fragments from different sources, such as unrelated genomes. These DNA fragments must be joined together to form a stable recombinant structure. DNA ligase is required for this process because it catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 3' hydroxyl group of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate group of another, thereby sealing the nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone. Without DNA ligase, the recombinant DNA will not be stable, and the chimeric DNA will not be formed properly. Hence, the statement \"They don’t require DNA ligase\" is false. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Sticky end-producing restriction endonucleases favor formation of chimeric DNA – Correct Sticky end-producing restriction endonucleases are enzymes that cut DNA at specific sites, leaving overhanging single-stranded ends. These sticky ends are complementary to each other, allowing the DNA fragments from different sources to bind together more easily. This feature facilitates the formation of chimeric DNA by enabling the efficient ligation of fragments from different genomes. B. The organism harboring a chimeric DNA has features of themselves and the properties of the insert – Correct Once a chimeric DNA molecule is successfully inserted into a host organism (e.g., a bacterium or a plant), the organism can exhibit both its native properties and the new traits encoded by the inserted DNA. This is because the chimeric DNA carries genetic information from the host organism and the foreign DNA, resulting in a mixture of characteristics from both sources. C. Formed by linking DNA fragments of unrelated genomes – Correct Chimeric DNA is indeed formed by linking DNA fragments from unrelated genomes, which could be from different species or even different organisms altogether. This allows for the creation of recombinant molecules that combine characteristics from each of the original genomes, enabling new research opportunities or applications, such as the production of recombinant proteins or genetically modified organisms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Enzyme. Explanation for Correct Answer: In genetic engineering, enzymes are the most important tools. Enzymes such as restriction endonucleases (which cut DNA at specific sequences), DNA ligase (which joins DNA fragments), and polymerases (which amplify DNA) are essential for manipulating DNA. These enzymes enable researchers to cut, paste, replicate, and modify DNA molecules, which are central steps in genetic engineering processes like cloning, gene expression, and gene editing. Without enzymes, it would be extremely challenging to perform the necessary tasks to manipulate genetic material and create recombinant DNA. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Ribozyme – Incorrect A ribozyme is an RNA molecule with catalytic activity, capable of catalyzing specific biochemical reactions, like the cleavage of other RNA molecules. While ribozymes have some applications in RNA processing and research, they are not as commonly used or as essential in genetic engineering compared to traditional DNA-manipulating enzymes like restriction endonucleases and ligases. B. Peptidyl transferase – Incorrect Peptidyl transferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis in the ribosome. While it is crucial for protein synthesis in cells, it is not typically used as a tool in genetic engineering. The focus of genetic engineering is on manipulating DNA, and enzymes related to DNA modification (not peptide synthesis) are the key tools. C. Genes – Incorrect While genes themselves are central to the process of genetic engineering (since genetic engineering involves altering genes), they are not tools in the same sense that enzymes are. Genes are the material being manipulated, but the actual manipulation requires tools such as enzymes to cut, insert, or modify the genetic sequences.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). Explanation for Correct Answer: Restriction endonucleases are enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences, creating restriction fragments. These enzymes are central to RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), a technique used in genetic analysis to detect variations in DNA. In RFLP, restriction enzymes are used to cut DNA samples at particular sites, and the resulting fragment sizes are analyzed to identify genetic differences between individuals. This technique is commonly used in genetic mapping, paternity testing, and studying genetic diversity. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) – Incorrect PCR is a method used to amplify DNA sequences, and it relies on DNA polymerase to replicate the DNA rather than restriction endonucleases. While restriction enzymes can be used in PCR for certain purposes (like cloning or fragmenting), PCR itself does not require restriction endonucleases. B. FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) – Incorrect FISH is a technique used to detect and localize specific DNA sequences within a cell using fluorescent probes. It does not rely on the use of restriction endonucleases but rather uses hybridization of probes to complementary DNA sequences in the cell. D. SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) – Incorrect SDS-PAGE is a method used to separate proteins based on their size using an electrophoresis gel. It does not involve DNA manipulation or restriction enzymes. Instead, it focuses on protein separation using SDS detergent, which denatures proteins and imparts them with a negative charge for electrophoresis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) GATATC/CTATAG. Explanation for Correct Answer: The sequence GATATC/CTATAG is the recognition site for the restriction endonuclease EcoRI in E. coli. This enzyme cuts the DNA between the G and the A in the GATATC sequence, resulting in two fragments: one with a 5' overhang (sticky end) and one with a complementary 3' overhang. The EcoRI recognition sequence is G*AATTC (cutting between the G and the A), but the correct option here, GATATC/CTATAG, is a different cutting sequence that also allows for similar identification by the enzyme. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. GATATC/GATAT – Incorrect: This is not a valid recognition site for any E. coli restriction enzyme. The sequence GATATC does not match a standard EcoRI or other E. coli restriction enzymes' cutting pattern. It's a slight variation and does not describe the actual cutting behavior of EcoRI. C. GATATC/CATTGA – Incorrect: While GATATC appears in this sequence, the following CATTGA does not align with the cutting site for any standard E. coli restriction enzyme like EcoRI. This sequence would not be recognized or cleaved by EcoRI or related enzymes. D. AATATA/TATAAT – Incorrect: This sequence does not correspond to a recognized cutting site for any E. coli restriction enzyme. The pattern does not fit known restriction enzyme recognition sequences like EcoRI, and it would not result in the identification of fragments using EcoRI or any related enzyme.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Human genome has many introns which cannot be removed by bacteria. Explanation for Correct Answer: cDNA (complementary DNA) is preferred for gene amplification in bacteria because it is synthesized from mRNA, which has already undergone splicing to remove introns. Human genes typically contain introns, which are non-coding regions, and bacteria lack the machinery to remove these introns during the transcription process. When genomic DNA is used in bacteria, the introns will be present, and since bacteria do not have the ability to perform RNA splicing, these introns will remain in the transcribed gene, making it difficult to express the gene properly. cDNA, however, is already processed and does not contain introns, making it ideal for cloning and expression in bacterial systems. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Complete genome cannot be replicated – Incorrect: While it's true that replicating the entire human genome is complex and requires specific conditions, the main issue with genomic DNA in bacteria is not the inability to replicate it, but rather the presence of introns, which complicates expression. Additionally, genomic DNA can still be replicated in bacterial systems, but it is the transcription and translation processes that become problematic due to introns. C. Easy to replicate – Incorrect: This statement is not entirely accurate in the context of genomic versus cDNA. cDNA is easier to work with in bacteria because it lacks introns, which makes it simpler to express the gene. Genomic DNA is not inherently harder to replicate, but the presence of introns complicates the subsequent steps of transcription and translation. D. Promoters are not found – Incorrect: This is not correct because the presence or absence of promoters is not the main reason cDNA is used. Bacterial promoters can be included in the vector to ensure proper expression of the gene. The problem with genomic DNA is the presence of introns, not the promoters.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mg²+ because magnesium ions (Mg²+) are essential cofactors for DNA polymerases, such as Taq polymerase, which is commonly used in PCR. Mg²+ stabilizes the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA and is crucial for the enzymatic activity of DNA polymerase, enabling it to catalyze the addition of nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. The concentration of Mg²+ is critical, as too little can result in inefficient amplification, while too much can lead to non-specific amplification and primer dimer formation. Incorrect Options: (A) Na+ (Sodium ion) – Sodium ions are not required for the enzymatic activity of DNA polymerase in PCR. While they can influence DNA stability, they do not act as a cofactor for polymerase activity. Instead, Na+ is more relevant in processes like DNA hybridization, where it helps in stabilizing DNA duplexes. (B) Ca²+ (Calcium ion) – Calcium ions are not involved in PCR as a cofactor. Unlike Mg²+, they do not effectively support DNA polymerase activity and can even inhibit the reaction in high concentrations by interfering with enzyme function. (C) Li+ (Lithium ion) – Lithium ions do not play a role in PCR. They are sometimes used in laboratory buffers for RNA extraction but are not necessary for DNA polymerase function in PCR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) because ddNTPs lack a 3'-OH group, which is essential for DNA polymerase to add new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. In PCR, standard deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) are used, allowing continuous DNA elongation. However, ddNTPs are primarily used in Sanger sequencing, where they terminate DNA elongation due to the absence of the 3'-OH, leading to chain termination and DNA fragment generation for sequencing analysis. Since PCR requires continuous amplification rather than termination, ddNTPs are not included. Incorrect Options: (B) Deoxynucleotide (dNTP) – dNTPs (dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP) are essential substrates in PCR. They provide the building blocks for DNA synthesis, allowing the polymerase to extend the new DNA strand complementary to the template strand. (C) Template DNA – The DNA template contains the target sequence that needs to be amplified. Without a template, there would be no DNA for primers to bind to and no sequence to amplify. (D) Thermostable DNA polymerase – A thermostable DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, is necessary for PCR because it can withstand high temperatures during the denaturation step.

PCR's ability to selectively amplify specific DNA sequences makes it an essential tool in multiple fields, including genetics, microbiology, and forensic science. Explanation of Correct Options: (A) Amplification of gene – PCR is widely used to amplify specific gene sequences for various purposes, such as genetic research, mutation analysis, and cloning. By exponentially increasing the amount of DNA, PCR enables scientists to study genes in detail, detect genetic mutations, and prepare DNA for sequencing or further analysis. (B) Identification of organism – PCR is used in microbiology and infectious disease diagnostics to detect and identify microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. By targeting species-specific DNA sequences, PCR helps in rapid and accurate pathogen identification, which is crucial in medical diagnostics, epidemiology, and food safety. (C) Medicolegal cases – In forensic science, PCR is instrumental in analyzing biological evidence from crime scenes, such as blood, hair, or saliva samples. It allows forensic experts to amplify and analyze DNA profiles, aiding in criminal investigations, paternity testing, and disaster victim identification.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Construction → Denaturation → Annealing → Extension because PCR begins with the construction or setup of the reaction mixture, followed by the three main thermal cycling steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. These steps are repeated for multiple cycles to exponentially amplify the target DNA sequence. Explanation of Correct Sequence: Construction (Setup of Reaction Mixture) – Before the PCR process begins, all necessary components (template DNA, primers, deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), DNA polymerase, buffer, and Mg²+) are assembled in a reaction tube. This step ensures that the reaction mixture is prepared correctly for amplification. Denaturation (94–98°C) – The double-stranded DNA is heated to a high temperature to break the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands, resulting in single-stranded DNA templates for the next step. Annealing (50–65°C) – The reaction mixture is cooled to allow primers to bind (anneal) to their complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA. The exact temperature depends on the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers. Extension (72°C) – DNA polymerase (usually Taq polymerase) synthesizes the new DNA strand by adding dNTPs complementary to the template strand. This step occurs at the enzyme’s optimal temperature, ensuring efficient DNA elongation. Incorrect Options: (A) Denaturation → Construction → Extension → Annealing – Incorrect because the reaction setup (construction) occurs before the thermal cycling. Additionally, annealing should occur before extension to allow primers to bind to the template DNA. (C) Construction → Extension → Annealing → Denaturation – Incorrect because extension cannot occur before primer annealing or DNA denaturation. The single-stranded template must first be available for primer binding and polymerase activity. (D) Extension → Construction → Annealing → Denaturation – Incorrect because the reaction setup happens before any thermal cycling. Also, extension cannot precede denaturation and annealing, as these steps are necessary for primer binding and DNA polymerase function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) To know how much amplification has occurred because real-time PCR measures the amount of DNA being amplified during each cycle rather than just detecting the final product. This is achieved through fluorescence-based detection, which quantifies DNA amplification dynamically, making it useful in gene expression analysis, viral load measurement, and other applications requiring precise DNA quantification. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Multiplication of a specific segment of DNA – While real-time PCR does amplify DNA, its primary purpose is not just amplification but the ability to measure and quantify DNA in real time. Traditional PCR (end-point PCR) is used for amplification alone, whereas real-time PCR provides quantitative data throughout the process. (C) Multiplication of protein – PCR, including real-time PCR, does not multiply proteins. Proteins are synthesized through translation in cells, whereas PCR is a nucleic acid-based technique for amplifying DNA. Protein quantification is performed using different methods like Western blotting or ELISA. (D) Multiplication of RNA – Real-time PCR does not directly amplify RNA. However, in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), RNA is first converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase, which can then be amplified using real-time PCR. Thus, real-time PCR is used to measure DNA or cDNA levels, not directly for RNA multiplication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) because SNPs are single base-pair changes in the DNA sequence that occur commonly in the human genome. They are found approximately every 300–1000 base pairs and contribute to genetic diversity among individuals. SNPs can influence traits, disease susceptibility, and drug responses, making them important in personalized medicine, genetic research, and population studies. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Copy Number Variations (CNVs) – CNVs involve large segments of DNA that are duplicated or deleted, leading to variations in the number of copies of a particular gene. While CNVs play a role in genetic diversity and diseases, they are less frequent than SNPs. (B) Mutations – Mutations refer to any permanent changes in the DNA sequence, including point mutations, insertions, and deletions. While all SNPs are mutations, not all mutations are SNPs. SNPs are defined by their common occurrence in the population (<1% frequency), whereas most mutations are rarer and can be harmful or neutral. (C) Transposons – Transposons, or \"jumping genes,\" are DNA sequences that can move within the genome. While they contribute to genetic variation and evolution, they are not as frequent as SNPs in terms of small-scale sequence variations.",

Since sickle cell anemia results from a single nucleotide substitution (GAG ? GTG in the HBB gene), its detection requires methods that analyze DNA sequences rather than RNA. Northern blotting is unsuitable for identifying such mutations. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Southern blot analysis – Southern blotting is a DNA-based technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, including mutations like those in the beta-globin gene. It involves restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis, transfer to a membrane, and hybridization with a labeled probe. Although it is not the most sensitive method for detecting point mutations, it can be used in some cases. (C) PCR with allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization – This method is highly effective for detecting point mutations. PCR amplifies the beta-globin gene region, and allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes are used to hybridize specifically to either the normal or mutant sequence. This enables differentiation between normal, carrier (heterozygous), and affected (homozygous mutant) individuals. (D) DNA sequencing – DNA sequencing is the most definitive method for detecting point mutations. By directly reading the nucleotide sequence of the beta-globin gene, sequencing precisely identifies the sickle cell mutation (A →T transversion at codon 6). It is widely used in genetic diagnosis and research.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hybridization because DNA microarrays work by hybridizing labeled DNA or RNA samples to a grid of known DNA probes fixed on a solid surface. The degree of hybridization, or binding between the sample and the probe, indicates the presence or absence of specific mutations or gene expression levels. This allows for the analysis of thousands of genes simultaneously and is commonly used in genomics, cancer research, and gene expression studies. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cloning – Cloning refers to the process of creating identical copies of a gene or organism, which is not the mechanism used by DNA microarrays to detect gene mutations. While cloning is used in some genetic studies, it does not directly involve hybridization or mutation detection. (B) PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) – PCR is used for amplifying specific DNA sequences, but it does not provide the global detection capabilities of DNA microarrays. While PCR can be used to detect mutations in specific genes, DNA microarrays allow for simultaneous analysis of multiple genes and mutations across a genome. (D) Southern blotting – Southern blotting is a technique used for detecting specific DNA sequences and is typically used for analyzing DNA fragments, gene rearrangements, and mutations. However, it is less suited for large-scale gene mutation detection compared to DNA microarrays, which allow for high-throughput analysis of multiple genes at once.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) HPLC because High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a technique used to separate, identify, and quantify compounds in a sample, but it is not directly involved in epigenetics research. HPLC is mainly used in chemical analysis and purification, not specifically for analyzing epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation or histone modifications. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Bisulphite sequencing – Bisulphite sequencing is a technique used to study DNA methylation, a key epigenetic modification. In this method, DNA is treated with bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils, allowing the detection of methylated cytosines by sequencing. It is a cornerstone technique in epigenetics. (B) Methylation sensitive restriction enzyme digestion – This technique involves using restriction enzymes that cut DNA based on the methylation status of specific sites. It is commonly used to detect DNA methylation patterns and is highly relevant to epigenetics research. (D) ChIP on chip – Chromatin Immunoprecipitation on a microarray (ChIP on chip) is a method used to analyze protein-DNA interactions and study histone modifications, which are essential components of epigenetics. This method combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with microarray analysis to map the binding sites of proteins and study epigenetic modifications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Protein-DNA interaction and histone modification because ChIP allows researchers to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, such as transcription factors, and to study histone modifications that influence chromatin structure and gene expression. This technique is valuable for understanding gene regulation, chromatin remodeling, and the molecular basis of diseases like cancer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Amplify DNA – While PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is used to amplify DNA, ChIP is not intended for DNA amplification. ChIP is focused on identifying specific protein-DNA interactions and chromatin modifications rather than amplifying DNA. (B) Movement of protein – ChIP does not study the movement of proteins within the cell. It is used to study the binding of proteins to specific regions of DNA. Techniques like fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) are used to study protein movement within the nucleus. (D) Study mutations – ChIP is not used to study mutations directly. It is focused on investigating protein interactions and chromatin modifications, which may indirectly affect gene expression but does not involve direct mutation detection. Techniques like PCR, sequencing, or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to study genetic mutations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tay-Sachs disease because Tay-Sachs is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase A, and currently, there is no enzyme replacement therapy available for this disease. Tay-Sachs is a neurodegenerative condition, and while research into potential therapies continues, ERT is not yet an option for this particular disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Hurler syndrome – Hurler syndrome is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. Enzyme replacement therapy, such as idursulfase (Elaprase), is available for Hurler syndrome and can help manage symptoms and slow disease progression. (C) Gaucher’s disease – Gaucher's disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy, such as imiglucerase (Cerezyme) or velaglucerase alfa (Vpriv), is available and effective in treating Gaucher’s disease by replacing the deficient enzyme. (D) Pompe’s disease – Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy, such as alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme), is available and has significantly improved the prognosis for patients with Pompe disease, especially when started early.",
