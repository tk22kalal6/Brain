      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Not regulated because housekeeping genes are typically involved in essential processes, such as metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell structure maintenance, and are expressed at relatively stable levels in all cells under normal conditions. These genes are generally not subject to regulation or activation by external signals and are constitutively active. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Mutant – Housekeeping genes are not mutant. They are essential for normal cell function and are typically conserved across various organisms. Mutations in housekeeping genes often lead to severe dysfunction or death, as they are critical for basic cellular processes. (C) Inducible – Inducible genes are genes whose expression is increased in response to specific stimuli or conditions. Housekeeping genes are not inducible; they are expressed at stable, basal levels to support the normal cellular functions that are required constantly, regardless of external factors. (D) Required only when inducer is present – This describes inducible genes rather than housekeeping genes. Housekeeping genes are required continuously for fundamental cellular operations and do not rely on the presence of an inducer for their expression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Enhancer because enhancers are typically found at variable distances from the gene they regulate—either upstream or downstream of the gene or even within introns. They work by binding transcription factors and other proteins that facilitate or enhance the transcription of the gene, even though they may be far from the gene's coding region. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Operator – The operator is a regulatory sequence found in operons (in prokaryotes) that is located near the promoter, which controls access to the gene by the RNA polymerase. It is not located far from the coding region but rather close to the gene's promoter. (C) Promoter – The promoter is located immediately upstream of the coding region of a gene and serves as the binding site for RNA polymerase and transcription factors to initiate transcription. It is directly adjacent to the coding region, not away from it. (D) Structural gene – Structural genes code for proteins and are directly involved in the coding region of the gene.

These genes code for the enzymes beta-galactosidase (lacZ), lactose permease (lacY), and thiogalactoside transacetylase (lacA), which together allow the bacterium to utilize lactose as a carbon source when glucose is not available. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) 6 – The lac operon does not consist of six structural genes. This number is incorrect because only three structural genes are involved in the lac operon (lacZ, lacY, and lacA). (B) 5 – Similarly, five structural genes are not part of the lac operon.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Operator site because the operator site is the region where the lac repressor protein binds, blocking RNA polymerase from transcribing the downstream structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA). When lactose is not present, the repressor binds to the operator, preventing the initiation of transcription. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Promoter site – The promoter site is the region where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. It does not directly inhibit transcription but rather serves as the site where the transcription machinery assembles. Inhibition of transcription occurs only when the repressor binds to the operator, not the promoter. (C) CAP site – The CAP (catabolite activator protein) site is involved in activating transcription when glucose levels are low, and CAP binds to this site to promote transcription in the presence of lactose. It does not inhibit transcription. In fact, CAP enhances transcription when the repressor is not bound to the operator. (D) None of the above – This option is incorrect because the transcription inhibition in the lac operon is directly related to the repressor binding to the operator site, as explained in option (A).",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Inducer without glucose. In the lac operon, transcription is induced by the presence of an inducer (lactose or allolactose) in the absence of glucose. When lactose (or its isomer allolactose) is present, it binds to the repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator site. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the genes of the lac operon, leading to the production of proteins needed to metabolize lactose. This process occurs more efficiently when glucose is absent because the presence of glucose reduces the level of cAMP, which is needed to activate the CAP (Catabolite Activator Protein) for efficient transcription. Incorrect Options: A. Glucose with inducer – Incorrect While an inducer (lactose) can promote transcription, the presence of glucose inhibits the operon’s transcription. Glucose prevents the formation of cAMP, which is necessary for CAP activation. As a result, even with the inducer present, transcription is not fully activated in the presence of glucose. B. Glucose – Incorrect Glucose by itself does not induce transcription of the lac operon. In fact, glucose inhibits the operon by reducing cAMP levels, which prevents the activation of the CAP site. Without CAP activation, transcription of the operon is less efficient. D. Both glucose and lactose – Incorrect While lactose can induce transcription, glucose will inhibit it, as explained above. Thus, the combination of both is not conducive to strong activation of the lac operon.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Positive regulator. In the lac operon, CAP (Catabolite Activator Protein) is an example of a positive regulator. CAP, when bound to cAMP, binds to a specific site near the lac promoter and enhances the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, facilitating transcription of the lac operon. This action is a form of positive regulation because CAP enhances gene expression by helping RNA polymerase initiate transcription more efficiently. CAP is activated in the absence of glucose, and its role is crucial for the operon to be transcribed when lactose is available as the primary carbon source. Incorrect Options: A. Attenuation – Incorrect Attenuation refers to a regulatory mechanism that controls gene expression by causing premature termination of transcription. It is more commonly seen in certain bacterial operons (e.g., tryptophan operon), but it does not apply to the lac operon or CAP's role in it. B. Negative regulator – Incorrect A negative regulator typically represses gene expression, such as a repressor protein binding to the operator site to inhibit transcription. While the lac repressor is a negative regulator, CAP is a positive regulator, not a negative one. D. Constitutive expression – Incorrect Constitutive expression refers to genes that are expressed continuously, regardless of environmental signals. The lac operon is not constitutively expressed; it is regulated based on the presence of lactose and the absence of glucose, meaning its expression is inducible, not constitutive.",

Abnormal patterns of DNA methylation, such as hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes, are frequently observed in various cancers, making option E incorrect. Incorrect Options: A. Can alter gene expression pattern in cells – Correct DNA methylation can influence gene expression by silencing genes. Methylation of promoter regions typically leads to gene silencing by preventing the binding of transcription factors or other regulatory proteins. Thus, it directly alters the gene expression pattern in cells. B. Role in genomic imprinting – Correct DNA methylation plays a key role in genomic imprinting, a process where certain genes are expressed depending on their parental origin. In this process, methylation marks are placed on one allele (either maternal or paternal) to regulate its expression. This methylation pattern is inherited through generations. C. Essential for normal development – Correct DNA methylation is essential for normal development. It regulates various processes, including X-chromosome inactivation in females, genomic imprinting, and the differentiation of stem cells. Disruptions in DNA methylation can lead to developmental disorders. D. Usually occurs in cytosine – Correct DNA methylation predominantly occurs at the cytosine residues, especially in a CpG dinucleotide context. Methylation of the 5th carbon of cytosine leads to 5-methylcytosine, which is a common epigenetic modification regulating gene expression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Decrease gene expression. DNA methylation, particularly at cytosine residues in CpG islands, is a key epigenetic modification that silences gene expression. This process occurs when a methyl group (-CH3) is added to the 5th carbon of cytosine by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), converting it to 5-methylcytosine. Methylation of promoter regions prevents the binding of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, thereby reducing or completely inhibiting transcription. This mechanism is crucial for gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. Incorrect Options: A. No change – Incorrect Methylation significantly impacts gene expression and is not a neutral modification. It plays a key role in development, differentiation, and disease by turning genes on or off. Therefore, stating that methylation causes \"no change\" is incorrect. B. Mutation – Incorrect While DNA methylation does not directly cause mutations, deamination of 5-methylcytosine can lead to mutations. Methylated cytosine can spontaneously deaminate to thymine, leading to a C→T transition mutation, but this is a secondary effect rather than a direct result of methylation. D. Increase gene expression – Incorrect DNA methylation primarily silences gene expression, especially when it occurs in promoter regions. In contrast, demethylation is typically associated with increased gene expression. Some exceptions exist where methylation activates genes, but these cases are rare and context-dependent.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Increased euchromatin formation. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic modification where acetyl groups (-COCH3) are added to lysine residues of histone proteins by histone acetyltransferases (HATs). This process reduces the positive charge on histones, leading to a weaker interaction with negatively charged DNA. As a result, the chromatin structure becomes less compact (euchromatin), making DNA more accessible for transcription factors and RNA polymerase, thereby promoting gene expression. Euchromatin is the active, loosely packed form of chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is tightly packed and transcriptionally inactive. Since histone acetylation leads to chromatin relaxation, it facilitates the conversion of heterochromatin into euchromatin, thus increasing gene expression. Incorrect Options: A. Methylation of cytosine – Incorrect Histone acetylation and DNA methylation are separate epigenetic mechanisms. Methylation of cytosine in CpG islands is associated with gene silencing, while histone acetylation is linked to gene activation. They are often inversely related. B. DNA replication – Incorrect Histone acetylation is primarily involved in gene expression regulation rather than DNA replication. Though open chromatin may facilitate replication, acetylation does not directly trigger DNA replication. C. Increased heterochromatin formation – Incorrect Heterochromatin is the highly condensed form of chromatin, typically transcriptionally inactive. Histone deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs) leads to heterochromatin formation, while acetylation promotes euchromatin formation. Thus, this statement is incorrect.",
