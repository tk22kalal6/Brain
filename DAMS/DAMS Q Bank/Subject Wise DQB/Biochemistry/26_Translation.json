      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A codon consists of three consecutive nucleotide units (Option D) in an mRNA sequence that specify a particular amino acid during protein synthesis. This triplet code is fundamental to the genetic code, with each codon corresponding to a specific amino acid or a stop signal. The sequence of codons in mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain. The concept of the triplet codon was established through experimental evidence, showing that the genetic code is non-overlapping and read in groups of three nucleotides, ensuring accurate protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Four individual nucleotides – This is incorrect because a codon is specifically composed of three nucleotides, not four. The genetic code follows a triplet rule, where each amino acid is coded by a set of three nucleotides. If codons were made up of four nucleotides, the number of possible codons would increase significantly, which does not align with the observed genetic coding system. Option B: Two complementary base pairs – This is incorrect because codons are sequences of nucleotides in a single-stranded mRNA molecule, not paired bases. Base pairing occurs in double-stranded DNA or during tRNA-mRNA interactions, but the codon itself is a linear sequence of three nucleotides, not a pair of bases. Option C: One molecule of amino acyl t-RNA – This is incorrect because a codon is a unit of genetic code within the mRNA, whereas an aminoacyl tRNA is a molecule that carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome during translation. While tRNA recognizes codons through its anticodon sequence, a codon itself is purely a sequence of three nucleotides in mRNA and does not constitute a tRNA molecule.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 256 This is because there are four different nucleotides (A, U, G, and C in RNA or A, T, G, and C in DNA). If a sequence of 4 nucleotides codes for one amino acid, the total number of possible unique combinations can be calculated using the formula 44, where n is the length of the sequence. Since the sequence length is 4, the total number of possible combinations is 44 = 256. Each of these unique combinations could theoretically correspond to a different amino acid, meaning the maximum number of possible amino acids that could be encoded is 256. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) 4 – This answer is incorrect because it assumes that only four amino acids can be coded. However, with four nucleotide choices per position and a four-nucleotide sequence, the number of combinations is much greater than just 4. B) 16 – This option likely assumes that a two-nucleotide sequence determines the amino acid (4² = 16). However, the problem states that a four-nucleotide sequence codes for an amino acid, so this calculation underestimates the possible combinations. C) 64 – This number comes from the standard genetic code, where triplets of nucleotides (codons) code for amino acids (4³ = 64). However, in this case, the question specifies a four-nucleotide sequence per amino acid, leading to a total of 44 = 256 possible amino acids instead of 64.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The wobble hypothesis explains how a single tRNA molecule can recognize multiple codons that differ in their third nucleotide position. This flexibility occurs because the 5' end of the anticodon (Option B) in tRNA can form non-standard base pairs with the 3' end of the codon in mRNA. This means that a single tRNA does not need a perfect match for the third nucleotide of the codon, allowing for redundancy in the genetic code. This phenomenon enhances efficiency by reducing the number of tRNA molecules required to translate all 61 sense codons. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: tRNA – This is incorrect because, while the wobble hypothesis involves tRNA, the key concept is specific to the 5' end of the anticodon rather than tRNA as a whole. The anticodon of tRNA is responsible for recognizing codons in mRNA, and the wobble position specifically refers to its 5' end. Option C: 3’ end of anticodon – This is incorrect because the wobble position is at the 5' end of the anticodon, not the 3' end. The base at the 5' end of the anticodon pairs with the third base (3' end) of the codon, which allows for non-standard pairing, enabling tRNA flexibility. Option D: mRNA – This is incorrect because wobble base pairing occurs in the anticodon of tRNA, not mRNA. While mRNA contains codons that specify amino acids, the ability to recognize multiple codons arises from the anticodon’s flexibility at its 5' end, not from the codon itself.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The genetic code is not punctuated (Option D), meaning that there are no special signals or \"gaps\" between codons. Once translation begins, the ribosome reads the mRNA sequence continuously in groups of three nucleotides (codons) without any internal punctuation marks to separate codons. This ensures an uninterrupted translation process, where the reading frame is maintained from the start codon until a stop codon is reached. If the genetic code were punctuated, specific signals would indicate where one codon ends and the next begins, but instead, codons are read sequentially without any separators. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Universal – This is incorrect because the genetic code is largely universal across all known organisms, from bacteria to humans. This means that the same codon specifies the same amino acid in almost all living systems, with only a few rare exceptions (e.g., in mitochondria and some protists). Option B: Degenerate – This is incorrect because the genetic code is degenerate, meaning that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. For example, leucine is encoded by six different codons (CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG, UUA, UUG). This redundancy helps minimize the effects of mutations, as changes in the third nucleotide of a codon often do not alter the amino acid sequence. Option C: Non-overlapping – This is incorrect because the genetic code is non-overlapping, meaning that each nucleotide is part of only one codon and is read only once during translation. If the code were overlapping, a single nucleotide would be part of multiple codons, leading to a completely different set of amino acid sequences. Instead, the ribosome reads mRNA in a strictly linear fashion, three nucleotides at a time.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The genetic code is said to be degenerate because there are 64 possible codons (4³ = 64) but only 20 amino acids. This means that multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. For example, leucine is encoded by six different codons (CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG, UUA, UUG). This redundancy serves as a protective mechanism, reducing the effects of point mutations since a change in the third nucleotide of a codon often does not alter the amino acid being incorporated into a protein. The degeneracy of the genetic code is a crucial feature that ensures robustness in protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Mutation – This is incorrect because mutation refers to any change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA. While degeneracy can help buffer against certain mutations (especially in the third codon position), the concept of degeneracy itself is not a type of mutation. Option B: Frame shift – This is incorrect because frameshift mutations occur when nucleotides are inserted or deleted from the genetic sequence in numbers not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame and alters the entire amino acid sequence downstream. Degeneracy, on the other hand, refers to multiple codons coding for the same amino acid and is unrelated to frameshift mutations. Option C: Transcription – This is incorrect because transcription is the process where genetic information from DNA is copied into mRNA. While transcription is necessary for protein synthesis, it is not related to the redundancy of codons in the genetic code. Degeneracy specifically refers to how codons are used to specify amino acids.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ribosomes are the primary cellular components responsible for protein synthesis. They function as molecular machines that translate messenger RNA (mRNA) into polypeptide chains by facilitating the binding of transfer RNA (tRNA) and catalyzing peptide bond formation. Ribosomes consist of two subunits (large and small) and can be free-floating in the cytoplasm (producing proteins for intracellular use) or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (producing proteins for secretion or membrane insertion). Ribosomes are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, highlighting their universal role in protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B: Mitochondria – This is incorrect because mitochondria are primarily involved in energy production (ATP synthesis) through oxidative phosphorylation, not direct protein synthesis. However, mitochondria do contain their own ribosomes (mitochondrial ribosomes) and synthesize some of their own proteins, but the majority of cellular protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasmic ribosomes. Option C: Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) – This is incorrect because the RER itself does not synthesize proteins, but it provides a surface where ribosomes attach to facilitate the synthesis of proteins destined for secretion, lysosomes, or membrane incorporation. The ribosomes, not the RER, are the actual site of protein synthesis. Option D: Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) – This is incorrect because the SER is involved in lipid metabolism, detoxification, and calcium storage, not protein synthesis. Unlike the RER, the SER lacks ribosomes and does not play a direct role in translating mRNA into proteins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Peptidyl transferase is the key enzyme responsible for forming peptide bonds between amino acids during protein synthesis. It is a ribozymal activity (catalyzed by ribosomal RNA, not a protein) found in the large ribosomal subunit (50S in prokaryotes and 60S in eukaryotes). During translation, peptidyl transferase catalyzes the transfer of the growing polypeptide chain from the P-site tRNA to the amino acid carried by the A-site tRNA, elongating the protein chain. This enzymatic function is essential for protein synthesis and occurs in the ribosome, the main site of translation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Peptidase – This is incorrect because peptidases (proteases) are enzymes that break down proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids, rather than synthesizing them. Peptidases function in digestion, protein degradation, and cellular regulation, but they do not play a role in building proteins. Option C: DNA polymerase – This is incorrect because DNA polymerase is responsible for DNA replication, not protein synthesis. It catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand during cell division, ensuring genetic information is copied accurately. It has no role in translation or protein formation. Option D: DNA helicase – This is incorrect because DNA helicase is an enzyme that unwinds the DNA double helix during replication and transcription. While transcription (mRNA synthesis) is a prerequisite for translation, helicase itself does not participate in protein synthesis directly. Option E: DNA ligase – This is incorrect because DNA ligase is an enzyme that joins DNA fragments together, particularly during DNA replication and repair. It plays no role in translation or protein synthesis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) N-formyl methionine is the first tRNA to come into action, which is false for eukaryotic protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, the first amino acid incorporated into a newly synthesized polypeptide chain is methionine (Met), not N-formyl methionine (fMet). fMet is used only in prokaryotic translation as the initiator amino acid. In eukaryotes, the initiation is carried out by Met-tRNAI (initiator tRNA bound to methionine), which binds to the P-site of the ribosome during translation initiation. This fundamental difference distinguishes eukaryotic translation from prokaryotic translation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: mRNA read from 5’ to 3’ – This is correct because mRNA is always read from 5’ to 3’ direction during translation. Ribosomes move along the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and codons are read in this orientation. Translation occurs in this direction to ensure proper decoding and polypeptide formation. Option B: eIF-2 shifts between GDP to GTP – This is correct and therefore not false. Eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) is a critical protein in translation initiation. It forms a ternary complex with GTP and initiator Met-tRNAI, facilitating its binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. After delivering the tRNA, eIF-2 hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, becoming inactive. For another round of translation initiation, eIF-2 must be reactivated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (eIF-2B), which replaces GDP with GTP. Option C: Capping helps in attachment of mRNA to 40S ribosome – This is correct and therefore not false. The 5' cap (7-methylguanosine cap) on eukaryotic mRNA is essential for ribosomal recognition and translation initiation. The cap-binding complex (CBC) and eIF-4E help recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA, ensuring proper initiation of translation. This process stabilizes mRNA and enhances translation efficiency in eukaryotic cells.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Identification of the 5’ cap of mRNA by eIF-4E is the rate-limiting step. In eukaryotic translation initiation, the 5' cap (7-methylguanosine cap) of mRNA is recognized by eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E). This recognition is the rate-limiting step in translation because it ensures proper ribosomal attachment and scanning for the start codon. eIF-4E is part of the eIF-4F complex, which helps recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. Since translation initiation is tightly regulated, the availability and activity of eIF-4E play a crucial role in controlling overall protein synthesis rates. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B: EF-2 shuttles between ADP and ATP – This is incorrect because elongation factor-2 (EF-2) shuttles between GDP and GTP, not ADP and ATP. EF-2 is essential for the translocation step in elongation, where it helps move the ribosome along the mRNA. It binds GTP during activation, and after translocation, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, inactivating EF-2 until it is recharged with GTP. Option C: Eukaryotic ribosomes are smaller than prokaryotic ribosomes – This is incorrect because eukaryotic ribosomes (80S) are larger than prokaryotic ribosomes (70S). Eukaryotic ribosomes consist of a 60S large subunit and a 40S small subunit, while prokaryotic ribosomes consist of 50S and 30S subunits. The increased size of eukaryotic ribosomes reflects their higher complexity and additional regulatory factors involved in translation. Option D: N-formyl methionine is the precursor of eukaryotic polypeptide synthesis – This is incorrect because eukaryotic translation begins with methionine (Met), not N-formyl methionine (fMet). fMet is used only in prokaryotic translation, where it serves as the first amino acid in newly synthesized proteins. In eukaryotes, the initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAIMET) delivers methionine to the ribosome without any formylation, distinguishing eukaryotic translation from prokaryotic translation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Attachment of the amino group to the 5’ end of tRNA, which is false for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. In reality, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes the attachment of amino acids to the 3’ end of tRNA, not the 5’ end. Specifically, the amino acid is attached to the 3’-OH group of the terminal adenine (A) nucleotide at the CCA sequence of the tRNA. This linkage forms an aminoacyl-tRNA, which is essential for translation, as it ensures that the correct amino acid is delivered to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Implement genetic code – This is correct and therefore not false. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are responsible for implementing the genetic code by ensuring that each tRNA is charged with the correct amino acid corresponding to its anticodon. This specificity is crucial for accurate translation, as any error in amino acid attachment could lead to the incorporation of the wrong amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain. Option B: Editing function – This is correct and therefore not false. Many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have a proofreading (editing) function to prevent errors in amino acid attachment. If an incorrect amino acid is mistakenly activated and linked to tRNA, the enzyme hydrolyzes and removes the mischarged amino acid before releasing the tRNA. This editing function enhances translational fidelity and prevents incorporation of incorrect amino acids into proteins. Option C: Is accepting tRNA – This is correct and therefore not false. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize and bind to their specific tRNA molecules, ensuring that the correct amino acid is attached to the corresponding tRNA. Each synthetase has a highly specific binding pocket that recognizes the structural and sequence elements of its tRNA substrate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hydroxyproline, as it is not directly linked to aminoacyl-tRNA. Aminoacyl-tRNA is essential for the incorporation of amino acids into polypeptides during translation. However, hydroxyproline is a post-translational modification of proline, where a hydroxyl group (-OH) is added to the proline side chain, typically in collagen. This modification occurs after protein synthesis, so hydroxyproline does not require a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA for its incorporation during translation. Proline, on the other hand, is incorporated via proline-tRNA during translation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Methionine – This is incorrect because methionine (Met) requires aminoacyl-tRNA for incorporation into proteins. Methionine-tRNA? is the initiator tRNA that brings methionine to the ribosome for the start of protein synthesis. Methionine is also used in the elongation process, though it is modified to form formyl-methionine (fMet) in prokaryotes. Option B: Lysine – This is incorrect because lysine also requires aminoacyl-tRNA for its incorporation into proteins. Lysine-tRNA specifically recognizes the codons for lysine and ensures the correct incorporation of lysine during translation. Option D: Cysteine – This is incorrect because cysteine also requires aminoacyl-tRNA for incorporation into proteins. Cysteine-tRNA recognizes the codon for cysteine and is charged with the amino acid cysteine before entering the ribosome for translation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues, which is an example of post-translational modification. γ-carboxylation involves the addition of a carboxyl group (-COOH) to the glutamate residues in proteins, a process essential for activating certain proteins like clotting factors (e.g., prothrombin). This modification typically occurs after translation and is crucial for the protein's function, particularly in blood coagulation. The process is catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: N-Glycosylation of proteins – This is incorrect because N-glycosylation is a co-translational modification, not a post-translational one. It occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) while the protein is still being synthesized, specifically during its translocation into the ER. In N-glycosylation, a sugar moiety is attached to the nitrogen atom of asparagine residues within the protein. Option B: 7-methyl guanosine capping – This is incorrect because 7-methyl guanosine capping is a post-transcriptional modification, not post-translational. It occurs on the 5' end of the nascent mRNA molecule shortly after transcription to protect the mRNA from degradation and aid in ribosomal recognition during translation. Option C: Poly A tail addition – This is incorrect because poly-A tail addition is a post-transcriptional modification as well. It involves the addition of a string of adenine nucleotides to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule, which is important for mRNA stability, transport, and translation initiation. It occurs after transcription but is not related to translation.",
