      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Glucokinase The enzyme defect in this scenario is glucokinase, which is commonly associated with a condition called Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), specifically MODY2. Glucokinase acts as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta cells and plays a critical role in glucose metabolism by phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the first step of glycolysis. Mutations in the glucokinase gene reduce its activity, leading to a higher threshold for insulin secretion in response to glucose. As a result, blood glucose levels remain elevated. In pregnancy, the metabolic demand increases, and insulin resistance typically rises. Women with a glucokinase mutation may develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) due to the inability of the pancreas to compensate adequately. After pregnancy, insulin sensitivity normalizes, and blood glucose levels may return to normal. The familial history of hyperglycemia in the mother and sister is consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of MODY. Incorrect Options: (B) Phosphofructokinase (PFK) PFK is a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. While PFK defects can cause metabolic disturbances, they are not linked to MODY or gestational diabetes. PFK mutations more commonly lead to conditions such as glycogen storage diseases (e.g., Tarui disease) and are not characterized by transient hyperglycemia in pregnancy. (C) Aldolase Aldolase catalyzes the cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in glycolysis. Defects in aldolase are rare and associated with conditions such as hereditary fructose intolerance, which does not cause hyperglycemia or gestational diabetes. (D) Enolase Enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in glycolysis. Enolase mutations are not known to cause hyperglycemia or gestational diabetes. Disorders associated with enolase defects are extremely rare and unrelated to the symptoms described in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 4 The Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) consists of a series of enzymatic reactions that generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are four dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle, each responsible for oxidizing substrates and reducing electron carriers like NAD+ or FAD to NADH or FADH2, which are then used in the electron transport chain for ATP production. The dehydrogenases are: Isocitrate dehydrogenase: Catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, reducing NAD+ to NADH. Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase: Catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, with another molecule of NADH produced. Succinate dehydrogenase: Converts succinate to fumarate while reducing FAD to FADH2. This enzyme is also part of the electron transport chain (Complex II). Malate dehydrogenase: Catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, producing NADH. These four dehydrogenases are critical for the transfer of electrons to NAD+ and FAD, which are essential for ATP synthesis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Glycogen In anaerobic metabolism, glycogen is broken down into glucose-1-phosphate through glycogenolysis. Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which directly enters the glycolytic pathway without requiring ATP for phosphorylation (unlike free glucose). In glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphate is metabolized to produce 2 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of lactate per molecule of glucose under anaerobic conditions. Since the initial step of ATP investment is bypassed during glycogenolysis, an additional ATP is saved, resulting in a net gain of 3 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose derived from glycogen during anaerobic metabolism. Incorrect Options: (A) Glucose In anaerobic glycolysis, glucose yields a net of 2 ATP molecules because 2 ATP are consumed in the initial phosphorylation steps (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase), and 4 ATP are produced in subsequent steps. Unlike glycogen, free glucose requires ATP for activation, so it does not yield 3 ATP molecules. (B) Galactose Galactose enters glycolysis after conversion to glucose-1-phosphate (via the Leloir pathway). While it can be metabolized under anaerobic conditions, it also requires ATP for activation during its initial conversion steps, ultimately yielding a net of 2 ATP molecules, similar to free glucose. (D) Amino acids Amino acids do not directly enter glycolysis or anaerobic metabolism. They are instead metabolized via gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle, or other pathways depending on the specific amino acid. Anaerobic metabolism of amino acids does not occur in the same manner as glucose or glycogen, and they do not produce 3 ATP molecules in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 In the brain, glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and into neurons is mediated primarily by GLUT1 and GLUT3, which are specialized glucose transporter proteins. GLUT1 is found on the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier and facilitates glucose entry from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is essential for basal glucose uptake to maintain brain metabolism. GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it efficiently transports glucose into cells due to its high affinity for glucose, even at low concentrations. This ensures a continuous supply of glucose for neuronal function. In this case, the patient's CSF glucose of 30 mg/dL (with a CSF/plasma glucose ratio of 0.4) indicates hypoglycorrhachia, which is often associated with infections like bacterial meningitis or other pathologies affecting glucose metabolism or transport. GLUT1 and GLUT3 are crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the brain. Incorrect Options: (A) GLUT1 and GLUT2 GLUT2 is not significantly involved in glucose transport in the brain. GLUT2 has a low affinity for glucose and is mainly expressed in the liver, pancreas, kidney, and intestinal cells, where it plays a role in glucose sensing and transport in high-glucose environments. (B) GLUT3 and GLUT4 GLUT4 is an insulin-dependent glucose transporter primarily found in muscle and adipose tissue, not in the brain. Its activity is regulated by insulin, and it does not contribute to glucose transport across the BBB or into neurons. (C) GLUT2 and GLUT3 As noted above, GLUT2 is not a major glucose transporter in the brain. GLUT3 is relevant for neuronal glucose uptake, but GLUT2 is not involved in glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Succinate thiokinase Succinate thiokinase, also known as succinyl-CoA synthetase, is the enzyme responsible for substrate-level phosphorylation in the TCA (Krebs) cycle. This reaction involves the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, coupled with the phosphorylation of GDP (in some cells, ADP) to GTP (or ATP). Substrate-level phosphorylation is a direct synthesis of a high-energy phosphate compound (like ATP or GTP) from a substrate without involving the electron transport chain. This reaction is crucial because it generates GTP (or ATP), providing a direct energy yield within the TCA cycle itself. It represents one of the few steps in cellular respiration where ATP/GTP is produced without oxidative phosphorylation. Incorrect Options: (A) Fumarase Fumarase catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to malate in the TCA cycle. This is not a substrate-level phosphorylation reaction; it is simply a hydration step that prepares malate for subsequent oxidation. Therefore, fumarase does not contribute to ATP or GTP formation directly. (B) Succinate dehydrogenase Succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, reducing FAD to FADH2 in the process. While this reaction is important for transferring electrons to the electron transport chain, it does not involve substrate-level phosphorylation or the direct synthesis of ATP or GTP. (D) Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, generating NADH. Although this reaction is critical for energy metabolism, it does not involve direct ATP or GTP production through substrate-level phosphorylation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phosphofructokinase I During fasting, the activity of phosphofructokinase I (PFK-1) decreases because it is a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, a pathway used to metabolize glucose for energy. Fasting is characterized by low blood glucose levels, leading to reduced insulin and increased glucagon secretion. This hormonal shift promotes gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycolysis. PFK-1 is allosterically regulated and is inhibited by high levels of ATP and citrate, both of which are elevated during fasting due to increased fat metabolism and decreased glucose utilization. Additionally, the decreased concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), a potent activator of PFK-1, further suppresses its activity. This ensures that glucose is conserved for essential tissues like the brain and red blood cells, rather than being used for energy production via glycolysis. Incorrect Options: (A) Hormone-sensitive lipase Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity increases during fasting due to the rise in glucagon and catecholamines, which stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue. HSL breaks down stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, providing energy substrates for peripheral tissues during fasting. (B) Glycogen phosphorylase Glycogen phosphorylase activity also increases during fasting. This enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate in the liver, a critical step in maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting. It is activated by glucagon and epinephrine. (C) Glucose-6-phosphatase Glucose-6-phosphatase activity increases during fasting because it is essential for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Adipose tissue Insulin-dependent glucose transport occurs in adipose tissue through the action of the glucose transporter protein GLUT4, which is regulated by insulin. When insulin binds to its receptor on adipocytes, it triggers a signaling cascade that causes GLUT4-containing vesicles to move to the cell membrane. GLUT4 then facilitates the uptake of glucose into adipose tissue for storage as triglycerides or conversion into other metabolites. This mechanism ensures that glucose is efficiently cleared from the bloodstream in response to insulin and stored in tissues like adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Incorrect Options: (A) Kidney Glucose transport in the kidney occurs primarily via GLUT2 and SGLTs (sodium-glucose transporters), which are not insulin-dependent. These transporters are responsible for glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules. Kidney glucose transport is independent of insulin and instead relies on concentration gradients and sodium co-transport mechanisms. (C) Liver In the liver, glucose transport is mediated by GLUT2, which is also insulin-independent. GLUT2 allows bidirectional transport of glucose, enabling the liver to take up glucose for glycogenesis during the fed state and release glucose during fasting through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. (D) Brain Glucose transport in the brain occurs through GLUT1 and GLUT3, which are also insulin-independent. GLUT1 is present in endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, while GLUT3 is found in neurons. These transporters have a high affinity for glucose, ensuring a constant supply of glucose to the brain, regardless of insulin levels.",

It is primarily composed of repeating disaccharide units of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Unlike other mucopolysaccharides, which contain acidic sugars (such as glucuronic acid or iduronic acid), keratan sulfate consists of neutral sugars and does not contribute any negative charge from an acidic sugar. Incorrect Options: (A) Chondroitin sulfate Chondroitin sulfate contains glucuronic acid or iduronic acid as its acidic sugar. These acidic sugars give chondroitin sulfate its characteristic negative charge, which is important for its role in cartilage, bone, and connective tissue. (C) Dermatan sulfate Dermatan sulfate contains iduronic acid as its acidic sugar. This sugar contributes to its negative charge and plays a role in the structure of the extracellular matrix, particularly in skin and blood vessels.

This sugar is a key component of the H antigen, which serves as a precursor for the A and B blood group antigens. The fucose residue is attached to the oligosaccharide chain on the surface of RBCs, and its presence or absence is crucial for determining blood type. In the ABO blood system, the addition of either N-acetylgalactosamine (for type A) or galactose (for type B) to the fucose-containing structure results in the respective blood group antigen. Incorrect Options: (B) Xylulose Xylulose is a sugar involved in metabolism, particularly in the pentose phosphate pathway, but it is not part of the carbohydrate moiety of the antigen-recognizing site in RBCs for blood grouping. Therefore, it does not play a role in the ABO blood group antigens. (C) Arabinose Arabinose is a sugar component that can be found in some polysaccharides and certain plant structures, but it is not involved in the carbohydrate moiety of the antigen-recognizing site for blood grouping.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C,E) (C) Sucrose and (E) Trehalose Sucrose and trehalose are non-reducing sugars because both have no free aldehyde or ketone group available for reduction. Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose linked via their reducing ends (Alpha-1,2-glycosidic bond). This linkage prevents the free aldehyde or ketone group from being available for reduction, making sucrose a non-reducing sugar. Trehalose is a disaccharide made of two glucose molecules linked by an Alpha-1,1-glycosidic bond. This bond also prevents any free reducing group, making trehalose a non-reducing sugar. Incorrect Options: (A) Glucose Glucose is a reducing sugar because it has a free aldehyde group in its open-chain form, which can participate in redox reactions, reducing other compounds. The free aldehyde group makes glucose capable of acting as a reducing agent. (B) Isomaltose Isomaltose is a reducing sugar because it has a free reducing group on one of the glucose molecules, specifically the anomeric carbon of the second glucose unit. It can participate in redox reactions, reducing other compounds, making it a reducing sugar. (D) Galactose Galactose is a reducing sugar because it, like glucose, has a free aldehyde group in its open-chain form, capable of participating in redox reactions. Therefore, galactose can act as a reducing agent in chemical reactions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Alpha-ketoglutarate is a five-carbon molecule Alpha-ketoglutarate is indeed a five-carbon molecule in the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle). It is formed from the decarboxylation of isocitrate by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase, and it plays a crucial role in energy production by being further converted to succinyl-CoA, which eventually leads to ATP production through substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. Incorrect Options: (A) Pyruvate condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate This statement is incorrect because pyruvate does not directly condense with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Pyruvate first undergoes decarboxylation by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase to form acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA then combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme citrate synthase. Therefore, the direct condensation between pyruvate and oxaloacetate does not occur. (C) Oxidative phosphorylation occurs within the cytoplasm This is incorrect. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondria, specifically in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process involves the electron transport chain and ATP synthase, which generate ATP by utilizing the electrons from NADH and FADH2 produced in the Krebs cycle. (D) Krebs cycle functions under anaerobic conditions This is incorrect. The Krebs cycle requires oxygen indirectly because it relies on the electron transport chain to regenerate NAD+ and FAD for continued function. While the cycle itself does not consume oxygen, it requires the presence of oxygen for the electron transport chain to function, which is critical for the regeneration of NAD+ and FAD.",

NADPH generated here is critical for anabolic reactions, including fatty acid synthesis and the reduction of glutathione to protect cells from oxidative stress. This is a key reaction in maintaining the cellular redox balance. Incorrect Options: (A) LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) LDH catalyzes the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate, using NADH or NAD+ as the cofactor. It does not generate NADPH; instead, it involves the reduction of NAD+ to NADH or the oxidation of NADH to NAD+, depending on the direction of the reaction. (C) G3PD (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) G3PD is involved in glycolysis, where it catalyzes the conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, generating NADH (not NADPH). NADH is used in the electron transport chain for ATP production, not for biosynthetic pathways that require NADPH.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glucose-6-Phosphate Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is a key metabolite that plays a central role in glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis: In glycogenolysis, G6P is generated from the breakdown of glycogen by the action of glycogen phosphorylase. In glycolysis, G6P is converted to pyruvate, generating ATP in the process. In gluconeogenesis, G6P is converted to glucose by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is a key step in the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. Thus, G6P acts as a pivotal metabolite linking multiple metabolic pathways. Incorrect Options: (A) Galactose-1-phosphate Galactose-1-phosphate is involved in galactose metabolism, where it is converted to UDP-galactose. However, it does not directly participate in glycogenolysis, glycolysis, or gluconeogenesis. It is mainly involved in the galactose pathway, which ultimately enters glycolysis after conversion to glucose-6-phosphate, but it does not interact with the three pathways listed directly. (C) Uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPG) UDPG is involved in the synthesis of glycogen, not directly in glycogenolysis, glycolysis, or gluconeogenesis. It is used to transfer glucose units to the growing glycogen chain during glycogen synthesis but does not act in the pathways that break down glycogen, produce ATP from glucose, or synthesize glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. (D) Fructose-6-phosphate Fructose-6-phosphate is an important intermediate in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, but it is not directly involved in glycogenolysis. In glycolysis, it is converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and in gluconeogenesis, it is converted to glucose-6-phosphate. However, it does not directly participate in glycogen breakdown, making it less central to the three processes in question compared to glucose-6-phosphate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lactate In anaerobic glycolysis, glucose is metabolized to lactate (lactic acid) as the final product. Under anaerobic conditions, the process of glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and results in the conversion of glucose to pyruvate. However, because oxygen is not available to allow for oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain to function, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This process regenerates NAD+, which is essential for the continuation of glycolysis. Incorrect Options: (A) Pyruvate Pyruvate is an intermediate product in glycolysis, and under aerobic conditions, it is further metabolized to acetyl-CoA for entry into the Krebs cycle. However, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate does not accumulate as the final product but instead is converted to lactate to prevent the buildup of NADH and ensure continued glycolysis. (B) Acetyl CoA Acetyl CoA is produced from pyruvate under aerobic conditions and enters the Krebs cycle for ATP production. However, in anaerobic glycolysis, acetyl-CoA is not formed because pyruvate is converted to lactate instead of being transported into the mitochondria for further oxidation. (D) Oxaloacetate Oxaloacetate is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, not a product of glycolysis. It can be involved in gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose) but is not a product of anaerobic glycolysis, where the final product is lactate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Biotin is required- Pyruvate carboxylase functions as a tetramer composed of four identical subunits, and each subunit consists of four domains . The biotin carboxylase domain (BC) catalyzes the formation of carboxyphosphate and the subsequent attachment of CO 2 to the second domain, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), the site of the covalently attached biotin. Once bound to CO 2, BCCP leaves the biotin carboxylase active site and swings almost the entire length of the subunit ( <75Å) to the active site of the pyruvate carboxylase domain (PC), which transfers the CO 2 to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. BCCP in one subunit interacts with the active sites on an adjacent subunit. The fourth domain (PT) facilitates the formation of the tetramer. A. Biotin is coenzyme for pyruvate carboxylase involved in 1st step. B. Glucagon is an inhibitor-glucagon promotes gluconeogenesis C. Lactate is essential intermediate-lactate can be a starting substrate for gluconeogenesis but is essentially not an intermediate. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phosphofructokinase (phosphofructokinase-1) occupies a key position in regulating glycolysis and is also subject to feedback control. It is inhibited by citrate and by normal intracellular concentrations of ATP and is activated by 5' AMP. AMP- Phosphofructokinase (phosphofructokinase-1) occupies a key position in regulating glycolysis and is also subject to feedback control. It is activated by 5' AMP. At the normal intracellular [ATP] the enzyme is about 90% inhibited; this inhibition is reversed by 5'AMP. 5' AMP acts as an indicator of the energy status of the cell. The presence of adenylyl kinase in liver and many other tissues allows rapid equilibration of the reaction 2ADP 2ADP → ATP + AMP Thus, when ATP is used in energy-requiring processes, resulting in formation of ADP, [AMP] increases. A relatively small decrease in [ATP] causes a several-fold increase in [AMP], so that [AMP] acts as a metabolic amplifier of a small change in [ATP], and hence a sensitive signal of the energy state of the cell. The activity of phosphofructokinase-1 is thus regulated in response to the energy status of the cell to control the quantity of carbohydrate undergoing glycolysis prior to its entry into the citric acid cycle.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gluconeogenesis Propionic acid (or propionate) is a short-chain fatty acid that is involved in gluconeogenesis. It is typically derived from the fermentation of fiber in the gut, especially by gut bacteria, and can be converted into succinyl-CoA, which is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle. From there, it can be used to generate oxaloacetate, a critical precursor for gluconeogenesis, the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. Incorrect Options: (A) Glycolysis Glycolysis is the pathway that breaks down glucose to produce energy, but it does not directly involve propionic acid. The pathway involves the metabolism of glucose into pyruvate, which is then used for energy production in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Propionic acid is not a key substrate in glycolysis. (C) Glycogenolysis Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate, which can then be used for energy production or converted to glucose in the liver.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) UTP Glycogenesis, the process of glycogen synthesis, requires energy to add glucose units to the growing glycogen chain. The energy for this process is provided by UTP (uridine triphosphate). During glycogenesis, UDP-glucose is formed by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. This reaction involves the use of UTP to attach a glucose molecule to the UDP molecule, forming UDP-glucose, which is the active form of glucose used to elongate the glycogen molecule. Incorrect Options: (A) GTP GTP (guanosine triphosphate) is used in certain biosynthetic pathways, including protein synthesis and signal transduction, but it is not directly involved in the energy provision for glycogenesis. (B) GDP GDP (guanosine diphosphate) is the product of GTP hydrolysis and plays a role in various cellular processes, but it is not the energy source for glycogenesis. The energy for glycogen synthesis specifically comes from UTP, not GDP. (D) AMP AMP (adenosine monophosphate) typically serves as a marker of low cellular energy and plays a role in regulating energy balance in the cell, particularly activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Causing Phosphorylation cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) increases glycogenolysis by promoting phosphorylation of key enzymes in the glycogen breakdown pathway. When cAMP levels rise, it activates protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase. This kinase then phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. Therefore, phosphorylation is the key mechanism by which cAMP enhances glycogenolysis. Incorrect Options: (B) Causing dephosphorylation Dephosphorylation generally inactivates enzymes in pathways like glycogenolysis. cAMP does not activate glycogen breakdown by dephosphorylation. In fact, dephosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase would inhibit glycogenolysis, which is the opposite of what happens when cAMP is elevated. (C) Uncoupling Uncoupling refers to the dissociation of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis, which is unrelated to the regulation of glycogen breakdown. cAMP does not function by uncoupling processes but rather by activating enzymes through phosphorylation. (D) All of the above This option is incorrect because dephosphorylation and uncoupling do not contribute to the mechanism by which cAMP stimulates glycogenolysis.

Incorrect Options: (A) Enolase Enolase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis. It catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is one of the key steps in the glycolytic pathway. This makes enolase a critical enzyme for glycolysis. (B) Phosphoglucomutase Phosphoglucomutase is involved in the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate and is part of glycogen metabolism, specifically glycogenolysis. While it is not directly part of the classical glycolysis pathway, it does participate in processes that ultimately provide glucose-6-phosphate, which can enter glycolysis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Skeletal muscle The Hexose Monophosphate Shunt (also known as the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, or PPP) is primarily involved in the production of NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which are important for fatty acid synthesis, antioxidant defense, and nucleotide synthesis. While it occurs in many tissues, skeletal muscle is not a major site for the hexose monophosphate shunt. Muscle tissues rely more on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for energy production and do not heavily depend on the PPP pathway compared to other tissues like the liver or adipose tissue. Incorrect Options: (A) Liver The liver is one of the primary tissues where the hexose monophosphate shunt occurs. The liver uses this pathway for the synthesis of NADPH, which is crucial for detoxification processes, lipid biosynthesis, and maintaining redox balance. Additionally, the liver uses the PPP to generate ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis. (B) Adipose tissue Adipose tissue also has a significant amount of the hexose monophosphate shunt. It is essential for fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes because the NADPH produced through the pathway is required for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. The pathway is highly active in adipose tissue, particularly during periods of high fat storage. (C) Mammary gland The mammary gland is another tissue where the hexose monophosphate shunt plays a critical role, especially during lactation. The NADPH produced by this pathway is used in the synthesis of fatty acids and lipids for milk production. Therefore, the PPP is highly active in the mammary glands during lactation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Galactosemia Galactosemia is a genetic disorder that results in the inability to properly metabolize galactose, a sugar derived from lactose. In individuals with galactosemia, galactose accumulates in the blood and is excreted in the urine. The presence of reducing sugars, like galactose, in the urine is a hallmark of this disorder. Galactose is a reducing sugar because it has a free aldehyde group that can donate electrons to other substances, a property that is detectable in a urine test. Incorrect Options: (A) Fanconi anemia Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow and can lead to kidney dysfunction, but it does not directly cause reducing sugars to appear in the urine. Fanconi anemia primarily results in renal tubular dysfunction, which can lead to the loss of phosphate, amino acids, and glucose, but it does not cause the presence of reducing sugars in the urine. (B) Lactose intolerance Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency in lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. While lactose intolerance can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms when lactose is ingested, it does not result in the presence of reducing sugars in the urine. Lactose is a disaccharide that is normally broken down into reducing sugars, but in lactose intolerance, it remains undigested and does not reach the urine in detectable amounts. (D) Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder where the body cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. PKU leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, but it does not involve reducing sugars in the urine. Thus, reducing sugars are not a feature of PKU. (E) Salicylate poisoning Salicylate poisoning, resulting from overdose of aspirin or other salicylates, does not lead to reducing sugars being present in the urine. The symptoms of salicylate poisoning primarily include respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and gastrointestinal disturbances, but it does not directly cause the excretion of reducing sugars in the urine.",

Cyclic AMP - cAMP ACTIVATES GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE Phosphorylase kinase is activated in response to cAMP.Increasing the concentration of cAMP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation by ATP of inactive phosphorylase kinase b to active phosphorylase kinase a, which in turn, phosphorylates phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a. In the liver, cAMP is formed in response to glucagon, which is secreted in response to falling blood glucose. Muscle is insensitive to glucagon; in muscle, the signal for increased cAMP formation is the action of norepinephrine, which is secreted in response to fear or fright, when there is a need for increased glycogenolysis to permit rapid muscle activity. b. Blood glucose-inhibits glycogen breakdown c. Epinephrine- Phosphorylation is increased in response to cyclic AMP (cAMP) formed from ATP by adenylyl cyclase at the inner surface of cell membranes in response to hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucagon. cAMP is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase, so terminating hormone action; in liver insulin increases the activity of phosphodiesterase. d.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Alpha-ketoglutarate The only physiologically irreversible reaction in the Krebs cycle is the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. This reaction is irreversible because it involves the production of NADH and the release of CO2. The formation of succinyl-CoA is a key step in the cycle and is tightly regulated, making this reaction a major control point in cellular metabolism. The irreversibility of this reaction is crucial for maintaining the directionality of the Krebs cycle and ensuring proper energy production in the cell. Incorrect Options: (A) Citrate The conversion of citrate to isocitrate by aconitase is reversible. While this reaction plays an important role in the cycle, it is not the physiologically irreversible reaction. Reversibility in this reaction allows flexibility for the cycle to adapt to various metabolic needs. (C) Succinate The conversion of succinate to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase is also reversible. This step involves the reduction of FAD to FADH2 and is part of the cycle’s electron transport. It is not considered irreversible in the physiological context. (D) Malate The conversion of malate to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase is reversible. This reaction is important for replenishing oxaloacetate in the cycle, but like the other steps, it is not irreversible under normal physiological conditions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 10 ATPs One molecule of acetyl-CoA entering the TCA (Tricarboxylic Acid) cycle produces a total of 10 ATPs through various steps in the cycle. Here's how: Acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate, and then through several steps, the cycle produces 3 NADH molecules, 1 FADH2 molecule, and 1 ATP (or GTP, depending on the tissue) by substrate-level phosphorylation. These coenzymes (NADH, FADH2) then enter the electron transport chain to generate ATP: Each NADH produces approximately 2.5 ATPs (3 NADH × 2.5 = 7.5 ATP). Each FADH2 produces approximately 1.5 ATPs (1 FADH2 × 1.5 = 1.5 ATP). Finally, the substrate-level phosphorylation step (via succinate thiokinase) produces 1 ATP. The total ATP generated is: 7.5 ATP from NADH 1.5 ATP from FADH2 1 ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation This sums up to 10 ATP. Incorrect Options: (B) 11 ATPs This is incorrect because while the TCA cycle does produce ATP, the total ATP production from one molecule of acetyl-CoA is 10 ATP (not 11). The additional ATP would require the involvement of additional substrates or reactions not directly part of the TCA cycle. (C) 12 ATPs This is also incorrect for the same reason. The total ATP generated per acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle, including NADH, FADH2, and ATP, is 10. This value does not reach 12. (D) 15 ATPs Again, this is incorrect. While the TCA cycle is a major part of cellular energy production, it does not generate as many as 15 ATPs from one molecule of acetyl-CoA. The correct total is 10 ATP.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Citric acid cycle The Citric Acid Cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) is the central hub of cellular metabolism where the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats converges. Here's why: Carbohydrates: Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis to form pyruvate, which is then converted to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, where it combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate, and further reactions lead to the production of ATP, NADH, and FADH2. Proteins: Amino acids undergo deamination, and their carbon skeletons are converted into intermediates that can enter the citric acid cycle, such as alpha-ketoglutarate or oxaloacetate. Fats: Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA, which, like the products of carbohydrate metabolism, enters the citric acid cycle. Thus, the citric acid cycle plays a critical role in the final steps of energy production from all three macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Incorrect Options: (A) Glycolysis Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and occurs in the cytoplasm. It primarily involves carbohydrate metabolism and does not directly handle the metabolism of proteins or fats. Therefore, glycolysis is not the correct answer for the metabolism of all three macronutrients. (B) Malate shuttle The malate shuttle is involved in transporting NADH from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria during aerobic respiration. It is not a metabolic pathway for the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, or fats but instead a mechanism to facilitate energy production by transferring reducing equivalents. Thus, it is not the correct choice here. (C) Urea cycle The urea cycle is involved in the detoxification of ammonia and the synthesis of urea for excretion. It primarily deals with nitrogen metabolism, not with the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, or fats for energy production. Therefore, the urea cycle is not relevant for the direct catabolism of these macronutrients for energy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pyruvate carboxylase Anaplerotic reactions are those that help replenish the intermediates of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), ensuring its proper functioning. The enzyme pyruvate carboxylase plays a key role in this process by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, an important intermediate in the citric acid cycle. This reaction helps replenish oxaloacetate when it is used up in the cycle, allowing the cycle to continue running efficiently and supporting cellular energy production. Pyruvate carboxylase is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance, particularly when the citric acid cycle intermediates are being drawn off for other biosynthetic processes. Incorrect Options: (B) Enolase Enolase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. This enzyme is not involved in anaplerotic reactions, which are specifically aimed at replenishing citric acid cycle intermediates. Therefore, enolase is not correct in this context. (C) Pyruvate kinase Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, where phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate. While pyruvate is a key substrate for the citric acid cycle, this enzyme does not directly contribute to the replenishment of citric acid cycle intermediates and is not involved in anaplerotic reactions. (D) G6PD (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) G6PD is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, where it catalyzes the first step in the oxidative phase, generating NADPH.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fumarate The urea cycle and TCA cycle are interconnected, and fumarate serves as the critical linking molecule between the two. In the urea cycle, argininosuccinate is converted to fumarate and arginine by the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. The fumarate produced can then enter the TCA cycle, where it is converted to malate and subsequently to oxaloacetate, contributing to the continuation of the cycle and facilitating energy production. Incorrect Options: (B) Succinate Succinate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle but does not serve as the linking molecule between the urea cycle and the TCA cycle. While succinate is involved in the conversion of fumarate to malate, it is not the direct link between the two cycles. (C) Oxaloacetate Oxaloacetate is a key intermediate in the TCA cycle, and while it plays an important role in energy production, it is not directly involved in linking the urea cycle with the TCA cycle. Fumarate is the intermediate that bridges the two cycles. (D) Argininosuccinate Argininosuccinate is an intermediate in the urea cycle itself, not in the TCA cycle. It is cleaved to form fumarate and arginine, with fumarate being the key compound that links the urea cycle to the TCA cycle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Citric acid cycle The citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) is an example of an amphibolic pathway. This means it has both catabolic and anabolic roles. It functions in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to produce energy (ATP) through the production of NADH, FADH2, and GTP. Additionally, intermediates from the citric acid cycle are used for biosynthesis of amino acids, glucose (via gluconeogenesis), and other essential biomolecules. Thus, it plays a crucial role in both energy production and biosynthetic processes, making it an amphibolic pathway. Incorrect Options: (A) Glycolysis Glycolysis is primarily a catabolic pathway that breaks down glucose into pyruvate to generate ATP. It does not have a significant anabolic function, as it mainly focuses on energy production from glucose. Therefore, it is not considered an amphibolic pathway. (B) Beta oxidation Beta oxidation is also a catabolic pathway, specifically responsible for the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units, which can then enter the citric acid cycle. While it plays an important role in energy production, it does not have significant anabolic functions, so it is not an amphibolic pathway. (D) Alpha – oxidation Alpha oxidation is a process involved in the breakdown of certain fatty acids, particularly branched-chain fatty acids.

It therefore effects the conversion of a ketose sugar into an aldose with two carbons less and an aldose sugar into a ketose with two carbons more. The reaction requires Mg2+ and thiamin diphosphate (vitamin B1) as coenzyme. Measurement of erythrocyte transketolase and its activation by thiamin diphosphate provides an index of vitamin B1 nutritional status. The two-carbon moiety transferred is probably glycolaldehyde bound to thiamin diphosphate. Thus, transketolase catalyzes the transfer of the two-carbon unit from xylulose-5-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate, producing the seven-carbon ketose sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and the aldose glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. These two products then undergo transaldolation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Positive allosteric regulation of PFK-1 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) is an important regulator of glycolysis. It functions as a positive allosteric regulator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. F2,6BP binds to PFK-1 and increases its activity, thereby promoting the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This activation enhances the glycolytic flux, facilitating energy production. The concentration of F2,6BP is regulated by PFK-2, which is a bifunctional enzyme that synthesizes and degrades F2,6BP in response to various hormonal signals, such as insulin and glucagon. Incorrect Options: (A) Intermediate of glycolysis Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is not directly an intermediate of glycolysis. While it is involved in regulating glycolysis, it is not part of the substrate or product chain of glycolytic reactions. It is synthesized and degraded by the enzyme PFK-2, which is regulated by cellular energy needs and hormonal signals. (C) Negative allosteric regulation of PFK-1 This is incorrect. F2,6BP acts as a positive allosteric regulator of PFK-1, not a negative one. It enhances PFK-1 activity, facilitating the flow of glucose through glycolysis rather than inhibiting it. (D) Positive allosteric regulation of PFK-2 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate does not regulate PFK-2 in a positive allosteric manner. Instead, PFK-2 is responsible for the synthesis and degradation of F2,6BP. Its activity is regulated by hormonal signals, such as insulin and glucagon, but F2,6BP itself does not directly activate PFK-2.",

The addition of acetyl-CoA results in a change in the tertiary structure of the protein, lowering the Km for bicarbonate. This means that as acetyl-CoA is formed from pyruvate, it automatically ensures the provision of oxaloacetate and, therefore, its further oxidation in the citric acid cycle, by activating pyruvate carboxylase. The activation of pyruvate carboxylase and the reciprocal inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by acetyl-CoA derived from the oxidation of fatty acids explain the action of fatty acid oxidation in sparing the oxidation of pyruvate (and hence glucose) and in stimulating gluconeogenesis. The reciprocal relationship between these two enzymes alters the metabolic fate of pyruvate as the tissue changes from carbohydrate oxidation (glycolysis) to gluconeogenesis during the transition from the fed to fasting state.A major role of fatty acid oxidation in promoting gluconeogenesis is to supply the ATP that is required.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pyruvate kinase. Why the correct answer is D: The patient in question exhibits signs and symptoms of severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and a characteristic pattern of metabolites in the erythrocytes. The described metabolic profile shows high levels of glucose-6-phosphate, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, and AMP, and low levels of ATP, pyruvate, and lactate. This pattern suggests a problem with the final steps of glycolysis, where pyruvate kinase (PK) plays a key role in converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, producing ATP in the process. In the case of pyruvate kinase deficiency, this step is impaired, leading to the accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates like phosphoenolpyruvate and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The lack of pyruvate production results in low pyruvate levels and a reduced ATP production, causing the cells (especially erythrocytes) to rely on other, less efficient metabolic pathways. This leads to hemolysis due to the inability of red blood cells to maintain proper osmotic balance and function, resulting in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The characteristic clinical course in this patient (requiring transfusions, splenectomy, and rare transfusions after infections) is typical of pyruvate kinase deficiency, a common cause of hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Hexokinase: Hexokinase is involved in the first step of glycolysis, where it catalyzes the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. A deficiency in hexokinase would lead to a reduction in glucose-6-phosphate levels, but in this case, the patient has high glucose-6-phosphate levels. This makes a hexokinase deficiency an unlikely cause of the symptoms. B. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): GAPDH is responsible for converting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. A defect in GAPDH would cause an accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and a reduction in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. However, the patient's metabolic profile shows elevated levels of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, indicating that GAPDH is not likely defective. C. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK): Phosphoglycerate kinase is involved in the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, producing ATP. While defects in PGK could cause hemolytic anemia, the metabolic pattern in this case (high 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, low ATP) is more consistent with a pyruvate kinase deficiency than with a PGK deficiency. PGK defects would typically lead to a slightly different metabolite profile.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The cardiac muscle cells utilize the lactate as fuel Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect of metformin, particularly in patients with compromised kidney function. Under normal circumstances, lactate that accumulates in the body due to anaerobic metabolism (which can be exacerbated by metformin) is cleared efficiently by various tissues. One of the key tissues involved in clearing lactate is the heart, which is highly efficient at utilizing lactate as a fuel source. Cardiac muscle cells can take up lactate and convert it to pyruvate, which then enters the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation, thus preventing the buildup of lactate in the bloodstream. This mechanism helps explain why lactic acidosis is rarely seen clinically in patients taking metformin. Incorrect Answers: A. The red blood cells utilize the lactate as fuel While red blood cells do produce lactate due to their reliance on anaerobic glycolysis, they do not utilize lactate as a fuel source. Red blood cells lack mitochondria, so they cannot perform oxidative phosphorylation to convert lactate into pyruvate for energy production. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B. The lactate directly enters the TCA cycle to be oxidized Lactate itself cannot directly enter the TCA cycle. It must first be converted to pyruvate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Once converted to pyruvate, it can then enter the TCA cycle. So, this explanation is inaccurate, as lactate does not directly enter the TCA cycle, making this option incorrect. D. The large, voluntary muscle groups utilize the lactate as fuel While skeletal muscles do produce and release lactate during exercise, they do not primarily utilize lactate as a fuel source. Instead, lactate is typically taken up by the liver for gluconeogenesis or by other tissues like the heart for conversion into pyruvate. Therefore, this option is not the most accurate explanation for the rare occurrence of lactic acidosis in metformin therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer D. Increased production of acetone In Type 1 diabetes mellitus, the body's insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed, leading to insufficient insulin production. Insulin is necessary for glucose uptake by cells and for the regulation of metabolic processes. When insulin is lacking (especially if the individual neglects insulin injections), the body enters a catabolic state, where it breaks down fats for energy, leading to the production of ketone bodies, including acetone. The excess ketones are a result of the breakdown of fatty acids in the liver. As the ketone bodies accumulate, acetone, a type of ketone, is released into the bloodstream and exhaled in the breath, which can result in the characteristic fruity odor of acetone. This is why increased production of acetone is the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. Increased fatty acid synthesis from glucose in liver In the absence of insulin, the body cannot properly utilize glucose, and instead, it primarily resorts to the breakdown of stored fat for energy. As a result, there would be decreased fatty acid synthesis, not increased, because glucose is not being adequately processed and stored due to the lack of insulin. This makes option A incorrect. B. Decreased conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies In the absence of insulin, the body will shift toward fat breakdown, and fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies (including acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate) as an alternative energy source. Therefore, the conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies is actually increased, not decreased. This makes option B incorrect. C. Increased stores of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue In the absence of insulin, lipogenesis (fat storage) is impaired, and adipose tissue is unable to store fatty acids efficiently. Instead, lipolysis (fat breakdown) increases to provide energy. As a result, there is decreased storage of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. Thus, option C is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer C Glucose β (1-4) glucose The glycosidic bond that prevents humans from completely digesting fiber is the beta (1-4) linkage between glucose molecules, found in cellulose, which is the primary component of insoluble fiber. Humans lack the enzyme cellulase, which is needed to break down these beta (1-4) bonds, so we are unable to digest cellulose effectively. As a result, cellulose passes through the gastrointestinal tract largely undigested, providing bulk to stool and contributing to the beneficial effects of fiber on gut health, including a reduced risk of colon cancer. Incorrect Answers: A. Glucose α (1-6) glucose This bond refers to the alpha (1-6) linkage found in the branching points of amylopectin, a component of starch. Humans have the enzyme amylase to break down the α (1-4) bonds in starch, and enzymes like isomaltase can also break down the alpha (1-6) branching points. This allows starches to be digested efficiently. Therefore, this glycosidic bond does not contribute to the indigestibility of fiber and is not the correct answer. B. Glucose α (1-2) fructose This glycosidic bond is found in sucrose, a disaccharide made up of glucose and fructose. Humans have the enzyme sucrase to break down sucrose into its component monosaccharides, which can be absorbed and utilized. This type of bond is not responsible for the indigestibility of fiber, making this option incorrect. D. Galactose β (1-4) glucose This bond is found in lactose, the disaccharide in milk, where galactose is linked to glucose by a beta (1-4) bond. Humans have the enzyme lactase to digest lactose, though some individuals may have a lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance). However, this bond is not responsible for the indigestibility of fiber, as fiber primarily involves beta (1-4) bonds between glucose molecules in cellulose, not in lactose.

      "solution": "Correct Answer B. Glycogen This patient likely has Pompe disease, a type of glycogen storage disease caused by a deficiency in acid alpha-glucosidase (also known as acid maltase). This enzyme normally breaks down glycogen into glucose in the lysosome. A deficiency in this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, particularly in muscle tissue (including cardiac muscle), leading to muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, respiratory distress, and failure to thrive. The patient's liver enlargement, muscle weakness, and cardiac involvement are characteristic signs of Pompe disease, where glycogen accumulates in tissues due to the inability to properly degrade it. Incorrect Answers: A. Glucose Although glucose is the end product of glycogen breakdown, it is not typically the substance that accumulates in the cells in conditions like Pompe disease. The defect in Pompe disease is in the enzymatic breakdown of glycogen, not the breakdown of glucose. Therefore, glucose accumulation is not the primary problem here. C. Oxaloacetate Oxaloacetate is an intermediate in the Krebs cycle and is involved in energy production. There is no clear connection between oxaloacetate accumulation and the symptoms described in this case. The condition described here involves a storage disease rather than a problem with the Krebs cycle intermediates. D. Pyruvate Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis, which occurs prior to entering the mitochondria for further metabolism. While pyruvate metabolism is important in energy production, it does not accumulate in conditions like Pompe disease.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It promotes GLUT4 mobilization to the plasma membrane In this scenario, the 13-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes is being treated with insulin to lower his serum glucose concentration. Insulin acts by binding to its receptor on the cell surface, activating the insulin signaling pathway. This leads to the translocation of GLUT4 transporters from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. GLUT4 is a glucose transporter that facilitates glucose uptake into cells, particularly in muscle and adipose tissue. By increasing the number of GLUT4 transporters at the cell surface, insulin promotes glucose entry into cells, which helps to reduce the serum glucose concentration. This process is referred to as GLUT4 mobilization, and it is the mechanism responsible for the reduced serum glucose after insulin treatment. Therefore, B is the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. It activates GLUT4 by a cAMP-dependent mechanism Insulin does not primarily use a cAMP-dependent mechanism to activate GLUT4. Instead, insulin signaling primarily relies on the insulin receptor and the PI3-kinase pathway to stimulate the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. While some pathways in the body may use cAMP for signaling, insulin's action on GLUT4 is not mediated by this mechanism. Thus, A is incorrect. C. It increases the Km of GLUT4 for glucose The Km of an enzyme or transporter reflects the affinity for its substrate. In the case of GLUT4, insulin does not increase the Km for glucose. Instead, insulin's action leads to more GLUT4 transporters on the plasma membrane, thereby increasing the cell's ability to take up glucose. This is a kinetic change in glucose uptake, not an alteration in the affinity (Km) of GLUT4 for glucose. Therefore, C is incorrect. D. It induces a conformational change in GLUT4 While insulin does promote the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, it does not induce a conformational change in GLUT4 itself. The primary effect of insulin on GLUT4 is the mobilization of pre-existing GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface, rather than altering the structure of GLUT4. The conformational change that might occur with some other transporters (such as in ion channels) is not the key mechanism here. Hence, D is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Na+/K+ ATPase After the hydrolysis of complex polysaccharides into glucose, glucose is absorbed into the intestine with the help of the Sodium-Dependent Glucose Transporter 1 (SGLT1). This transporter requires an electrochemical gradient, which is maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump actively moves sodium ions out of the intestinal epithelial cells and potassium ions into the cells, creating a sodium gradient. This gradient allows sodium ions to move back into the cells through SGLT1, carrying glucose along with it via secondary active transport. Hence, the Na+/K+ ATPase pump is essential for glucose absorption. Incorrect Answers: (A) Sucrase Sucrase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. While it plays a role in the digestion of sucrose, it is not involved in the actual absorption of glucose into the intestinal cells. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glucose Glucose has the highest glycemic index (GI) among the options provided because it is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream after ingestion, leading to a quick and significant increase in blood glucose levels. The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood sugar levels compared to pure glucose, which is assigned a GI of 100. Since glucose itself is the reference standard, its GI is naturally the highest among common sugars. Incorrect Answers: (A) Fructose Fructose has a low glycemic index because it is metabolized more slowly by the liver and does not cause a rapid spike in blood glucose levels. Its conversion into glucose or other metabolites takes time, making it much less glycemic than glucose. Hence, this option is incorrect. (C) Sucrose Sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, has a moderate glycemic index because it is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. It must first be broken down into these monosaccharides by enzymes in the digestive tract, resulting in a slower and less pronounced blood sugar increase compared to glucose alone. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (D) Sorbitol Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, has a very low glycemic index because it is only partially absorbed in the small intestine and is metabolized more slowly than glucose. It does not cause a rapid rise in blood sugar levels and is often used as a sugar substitute for this reason. This makes this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The statement \"(D) 3 Na+ carried by sodium-glucose symporter for each glucose absorption\" is false because sodium-glucose transporters (SGLTs) do not transport three sodium ions per glucose molecule. Instead, SGLT1 uses 2 Na+ ions per glucose molecule, while SGLT2 uses 1 Na+ ion per glucose molecule to transport glucose across the cell membrane. This mechanism ensures the active uptake of glucose against its concentration gradient, driven by the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Incorrect Options: (A) SGLT1 present in kidney and small intestine for absorption of glucose and galactose This statement is true. SGLT1 is a sodium-dependent glucose transporter that facilitates the absorption of glucose and galactose in the small intestine and the kidney proximal tubules. It has a high affinity for glucose and galactose. (B) SGLT2 present in kidney and for absorption of glucose only This statement is true. SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney and is responsible for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate. Unlike SGLT1, it is specific to glucose and does not transport galactose. (C) Sodium-dependent glucose transporter is unidirectional This statement is true. Sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs) function in a unidirectional manner, moving glucose from the luminal side to the intracellular compartment along with sodium ions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phlorizin Phlorizin is a competitive inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs), specifically SGLT1 and SGLT2. It binds to the glucose-binding site of SGLTs, preventing glucose from being actively transported across the cell membrane. By inhibiting SGLT-mediated glucose transport, phlorizin blocks the active uptake of glucose in the small intestine and kidney, leading to glucose excretion. This property has been studied for potential therapeutic applications in diabetes. Incorrect Options: (A) Fluoride This is incorrect. Fluoride inhibits glycolytic enzymes like enolase, thereby blocking the glycolytic pathway, but it does not directly inhibit active glucose transport mechanisms such as SGLTs. Its primary role is in metabolism and not in glucose transport. (C) Insulin This is incorrect. Insulin enhances glucose uptake by increasing the translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane in insulin-sensitive tissues like muscle and adipose tissue. Insulin does not inhibit active glucose transport via SGLTs. (D) Iodoacetate This is incorrect. Iodoacetate inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3P-DH) in the glycolytic pathway, interfering with cellular metabolism. It does not affect active glucose transport directly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ferric chloride test The Ferric chloride test is not typically used for measuring glucose. This test is mainly used to detect phenolic compounds, particularly in the context of testing for the presence of certain phenols, tannins, or other compounds with hydroxyl groups that can react with ferric chloride. It does not specifically measure glucose levels and, therefore, is not suitable for glucose measurement. Incorrect Options: (B) Nelson-Somogyi method The Nelson-Somogyi method is a well-established biochemical test used to measure glucose levels. It is based on the reduction of copper ions in alkaline medium by reducing sugars, including glucose, which forms a colored complex that can be quantified. This test is commonly used in laboratory settings to measure glucose. (C) Dextrostix Dextrostix is a type of glucose test strip used for the rapid measurement of glucose in blood or urine samples. It is based on an enzymatic reaction that uses glucose oxidase to measure glucose levels. Dextrostix is commonly used for point-of-care glucose testing, making it a valid method for measuring glucose. (D) Glucose oxidase The glucose oxidase method is a specific and accurate enzymatic method used for measuring glucose levels. In this method, glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide, with the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced correlating with the glucose concentration. This method is widely used in clinical laboratories and home glucose monitors.",
