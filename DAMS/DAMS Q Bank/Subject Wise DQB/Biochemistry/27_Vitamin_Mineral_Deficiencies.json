      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Injections of B12 This patient presents with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (tingling in hands and feet) and cognitive issues, alongside mild anemia. These are classic signs of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can result from several causes, including malabsorption due to intrinsic factor deficiency or other gastrointestinal conditions. Vitamin B12 is crucial for proper nerve function and red blood cell production. The patient’s diet, even with increased red meat consumption, might not be sufficient for optimal B12 absorption, possibly due to age-related decline in gastric acid secretion or other factors. The best treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency, especially if it is severe or associated with malabsorption, is B12 injections to bypass the absorption issues in the gastrointestinal tract. Incorrect Answers: A. Oral administration of vitamin B12 While oral administration of vitamin B12 is often effective for patients with mild deficiency or those with intact gastrointestinal absorption, it may not be as effective in cases where the deficiency is due to malabsorption (such as in pernicious anemia or older adults with reduced stomach acid). In such cases, B12 injections are preferred because they provide a direct, reliable route to raise B12 levels without relying on absorption from the gut. B. Oral administration of folic acid Folic acid is often used to treat megaloblastic anemia, but it cannot correct the neurological symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. In fact, folic acid supplementation in the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency can mask the anemia while allowing the neurological damage to worsen. This makes folic acid inappropriate as a treatment for this patient's condition, as it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms. C. Oral administration of methionine Methionine is an amino acid and is not an appropriate treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency. While methionine plays a role in methylation reactions and is involved in the metabolism of homocysteine (which is impacted by B12), its administration would not correct the deficiency or the symptoms caused by B12 deficiency. This makes methionine an unsuitable treatment in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hartnup disease Taimoor’s episodic skin rashes, which improve with niacin (vitamin B3) supplementation, are characteristic of Hartnup disease. This genetic disorder affects the transport of neutral amino acids, particularly tryptophan, in the kidneys and intestines. Tryptophan is a precursor for niacin, and in Hartnup disease, a deficiency in tryptophan leads to insufficient niacin production. This can result in pellagra-like symptoms, including skin rashes, which can be alleviated by niacin supplementation. The high-protein diet would also help by providing more tryptophan, further supporting this diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Cystinuria Cystinuria is a condition characterized by impaired renal reabsorption of certain amino acids, including cysteine. This can lead to kidney stone formation, but it is not associated with the episodic skin rashes that improve with niacin, nor would niacin supplementation be expected to alleviate the symptoms. Therefore, cystinuria is not the likely diagnosis in this case. C. Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and fatigue of voluntary muscles, often affecting the eyes, face, and limbs. It is caused by an autoimmune attack on acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. While this condition could cause significant symptoms, it would not explain the episodic skin rashes, and niacin supplementation would not affect the course of the disease. Therefore, myasthenia gravis is not the correct diagnosis here. D. Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme homogentisate oxidase, leading to the accumulation of homogentisic acid. This results in a characteristic darkening of the urine and ochronosis (dark pigmentation) of connective tissues, but it does not present with episodic skin rashes or a response to niacin. Thus, alkaptonuria is not the correct diagnosis in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer C. Transketolase The symptoms described — trouble with balance, confusion, and nystagmus — are suggestive of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is commonly seen in chronic alcoholics due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is a cofactor for several enzymes, including transketolase, which plays a crucial role in the pentose phosphate pathway. A deficiency in thiamine leads to reduced activity of transketolase, which can be detected by measuring its activity in red blood cells. This deficiency disrupts glucose metabolism and leads to neurological symptoms like confusion, ataxia (balance issues), and nystagmus. Therefore, measuring transketolase activity can help confirm the biochemical cause of the patient's symptoms. Incorrect Answers: A. Transaldolase Transaldolase is also involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, but it is not as directly related to thiamine deficiency as transketolase. While a transaldolase deficiency might affect metabolism, it is not the enzyme typically measured to diagnose Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Therefore, this option is less relevant to the patient's symptoms. B. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, not the pentose phosphate pathway. A deficiency in GAPDH would have different metabolic consequences and is not directly linked to the symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Thus, this enzyme is not the correct choice for diagnosing this condition. D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is involved in the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, but its deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia and not the neurological symptoms associated with thiamine deficiency. G6PD deficiency does not explain the clinical presentation of confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus, so it is not the appropriate enzyme to assay in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) The presentation of fatigue, tingling sensation in both hands and legs, a fissured red tongue, lesions at the angle of the mouth, and peripheral neuropathy with decreased glutathione reductase activity is strongly indicative of riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency, which leads to ariboflavinosis. Riboflavin plays a key role in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, and its deficiency causes symptoms such as cheilosis (lesions at the angle of the mouth), glossitis (fissured red tongue), peripheral neuropathy, and glutathione reductase dysfunction. The deficiency of riboflavin impairs the reduction of glutathione, which is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress. Hence, (B) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Thiamine (Vitamin B1): Thiamine deficiency causes beriberi, which is associated with neuropathy (typically affecting the legs), cardiovascular symptoms, and edema, but it does not present with the characteristic fissured red tongue or lesions at the angle of the mouth. The symptoms described in the question are more specific to riboflavin deficiency. Therefore, (A) is incorrect. (C) Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6): Vitamin B6 deficiency can lead to peripheral neuropathy, dermatitis, glossitis, and cheilosis, but the symptoms described (including the decreased glutathione reductase activity) are more closely related to riboflavin deficiency rather than pyridoxine. Pyridoxine deficiency also does not typically cause the specific features seen in this case. Hence, (C) is incorrect. (D) Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12): Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, and glossitis, but it does not cause the characteristic fissured red tongue or lesions at the angle of the mouth. It also does not impact glutathione reductase activity in the same manner as riboflavin deficiency. Therefore, (D) is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Oculo-orogenital syndrome is a condition characterized by ocular symptoms (like conjunctivitis), oral symptoms (such as angular cheilitis), and genital symptoms (including lesions or inflammation). This syndrome is specifically associated with riboflavin (Vitamin B2) deficiency. Riboflavin is essential for the proper functioning of enzymes involved in cellular respiration, and its deficiency can lead to symptoms that affect the eyes, mouth, and genital area, including cheilosis, glossitis, and conjunctivitis. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Zinc: Zinc deficiency can cause acrodermatitis enteropathica, which includes eczema-like skin rashes, alopecia, and diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with the ocular and oral symptoms seen in oculo-orogenital syndrome. Zinc plays a role in many enzymatic reactions and immune function but does not cause the syndrome described. Hence, (A) is incorrect. (C) Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Niacin deficiency causes pellagra, which is characterized by the 3 D's: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.

In severe cases, it can also lead to death. Niacin is an essential nutrient involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and it forms the coenzymes NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are crucial for cellular energy production. A deficiency in niacin leads to these characteristic symptoms. Incorrect Responses: (A) Thiamine: Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency leads to conditions like beriberi, not pellagra. Symptoms of beriberi include neuropathy, muscle weakness, and cardiovascular problems, not the dermatological, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms typical of pellagra. (C) Riboflavin: Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) deficiency causes ariboflavinosis, which presents with symptoms like sore throat, cracks or sores on the lips (cheilosis), and inflammation of the tongue (glossitis), but it does not cause pellagra. (D) Folic acid: Folic acid (Vitamin B9) deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and, in pregnant women, increases the risk of neural tube defects in the fetus.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Niacin Niacin (Vitamin B3) toxicity is associated with fulminant hepatitis when taken in high doses, such as during treatment for hyperlipidemia. Niacin toxicity typically manifests as flushing, gastrointestinal upset, liver toxicity, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia. The liver toxicity may range from mild transaminase elevations to severe fulminant hepatitis, which is life-threatening. The mechanism is related to the hepatotoxic effects of niacin and its metabolites, which can cause oxidative stress and liver cell damage. Sustained-release niacin preparations, in particular, are more likely to cause liver toxicity compared to immediate-release forms. Incorrect Responses: (A) Thiamine: Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin, and toxicity is rare because excess thiamine is easily excreted in the urine. Even with high doses, it does not cause fulminant hepatitis. Thiamine deficiency, however, is associated with conditions like beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but toxicity is minimal. (B) Riboflavin: Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is another water-soluble vitamin, and toxicity is extremely rare. Excess riboflavin is excreted through the urine, leading to a harmless yellow discoloration. It is not known to cause fulminant hepatitis or any severe adverse effects. (D) Biotin: Biotin (Vitamin B7) is also water-soluble, and toxicity is rare because excess biotin is eliminated from the body through the kidneys. Biotin is involved in carboxylation reactions, but it does not lead to fulminant hepatitis in toxic doses.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pyridoxin (Vitamin B6) The excretion of xanthurenic acid in the urine is associated with a pyridoxine deficiency. Pyridoxine, in its coenzyme form pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), is required for the proper metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. In pyridoxine deficiency, tryptophan is metabolized along an alternate pathway that leads to the formation and excretion of xanthurenic acid. This metabolic disturbance is a hallmark of pyridoxine deficiency and is often used as a diagnostic clue for the condition. Incorrect Responses: (A) Folic acid: Folic acid (vitamin B9) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nucleotides and the metabolism of amino acids, but it is not directly involved in the production or excretion of xanthurenic acid. A deficiency in folic acid does not lead to the accumulation of xanthurenic acid in the urine. (C) Niacin: Niacin (vitamin B3) is involved in the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (nicotinic acid) via a pathway that requires pyridoxine. However, niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, not the excretion of xanthurenic acid. While both niacin and pyridoxine are involved in tryptophan metabolism, the accumulation of xanthurenic acid is specifically related to pyridoxine deficiency. (D) Cobalamine: Cobalamine (vitamin B12) is essential for the metabolism of methionine and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can cause neurological and hematologic issues, but it does not cause the excretion of xanthurenic acid. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and neuropathy, but not the specific urine finding of xanthurenic acid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pyridoxin (Vitamin B6) The tryptophan load test is used to evaluate pyridoxin (Vitamin B6) deficiency. In this test, tryptophan is administered to the patient, and the metabolic products, particularly xanthurenic acid, are measured in the urine. A pyridoxin deficiency leads to a metabolic shift where tryptophan is diverted to the pathway producing xanthurenic acid. In a normal situation, pyridoxine (PLP) helps in the conversion of tryptophan to nicotinamide, a precursor of niacin, but in its absence, this pathway is impaired, leading to increased excretion of xanthurenic acid. Incorrect Responses: (A) Niacinamide: Niacinamide is a form of niacin (vitamin B3), and a deficiency in niacin can cause pellagra. However, the tryptophan load test is not used to assess niacinamide (niacin) deficiency. Instead, niacin deficiency is often evaluated by assessing symptoms such as dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. (B) Cobalamine (Vitamin B12): Cobalamine deficiency typically results in megaloblastic anemia and neuropathy, which is related to impaired DNA synthesis. The tryptophan load test does not help evaluate cobalamine deficiency. Vitamin B12 metabolism does not directly influence the tryptophan pathway. (C) Folic acid: Folic acid deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and impaired DNA synthesis, but it does not directly affect the tryptophan pathway. Therefore, the tryptophan load test is not used to evaluate folic acid deficiency. It is usually diagnosed through serum folate levels and assessment of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) Excessive intake of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can lead to neurotoxicity, particularly in the form of peripheral neuropathy. High doses of pyridoxine interfere with the proper functioning of the nervous system, and symptoms such as sensory loss, numbness, and tingling sensations may occur. Chronic overconsumption of Vitamin B6 can damage nerve fibers and impair nerve transmission, leading to neurotoxic effects. Incorrect Responses: (A) Vitamin C: While Vitamin C is an essential antioxidant and important for collagen synthesis, excessive intake is generally not associated with neurotoxicity. High doses of Vitamin C can cause gastrointestinal distress and kidney stones but do not cause the neurological symptoms seen with Vitamin B6 toxicity. (B) Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Vitamin B2 is vital for cellular energy production and redox reactions. It is water-soluble, and excess riboflavin is typically excreted through the urine. It is not associated with neurotoxicity, even at high doses, and does not accumulate in the body to the extent that would cause harm to the nervous system. (D) Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): Vitamin B12 is critical for red blood cell formation and nerve health. It is typically well-tolerated even at higher doses, and there is no established link between excessive Vitamin B12 intake and neurotoxicity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Biotin Consumption of raw eggs can lead to a biotin deficiency due to the presence of avidin, a protein found in egg whites. Avidin binds to biotin, preventing its absorption and leading to a deficiency if large amounts of raw eggs are consumed over time. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin involved in several metabolic processes, including the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Avidin’s binding to biotin reduces its bioavailability, which can cause symptoms like hair loss, skin rashes, and neurological issues if left untreated. Incorrect Responses: (A) Thiamine: Thiamine deficiency is not associated with raw egg consumption. Thiamine is a vitamin that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, but its deficiency typically results from inadequate dietary intake, rather than the consumption of raw eggs. Common causes of thiamine deficiency include poor diet, alcohol consumption, and certain medical conditions. (B) Avidin: Avidin itself is the protein in raw eggs that binds biotin, causing the deficiency. It is not a vitamin. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that avidin is the deficiency caused by raw egg consumption. Instead, avidin leads to the biotin deficiency. (C) Riboflavin: Riboflavin, or Vitamin B2, is not affected by the consumption of raw eggs. It plays a key role in energy metabolism and is found in various foods, including dairy, meat, and green vegetables.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Carboxylase Biotin is a cofactor for several carboxylase enzymes, which are essential for metabolic pathways like fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Biotin deficiency can impair the activity of these enzymes, leading to disturbances in processes that require carboxylation. For example, enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and propionyl-CoA carboxylase are biotin-dependent. These enzymes catalyze key steps in energy production and metabolism, so biotin deficiency can result in symptoms like lethargy, muscle pain, and metabolic issues. Incorrect Responses: (A) Oxidase: Oxidase enzymes are involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and do not depend on biotin as a cofactor. They typically use cofactors like FAD or FMN, which are derivatives of riboflavin, not biotin. Therefore, biotin deficiency does not affect oxidase activity. (C) Transketolase: Transketolase is a thiamine-dependent enzyme, involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. It catalyzes the transfer of two-carbon units between sugar molecules. Since transketolase relies on thiamine (Vitamin B1) as its cofactor, its activity is not affected by biotin deficiency.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cobalamine Cobalamine (also known as Vitamin B12) is not obtained from plants. It is a vitamin produced primarily by microorganisms, including bacteria, in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Since plants do not produce Vitamin B12, vegetarians and vegans are at risk of deficiency unless they obtain B12 from fortified foods or supplements. Animals obtain B12 from the microorganisms in their digestive systems, and it is then stored in their tissues, which is why animal products are the primary dietary sources of Vitamin B12. Incorrect Responses: (A) Thiamine: Thiamine (Vitamin B1) is obtained from plants. It is found in high concentrations in whole grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. It plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism and is widely available in plant-based foods. (B) Vitamin A: Vitamin A is obtained from plants in the form of provitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, which can be converted into active Vitamin A in the body. This is commonly found in orange and yellow vegetables (e.g., carrots, sweet potatoes) and green leafy vegetables. (C) Riboflavin: Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is also obtained from plants. It is present in foods such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. It is an essential nutrient involved in energy metabolism and the conversion of other vitamins into their active forms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Demyelination Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with demyelination of the nervous system, particularly in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. This is due to the crucial role that Vitamin B12 plays in myelin synthesis and nervous system health. A deficiency in Vitamin B12 can lead to neurological symptoms, including peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, memory loss, and demyelination of the nerves, leading to irreversible neurological damage if not corrected in a timely manner. The demyelination process is a hallmark of Vitamin B12 deficiency. Incorrect Responses: (A) Dermatitis: Dermatitis is not typically associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency. It is more commonly seen in conditions like niacin (Vitamin B3) deficiency, where a form of dermatitis called pellagra occurs. While skin changes can occur in Vitamin B12 deficiency (such as pale or yellowish skin due to anemia), dermatitis is not a prominent feature. (B) Burning Foot Syndrome: Burning foot syndrome is primarily associated with Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency, which leads to beriberi. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as a burning sensation in the feet, muscle weakness, and fatigue, but it is not typically caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency. (C) Beriberi: Beriberi is caused by a Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and is characterized by symptoms like muscle weakness, edema, and heart failure (wet beriberi) or nerve damage (dry beriberi). This condition is unrelated to Vitamin B12 deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increased methylmalonic acid in urine Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to an accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA), which is typically converted to succinyl-CoA by the action of Vitamin B12-dependent enzymes (such as methylmalonyl-CoA mutase). When Vitamin B12 is deficient, this conversion is impaired, resulting in increased levels of MMA in the blood and urine. The elevated MMA is one of the specific biochemical markers used to diagnose Vitamin B12 deficiency. Incorrect Responses: (B) Increased homocysteine in urine: While homocysteine levels can be elevated in Vitamin B12 deficiency, this happens in the blood and not the urine. The defect in Vitamin B12 leads to a failure in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, causing elevated homocysteine levels in plasma. However, this is not a urine-based marker. (C) Phenylalanine in urine: The presence of phenylalanine in the urine is associated with phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This is unrelated to Vitamin B12 deficiency. (D) FIGLU in urine: FIGLU (Formiminoglutamate) is an intermediate in the metabolism of histidine and is typically elevated in folate deficiency. It does not typically increase in Vitamin B12 deficiency, although both folate and Vitamin B12 deficiencies share some similar hematologic effects, such as megaloblastic anemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Folic acid with hydroxycobalamin In cases of neurological worsening with anemia, particularly when Vitamin B12 deficiency is suspected, hydroxycobalamin (a form of Vitamin B12) is often administered alongside folic acid. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to pernicious anemia and neurological symptoms such as demyelination, which can worsen if Vitamin B12 deficiency is not addressed. The combination of folic acid (which helps with the formation of red blood cells and DNA synthesis) and hydroxycobalamin (which corrects the Vitamin B12 deficiency) is effective in treating both the anemia and the neurological symptoms. Folic acid alone cannot address the neurological aspect of Vitamin B12 deficiency, so both treatments are necessary for optimal management. Incorrect Responses: (A) Folic acid alone: While folic acid is crucial for red blood cell production and DNA synthesis, it does not treat the neurological aspects of Vitamin B12 deficiency. If Vitamin B12 deficiency is present, giving folic acid alone can actually mask the anemia, making it appear as if the deficiency is corrected when neurological damage is still progressing. Therefore, folic acid alone is not sufficient for treating neurological worsening in Vitamin B12 deficiency. (B) Iron: Iron supplementation is useful in treating iron-deficiency anemia, but it is ineffective in treating Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. If Vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause of anemia, iron supplementation will not address the underlying cause of the neurological symptoms and anemia. (C) Pyridoxine: Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is involved in transamination, decarboxylation, and glycogen metabolism, but it does not treat Vitamin B12 deficiency or its associated neurological and hematological effects. Pyridoxine is useful in pyridoxine-dependent seizures and certain enzyme deficiencies, but it is not relevant for Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia or its neurological manifestations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above The diagnosis of folic acid deficiency can be approached using several diagnostic methods, including peripheral blood smear, FIGLU excretion, and CAR excretion, all of which are helpful in detecting this condition: Peripheral blood smear: In folic acid deficiency, a peripheral blood smear typically shows macrocytic anemia, where the red blood cells are abnormally large. This is a common hallmark of folate deficiency, reflecting impaired DNA synthesis and cell division in red blood cell precursors. FIGLU excretion: FIGLU (formiminoglutamic acid) is a substance that accumulates in the urine when there is a deficiency in folate. The presence of FIGLU in the urine is a marker of impaired folate metabolism and is often used to diagnose folic acid deficiency. CAR excretion: CAR (circulating amino acid homocysteine) levels can also be elevated in folic acid deficiency, as folate is involved in the metabolism of homocysteine to methionine. Elevated homocysteine levels are a recognized marker of folate deficiency and other related deficiencies. Since all these tests can provide important clues to diagnose folic acid deficiency, the correct answer is D. All of the above. Incorrect Responses: (A) Peripheral blood smear: While peripheral blood smear is useful in diagnosing macrocytic anemia and suggesting folate deficiency, it alone cannot definitively confirm a folate deficiency. It needs to be supplemented by biochemical tests like FIGLU and CAR excretion to establish a clear diagnosis. (B) FIGLU excretion: FIGLU excretion is a helpful diagnostic tool for folic acid deficiency, but relying solely on this test without considering other markers like peripheral blood smear and CAR excretion may lead to incomplete clinical interpretation. (C) CAR excretion: CAR excretion, or the presence of elevated homocysteine, can indeed signal folic acid deficiency. However, like FIGLU excretion, it is not sufficient alone for a definitive diagnosis. A combination of tests, including peripheral blood smear, is often required for accurate diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Folic acid Folic acid is crucial during pregnancy for the proper development of the neural tube, which forms the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. A deficiency in folic acid during pregnancy is associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), such as meningomyelocele (a type of spina bifida). Meningomyelocele occurs when the spinal cord and the surrounding tissues protrude through an opening in the spine. Adequate intake of folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects, making folic acid the vitamin linked to preventing this condition. Incorrect Responses: (A) Biotin: While biotin is important for various metabolic processes, such as fat and carbohydrate metabolism, its deficiency is not associated with neural tube defects like meningomyelocele. Biotin deficiency in pregnancy is rare and does not predispose to the same complications as folic acid deficiency. (B) Thiamine: Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency can lead to conditions such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but it is not linked to neural tube defects or meningomyelocele. Thiamine plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function, but its deficiency does not cause the structural birth defects seen in folate deficiency. (D) Pyridoxin: Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is involved in amino acid metabolism and the synthesis of neurotransmitters, but a deficiency in pyridoxine does not lead to meningomyelocele or other neural tube defects. Vitamin B6 deficiency can cause issues like irritability, depression, and neuropathy, but it is not associated with the development of neural tube defects in pregnancy.",
