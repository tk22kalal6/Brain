      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Psychomotor agitation. Major depressive disorder (MDD) in children presents differently than in adolescents or adults. One of the key differences is that children more commonly exhibit psychomotor agitation, which includes restlessness, fidgeting, pacing, or an inability to sit still. These symptoms can sometimes be mistaken for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or anxiety. In contrast, adolescents and adults with MDD are more likely to experience psychomotor retardation, characterized by slowed movements and speech. Given this child’s impulsivity (running into the street) and severe depressive symptoms (suicidal ideation), psychomotor agitation is a significant consideration. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Hypersomnia – Incorrect Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness despite adequate rest) is a symptom of MDD, but it is more commonly seen in adolescents and adults rather than young children. In children, insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns tend to be more frequent than hypersomnia. (B) Hopelessness – Incorrect Hopelessness is a significant feature of depression but is more commonly observed in adolescents and adults rather than young children. Younger children often struggle to verbalize their emotions and may instead display depression through behavioral symptoms such as irritability, tantrums, or physical complaints (e.g., stomachaches, headaches). (D) Weight Change – Incorrect Changes in weight (either weight loss or gain) can be seen in MDD across all age groups. However, in children, appetite and weight changes are not as prominent or diagnostically specific compared to other symptoms like agitation or irritability. Additionally, weight fluctuations in children can sometimes be attributed to normal growth variations rather than depression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Neurovegetative signs. Neurovegetative signs refer to biological or physiological symptoms that accompany psychiatric conditions, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD). These symptoms affect basic bodily functions regulated by the autonomic nervous system. In this case, the patient exhibits insomnia, weight loss, reduced libido, and constipation, all of which are classic neurovegetative symptoms of depression. These signs are often used to gauge the severity of depression and help distinguish MDD from situational sadness. Decreased sleep ? Common in depression, especially early-morning awakenings. Weight loss ? Often due to decreased appetite, a hallmark of MDD. Decreased libido ? A frequent symptom of depression, also affected by neurotransmitter imbalances. Constipation ? Can result from reduced autonomic nervous system activity in depression. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Word salad – Incorrect Word salad is a disorganized speech pattern seen in severe thought disorders, especially in schizophrenia. It involves random words strung together without logical meaning (e.g., \"Blue sky running fast apple chair\"). This patient does not exhibit disorganized speech or psychotic symptoms, making word salad an incorrect choice. (C) Conversion – Incorrect Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) involves neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, or seizures) without an identifiable medical cause. It is often triggered by psychological stress. The patient’s symptoms are consistent with depression rather than unexplained neurological deficits, so conversion disorder is unlikely. (D) Catatonia – Incorrect Catatonia is a syndrome of motor abnormalities seen in schizophrenia, mood disorders, or medical conditions. It includes symptoms such as mutism, posturing, rigidity, waxy flexibility, or negativism. This patient does not display motor dysfunction, making catatonia an incorrect choice.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Major depression The patient’s symptoms are indicative of major depression. Despite denying feelings of sadness, the generalized weakness, loss of appetite, insomnia, and lack of interest in activities (including work and social interactions) are all classic features of depression. The absence of sadness does not rule out depression, as somatic symptoms often predominate, particularly in somatized depression. People with depression may experience physical complaints such as aches, pains, and fatigue, without explicitly feeling sad. The duration of symptoms (four years) and the impact on her daily functioning further point to major depressive disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Somatoform pain disorder – Incorrect Somatoform pain disorder involves chronic pain that cannot be fully explained by any underlying medical condition, and it is often linked with psychological stress. However, in this case, the patient’s symptoms are broader, with loss of appetite, generalized weakness, and lack of interest in activities—suggesting depressive symptoms beyond pain. The presence of other signs of depression (e.g., sleep disturbance, loss of interest) makes major depression a more likely diagnosis. (C) Somatization disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder involves a pattern of multiple, unexplained physical complaints affecting several organ systems. While the patient presents with aches and pains, her symptoms extend beyond physical complaints to include sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, and lack of interest in activities, which are more consistent with depression rather than somatization disorder. Additionally, the duration of symptoms (four years) and the presence of functional impairment make major depression the more likely diagnosis. (D) Dissociative disorder – Incorrect Dissociative disorders involve disturbances in identity, memory, or consciousness, often as a response to trauma or stress. The patient’s symptoms do not suggest identity fragmentation or amnesia, which are hallmark features of dissociative disorders. The primary symptoms here are somatic and mood-related, which are more characteristic of major depression.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Postpartum depression The patient is exhibiting signs of depressive symptoms after childbirth, including irritability, sleep disturbances, weight loss, and suicidal thoughts. The fact that she is fantasizing about suicide in relation to her child’s potential death and has begun actively planning how to commit suicide strongly suggests postpartum depression (PPD). This is a major depressive disorder that occurs within the first 4 weeks following childbirth, and it is marked by more severe symptoms than the commonly observed postpartum blues. The presence of suicidal ideation and a marked sense of hopelessness further supports the diagnosis of postpartum depression, which requires immediate treatment due to the potential risk of harm to the mother and child. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (B) Postpartum psychosis – Incorrect Postpartum psychosis is a rare but serious condition that typically manifests within 2 weeks after childbirth. It is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior, which are not present in this patient’s case. While the patient does have suicidal thoughts, there is no indication of the psychotic features (e.g., delusions, hallucinations) that would point to postpartum psychosis. Therefore, postpartum depression is a more appropriate diagnosis in this case. (C) Uncomplicated bereavement – Incorrect Uncomplicated bereavement occurs in response to the death of a loved one, and while it can involve grief, sadness, and mild sleep disturbances, it typically does not involve the severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation that this patient is experiencing. This patient’s condition seems to be more related to postpartum changes, rather than the grieving process related to a loss. Bereavement usually involves mourning a death, but here, the patient is expressing a desire to harm herself due to her feelings about her child, which is more consistent with postpartum depression. (D) Postpartum blues – Incorrect Postpartum blues, or baby blues, is a very common condition affecting many women in the first 2 weeks after childbirth. It is characterized by mild mood swings, irritability, and tearfulness, but it typically does not involve significant depression, sleep disturbances, or suicidal ideation. The patient’s severe depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts go beyond the typical experience of postpartum blues, making postpartum depression the correct diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) TSH Thyroid function is closely monitored in patients taking lithium because lithium can affect thyroid function, potentially leading to hypothyroidism. Lithium has a well-documented association with altering thyroid hormone levels, particularly increasing the risk of hypothyroidism, which can manifest as fatigue, weight gain, depression, and cold intolerance. Therefore, TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) should be regularly checked (typically every 6 months) to monitor for any thyroid dysfunction while the patient is on lithium. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) T3RU – Incorrect T3RU (Total T3 Resin Uptake) is an outdated test used to evaluate thyroid function and is not commonly used today. TSH is the more accurate and reliable test to assess thyroid function in patients on lithium therapy. T3RU is less sensitive compared to other thyroid tests like TSH, and its use is generally not recommended for monitoring thyroid function in patients on lithium. (C) BUN – Incorrect While BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) levels are important for monitoring renal function, especially because lithium can have nephrotoxic effects, BUN is not the most crucial lab test for patients on lithium in terms of regular monitoring. Lithium’s impact on renal function can be detected with other tests, such as serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which are typically monitored along with serum lithium levels. BUN is not specifically required every 6 months for lithium monitoring unless there are signs of kidney dysfunction. (D) CBC – Incorrect A CBC (Complete Blood Count) is useful for detecting anemia or infection but is not typically used to monitor for the side effects of lithium treatment. Lithium does not have a direct effect on blood cell counts, so regular CBCs are not necessary unless there are specific concerns such as infection or anemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Melancholia. Melancholia is a severe form of depression characterized by profound feelings of sadness, misery, and hopelessness, often without any identifiable cause. This condition is marked by a pervasive sense of despair and a lack of interest in activities that were once enjoyable, along with other symptoms such as guilt, lack of energy, and disturbances in sleep and appetite. It is one of the classic presentations of major depressive disorder and is particularly noted for its intensity and chronic nature. Incorrect responses: B. Mania: Mania, in contrast to melancholia, is characterized by elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, and impulsive behaviors. Individuals with mania may feel euphoric, overconfident, and have an inflated sense of self-esteem. This is opposite to the feelings of severe depression and misery seen in melancholia. C. Confusional insanity: Confusional insanity is a term historically used to describe a state of mental confusion or delirium, where a person experiences disorientation, impaired consciousness, and difficulty thinking clearly. While it may involve emotional distress, the hallmark of confusional insanity is confusion and disorientation rather than profound sadness or depression without cause. D. Delirium tremens: Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal, marked by confusion, tremors, hallucinations, and autonomic instability (like increased heart rate and blood pressure). While it can cause significant distress and altered mental states, it does not specifically cause the deep depression and feelings of misery without a clear reason, which is characteristic of melancholia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Old age depression. The term \"involutional melancholia\" was coined by the German psychiatrist Karl Bonhoeffer and later expanded by others, including Kraepelin, to describe a form of severe depression that typically occurs in older adults. It was believed to be related to the psychological and biological changes that occur with aging, particularly during the process of \"involution,\" or the decline of the body’s functions with age. Involutional melancholia is marked by depressive symptoms such as extreme sadness, despair, and pessimism, often accompanied by a loss of interest in life, guilt, and feelings of worthlessness. The condition was considered specific to later life, often occurring during midlife or in the elderly. Incorrect responses: A. Severe depression: While involutional melancholia is a form of severe depression, the term specifically refers to depression that occurs in older adults, typically during midlife or beyond. General severe depression can affect individuals of any age, not necessarily linked to aging or the involution process, so this response is too broad. C. Depression in early recovery stages: Depression during early recovery stages refers to the depressive symptoms that may appear in the initial phases of recovery from illness or substance abuse, or post-trauma. Involutional melancholia, however, is specifically related to the aging process and is not tied to recovery stages of other conditions. D. Neurotic depression: Neurotic depression (or dysthymia) is a type of long-term, less severe depression characterized by chronic feelings of sadness and dissatisfaction. While neurotic depression can occur at any age, involutional melancholia specifically refers to depression occurring in older individuals and is not classified as a neurotic depression, which is more of a persistent, mild depressive state rather than one triggered by aging.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Olanzapine + fluoxetine. The combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine has been proven to be effective in the treatment of acute bipolar depression. This combination is supported by clinical research and is one of the most well-established fixed-dose combinations for this purpose. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, helps in controlling manic and depressive episodes, while fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), helps manage the depressive symptoms. The synergistic effects of these two drugs have shown significant efficacy in reducing both depressive and manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder, especially in acute depressive episodes. Incorrect responses: A. Olanzapine + sertraline: While olanzapine is effective for treating bipolar disorder, combining it with sertraline (another SSRI) has not been shown to be as effective as the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Studies have found that fluoxetine works better with olanzapine in the context of bipolar depression, whereas sertraline may not provide the same level of effectiveness in managing both depressive and manic symptoms when combined with an antipsychotic. B. Risperidone + sertraline: Risperidone, another atypical antipsychotic, is sometimes used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, but sertraline has not been proven as effective when paired with risperidone for the treatment of acute bipolar depression. The combination of risperidone and sertraline has shown some utility in mood disorders, but it does not have the same level of evidence supporting its effectiveness in acute bipolar depression as the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. D. Risperidone + fluoxetine: The combination of risperidone and fluoxetine has been explored for various mood disorders, but research has shown that this combination is not as effective in treating acute bipolar depression as olanzapine + fluoxetine. Olanzapine has stronger evidence for efficacy in managing both manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder compared to risperidone, making it the preferred antipsychotic in combination with fluoxetine for acute bipolar depression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Reassure the patient and make no changes in treatment. In the case of a first episode of major depressive disorder (MDD), it is important to understand that antidepressants such as sertraline (an SSRI) typically take 2 to 4 weeks to show noticeable effects. A 7-day timeframe is too early to assess the full therapeutic response. Therefore, the psychiatrist should reassure the patient that it can take time for antidepressants to take effect, and continue the current treatment plan. Making changes to the medication regimen at this point would be premature, as the treatment has not yet had enough time to show its full effect. Incorrect responses: A. Increase the dose of sertraline: Increasing the dose of sertraline after only 7 days of treatment is premature, as antidepressants often take 2 to 4 weeks to show their effects. Early dose adjustments should be avoided unless there are clear signs of side effects or significant issues with tolerability. Patience is needed in the initial treatment phase before any changes are made to the dose. B. Add another antidepressant: Adding another antidepressant at this early stage of treatment is not advisable, as the patient has not had sufficient time (2 to 4 weeks) to experience the full therapeutic effect of sertraline. Combining antidepressants too soon can lead to unnecessary polypharmacy and potential side effects, without giving the first antidepressant the opportunity to work. C. Change antidepressant to one with a different mechanism of action: Changing the antidepressant after just 7 days is not recommended unless the patient is experiencing significant side effects or the medication is clearly ineffective after an appropriate trial period (typically 4-6 weeks). Switching medications too early can disrupt the treatment process, and the patient needs more time to determine whether sertraline will be effective.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sertraline. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the most likely offending agent in this scenario. One of the rare but serious side effects of SSRIs like sertraline is syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which can lead to hyponatremia (low sodium levels). This condition causes water retention, dilution of sodium in the blood, and may present with symptoms such as lethargy, confusion, and extreme fatigue. In this patient, the low sodium levels and lethargy are most likely due to this mechanism caused by sertraline. Incorrect responses: B. Lithium: Lithium is well-known for causing hyponatremia as a side effect, but it typically causes low sodium levels through its effects on the kidneys, leading to sodium retention and a potential imbalance. However, in this patient, the lethargy and low sodium are more likely due to the SIADH caused by sertraline, rather than lithium. Although lithium toxicity can cause similar symptoms, the context of the patient's medication profile and the acute onset of symptoms suggest sertraline as the primary culprit. C. Olanzapine: Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, can cause side effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and sedation, but it is not typically associated with hyponatremia or SIADH. Therefore, while it may contribute to lethargy or drowsiness, it is unlikely to be the main cause of the patient's low sodium levels in this case. D. Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines like lorazepam can cause sedation, dizziness, and drowsiness, but they are not linked to hyponatremia or electrolyte disturbances like sodium imbalance. The lethargy in this patient is more likely related to the combination of drugs and the specific effects of sertraline on sodium regulation, rather than lorazepam use.",

It is primarily used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and for patients who do not respond to other antipsychotic medications. Although clozapine can be effective in managing various psychiatric symptoms, including agitation and psychosis, its use in acute mania is not supported by FDA approval. The drug is also associated with significant side effects, such as agranulocytosis, which makes it less suitable for treating acute mania compared to other antipsychotics. Incorrect responses: A. Olanzapine: Olanzapine is an FDA-approved antipsychotic for the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar disorder. It has demonstrated efficacy in both the short-term management of manic episodes and the prevention of manic relapses, making it one of the first-line treatments for acute mania. B. Ziprasidone: Ziprasidone is another atypical antipsychotic that is FDA-approved for the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder. It has been shown to be effective in reducing manic symptoms and is often used in combination with other mood stabilizers or as monotherapy for acute manic episodes. C. Aripiprazole: Aripiprazole is FDA-approved for the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder as well. It is considered a second-line option due to its favorable side effect profile, and it can be used alone or in combination with mood stabilizers to manage acute manic episodes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Child age. Copycat suicide, also known as suicide contagion, refers to when individuals, particularly children and adolescents, are influenced by the suicide of others and imitate it. This phenomenon is most often seen in childhood or adolescence. Young people are particularly susceptible to external influences, and when they are exposed to suicide, either through media or in their immediate social environment, it can sometimes lead to them attempting or completing suicide themselves. The vulnerability of this age group is due to their developing emotional regulation, coping skills, and sometimes limited understanding of the long-term consequences of such actions. Incorrect responses: A. Adolescence: Although adolescence is a time of heightened risk for copycat suicides, the term \"copycat suicide\" is often most associated with younger children, especially those who may be directly influenced by peers or media exposure. However, adolescents are still at risk, and this is a critical period for suicide prevention efforts. C. Adult age: While suicide contagion can occur in adults, it is not as common as in children and adolescents. Adults typically have better-developed coping mechanisms, emotional regulation, and an understanding of the consequences of suicide. Therefore, copycat suicides are less frequently observed in adults compared to younger individuals. D. Old age: In older adults, suicides may occur due to factors such as depression, physical illness, or loss of social support, but the phenomenon of copycat suicides is much less prevalent in this age group. Older individuals are generally less influenced by media or peer-driven contagion, and their suicides are more likely to be associated with other underlying psychological or medical conditions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Postpartum psychosis, patient has poor response to treatment. This statement is incorrect because postpartum psychosis typically responds well to treatment, especially when managed with early intervention. Postpartum psychosis is a severe condition that usually occurs within the first two weeks following childbirth and requires urgent psychiatric attention. While it is a psychiatric emergency, it can be treated effectively with medications, including antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for postpartum psychosis can be quite good, and many women recover fully. Incorrect responses: A. Postpartum psychosis, patient has depressed mood: This statement is true. Postpartum psychosis often presents with severe mood disturbances, including depression, mood swings, and hallucinations or delusions. Women may also experience confusion, agitation, and disorganized thinking. Depression is a common component of the psychosis, although the psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions or hallucinations) are the hallmark features of the disorder. B. There is risk of suicide in women having postpartum depression: This statement is true. Women with postpartum depression are at an increased risk of suicide, especially if their depression is severe or untreated. Suicidal ideation and attempts are serious risks associated with postpartum depression, making early detection and intervention critical to preventing these tragic outcomes. C. ECT is a safe modality of treatment in lactating women: This statement is true. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered a safe and effective treatment option for women with severe psychiatric disorders, including postpartum depression or psychosis, even in lactating women. ECT does not pose significant risks to breastfeeding, and it can be used when other treatments have not been effective or when the patient's condition is life-threatening.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Suicide occurring at the time when the patient starts to recover. Paradoxical suicide refers to the occurrence of suicide at a time when the individual may appear to be improving or recovering from their mental health condition, such as depression. This paradox happens because, as the person begins to recover, they may experience a sudden surge in energy or clarity of thought, but still lack the coping mechanisms to manage their emotions or impulses. The recovery phase can give them the ability to plan and carry out suicide that they were too fatigued or emotionally incapacitated to do while in the depths of their illness. It is a dangerous time to watch for suicidal risk in patients who have been severely depressed but start to show signs of improvement. Incorrect responses: A. Suicide after taking low dose of drug: This option is not related to paradoxical suicide. Suicide after taking a low dose of a drug suggests an ineffective attempt or one that may not be serious, as the dose is insufficient to cause harm. Paradoxical suicide typically occurs when the person shows unexpected improvement, not as a result of insufficient medication or overdose. C. Accidental completion of suicide: Accidental suicide, or death by accident during a suicide attempt, is not the same as paradoxical suicide. Paradoxical suicide refers to a deliberate act of taking one’s life during a period of apparent recovery or improvement, not an unintended or accidental death. D. None of the above: This is incorrect because B. Suicide occurring at the time when the patient starts to recover accurately describes paradoxical suicide, making this option not true.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Psychotic depression. This patient is presenting with symptoms of psychotic depression, which is a form of major depressive disorder (MDD) that includes significant depressive symptoms along with psychosis (delusions or hallucinations). In this case, the man believes his intestines have rotted away and feels guilty about his wife’s death, which is indicative of guilt-laden delusions (a hallmark of psychotic depression). Such delusions are often centered around feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, which are common in depressive episodes, especially in the context of grief or loss. The timeline of 3 months following his wife’s death suggests that his psychosis is occurring as part of a major depressive episode, not simply as part of the normal grieving process. Incorrect responses: A. Delusional disorder: Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of persistent delusions without the accompanying mood disturbance of depression. However, this patient’s delusions are accompanied by depressive symptoms (guilt, sadness, and thoughts about his wife’s death), making psychotic depression a more appropriate diagnosis. Delusional disorder does not typically involve the significant mood changes seen in this case. C. Grief psychosis: Grief or bereavement can cause intense emotional pain, but grief psychosis is not a recognized clinical diagnosis in most psychiatric classifications. While grieving individuals may experience fleeting delusions or hallucinations, persistent and fixed delusions such as those described in this patient (intestines rotting, responsibility for his wife’s death) are more indicative of a mood disorder with psychotic features rather than a normal grieving process. D. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms. However, schizophrenia typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and does not typically present for the first time in a 60-year-old individual. Additionally, the delusions in schizophrenia are usually more bizarre and not typically centered around grief and guilt as seen in this case. Therefore, schizophrenia is an unlikely diagnosis in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) More than 4 episodes per month. Ultra-rapid cycling in bipolar disorder refers to a pattern where a person experiences more than 4 episodes of mood disturbance (mania, hypomania, or depression) within a single month. This is an extreme form of mood cycling that is much faster than the typical cycling patterns seen in bipolar disorder, which usually involve longer periods between episodes (e.g., episodes occurring over the course of a year). Ultra-rapid cycling can significantly impair functioning and often requires specialized treatment strategies. Incorrect responses: A. More than 4 episodes per year: This describes rapid cycling, not ultra-rapid cycling. Rapid cycling is defined by having 4 or more mood episodes (mania, hypomania, or depression) within a year. This is more common in bipolar disorder than ultra-rapid cycling, which involves much quicker shifts between mood states. B. More than 4 episodes in 6 months: This also refers to rapid cycling rather than ultra-rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, episodes occur more frequently than typical bipolar episodes but still within a 6-month period. Ultra-rapid cycling involves mood shifts happening much more frequently, typically more than 4 episodes per month, as opposed to within a 6-month time frame. C. More than 4 episodes in 6 weeks: This still does not meet the definition of ultra-rapid cycling, which specifically refers to more than 4 mood episodes per month. While frequent cycling can occur within 6 weeks, the exact time frame of more than 4 episodes per month is the key characteristic of ultra-rapid cycling.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Psychomotor agitation. Psychomotor agitation in a child with depression, while concerning, is not specifically suggestive of an increased risk for developing bipolar disorder later. It is a common feature of depression itself, especially in children, and refers to restlessness, fidgeting, and an inability to relax. While it can be present in both depressive episodes and bipolar episodes, it does not strongly indicate that the child is at higher risk for bipolar disorder in the future. In contrast, other features listed in the options are more closely associated with a potential transition to bipolar disorder. Incorrect responses: A. Rapid onset of depression: The rapid onset of depression in children, particularly if it occurs suddenly and severely, can be a red flag for bipolar disorder. Children who develop depression rapidly, especially with an intense episode, might later develop bipolar disorder because bipolar depression can present with quick mood shifts, sometimes resembling unipolar depression in its early stages. Early-onset depression, particularly with a quick shift, raises concern for a possible later transition to bipolar disorder. B. Psychotic symptoms: Psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations or delusions) in a 12-year-old child with depression are concerning and are a strong risk factor for bipolar disorder later in life. These symptoms can occur in both severe depressive episodes and manic episodes, both of which are features of bipolar disorder. The presence of psychosis, especially if it appears early in the course of depression, increases the likelihood of future bipolar disorder. C. Mood lability: Mood lability, or rapid mood changes, is another feature that increases the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder later. Children who exhibit marked fluctuations in mood, such as rapidly shifting between sadness and irritability or even euphoria, may be showing early signs of bipolar disorder. This symptom is particularly concerning if it appears during depressive episodes and persists over time.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and cognitive distortions such as worthlessness, guilt, and hopelessness, which often underlie emotional distress and behaviors. In this case, the therapist is addressing Mr. X's negative thoughts and suicidal ideas, which are central to CBT's approach. The goal of CBT is to help the patient recognize these harmful thoughts, correct them, and replace them with healthier, more balanced ways of thinking. This process of cognitive restructuring is a hallmark of CBT. Incorrect responses: A. Psychodynamic psychotherapy: Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on uncovering unconscious conflicts and how past experiences, particularly early childhood, influence current behavior and emotions. While it may address underlying emotional issues, psychodynamic therapy does not primarily focus on directly challenging specific negative thoughts like worthlessness. It aims to bring unconscious processes into awareness, but the approach described in the question is more characteristic of CBT. C. Supportive psychotherapy: Supportive psychotherapy is designed to provide emotional support, validation, and encouragement to the patient. It does not focus on actively challenging negative thought patterns or cognitive distortions. Instead, it is generally used to help patients cope with emotional distress by fostering a therapeutic relationship and offering reassurance. While supportive, it does not involve the systematic restructuring of negative thoughts, which is a central feature of CBT. D. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT): Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and communication skills. It is used to help patients understand and improve their relationships with others, often in the context of mood disorders like depression. IPT does not focus specifically on identifying and correcting negative thought patterns as CBT does, and the emphasis is more on interpersonal issues than on individual cognitive distortions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Amitriptyline 75-300 mg. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and the typical therapeutic dose range for adults is 75-300 mg per day. The starting dose is generally low, and it is gradually increased based on the patient’s response and tolerance. At doses in the range of 75-300 mg, amitriptyline is effective for treating depression. This range is considered adequate for antidepressant effect while balancing the risk of side effects. Incorrect responses: A. Fluoxetine 2.5 - 10 mg: This dose range for fluoxetine is too low. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), typically requires a starting dose of 20 mg per day, which can be adjusted based on the patient's response. Doses as low as 2.5-10 mg are not considered adequate for the therapeutic effect of fluoxetine in treating depression, though they might be used in very sensitive individuals or for specific conditions. B. Fluoxetine 10-20 mg: While fluoxetine 10-20 mg may be used as an initial dose, it is on the lower side for treating major depressive disorder. The typical starting dose for fluoxetine is 20 mg and can be increased based on patient response. 20 mg is often considered the effective minimum dose, with adjustments made to reach optimal therapeutic levels, especially for moderate to severe depression. D. Amitriptyline 10-50 mg: This dose range is too low for amitriptyline to be considered adequate for antidepressant treatment in the majority of cases. While doses as low as 10-50 mg may be used for sleep disorders or neuropathic pain, the therapeutic antidepressant dose typically starts at 75 mg and can go up to 300 mg. Lower doses may not provide sufficient antidepressant effects.",

To diagnose cyclothymia, the symptoms must persist for at least 2 years in adults (1 year in children and adolescents), with no symptom-free period lasting longer than 2 months. The two-year duration requirement is essential for distinguishing cyclothymia from other mood disorders and ensuring that the individual experiences chronic mood instability over a prolonged period. Incorrect responses: A. Should definitely have an episode of severe depression: This statement is incorrect because cyclothymia does not require the person to have a severe depressive episode or a full-blown major depressive episode. Instead, cyclothymia involves mild depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for major depression. Therefore, a severe depression is not a necessary feature of cyclothymia. C. Should definitely have an episode of mania: This is incorrect because individuals with cyclothymia do not necessarily experience mania. Instead, they experience hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than full-blown manic episodes. A full manic episode is a defining feature of bipolar I disorder, but it is not a requirement for cyclothymia. D. Should have major periods of hypomania: This is incorrect because while cyclothymia does involve hypomanic symptoms, these symptoms do not need to meet the criteria for major hypomanic episodes. The symptoms can be mild and intermittent rather than major, and they must not meet the threshold for a manic episode. The disorder is characterized by mood instability, but it does not require major hypomanic periods.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Major depressive disorder. This patient's presentation, which includes persistent low mood, loss of interest, low energy, guilt about his brother’s death, sleep disturbances, poor concentration, and weight loss, points to major depressive disorder (MDD). His symptoms have been ongoing for at least 3 months, and they are severe enough to interfere with his work and daily functioning. He also exhibits guilt and self-blame, which are common in MDD, and he has psychosomatic symptoms like appetite and sleep disturbances. While his grief is related to the loss of his brother, the persistence and severity of the symptoms go beyond what would be expected in normal grief, which typically involves sadness and yearning but generally does not cause significant functional impairment. Incorrect responses: A. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood would be a reasonable diagnosis if the patient’s symptoms were more mild or transient and related to the stressor of his brother’s death. However, his symptoms are persistent, affecting his daily functioning and involving severe depressive features (e.g., guilt, weight loss, and functional impairment), making major depressive disorder the more appropriate diagnosis. Adjustment disorder typically involves a less intense and shorter duration of symptoms compared to what is seen in MDD. B. Bereavement reaction: Bereavement reaction can cause sadness and longing after the death of a loved one, but it typically does not lead to significant impairment in functioning and does not present with the severe depressive symptoms seen here (e.g., significant weight loss, poor concentration, early morning awakening). In normal grief, the individual may feel sadness and guilt but is usually able to function at a reasonable level. MDD, on the other hand, involves more severe symptoms that significantly impact daily life and persist for an extended period, like in this case. D. Normal grief: Normal grief often involves feelings of sadness, loss, and yearning, but the symptoms tend to be less severe and transient. It is common for someone to feel sad or experience mood fluctuations after the loss of a loved one, but it usually does not lead to the functional impairment seen in this patient (e.g., work difficulties, weight loss, and severe feelings of worthlessness). Grief typically improves over time, while major depressive disorder is marked by prolonged, severe depressive symptoms that significantly impact daily functioning.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Discontinue imipramine and add sodium valproate. This patient has developed hypomanic or manic symptoms (e.g., excessive cheerfulness, increased excitement, dressing in colorful clothes, increased talking) shortly after starting treatment with imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant. The development of these symptoms suggests that the patient may have a bipolar disorder or is experiencing a manic switch, a well-known side effect of antidepressant therapy, especially in patients with undiagnosed bipolar disorder. In such cases, imipramine (or other antidepressants) can induce mania or hypomania. The appropriate next step is to discontinue the antidepressant and start a mood stabilizer like sodium valproate, which is commonly used to manage manic episodes in bipolar disorder. Incorrect responses: A. Continue imipramine and add antipsychotic: Continuing imipramine in this scenario is not advisable as it is likely to be the cause of the new manic symptoms. Adding an antipsychotic could help manage the manic symptoms, but it would not address the underlying issue of antidepressant-induced mania. The appropriate action is to discontinue imipramine rather than continue it, as the antidepressant may be exacerbating the manic symptoms. B. Continue imipramine and add benzodiazepines: Adding benzodiazepines may help with anxiety or agitation, but it does not address the root cause of the manic symptoms caused by imipramine. Continuing imipramine in this case is not recommended, as it could worsen the patient's manic state. The most appropriate treatment involves stopping the antidepressant and starting a mood stabilizer. C. Discontinue imipramine and start fluoxetine: While fluoxetine is another antidepressant, switching to it is not recommended in this case because it may also induce mania in a patient with bipolar disorder or those at risk for a manic switch. The first step should be to discontinue the current antidepressant (imipramine) and start a mood stabilizer like sodium valproate, which is effective for controlling mania. Transitioning to another antidepressant would risk further triggering manic episodes. In summary, the best approach is to discontinue imipramine and treat the manic symptoms with a mood stabilizer such as sodium valproate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anti-depressants. The patient presents with a 3-month history of symptoms that are characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD). These symptoms include low mood, loss of interest in activities, lethargy, worthlessness, decreased appetite, early morning awakening, and bodily aches, which are classic features of depression. The most effective treatment for MDD is usually antidepressants, which help regulate mood and improve overall functioning. These medications can address the core symptoms of depression, such as low mood and loss of interest, and can also help with associated symptoms like sleep disturbances and low appetite. Incorrect responses: A. Anti-psychotics: Anti-psychotics are generally used to treat conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe psychotic symptoms. While antipsychotics can be used in certain situations as an adjunct treatment for severe or treatment-resistant depression, they are not the first-line treatment for someone with primary depressive symptoms like this patient. Thus, antidepressants would be the more appropriate treatment in this case. C. Anxiolytics: Anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, are typically prescribed to treat anxiety-related disorders. While anxiety can be a component of depression, this patient's primary symptoms seem to be related to depression (e.g., low mood, loss of interest, lethargy, worthlessness). Anxiolytics may offer short-term relief for anxiety, but they are not effective for treating the core symptoms of major depressive disorder. Antidepressants would be more appropriate for this patient's situation. D. Hypno-sedatives: Hypno-sedatives (such as sleep medications) might address the sleep disturbances associated with depression, but they do not treat the underlying depressive symptoms. Relying solely on hypno-sedatives would not address the lack of interest, low mood, or feelings of worthlessness that are prominent in this patient's case. Therefore, antidepressants are a more comprehensive solution to address the various aspects of depression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sertraline. This patient presents with a 2-month history of low mood, lack of interest in recreational activities, lethargy, decreased appetite, and sleep disturbances, all of which are suggestive of major depressive disorder (MDD). The absence of delusions or hallucinations and a normal physical examination (including lab tests) further supports the diagnosis of a mood disorder rather than a psychotic or medical condition. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is one of the first-line treatments for MDD due to its efficacy, favorable side effect profile, and ability to improve mood, sleep, appetite, and energy levels in patients with depression. Incorrect responses: A. Haloperidol: Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia, delusions, hallucinations, and other psychotic disorders. Since this patient does not exhibit any signs of psychosis (such as delusions or hallucinations), antipsychotics like haloperidol would not be appropriate. His symptoms are more consistent with depression rather than a psychotic disorder. C. Alprazolam: Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly used for anxiety and panic disorders. While it may help with symptoms of anxiety or agitation, it is not an appropriate treatment for depression. Benzodiazepines do not address the underlying causes of major depressive disorder and are generally used for short-term management of anxiety, rather than long-term treatment of mood disorders like depression. D. Olanzapine: Olanzapine is another antipsychotic medication, and like haloperidol, it is typically used to treat conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, especially during mania or psychosis. Since this patient does not present with any psychotic symptoms, antipsychotics are not appropriate.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Antipsychotic + Antidepressant. This 60-year-old male presents with severe depressive symptoms, including feelings of worthlessness, suicidal ideation, and excessive guilt. Additionally, he believes that he has committed sins throughout his life, which is a sign of psychotic depression, where depression is accompanied by delusions or false beliefs. His fixed belief about sinning, despite being reassured by his wife, suggests that his depressive symptoms are associated with a psychotic component. In this case, a combination of antidepressant (for treating the depressive symptoms) and antipsychotic (to address the delusional beliefs) is the most appropriate approach. This combination can help treat both the mood symptoms and the psychotic features of the disorder. Incorrect responses: B. Antidepressant with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): While CBT is an effective treatment for depression and can help address negative thought patterns, this patient is experiencing delusions (a psychotic feature), which would not be effectively managed by therapy alone. CBT is usually effective for patients without psychosis or delusions. Since this patient has psychotic depression, adding an antipsychotic would be necessary to address the delusional symptoms. C. Guidance & counselling with guru: Although the patient has been seeking guidance from a spiritual guru, this approach is unlikely to be sufficient for managing the severe depression and delusional thinking he is experiencing. While spiritual support can be helpful for some individuals, it is not an adequate treatment for psychotic depression. In this case, the patient needs medical treatment (antidepressant + antipsychotic) to effectively address both the mood symptoms and delusions. D. Antidepressant alone: While an antidepressant is an appropriate treatment for depression, it may not be sufficient when psychosis is present, as in this case with the patient's delusions. Antidepressants alone would treat the mood symptoms, but they would not address the psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions of guilt and sin). An antipsychotic is needed to help manage the delusional aspects of his illness.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mania. This 20-year-old male presents with several classic symptoms suggestive of mania, a hallmark of bipolar disorder. The patient's increased alcohol consumption, sexual indulgence, irritability, lack of sleep, and high energy without fatigue (even after prolonged activity) are indicative of manic behavior. In mania, individuals often experience elevated mood, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, and decreased need for sleep. These symptoms have been present for 3 weeks, which is consistent with the duration of a manic episode. In mania, individuals may also exhibit risky behavior, such as substance abuse (in this case, increased alcohol consumption), and impulsive actions like sexual indulgence. Incorrect responses: A. Alcohol dependence: While the patient does show an increase in alcohol consumption, alcohol dependence alone would not explain the full range of symptoms he is experiencing, such as irritability, lack of sleep, and increased energy. Alcohol dependence is typically associated with cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and a pattern of alcohol use disorder, but the mood disturbances and increased activity point more toward mania rather than simply alcohol misuse. B. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. This patient's presentation does not include any psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions or hallucinations). His symptoms are more consistent with mania, where mood disturbances and changes in behavior (e.g., irritability, increased energy) occur, but without the psychosis typical of schizophrenia. D. Impulsive control disorder: An impulse control disorder is characterized by a failure to resist impulses or urges to perform certain actions (e.g., kleptomania, pyromania), often leading to regret or remorse afterward. While the patient's impulsivity (e.g., increased sexual behavior) is present, the accompanying elevated mood, irritability, and lack of sleep are not features of impulsive control disorders but are typical of mania.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute manic excitement. This 67-year-old lady shows signs of mania following the death of her husband, including increased activity, a decreased need for sleep, excessive involvement in religious and spiritual activities, and a grandiose belief that she has a significant goal to change society. These symptoms are typical of mania, which is often characterized by elevated mood, increased energy, reduced sleep, impulsivity, and sometimes grandiosity or unrealistic goals. The patient's argumentativeness and refusal to be hospitalized suggest irritability, which is common in manic episodes. The symptoms have developed over the course of the last six months, and the patient's behavior is significantly different from her baseline, which supports the diagnosis of acute manic excitement. Incorrect responses: B. Delusion: A delusion is a false belief that is firmly held despite evidence to the contrary. While this patient does exhibit a grandiose belief (that she has a goal to change society), this is part of a broader pattern of mania, which includes elevated mood, increased activity, and impulsivity, rather than being a single isolated delusion. In mania, such beliefs are often overvalued ideas rather than fixed delusions. The context of mania (increased energy, decreased need for sleep, etc.) is key here. C. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and catatonia, usually involving a long-standing pattern of disturbed thinking and behavior. This patient's symptoms do not suggest schizophrenia because she does not exhibit disorganized thinking, hallucinations, or a long-standing pattern of psychosis. The recent onset of symptoms and the specific mood changes are more indicative of mania rather than schizophrenia. D. Depression: Depression typically involves low mood, lack of energy, decreased interest in activities, sleep disturbances, guilt, and worthlessness, which are opposite to the symptoms observed in this patient. Her increased energy, lack of sleep, over-involvement in activities, and grandiose ideas are more consistent with mania than with depression",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Antidepressants and mood stabilizers. This 42-year-old male presents with depressed mood, anhedonia, and psychomotor retardation, which are classic symptoms of a major depressive episode. Importantly, he has a history of a manic episode, which suggests that he has bipolar disorder. For individuals with bipolar disorder who experience depression, the treatment approach typically includes a combination of mood stabilizers (such as lithium or valproate) to stabilize mood and antidepressants (such as SSRIs or SNRIs) to address the depressive symptoms. The use of mood stabilizers is crucial in bipolar disorder because they help prevent the switching from depression to mania that can occur with antidepressant use alone. Thus, the most appropriate management strategy is the combination of antidepressants and mood stabilizers. Incorrect responses: A. Antipsychotics and antidepressants: Although antipsychotics (such as aripiprazole or quetiapine) can be helpful for patients with bipolar disorder, particularly if they are experiencing psychosis or severe mood symptoms, this patient does not show any psychotic features in the presentation. Additionally, antipsychotics alone do not address the underlying mood instability that requires mood stabilizers. The patient also needs antidepressants to manage the depressive symptoms. Hence, a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants would not be the first choice here. C. Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers: While antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are both appropriate for managing bipolar disorder, this patient is presenting primarily with depressive symptoms. Antipsychotics are not specifically indicated for treating depression in this context unless there are symptoms of psychosis or severe agitation, neither of which is mentioned in the question. The priority should be treating the depressive symptoms with antidepressants alongside mood stabilizers to prevent mood swings, not just focusing on antipsychotics. D. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines are used primarily for managing anxiety and insomnia, but they are not appropriate for treating the core symptoms of bipolar depression. They do not have any effect on mood stabilization and could increase the risk of sedation or dependency. Therefore, benzodiazepines are not the appropriate treatment for this patient. The most effective treatment for the depressive episode in the context of bipolar disorder is a combination of antidepressants and mood stabilizers.",

Even adjustment disorder has depressive symptoms, we call it adjustment with prolonged depressive reaction. But in diagnostic criteria, it is mentioned that in order to diagnose adjustment disorder, symptoms should not be so predominant that other more specific depressive or anxiety disorders can be diagnosed. ICD-10 Criteria for Adjustment disorder: F43.2 Adjustment disorders A. Experience of an identifiable psycho-social stressor, not of an unusual or catastrophic type, within one month of the onset of symptoms. B. Symptoms or behaviour disturbance of types found in any of the affective disorders (except for delusions and hallucinations), any disorders in F4 (neurotic, stress related and somatoform disorders) and conduct disorders, so long as the criteria of an individual disorder are not fulfilled. Symptoms may be variable in both form and severity. The predominant feature of the symptoms may be further specified by the use of a fifth character: F43.20 Brief depressive reaction. A transient mild depressive state of a duration not exceeding one month. F43.21 Prolonged depressive reaction. A mild depressive state occurring in response to a prolonged exposure to a stressful situation but of a duration not exceeding two years. F43.22 Mixed anxiety and depressive reaction. Both anxiety and depressive symptoms are prominent, but at levels no greater than specified in mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (F41.2) or other mixed anxiety disorders (F41.3). F43.23 With predominant disturbance of other emotions. The symptoms are usually of several types of emotion, such as anxiety, depression, worry, tensions and anger. Symptoms of anxiety and depression may meet the criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (F41.2) or other mixed anxiety disorders (F41.3), but they are not so predominant that other more specific depressive or anxiety disorders can be diagnosed. F43.24 With predominant disturbance of conduct. F43.25 With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. F43.28 With other specified predominant symptoms. DSM-5 criteria: The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s). These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant as evidenced by either of the following: marked distress that is in excess of what would be expected from exposure to the stressor significant impairment in social or occupational (academic) functioning The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another specific Axis I disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting Axis I or Axis II disorder. The symptoms do not represent bereavement. Once the stressor (or its consequences) has terminated, the symptoms do not persist for more than an additional 6 months. Specify if: Acute: if the disturbance lasts less than 6 months Chronic: if the disturbance lasts for 6 months or longer Adjustment disorders are coded based on the subtype, which is selected according to the predominant symptoms.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Amitriptyline. This patient is presenting with acute urinary retention, which is a well-known side effect of antidepressants that are tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is an older class of antidepressants that have anticholinergic effects, which can lead to difficulty urinating, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and other symptoms associated with parasympathetic inhibition. In particular, the anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline can impair bladder function, leading to urinary retention. This explains why it is the most likely offending drug in this case. Incorrect responses: A. Chlorpromazine: Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic medication (a typical or first-generation antipsychotic). While antipsychotics can have some anticholinergic side effects, they are not as strongly associated with urinary retention as tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline. Additionally, chlorpromazine has other side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), but urinary retention is not as common or prominent with this medication compared to TCAs. B. Clozapine: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic known for its sedating effects and risk of agranulocytosis. Like other antipsychotics, clozapine can have anticholinergic effects, which may contribute to urinary retention. However, clozapine is less likely to cause this problem compared to TCAs like amitriptyline. Although urinary retention is a possible side effect of clozapine, the likelihood is lower than with amitriptyline. C. Olanzapine: Olanzapine is another atypical antipsychotic, and although it may have some anticholinergic effects, it is not typically associated with acute urinary retention. Like clozapine, its primary side effects include sedation, weight gain, and metabolic changes (like increased blood sugar or cholesterol). Urinary retention is a less common side effect with olanzapine compared to amitriptyline. E. Sertraline: Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which has a different mechanism of action compared to TCAs. SSRIs generally have fewer anticholinergic side effects than TCAs, and urinary retention is not a common side effect of sertraline. The most frequent side effects of sertraline include gastrointestinal disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia, but urinary retention is not typically associated with this medication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atropine sulphate should be administered as an antidote. In the case of a massive overdose of amitriptyline, which is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), the management involves addressing cardiotoxicity, CNS toxicity, and seizures, among other symptoms. Atropine is not the appropriate antidote for a TCA overdose, as it mainly addresses bradycardia caused by vagal stimulation but does not treat the overdose symptoms caused by TCAs, which include anticholinergic effects, cardiac arrhythmias, and CNS depression. Instead, sodium bicarbonate is the treatment of choice for TCA-induced arrhythmias and acidosis. Explanation of Correct Responses: A. Gastric lavage to be done: Gastric lavage can be performed in cases of significant overdose if the patient presents within 1-2 hours of ingestion. It can help remove the drug from the stomach and decrease systemic absorption. However, gastric lavage is most effective if performed early, and the decision should be made based on the patient's clinical presentation and the timing of the overdose. B. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered to treat acidosis: Sodium bicarbonate is an effective treatment in TCA overdose to correct metabolic acidosis and to prevent or treat cardiac arrhythmias that can occur as a result of the overdose. The alkalinization of urine also helps enhance the renal elimination of the drug. This treatment is one of the mainstays in the management of TCA toxicity. D. Diazepam should be injected to control seizures: Diazepam, a benzodiazepine, is indicated for the management of seizures caused by TCA toxicity. Seizures are a known complication of TCA overdose, and diazepam can help to terminate seizures and provide CNS stabilization. It's the appropriate treatment for managing this aspect of TCA overdose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sertraline. This 85-year-old man is presenting with symptoms of major depressive disorder following a significant loss, along with signs of insomnia, weight loss, crying spells, and suicidal ideation. Given the patient's age and the medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and a history of myocardial infarction, it is crucial to choose an antidepressant with a favorable side-effect profile and minimal risk of adverse drug interactions. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is generally considered a safe and effective treatment for depression in older adults. SSRIs are known to be well-tolerated, have fewer side effects than older antidepressants (such as tricyclic antidepressants), and are less likely to cause anticholinergic side effects, which are concerning in older patients with multiple medical conditions. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Doxepin: Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). While TCAs can be effective in treating depression, they have significant anticholinergic effects (such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and blurred vision), which are more pronounced in older adults. These side effects, along with the cardiotoxicity (especially in the elderly with heart disease) and potential for sedation, make doxepin less appropriate for this patient with numerous medical conditions. B. Clonazepam: Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used primarily for anxiety and seizure disorders, not for depression. While it may provide short-term relief for anxiety or insomnia, it is not an appropriate long-term treatment for major depressive disorder. Additionally, benzodiazepines can increase the risk of sedation, falls, and cognitive impairment in elderly patients, which could worsen their overall functioning and safety. D. Amitriptyline: Amitriptyline is another tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that can be effective in treating depression. However, similar to doxepin, it carries the risks of anticholinergic side effects and cardiovascular toxicity (such as arrhythmias), particularly dangerous in older adults with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. The sedating effects of amitriptyline can also be problematic in elderly patients who may already be dealing with poor sleep or fatigue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Major depression. This 41-year-old woman presents with a history of chronic physical symptoms such as aches and pains, generalized weakness, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, and lack of interest in activities. Despite denying sadness, her symptoms strongly suggest major depressive disorder (MDD), as the criteria for depression can include physical complaints and anhedonia (lack of interest) rather than overt sadness. Depression can often present with somatic symptoms like chronic pain, sleep disturbances, and appetite changes, especially in cases where patients may not immediately recognize or report typical emotional symptoms. The absence of sadness does not rule out MDD, as it is not a required symptom for diagnosis—somatic complaints can be the dominant presentation, particularly in older adults or individuals who may not easily express emotional distress. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Somatoform pain disorder: Somatoform pain disorder (now more commonly classified as somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5) involves chronic pain that is not explained by medical conditions but is still distressing to the patient. However, unlike major depression, this disorder does not typically include the pervasive mood disturbances (e.g., anhedonia, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbances) that are seen in major depressive disorder. The patient in this case also has anhedonia and lack of interest, which points more strongly to depression than to a somatic symptom disorder. C. Somatization disorder: Somatization disorder, now also included under somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5, involves multiple physical complaints over time, but in addition to pain, this disorder also includes symptoms from a wide variety of bodily systems (gastrointestinal, sexual, neurological). The patient's presentation is more focused on generalized pain and weakness, and the absence of a broad range of symptoms makes somatization disorder less likely. Moreover, in somatization disorder, the psychological distress is often not recognized as such by the patient, but there would typically be an enduring pattern of numerous unexplained physical symptoms across various organ systems, which this patient does not show. D. Dissociative disorder: Dissociative disorders primarily involve a disruption in consciousness, memory, or identity (e.g., dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder), rather than chronic physical symptoms such as pain, sleep problems, or anhedonia. This patient's symptoms do not suggest any issues with identity, memory, or consciousness, which are central to dissociative disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy). In this scenario, the patient is in a stupor and has a history of continually feeling sad, suicidal attempts, lack of eating and sleeping. These symptoms strongly suggest a severe major depressive episode with psychotic features or catatonia. The condition is life-threatening due to the suicidal behavior, malnutrition, and possible catatonia (a state of physical immobility or stupor, which is a medical emergency). When a patient presents with severe depression, catatonia, or suicidal ideation, and is non-responsive to medications or requires rapid intervention, ECT is the most effective and recommended treatment. It is especially used in cases of severe depression where immediate improvement is needed or where the patient is unable to tolerate oral medications. ECT has a fast onset of action, which is crucial in life-threatening situations. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: B. Antidepressant: While antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression, in this case, the patient is in a stupor and unable to eat, sleep, or engage in typical activities. This suggests a severe depressive episode, possibly with catatonia or psychosis, where the patient may not respond promptly to medications alone. Antidepressants typically take several weeks to show effects, and in such a severe case with suicidal tendencies, the priority is immediate intervention with ECT to prevent harm. Furthermore, in severe depression with catatonia, ECT is more effective and faster in achieving relief than medications. C. Antipsychotic: Antipsychotics are usually used for psychosis or mania, but this patient’s primary concern seems to be severe depression with possible catatonia rather than psychosis. Antipsychotics may be considered in cases where there are psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), but the key issue here is the severe depressive state and the need for urgent intervention. ECT is preferred in severe depression with catatonia or suicidal ideation because of its rapid efficacy. D. Sedatives: While sedatives can temporarily alleviate agitation or anxiety, they are not the appropriate treatment for severe depression, especially when it is associated with suicidal tendencies or catatonia. Sedatives do not address the underlying depressive disorder or its life-threatening aspects. In this case, the patient needs active intervention with a treatment like ECT that targets the core depression and associated life-threatening behaviors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dysthymia. This patient presents with a 3-year history of irritability, low mood, lack of interest in surroundings, and general dissatisfaction with everything, but with no significant disruption of sleep or appetite. These symptoms are highly suggestive of dysthymia, also known as persistent depressive disorder. Dysthymia is characterized by a chronic low-grade depression lasting for at least 2 years, where individuals experience depressive symptoms (such as low mood and irritability) but without the more severe impairment seen in major depression (e.g., significant sleep or appetite changes, more pronounced low energy, etc.). Patients with dysthymia often report feeling dissatisfied with life, and while they may not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode, they still experience chronic depressive symptoms that affect their quality of life. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Major depression: While major depression also involves a low mood, lack of interest, and irritability, it typically presents with more severe symptoms compared to dysthymia. In major depressive disorder (MDD), individuals often experience significant changes in sleep, appetite, and energy levels, and the depression can be more intense, often interfering with daily functioning. This patient does not report any significant sleep or appetite disruption, which is a hallmark of MDD. Therefore, the patient’s symptoms are more consistent with dysthymia rather than major depression. B. No psychiatric disorder: Although the patient does not experience the more disruptive symptoms of major depression, the chronic dissatisfaction and low mood over a 3-year period still warrant a psychiatric diagnosis. The symptoms are consistent with dysthymia, a mood disorder that is persistent but typically less intense than major depression. Therefore, saying the patient has no psychiatric disorder would overlook the ongoing depressive symptoms that impact his well-being. D. Chronic fatigue syndrome: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized primarily by severe, persistent fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and is often accompanied by other symptoms such as muscle pain, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction. While fatigue could overlap with depression, this patient’s primary complaints are irritability, low mood, and lack of interest, without the hallmark symptom of severe fatigue seen in CFS. Additionally, CFS tends to have a more significant focus on physical symptoms rather than the emotional and mood disturbances that this patient is experiencing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Psychomotor agitation. Atypical depression is a subtype of depression where individuals may exhibit a set of symptoms that differ from the more common patterns seen in typical major depressive disorder (MDD). Some defining features of atypical depression include reversal of vegetative symptoms, younger age of onset, and more frequent comorbid diagnosis of panic disorder compared to typical depression. However, psychomotor agitation is not a hallmark symptom of atypical depression. Instead, individuals with atypical depression tend to experience psychomotor retardation (slowing down of movements), which is in contrast to the agitation typically observed in other forms of depression. Therefore, psychomotor agitation is not characteristic of atypical depression, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Reversal of vegetative symptoms: One of the key features of atypical depression is the reversal of vegetative symptoms. In atypical depression, patients often experience hypersomnia (excessive sleep) and increased appetite, which is the opposite of the vegetative symptoms seen in typical depression (insomnia and decreased appetite). These reversed symptoms make atypical depression stand out from other forms of major depressive disorder. C. Younger age of onset: Atypical depression often begins at a younger age compared to typical depression. It is common to see atypical depression in adolescents and young adults. This is in contrast to typical depression, which often develops later in life. Therefore, a younger age of onset is considered a characteristic feature of atypical depression. D. More frequent comorbid diagnosis of panic disorder as compared to typical major depressive disorder: Patients with atypical depression are more likely to have comorbid panic disorder compared to those with typical depression. This association is an important distinguishing feature of atypical depression. In fact, the presence of panic disorder in patients with atypical depression can contribute to the severity of symptoms, especially anxiety and fear, making it a relevant comorbid condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Postpartum depression. The patient's symptoms are consistent with postpartum depression (PPD), which can develop after childbirth and is characterized by symptoms such as irritability, poor sleep, weight loss, and suicidal ideation. In this case, the patient is expressing significant concern for her child's safety, feeling worthless, and even fantasizing about suicide, which is a hallmark feature of severe depression. The presence of these symptoms, especially the suicidal ideation, and the fact that they are impairing her ability to care for her child and manage daily activities, make postpartum depression the most likely diagnosis. This condition can occur anytime within the first year postpartum, but is most commonly seen in the first few months. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: B. Postpartum psychosis: Postpartum psychosis is a more severe condition than postpartum depression and is typically characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and a loss of reality testing. In this case, while the patient has suicidal ideation and excessive worry, she does not have hallucinations or delusions (such as believing that something supernatural is happening or that the child is possessed, etc.). Postpartum psychosis tends to occur in the first few days to weeks after delivery, and is much rarer than postpartum depression. C. Uncomplicated bereavement: Bereavement is the experience of mourning after the loss of a loved one, which can include sadness, difficulty sleeping, and irritability. However, the patient has not lost anyone (she has just given birth to a healthy child), and the suicidal thoughts and weight loss are much more severe than would be expected in uncomplicated grief. In uncomplicated bereavement, suicidal ideation is not typical, and the intensity of the symptoms usually does not impair functioning to the degree described in this case. D. Postpartum blues: Postpartum blues (also called baby blues) is a common, mild condition that occurs in up to 80% of women after childbirth and is characterized by mood swings, tearfulness, irritability, and mild sleep disturbance. However, it is typically self-limited, lasting a few days to two weeks, and does not involve severe symptoms like weight loss, suicidal ideation, or significant impairment in functioning. This patient's symptoms persist for more than a week and are more severe, indicating a more serious condition than postpartum blues.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Psycho-education. In patients with bipolar disorder who struggle with poor medication compliance, psycho-education is the therapy of choice. Psycho-education involves teaching the patient and their family about the nature of bipolar disorder, the importance of medication adherence, identifying early warning signs of mood episodes, and addressing the impact of lifestyle factors on mood regulation. By educating the patient about their condition, it can improve their understanding of the need for consistent treatment and help them manage the condition more effectively, reducing the risk of relapse and enhancing long-term functioning. This type of therapy directly targets medication adherence and self-management, which is particularly important when non-compliance is an issue. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): While CBT can be effective for many psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, it is generally not the first line of therapy for improving medication compliance in bipolar disorder. CBT focuses on changing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors, and while it can be helpful for mood stabilization and managing depressive symptoms, psycho-education is more directly focused on improving medication adherence and understanding the course of the illness. CBT can be used as an adjunct therapy in bipolar disorder, but it does not specifically target compliance issues as effectively as psycho-education. C. Insight-Oriented Therapy: Insight-oriented therapy is a more psychodynamic approach, which focuses on exploring unconscious conflicts and gaining insight into the patient's past experiences. While this can be valuable in some cases, it is not particularly helpful in addressing practical issues like medication adherence or symptom management in bipolar disorder. This type of therapy is generally not the most effective for a patient who needs to improve compliance and understanding of the disease and treatment regimen. D. Supportive Psychotherapy: Supportive psychotherapy provides emotional support and validation to the patient, but it does not involve structured education or behavioral techniques aimed at improving compliance or addressing the specific challenges of living with bipolar disorder. While supportive therapy can be helpful in reducing distress and improving coping mechanisms, it is less likely to address the core issue of poor medication adherence and does not provide the structured education and guidance needed to help the patient manage the illness in the long term.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bipolar disorder, manic. This patient's presentation is most consistent with a manic episode of bipolar disorder. She is exhibiting classic symptoms of mania, including agitation, restlessness, pressured speech, and a fluctuating affect (alternating between euphoria and irritability). The behavior of standing in the middle of a busy highway and commanding traffic to stop suggests impulsive, risk-taking behavior and a loss of insight, both hallmark features of mania. Additionally, the family history of similar behavior strengthens the likelihood of a genetic predisposition to bipolar disorder, which is common in individuals with this diagnosis. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Delirium: Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by disorientation, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and cognitive disturbances (e.g., memory deficits, hallucinations). It typically results from a medical condition, infection, or medication, and is often accompanied by a reduced level of alertness and cognitive impairments. While the patient’s disorganized behavior could appear similar, her clear orientation and the euphoric and irritable affect are more consistent with mania than delirium, which involves more significant cognitive disruption. C. Bipolar disorder, mixed state: A mixed state in bipolar disorder involves the simultaneous occurrence of both depressive and manic symptoms, such as depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness along with hyperactivity, agitation, and pressured speech. Although the patient exhibits some manic features, she does not display any clear symptoms of depression (such as hopelessness or loss of interest), which would be necessary for a diagnosis of a mixed state. Therefore, her presentation fits better with a pure manic episode. D. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia involves psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. While this patient’s behavior is unusual and disorganized, there is no clear evidence of delusions or hallucinations, which are key features of schizophrenia. Her behavior is more consistent with the impulsivity and mood swings of a manic episode, rather than the psychotic symptoms seen in schizophrenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lithium. Lithium is the most well-established medication for both the acute treatment and maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder. It has proven efficacy in preventing both manic and depressive episodes and is recommended for long-term use in the maintenance phase to prevent recurrence of mood episodes. Lithium works by modulating neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin and dopamine, and has a mood-stabilizing effect. Its effectiveness in long-term management and maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder is well-supported by clinical evidence. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Aripiprazole: Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that is often used for the acute treatment of mania and psychosis in bipolar disorder. While it can be helpful during the acute phase to control manic symptoms, it is not typically used as monotherapy for maintenance treatment. Aripiprazole is more commonly used in combination with mood stabilizers (such as lithium or valproate) for maintenance therapy, but it is not as effective on its own for long-term prevention of both mania and depression in bipolar disorder. B. Lamotrigine: Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant and a mood stabilizer that is effective for preventing depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. However, it is less effective in preventing manic episodes and not recommended for acute mania. It is more often used for maintenance therapy in patients with bipolar disorder, especially for those with frequent depressive episodes. Since the patient in the question has been diagnosed with manic-type bipolar disorder, lamotrigine would not be the first choice for acute treatment or maintenance of mania. D. Olanzapine: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is also used for the acute treatment of mania, but it is not typically used alone for long-term maintenance therapy. It is often part of a combination regimen with mood stabilizers for managing bipolar disorder, especially when psychosis is present. However, olanzapine is more commonly used during the acute phase of mania and is not considered the first-line treatment for long-term maintenance, as lithium remains the gold standard for maintenance therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) TSH. Lithium is a mood stabilizer that is commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, and it has a well-known side effect profile. One of the important concerns with long-term lithium therapy is its potential impact on thyroid function, specifically causing hypothyroidism. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is a good indicator of thyroid function, so TSH should be monitored regularly, typically every 6 months, to detect any changes in thyroid function that may require adjustment in the treatment plan. Hypothyroidism is a common side effect of lithium, and it can present with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and depression. If significant changes in thyroid function are noted, adjustments in medication or thyroid replacement therapy may be necessary. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. T3RU: The T3 resin uptake (T3RU) test is used to assess thyroid binding capacity and indirectly reflects thyroid hormone levels. However, it is not commonly used for routine monitoring of thyroid function during lithium therapy. TSH is a much more specific and reliable test to monitor thyroid status, particularly for detecting hypothyroidism induced by lithium. C. BUN: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a test that measures kidney function. While lithium can potentially affect renal function, BUN is not typically measured every 6 months unless there is a concern about renal function. Lithium can be nephrotoxic in some patients, but kidney function is generally monitored more frequently, particularly in the first few months of treatment or when there are signs of renal impairment. Routine testing of BUN every 6 months is not necessary unless there is an indication of renal issues. D. CBC: A complete blood count (CBC) is used to assess overall blood health, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. While some medications can affect the CBC (such as causing leukopenia or thrombocytopenia), lithium does not typically require routine CBC monitoring unless there are symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias. Therefore, monitoring CBC every 6 months is not required for most patients on lithium therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hyponatremia. Oxcarbazepine, a newer congener of carbamazepine, is often used as a substitute for carbamazepine in patients who experience adverse reactions to the latter, such as skin rashes (like Stevens-Johnson syndrome). While oxcarbazepine is generally better tolerated, it carries a risk of hyponatremia, a condition characterized by low sodium levels in the blood. This is because oxcarbazepine can cause SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion), leading to the retention of water and dilution of sodium in the body. Monitoring of sodium levels is crucial when patients are on oxcarbazepine to detect this potentially serious electrolyte imbalance. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Vertigo: Vertigo is not a common or significant concern with oxcarbazepine therapy. While carbamazepine and other antiepileptic drugs can sometimes cause dizziness or drowsiness, vertigo specifically is not a prominent issue associated with oxcarbazepine. Therefore, it is not a major concern compared to hyponatremia. B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe skin reaction that can occur with carbamazepine therapy. However, oxcarbazepine, while chemically related to carbamazepine, has a lower risk of causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This is one of the reasons why it is often used as a substitute for carbamazepine when a patient develops a skin rash. Therefore, SJS is a lesser concern with oxcarbazepine. D. Hepatitis: Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) is a potential side effect of some medications, including carbamazepine, but it is not a typical or well-documented concern with oxcarbazepine. The most significant adverse effect associated with oxcarbazepine remains hyponatremia, not hepatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pregnancy test. Before starting a woman of reproductive age on lithium, it is essential to perform a pregnancy test. Lithium is known to be teratogenic, especially during the first trimester, where it can cause cardiac malformations, most notably Ebstein's anomaly. Given the potential risks to the fetus, a pregnancy test must be conducted to ensure that the patient is not pregnant before initiating lithium therapy. If the patient is pregnant, alternative treatment options for bipolar disorder should be considered, as lithium may pose significant risks to the developing fetus. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: B. Total bilirubin: There is no routine need to measure total bilirubin before starting lithium. While liver function can be affected by many medications, lithium is not typically associated with significant hepatic toxicity. Therefore, a bilirubin test is unnecessary unless there are specific signs of liver dysfunction, which is not indicated in this case. C. EEG: An EEG (electroencephalogram) is used to assess brain electrical activity and is commonly used in the diagnosis of seizure disorders or epilepsy. However, EEG is not routinely indicated before starting lithium. There is no need to check for seizure activity unless the patient has a history or clinical signs that suggest a seizure disorder, which is not mentioned in this case. D. Chest x-ray: A chest x-ray is generally not necessary before starting lithium unless there are specific respiratory concerns or signs of pulmonary disease. In this case, there are no respiratory complaints or symptoms that would warrant a chest x-ray. Lithium does not have a direct impact on the lungs, so this test is not required before initiating therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Change in neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity. The clinical effects of antidepressant drugs are primarily based on their ability to alter the sensitivity of neurotransmitter receptors over time, rather than just increasing or decreasing neurotransmitter levels directly. Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), and TCAs (Tricyclic Antidepressants), work by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft. However, their therapeutic effects do not occur immediately; they are thought to result from long-term changes in neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity. As neurotransmitter levels increase, receptor sensitivity changes to normalize mood and alleviate depressive symptoms. Over time, the changes in receptor sensitivity help the brain return to a more balanced state. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: B. Decreased levels of neurotransmitters: While decreased neurotransmitter levels can be implicated in the development of depression, the action of antidepressants is generally to increase neurotransmitter levels (such as serotonin and norepinephrine). Antidepressants do not work by lowering neurotransmitter levels. Therefore, this option does not accurately describe the primary mechanism of antidepressants. C. Change in efficacy of neurotransmitters: Antidepressants do not typically work by changing the efficacy of neurotransmitters in the sense of making them inherently more or less effective. Rather, they work by increasing the availability of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, which can lead to changes in receptor sensitivity and signaling. The \"efficacy\" of neurotransmitters themselves remains relatively stable; what changes is their availability and the subsequent adjustments in receptor function and neurotransmitter signaling. D. Increased levels of neurotransmitters: Although increasing neurotransmitter levels (such as serotonin or norepinephrine) is part of how many antidepressants work, the clinical effects of antidepressants are not just due to the increase in neurotransmitter levels alone. The long-term effectiveness comes from changes in neurotransmitter receptor sensitivity, which eventually leads to improved mood and symptom resolution. Simply increasing neurotransmitter levels does not explain the therapeutic time course of antidepressants, as it typically takes weeks for antidepressants to show effects, suggesting a more complex mechanism involving receptor sensitivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dopamine. Dopamine is often referred to as the \"pleasure neurotransmitter\" because it plays a critical role in the brain's reward and pleasure systems. It is involved in motivation, reinforcement, and the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction from rewarding experiences. When we engage in activities that bring us pleasure, such as eating, socializing, or achieving goals, dopamine is released, reinforcing these behaviors and making us more likely to repeat them. Dopamine is also involved in the mesolimbic pathway, which is directly linked to feelings of pleasure, reward, and even addiction. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: A. Serotonin: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter primarily associated with mood regulation, sleep, appetite, and overall emotional stability. While serotonin can contribute to feelings of well-being, it is not specifically linked to the pleasure or reward system in the way that dopamine is. Rather than being primarily responsible for pleasure, serotonin helps regulate mood, which can influence overall happiness, but it does not directly produce the feeling of reward or pleasure. C. Norepinephrine: Norepinephrine is involved in the body’s stress response and plays a key role in the fight-or-flight mechanism. While it does have a role in alertness, arousal, and energy levels, it is not directly responsible for pleasure. Norepinephrine’s actions are more related to arousal and attention rather than the feeling of pleasure or reward. D. Acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in many functions, including muscle movement, learning, and memory. It is crucial for proper brain and muscle function but does not play a direct role in the experience of pleasure or reward. While it influences cognitive functions, it is not typically associated with the pleasure or reward systems in the brain.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Depression. In older adults, especially those above 60 years of age in India, depression is the most commonly encountered psychiatric disorder. This age group is often at higher risk due to factors such as social isolation, physical health problems, loss of loved ones, financial stress, and limited social support. Depression in the elderly can often be underdiagnosed or misattributed to normal aging or physical illnesses, but it is a significant issue. Symptoms of depression in older adults might include sadness, loss of interest in daily activities, poor appetite, sleep disturbances, and physical symptoms such as fatigue or unexplained aches and pains. It is crucial to recognize and treat depression in older adults as it can severely impact their quality of life and overall health. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: B. Dementia: Dementia, while also prevalent among the elderly, is not the most common psychiatric disorder in people above 60 years of age in India. Although dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is a significant cause of cognitive decline, depression remains more commonly diagnosed. Dementia involves significant memory and cognitive impairments, which are different from the mood disturbances seen in depression. Though both conditions may coexist, depression is more prevalent. C. Hysteria: Hysteria (now often referred to as conversion disorder or somatic symptom disorder) is a psychological condition that can involve physical symptoms with no medical cause. It is much less common in the elderly, and in fact, the diagnosis of hysteria has fallen out of favor in modern psychiatry. It is not a common psychiatric disorder among older adults in India, and the focus has shifted more towards mood disorders like depression and neurocognitive disorders like dementia. D. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is typically diagnosed earlier in life, often in late adolescence or early adulthood. While schizophrenia can occur in older adults, its onset is less common in the geriatric population. Schizophrenia in the elderly, particularly if it starts in later life (late-onset schizophrenia), is rare compared to depression and dementia. The course of schizophrenia is usually chronic and not typically associated with the elderly unless it is a case of late-onset schizophrenia, which is uncommon.",

Veraguth's fold: Veraguth's fold refers to the horizontal fold of skin located in the lower eyelid, usually seen in patients with Down's syndrome or trisomy 21. This fold is caused by a specific pattern of skin and tissue development around the eye, giving a characteristic appearance. It is associated with a number of genetic and chromosomal conditions. B. Inverted omega sign: The inverted omega sign is a radiological term referring to a specific pattern that can be seen on a chest X-ray or abdominal X-ray. It is typically associated with intussusception, where a part of the intestine telescopes into another part. The appearance resembles the inverted letter omega (?) when viewed on X-ray, helping clinicians identify this condition.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment. Explanation: A. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment: This statement is true. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a well-established, evidence-based psychotherapy that has been shown to be highly effective in treating depression, either alone or in combination with antidepressant medications. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to depression. Multiple studies have supported its efficacy in both acute and long-term management of depression. Incorrect Responses: B. Antidepressant monotherapy is effective 95% of the time: This statement is false. While antidepressants can be effective for many people, they do not work 95% of the time. In fact, approximately 60-70% of patients experience significant improvement with antidepressants, and not all individuals respond to medication. The exact effectiveness rate varies depending on the type of antidepressant, the severity of the depression, and individual factors. Additionally, treatment often requires ongoing adjustments. C. Antidepressants usually work within 1 to 2 weeks: This statement is false. Antidepressants typically take 4 to 6 weeks to show noticeable effects, though some people may experience early improvement in symptoms like sleep or appetite. However, the full therapeutic effect usually takes several weeks, and patients need to continue the treatment for the best outcomes. D. Antidepressant medication is not lethal in overdose: This statement is false. Antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can be dangerous in overdose, potentially leading to serious health complications or even death. The toxicity of an overdose depends on the specific medication, dose, and other factors like preexisting conditions. While newer medications like SSRIs are generally safer in overdose compared to older drugs like TCAs, they still carry risks.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypoparathyroidism. Explanation: D. Hypoparathyroidism: This statement is correct. Hypoparathyroidism, which involves low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), typically results in symptoms like muscle cramps, tetany, numbness, and tingling, but depression is not commonly a presenting symptom. While mood changes can occur due to electrolyte disturbances or chronic illness, depression is not a hallmark of hypoparathyroidism. Incorrect Responses: A. Carcinoma of the pancreas: This statement is incorrect. Pancreatic cancer can cause depression as a presenting symptom. The diagnosis of cancer, particularly when it is advanced, can be associated with emotional distress, sadness, and loss of interest in activities, which are characteristic symptoms of depression. The physical symptoms of the disease, such as pain, weight loss, and gastrointestinal disturbances, can also contribute to mood changes. B. Diabetes mellitus: This statement is incorrect. Depression is a common comorbidity in diabetes mellitus. Studies show that individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing depression, possibly due to factors like the chronic nature of the disease, the physical burden, and metabolic disturbances that may affect brain chemistry. Additionally, blood sugar fluctuations can influence mood. C. Hypothyroidism: This statement is incorrect. Hypothyroidism is strongly associated with depression as a presenting symptom. The symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, often overlap with depressive symptoms. Reduced thyroid hormone levels can cause a decrease in energy, motivation, and mood, leading to depressive-like symptoms in many patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Female. Explanation: A. Female: This statement is incorrect. While females are more likely to attempt suicide, males are more likely to complete suicide. Studies show that men, especially those over 40, tend to use more lethal methods, which increases their risk of completing suicide. Therefore, being female is not a risk factor for suicide in depression; rather, males, particularly over the age of 40, have a higher risk of completion. This makes option A the correct answer to the question. Incorrect Responses: B. Male > 40 years: This statement is correct. Men over the age of 40 are at a higher risk of suicide, especially in the context of depression. Older men often experience more severe forms of depression and may also face greater life stressors, such as job loss, relationship breakdown, or physical health issues. They are more likely to use lethal means, which increases their risk of suicide completion. C. Child with conduct disorder: This statement is correct. Children with conduct disorder are at a significantly increased risk of suicide. They often exhibit aggressive behaviors, lack of empathy, and disregard for social norms, which can lead to severe emotional and social difficulties. When combined with depression or other psychiatric disorders, children with conduct disorder are more vulnerable to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. D. Family history of suicide: This statement is correct. A family history of suicide is a well-known risk factor for suicide in individuals with depression. Having a relative who has died by suicide increases the likelihood that an individual will experience similar thoughts and behaviors, possibly due to genetic, psychological, or environmental factors that make the individual more vulnerable to depression and suicidal ideation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Nihilistic ideas. Explanation: C. Nihilistic ideas: This is the correct answer because nihilistic ideas (e.g., the belief that life has no meaning or that the self is worthless in a broader, existential sense) are not required for diagnosing major depression. While such ideas may occur in some cases of depression (particularly in more severe forms), they are not part of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. The diagnosis can still be made without the presence of nihilistic or delusional thoughts. Therefore, nihilistic ideas are not mandatory for the diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Depressed mood: This is incorrect because depressed mood is one of the core criteria for diagnosing major depression. According to the DSM-5, depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia) are essential symptoms for diagnosing major depression, and the individual must experience at least one of these symptoms for a diagnosis to be made. B. Insomnia: This is incorrect because insomnia (difficulty sleeping) is one of the possible symptoms of major depression, although not every patient with depression will experience sleep disturbances. The DSM-5 recognizes several symptoms of depression, and sleep disturbances (either insomnia or hypersomnia) are part of the diagnostic criteria. Even though insomnia is not required for all patients, it is a common symptom in depression. D. Decreased concentration: This is incorrect because decreased concentration or difficulty thinking is one of the recognized symptoms of major depression. Individuals with depression often report poor concentration or trouble making decisions, and this symptom is included as one of the diagnostic criteria for major depression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pheochromocytoma. Explanation: C. Pheochromocytoma: This is the correct answer because pheochromocytoma is not commonly associated with depression. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal glands that primarily causes symptoms due to the excessive secretion of catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline). While pheochromocytoma can present with symptoms like hypertension, palpitations, sweating, and anxiety, it is not typically associated with depression. Therefore, it is the exception in this list of endocrine disorders. Incorrect Responses: A. Hypothyroidism: This is incorrect because hypothyroidism is strongly associated with depression. Low thyroid hormone levels can cause symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, lethargy, and mood disturbances, including depression. Depression is a well-documented psychiatric manifestation of hypothyroidism and it is an important consideration when evaluating patients with depressive symptoms. B. Hyperthyroidism: This is incorrect because hyperthyroidism can also be associated with mood disturbances, including symptoms of depression. While hyperthyroidism is more commonly associated with anxiety and irritability, it can lead to depressive symptoms, especially if untreated or if the individual has fluctuating thyroid hormone levels. Therefore, hyperthyroidism should be considered in patients with mood symptoms. D. Acromegaly: This is incorrect because acromegaly, a condition caused by excess growth hormone (often due to a pituitary tumor), can also present with depressive symptoms. People with acromegaly may experience changes in physical appearance, joint pain, and other systemic symptoms that can contribute to depression. Additionally, acromegaly has been linked to higher rates of mood disorders, including depression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Disorientation. Explanation: A. Disorientation: This is the correct answer because disorientation is not typically a feature of mania. Mania is characterized by elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, racing thoughts, impulsive behavior, and poor judgment, but disorientation (confusion about time, place, or person) is more commonly associated with conditions like delirium or severe cognitive impairments. Disorientation is not a hallmark feature of mania and would suggest the presence of another medical issue. Incorrect Responses: B. Delusion of grandeur: This is incorrect because delusions of grandeur are a common feature of mania. In a manic episode, individuals may have inflated self-esteem or a grandiose sense of importance, often believing they have special abilities or powers. This is a typical symptom seen in manic states, where the person may feel invincible or overly confident. C. Elation: This is incorrect because elation (an extreme sense of happiness, joy, or euphoria) is a key feature of mania. During manic episodes, individuals often experience intense feelings of elation or euphoria that are disproportionate to their circumstances. This elation is often combined with irritability or anger if the person's behavior or ideas are challenged. D. Pressure of speech: This is incorrect because pressure of speech is a classic symptom of mania. Individuals experiencing mania may speak very quickly, feeling as though they are unable to control the flow of their thoughts. Their speech can become rapid, loud, and difficult for others to interrupt or follow. This is a hallmark feature of the manic episode, reflecting the racing thoughts that accompany mania.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is used after MI. Explanation: D. Only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is used after MI: This statement is false. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression, it is not the only therapy used after myocardial infarction (MI). Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), are also commonly used in the treatment of depression post-MI, along with other forms of therapy such as supportive psychotherapy. Therefore, restricting treatment to only CBT is inaccurate. Both pharmacological treatments and psychotherapy may be considered, depending on the patient's needs and the severity of the depression. Incorrect Responses: A. Depression is a risk factor for MI: This statement is true. Depression has been identified as a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). Depressive symptoms can increase the risk of MI through mechanisms such as increased stress, inflammation, and poor lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity). Studies have shown that people with depression are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including MI. B. MI is a risk factor for depression: This statement is true. Myocardial infarction (MI) can lead to the development of depression due to the psychological and physical impact of a heart attack. The stress of coping with a serious health condition, the potential for changes in lifestyle, and concerns about future health can all contribute to the onset of depressive symptoms after an MI. Depression rates are notably high among those recovering from a heart attack. C. SSRIs can be used post MI for treatment of depression: This statement is true. SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) are commonly used in the treatment of depression after myocardial infarction (MI). SSRIs are considered safe and effective in this context and have been shown to improve depressive symptoms without significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. In fact, managing depression post-MI can improve the overall outcomes and quality of life for the patient.",

Anhedonia: Anhedonia refers to the inability to experience pleasure or interest in activities that were previously enjoyable or engaging. This is a psychological symptom, not a somatic symptom. Somatic symptoms are physical manifestations of illness or distress, whereas anhedonia is related to emotional and psychological experiences, often seen in depression. Therefore, anhedonia is not considered a somatic symptom. Incorrect Responses: B. Constipation: Constipation is a somatic symptom, as it involves physical discomfort or dysfunction in the digestive system. It is often a manifestation of physical or psychological distress, and can be associated with conditions like depression, anxiety, or certain medications. As a physical symptom, constipation falls under the category of somatic symptoms. C. Impotence: Impotence, or erectile dysfunction, is a somatic symptom that involves a physical issue with sexual function. It is often seen in psychological conditions like depression and anxiety but remains a physical symptom related to the body’s ability to function sexually. Impotence is considered a somatic symptom. D. Numbness: Numbness refers to a loss of sensation or feeling in a part of the body, which is a somatic symptom.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lesion of the left hemisphere. Explanation: B. Lesion of the left hemisphere: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is more commonly seen with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain. This is because the left hemisphere is involved in language, reasoning, and emotional regulation, particularly affecting mood regulation. Lesions in this region, especially in areas such as the left prefrontal cortex, have been linked to an increased risk of depression. Additionally, the left hemisphere is often involved in processes related to positive emotions, and damage here can lead to an emotional imbalance that predisposes individuals to depression following a stroke. Thus, left hemisphere lesions are more strongly associated with post-stroke depression. Incorrect Responses: A. Lesion of the right hemisphere: While right hemisphere lesions can also contribute to depression, they are generally more associated with apathy, lack of motivation, and other symptoms of disengagement rather than overt depressive mood states. The right hemisphere tends to affect emotional responses to external events and mood regulation, but the association between the left hemisphere and post-stroke depression is stronger. Therefore, lesions of the right hemisphere are less commonly linked to depression than those in the left hemisphere. C. Equal in both right & left: Research indicates that the risk of depression following a stroke is higher with left hemisphere lesions than with right hemisphere lesions. It is not equal in both hemispheres. Left hemisphere strokes are particularly associated with emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms, while right hemisphere strokes are more related to apathy and non-depressed states. Therefore, this option is incorrect. D. Does not depend on what hemisphere is involved: This statement is incorrect because there is a clear correlation between the location of the stroke and the likelihood of developing depression. Left hemisphere lesions are particularly associated with post-stroke depression due to the involvement of brain regions responsible for mood regulation. The statement that it \"does not depend on what hemisphere is involved\" overlooks these well-established findings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Positive dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Explanation: A. Positive dexamethasone suppression test (DST): This patient presents with symptoms of depression, including poor appetite, sleep disturbances, and loss of interest in normal activities. These are classic signs of major depressive disorder (MDD). One of the neuroendocrine abnormalities often associated with depression, particularly in patients with melancholic depression or more severe forms of depression, is an abnormal dexamethasone suppression test (DST). The DST is used to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In MDD, especially melancholic depression, there is typically a blunted or absent suppression of cortisol after administration of dexamethasone, leading to a positive DST. This abnormal response suggests dysregulation of the HPA axis, which is commonly observed in depressive disorders. Incorrect Responses: B. Normal growth hormone regulation: In depression, particularly with melancholic features, there may be decreased growth hormone secretion in response to stimuli (like exercise or sleep), but growth hormone regulation is not directly affected in the majority of depressive disorders. While growth hormone dysfunction can sometimes be associated with depression, it is not the primary laboratory finding in depression, making this option incorrect. C. Increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels: 5-HIAA is the major metabolite of serotonin, and elevated levels are typically associated with serotonergic dysfunction. While serotonin may be implicated in depression, increased 5-HIAA levels are more commonly associated with conditions like serotonin syndrome or carcinoid syndrome, rather than being a standard finding in depression. In fact, serotonin dysfunction in depression typically leads to decreased 5-HIAA levels, making this answer incorrect. D. Normal melatonin levels: Melatonin is a hormone involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, and it can be affected by depression, particularly in patients who have sleep disturbances. In some forms of depression, particularly those with sleep disturbances, melatonin levels may be altered, either increased or decreased. However, normal melatonin levels would not be the most likely laboratory finding in this patient with clear depressive symptoms, especially since sleep disturbances are a major feature of depression. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increase, decrease, increase. Explanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), which includes loss of appetite, lack of interest, and feelings of hopelessness. In individuals with depression, sleep disturbances are common, and these disturbances typically have specific patterns on sleep studies. Here’s what we can expect: Percentage of REM sleep (Increase): In depression, there is often increased REM sleep. This can result in more frequent and earlier onset of REM periods during the night, particularly in the second half of the night. Depression is associated with a shortening of the REM latency (the time taken to enter REM sleep), meaning REM sleep can begin earlier than usual. Percentage of delta sleep (Decrease): Delta sleep, or slow-wave sleep, which is the deepest, most restorative phase of non-REM sleep, decreases in depression. This means that the person may experience less restorative sleep, contributing to feelings of fatigue and low energy, which are characteristic of depression. Sleep latency (Increase): Sleep latency, or the amount of time it takes to fall asleep, tends to increase in depression. People with depression often have difficulty falling asleep, and may spend more time in bed before they are able to fall asleep, contributing to disrupted sleep patterns. Incorrect Responses: A. Increase, decrease, decrease: While REM sleep does increase in depression, delta sleep actually decreases, not increases. So, the second part of this option is incorrect, and sleep latency typically increases, not decreases. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Decrease, stay the same, increase: Although REM sleep is indeed often increased in depression, delta sleep does not stay the same; it typically decreases. Additionally, sleep latency increases, not just stays the same. Hence, this option is incorrect. D. Decrease, decrease, increase: While REM sleep may be increased in depression, delta sleep is typically decreased, not further decreased. This makes the first part of this answer wrong. Also, sleep latency would increase, not decrease. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Masked depression. Explanation: Masked depression (also known as somatized depression) refers to a type of depression where the individual presents primarily with physical symptoms, such as headaches, body aches, and pains, rather than the typical psychological symptoms of sadness or hopelessness that are often associated with depression. In this case, the patient has no psychological complaints like sadness but presents with physical symptoms (headaches and body aches) that resolve after a trial of antidepressants. The fact that the physical complaints resolved after treatment for depression strongly supports the diagnosis of masked depression, where the depressive symptoms are expressed primarily through somatic complaints. Incorrect Responses: A. Dysthymic disorder: Dysthymic disorder, or persistent depressive disorder, is characterized by a chronic low mood lasting for at least 2 years, with additional symptoms such as low energy, poor appetite, sleep disturbances, and low self-esteem. However, the primary feature is a depressed mood lasting for a prolonged period, which this patient does not report. The patient’s symptoms appear to be more related to somatic complaints rather than ongoing low mood, making this option incorrect. B. Major depressive disorder: Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves persistent sadness or hopelessness, along with a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including loss of interest and disruption in daily functioning. However, this patient does not report feelings of sadness or hopelessness, which are core features of MDD. Given that the patient’s primary complaints are physical symptoms that resolve with antidepressants, masked depression is a better fit. Therefore, MDD is incorrect. D. Hypochondriasis: Hypochondriasis, or illness anxiety disorder, involves a preoccupation with having a serious illness despite medical evaluation and reassurance showing no substantial physical evidence of disease. This patient, however, has had physical complaints that improved with antidepressant treatment, which is not typical of hypochondriasis. The fact that the patient’s symptoms resolved with antidepressant medication suggests that the underlying issue was depression rather than a persistent worry about illness. Therefore, hypochondriasis is incorrect.",
