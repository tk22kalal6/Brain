      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anxiety Neurosis The patient's fear of being harmed by schoolmates and the belief that classmates are laughing at and talking about him indicates a pattern of social anxiety or social phobia, which is a type of anxiety disorder. These symptoms are characteristic of anxiety neurosis, particularly the avoidance of situations where social interactions are involved, such as school or the market. The individual is excessively worried about being judged or criticized by others, which can lead to social withdrawal and avoidance behaviors. Anxiety neurosis is often marked by irrational fears, increased physiological arousal, and significant impairment in daily functioning. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (B) Manic Depressive Psychosis – Incorrect Manic depressive psychosis, now known as bipolar disorder, is characterized by extreme mood swings between mania (elevated mood, high energy, impulsivity) and depression (low mood, lack of energy, hopelessness). The patient described here does not exhibit these mood changes. Instead, the symptoms are more consistent with anxiety and social fear rather than mood fluctuations. There are no signs of mania or depression in this case, making bipolar disorder an unlikely diagnosis. (C) Adjustment Reaction – Incorrect An adjustment reaction involves an individual's difficulty in coping with a specific life stressor or major change, such as the loss of a loved one or starting a new school. The fear of being harmed and the belief that classmates are laughing at him are more indicative of a chronic anxiety issue, rather than a reaction to a specific life stressor. This is also a long-term issue that appears to be unrelated to any acute life change, ruling out adjustment disorder. (D) Schizophrenia – Incorrect While some of the patient's symptoms, such as paranoia and the belief that others are talking about him, might suggest delusional thinking, schizophrenia involves more severe and pervasive psychotic symptoms, such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and lack of insight. Schizophrenia typically presents with a longer duration of symptoms and a more pervasive impact on reality testing. In contrast, the symptoms described here are more characteristic of social anxiety and paranoia, rather than the full spectrum of psychosis seen in schizophrenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Depression The patient’s clinical presentation, characterized by central obesity, thin limbs, purple striae, and atrophic skin, is highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, which can be caused by a pituitary adenoma (often called Cushing's disease). Cushing's syndrome is associated with an increased level of cortisol, either due to excess production from the adrenal glands or from excessive stimulation by ACTH (as in pituitary adenomas). One of the most common psychiatric disorders associated with Cushing's syndrome is depression. This can present as mood disturbances, irritability, anxiety, anhedonia, and low energy. The link between cortisol dysregulation and depression is well-documented. Cortisol excess has a direct impact on brain regions like the hippocampus, leading to mood disturbances and cognitive changes. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (B) Psychosis – Incorrect While psychosis can occur in severe cases of Cushing's syndrome, it is much less common than depression. Psychosis is typically seen in the most extreme cases, particularly when the syndrome is untreated or inadequately managed. Depressive symptoms are more prevalent in the early stages and more likely to be the presenting psychiatric disorder. (C) Organic mental disorder – Incorrect An organic mental disorder refers to cognitive deficits and impairments due to a known physical cause (like brain injury or a neurodegenerative disease). While Cushing's syndrome can cause cognitive dysfunction due to high cortisol levels, it typically manifests with mood changes like depression or anxiety rather than being classified as an \"organic mental disorder.\" The cognitive effects tend to improve with treatment of the underlying hormonal imbalance. (D) Mania – Incorrect While mania can occur in some individuals with Cushing's syndrome, it is less common compared to depression. The hormonal imbalance typically causes depressive symptoms, and manic episodes are more often associated with other conditions, such as bipolar disorder. Mania may occur but is not the most typical psychiatric manifestation in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Panic attack The patient's symptoms of sudden palpitations, a sensation of impending doom, and chest constriction, lasting for 10-15 minutes and then resolving spontaneously, are characteristic of a panic attack. Panic attacks are typically short-lived episodes of intense fear or discomfort, accompanied by physical symptoms like palpitations, sweating, shaking, chest pain, and feelings of impending doom or fear of losing control. These episodes occur unexpectedly and can be very distressing, even though they are often brief and resolve without intervention. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Phobia – Incorrect A phobia is characterized by an excessive, persistent fear of a specific object or situation (e.g., heights, spiders, flying). Unlike panic attacks, phobias usually involve avoidance behaviors related to the feared object or situation, and the symptoms are typically triggered by the presence of that specific object or situation. The episode described in the case occurred suddenly without a clear trigger, which is more consistent with a panic attack. (B) Personality disorder – Incorrect Personality disorders involve long-standing patterns of behavior and inner experience that deviate markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture. These patterns are pervasive, inflexible, and often lead to distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms described in the case (i.e., sudden, brief onset of physical symptoms and fear) are more indicative of a panic attack rather than a personality disorder, which typically involves enduring patterns of behavior rather than acute episodes. (C) Generalized anxiety disorder – Incorrect Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves excessive, chronic worry and anxiety that is difficult to control and lasts for 6 months or more. In contrast, a panic attack is a sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes and resolves within a short period, as seen in the patient. While GAD can involve anxiety, the description of short-lived episodes is more consistent with a panic attack than with generalized anxiety disorder, which tends to be chronic and pervasive.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Agoraphobia The patient's symptoms of fear of leaving home, fear of traveling alone, and fear of being in a crowd, along with marked anxiety, palpitations, and sweating in these situations, are consistent with agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is characterized by an intense fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable, such as being in public places, traveling alone, or being in crowded situations. This anxiety often leads to avoidance of such situations, as seen in the patient's avoidance of public transport. The key feature of agoraphobia is the avoidance behavior to prevent triggering anxiety-provoking situations. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) – Incorrect Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves chronic worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, such as work, health, and social situations, and is not limited to specific situations or places. Unlike agoraphobia, which is focused on specific situations such as crowds or traveling, GAD typically presents with more pervasive and uncontrollable anxiety across a wide range of topics and situations. While both disorders involve anxiety, GAD does not have the specific situational fears and avoidance that are characteristic of agoraphobia. (B) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and impaired reality testing. The patient's symptoms of fear and anxiety in specific situations do not fit with schizophrenia, which involves more severe cognitive and perceptual disturbances, such as hearing voices or having delusions. The avoidance of specific situations and anxiety-related symptoms point more toward agoraphobia rather than schizophrenia. (C) Personality disorder – Incorrect Personality disorders involve long-standing patterns of behavior and inner experiences that are inflexible, persistent, and typically lead to impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. These patterns are usually consistent across various contexts and are not specific to particular situations. The patient's symptoms, including situational fear and avoidance, are more suggestive of a specific anxiety disorder (agoraphobia), rather than a personality disorder, which typically involves deeper, more pervasive patterns of behavior and inner experience.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) The woman’s symptoms, including night terrors, fearful thoughts related to a traumatic event (car accident), and avoidance of driving, are characteristic of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Common symptoms include intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of reminders (in this case, the car), and hyperarousal (e.g., feeling easily startled or unable to relax). The fact that the symptoms began after the traumatic car accident and are interfering with the patient’s ability to engage in activities such as driving further supports the diagnosis of PTSD. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Anxiety disorder – Incorrect While anxiety is a feature of PTSD, the diagnosis of anxiety disorder alone does not fully capture the trauma-specific nature of the woman’s symptoms. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or other types of anxiety disorders involve excessive worry, but these conditions do not have the clear connection to a specific traumatic event (such as the car accident) that is seen in PTSD. In PTSD, the symptoms are specifically triggered by the trauma, such as nightmares or avoidance related to driving, which are not typical in generalized anxiety disorder. (B) Phobia – Incorrect A phobia is an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation (e.g., fear of spiders or heights). In this case, the woman’s fear of driving may appear phobic in nature, but it is better explained as a symptom of PTSD because the fear stems directly from the traumatic event (the car accident). Phobias typically do not involve the intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, or nightmares that characterize PTSD. (C) Conversion disorder – Incorrect Conversion disorder involves the loss of physical function or motor symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness) without any underlying medical cause, often triggered by psychological stress or trauma. In this case, the woman’s symptoms do not include any neurological or motor impairments; instead, they are related to psychological distress and trauma-related symptoms (night terrors, avoidance of driving), which is a hallmark of PTSD, not conversion disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypochondriasis The most probable diagnosis for Lalu Prasad is hypochondriasis (now referred to as illness anxiety disorder in the DSM-5). Hypochondriasis involves an excessive preoccupation with the fear of having a serious medical condition, despite reassurance from doctors and normal test results. Lalu has been consulting multiple neurologists and requesting additional tests, yet his belief that he has a brain tumor persists even though all investigations have been normal. This persistent anxiety about having a serious illness, in the absence of any substantial evidence, points to hypochondriasis. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (B) Somatization disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder (now called somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5) is characterized by the presence of multiple physical symptoms (such as pain, fatigue, or gastrointestinal complaints) that are unexplained and not consistent with a medical diagnosis. While Lalu does have headache, which is a physical symptom, the key feature of somatization disorder is the presence of multiple unexplained symptoms affecting different organ systems, rather than a preoccupation with one specific illness, as seen in Lalu’s case. Additionally, Lalu’s primary issue seems to be his belief in having a brain tumor, rather than a broad range of unexplained physical complaints. (C) Somatoform pain disorder – Incorrect Somatoform pain disorder (now included under somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain in DSM-5) involves chronic pain without a clear medical cause, and the pain causes significant distress or impairment. In Lalu’s case, he is experiencing headache, but his primary concern is the fear of having a brain tumor, not the pain itself. His anxiety and obsession with being diagnosed with a serious condition, despite normal investigations, make hypochondriasis a more appropriate diagnosis than somatoform pain disorder. (D) Conversion disorder – Incorrect Conversion disorder (also known as functional neurological symptom disorder) involves neurological symptoms, such as paralysis, seizures, or blindness, that cannot be explained by medical conditions, and are thought to be psychologically induced. Lalu’s main complaint is a headache and a belief in having a brain tumor, which are not neurological symptoms consistent with conversion disorder. He is not experiencing any neurological deficits like paralysis or blindness, so conversion disorder is not applicable here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypochondriacal disorder The most likely diagnosis for this patient is hypochondriacal disorder (also referred to as illness anxiety disorder in DSM-5). Hypochondriacal disorder involves an excessive and irrational preoccupation with the fear of having a serious illness, despite evidence to the contrary from medical examinations and tests. In this case, the patient believes he has lung carcinoma despite no significant clinical findings or relevant investigations showing any abnormalities. The patient's persistent belief and the fact that he spends excessive money, time, and energy on getting unduly investigated further support this diagnosis. His pre-morbid anxious traits also suggest that he may be prone to worrying excessively about his health. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Carcinoma lung – Incorrect This diagnosis would imply that the patient actually has lung cancer. However, this is not the case, as the patient’s clinical examination and investigations are normal, and there is no significant clinical finding to support the diagnosis of lung carcinoma. Therefore, carcinoma lung is not applicable in this case. (C) Delusional disorder – Incorrect Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of delusions, which are fixed, false beliefs that are not based in reality. However, the patient’s belief in having lung cancer is more consistent with health anxiety than a delusion. In delusional disorder, the beliefs are often not influenced by evidence to the contrary, whereas in hypochondriacal disorder, the anxiety about health persists despite medical reassurance and normal test results. The belief is excessive but not as fixed and unshakable as a delusion. Hence, delusional disorder is not the most appropriate diagnosis. (D) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering refers to intentional fabrication or exaggeration of symptoms for secondary gain, such as avoiding work or seeking financial compensation. There is no evidence that the patient is intentionally feigning illness for external gain. He seems genuinely concerned about his health, even though his belief in having lung cancer is unjustified. This distinguishes his condition from malingering.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Factitious disorder The most likely diagnosis for this patient is factitious disorder. Factitious disorder is characterized by the intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological symptoms in order to assume the sick role and gain attention, typically without any external incentives like financial gain. In this case, the patient has a history of repeated hospital visits for vague complaints (e.g., abdominal pain, headache) and multiple abdominal scars from previous surgeries. Despite no significant findings during examination or tests, the patient continues to demand unnecessary diagnostic procedures, such as a liver biopsy, and seems to maintain a sick role by seeking attention from medical staff. This behavior is consistent with factitious disorder, where individuals intentionally produce symptoms to assume the role of a patient and gain attention, sympathy, and care from others. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and other significant cognitive or behavioral dysfunctions. The patient in this case does not exhibit any major psychopathology or symptoms like delusions or hallucinations, which are core features of schizophrenia. His symptoms seem to be focused on gaining attention through physical illness rather than exhibiting psychotic symptoms, making schizophrenia an unlikely diagnosis. (B) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering involves the intentional production of false symptoms for external gain, such as financial compensation, avoiding work, or avoiding legal responsibilities. Unlike factitious disorder, malingering is driven by a clear external motive. In this case, there is no evidence of external gain (e.g., financial compensation or avoiding responsibilities). The patient appears to be seeking attention and sympathy rather than material benefits, so malingering is less likely. (C) Somatisation disorder – Incorrect Somatisation disorder (now referred to as somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5) involves the presence of multiple physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by medical or physiological conditions, and the patient may be excessively concerned about these symptoms. However, unlike factitious disorder, the symptoms in somatic symptom disorder are not intentionally produced. The patient in this case is deliberately requesting unnecessary medical tests and surgeries to maintain the sick role, which points more toward factitious disorder than somatization disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Social phobia The most likely diagnosis is social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder. The key features of this condition include intense fear and anxiety about social situations, particularly where the person is worried about being judged or negatively evaluated by others. The patient’s symptoms, such as tachycardia when delivering a lecture, poor performance in front of seniors, and avoidance of parties, fit well with social phobia. This disorder often leads to avoidance of social situations, and physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia, can occur when the person is faced with situations involving potential social scrutiny. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Panic disorder – Incorrect Panic disorder involves recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, which are characterized by sudden, intense episodes of fear or discomfort. These attacks are accompanied by physical symptoms such as sweating, chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath, but panic disorder is not limited to fear of social situations. The individual described in the question does not experience spontaneous panic attacks, but rather has anxiety specifically about social situations (e.g., delivering lectures or attending parties), making social phobia a better diagnosis. (B) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and impaired functioning. There is no indication of these psychotic features in the description provided. The individual is experiencing social anxiety, not delusions or hallucinations, so schizophrenia is not a likely diagnosis. (D) Avoidant personality – Incorrect Avoidant personality disorder involves a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and a hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, but the individual’s anxiety and avoidance are typically much more generalized and pervasive across many areas of life, not just specific to social situations. While there are similarities, the key distinction is that avoidant personality disorder involves a broader and more chronic pattern of avoidance and inhibition that affects the person's overall functioning, whereas social phobia is more specific to performance or interaction-based anxiety in particular social situations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Specific phobia The most likely diagnosis is specific phobia. This disorder is characterized by an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation, leading to avoidance behavior. In this case, the secretary has a persistent fear of elevators that she has experienced since childhood, despite having no traumatic event related to elevators. Her avoidance behavior (climbing 12 flights of stairs daily) is typical of specific phobia, where the fear is focused on a particular object or situation. This fear is disproportionate to the actual danger, and the person often goes to great lengths to avoid the feared object or situation. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Social phobia – Incorrect Social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder, involves an intense fear of being negatively evaluated or embarrassed in social situations. The individual fears situations where they may be judged by others, such as public speaking, attending parties, or meeting new people. This is different from the secretary's fear, which is limited to a specific object (the elevator) and not related to social evaluation, making social phobia an unlikely diagnosis. (B) Generalized anxiety disorder – Incorrect Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, chronic worry about a variety of situations or events, often involving multiple areas of life. However, it is not typically focused on a single specific object or situation like the secretary’s fear of elevators. In GAD, the anxiety tends to be more generalized rather than being tied to a particular situation, such as in this case. Therefore, GAD does not explain the secretary’s focused fear of elevators. (D) Agoraphobia – Incorrect Agoraphobia is characterized by a fear of being in places or situations where escape might be difficult, or help unavailable, in the event of a panic attack or other distressing symptoms. It usually involves fear of open spaces, crowded places, or situations where the person feels trapped, such as shopping malls or public transportation. In this case, the secretary's fear is specific to elevators and is not tied to open spaces or situations requiring escape, making agoraphobia less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Delirium The most likely diagnosis is delirium, which is an acute confusional state characterized by disturbance in attention, awareness, and cognition. This patient is not oriented to time or place, and exhibits agitation and hallucinations (i.e., believing someone is trying to kill him). Delirium commonly occurs in hospitalized patients, particularly following a serious illness like pneumonia. It can be precipitated by factors such as infection, medications, or hospitalization. Delirium usually develops over a short period (days to weeks), and is characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness and cognitive impairment, all of which fit the presentation in this patient. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Dementia – Incorrect Dementia is a chronic condition involving progressive cognitive decline, including memory loss and impaired judgment. Unlike delirium, dementia develops slowly over months or years and does not present with sudden onset of agitation, hallucinations, or disorientation as in this patient. Furthermore, the patient’s acute confusion following hospitalization for pneumonia makes delirium a more likely diagnosis than dementia. (B) Fugue state – Incorrect A fugue state is a rare dissociative disorder where the person forgets their identity and may travel away from their usual environment. It involves memory loss and often involves wandering, but delusions or hallucinations (such as believing someone is out to kill them) are not typical. Additionally, there is no indication in this case that the patient has lost their identity or engaged in any wandering behavior. Therefore, fugue state is unlikely. (D) Brief psychotic episode – Incorrect A brief psychotic episode involves the sudden onset of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech, but typically lasts for a day to a month and is often linked to a major stressor. While psychosis is present, this patient’s symptoms are more likely acute confusion with disorientation, which is characteristic of delirium rather than a brief psychotic episode. The acute onset after hospitalization and pneumonia further supports delirium over a psychotic disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Reality contact is lost. Depersonalization disorder is a type of dissociative disorder in which individuals experience a persistent or recurrent feeling of detachment from their own thoughts, feelings, body, or actions. However, reality testing remains intact, meaning the person is aware that their experiences of detachment or unreality are not truly happening. This is a key differentiating factor between depersonalization and psychotic disorders, where reality contact is indeed lost. Patients with depersonalization often describe feeling like an observer of themselves, as if they are watching their life as an outsider, but they do not actually lose touch with reality. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) More common after life-threatening trauma – Correct Depersonalization can be triggered by extreme stress or trauma, including life-threatening experiences such as accidents, assault, or war. It is a common dissociative response to overwhelming situations as the brain tries to protect itself from distressing emotions. B) Can be seen in seizure and migraine patients – Correct Depersonalization symptoms can occur in patients with neurological conditions such as temporal lobe epilepsy, migraines, or head trauma. These conditions can affect brain regions responsible for perception, self-awareness, and consciousness, leading to transient episodes of depersonalization. C) More common in females than males – Correct Research suggests that depersonalization disorder and dissociative symptoms, in general, are more frequently reported in females than males. This could be due to hormonal influences, differences in stress response, or higher prevalence of trauma-related disorders among females.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Caffeine. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that can worsen symptoms of depersonalization and derealization by increasing anxiety, agitation, and hyperarousal. Since depersonalization disorder is often linked to heightened stress and overactivation of the brain’s fear circuits, stimulants like caffeine can exacerbate these symptoms by increasing excitatory neurotransmission. Additionally, caffeine can interfere with sleep, which is crucial for emotional regulation, further worsening depersonalization symptoms. Patients with depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR) are often advised to limit caffeine intake to prevent symptom exacerbation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Clozapine – Incorrect Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Unlike stimulants, it has sedative and anxiolytic properties, which could potentially help rather than worsen depersonalization symptoms. Clozapine does not typically induce or aggravate dissociative symptoms. C) Lamotrigine – Incorrect Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant used in bipolar disorder and epilepsy. Some studies suggest that it may actually help treat depersonalization symptoms, possibly by stabilizing glutamate transmission and reducing cortical hyperexcitability. Thus, it is unlikely to worsen the condition. D) Clonazepam – Incorrect Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine with potent anxiolytic and sedative effects. While long-term benzodiazepine use can lead to dependence and withdrawal symptoms, in the short term, clonazepam is often used to reduce anxiety and associated dissociative symptoms, rather than worsening them.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Acute Stress Disorder occurs after a traumatic event and is characterized by symptoms such as intrusive memories, nightmares, emotional distress, dissociation, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors. These symptoms occur within 3 days to 1 month following the trauma. In this case, the woman has experienced a severe traumatic event (witnessing the death of her child in an accident) and has developed symptoms including nightmares, emotional outbursts, hyperarousal (difficulty sleeping, headaches, poor concentration), and avoidance (refusing to ride in a car), all of which are hallmark features of ASD. If these symptoms persist beyond one month, the diagnosis may change to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Adjustment Disorder – Incorrect Adjustment Disorder occurs in response to an identifiable non-traumatic stressor (e.g., job loss, divorce, financial difficulties) and involves emotional or behavioral symptoms that do not meet criteria for PTSD or ASD. The symptoms in this case (nightmares, dissociation, avoidance, and hyperarousal) strongly suggest a trauma-related disorder rather than an adjustment disorder. B) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – Incorrect PTSD shares many symptoms with ASD, including intrusive thoughts, nightmares, emotional distress, and avoidance. However, the key difference is the duration. PTSD is diagnosed only if symptoms persist beyond one month. Since this patient has had symptoms for only 3 weeks, ASD is the more appropriate diagnosis. D) Bereavement Reaction – Incorrect Bereavement or grief is a natural response to losing a loved one. While grief can involve sadness, crying, and difficulty sleeping, it does not typically include intrusive nightmares, dissociation, or avoidance behaviors related to trauma. The woman’s symptoms indicate a trauma-related disorder rather than a typical bereavement reaction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Suppression. Suppression is a conscious defense mechanism in which a person intentionally pushes distressing thoughts or impulses out of awareness. In contrast, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) operates primarily through unconscious defense mechanisms. Individuals with OCD experience intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to reduce anxiety. Because suppression is a voluntary process, it is not a major defense mechanism involved in OCD, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Displacement – Correct Displacement is an unconscious defense mechanism where a person redirects emotions or impulses from an unacceptable target to a more acceptable one. In OCD, anxiety from an internal conflict may be displaced onto compulsive behaviors. For example, an individual with obsessive fears about contamination may compulsively wash their hands to manage the anxiety instead of directly confronting the fear. C) Isolation of Affect – Correct Isolation of affect refers to separating emotions from thoughts or events to reduce distress. In OCD, individuals may intellectually acknowledge their intrusive thoughts but experience a disconnection from the emotions associated with them. For example, a person with violent obsessions may recognize the thought but feel emotionally detached from its significance. D) Undoing – Correct Undoing is a defense mechanism where a person attempts to \"cancel out\" or reverse an unacceptable thought or action. This is a key feature of OCD, where compulsions serve as a way to \"neutralize\" distressing obsessions. For example, someone who has intrusive thoughts about harming others may compulsively pray or perform rituals to \"undo\" the thought.",

The patient is very frustrated that physicians have been unable to arrive at a diagnosis and pleads for help. Her father died of colon cancer 5 years ago at 65.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD). SSD is characterized by excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms that cause significant distress and impairment. The key features of SSD include: Persistent physical symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, bloating) for at least 6 months despite negative medical evaluations. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms, such as frequent doctor visits, repeated medical tests, or an inability to focus on anything else. Significant distress and functional impairment (e.g., inability to work due to constant concern about symptoms). In this case, the patient has experienced chronic, unexplained abdominal pain, has undergone multiple medical evaluations without a clear diagnosis, and remains highly preoccupied with her symptoms, all of which strongly suggest Somatic Symptom Disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Factitious Disorder – Incorrect Factitious Disorder involves intentional fabrication or exaggeration of symptoms to assume the \"sick role\" and receive medical attention. However, patients with SSD genuinely believe their symptoms are real and are not consciously feigning illness. This patient’s frustration and repeated attempts to find a diagnosis suggest she is not deliberately faking symptoms. C) Illness Anxiety Disorder – Incorrect Illness Anxiety Disorder (formerly hypochondriasis) involves excessive fear of having a serious illness, despite minimal or no actual symptoms. These patients are primarily preoccupied with the idea of being ill rather than experiencing significant physical symptoms. In contrast, this patient has persistent, distressing physical symptoms, making SSD the better fit. D) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering involves intentionally exaggerating or feigning symptoms for external gain, such as financial compensation, obtaining medications, or avoiding responsibilities (e.g., work, legal consequences). This patient does not appear to be seeking any clear external benefits, making malingering unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. Adjustment Disorder occurs within 3 months of an identifiable stressor and involves excessive emotional or behavioral symptoms that are disproportionate to the stressor but do not meet criteria for another psychiatric disorder. In this case, the stressor is the transition to college and living alone, which has led to persistent anxiety, excessive worry about safety, difficulty sleeping, and fatigue affecting her daily functioning. Since these symptoms developed in response to a clear life change, they fit the diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety rather than a primary anxiety disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Acute Stress Disorder – Incorrect Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) occurs after exposure to a traumatic event (e.g., life-threatening event, assault, serious accident) and includes intrusive memories, flashbacks, dissociation, and hyperarousal. In contrast, this patient’s symptoms stem from a non-traumatic stressor (moving to college) and do not involve trauma-related symptoms, making ASD an unlikely diagnosis. C) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) – Incorrect GAD involves excessive and uncontrollable worry about multiple aspects of life (e.g., finances, health, work, school) for at least 6 months. The patient’s anxiety is specific to a recent stressor (living alone in college) rather than a chronic, generalized pattern of worry. Additionally, GAD is not typically triggered by a single life event, making Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety the better diagnosis. D) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) – Incorrect OCD is characterized by intrusive, recurrent obsessions (unwanted thoughts) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors performed to reduce anxiety). This patient’s excessive worry about safety does not involve compulsive rituals or repetitive behaviors, which are hallmark features of OCD. Thus, her symptoms are better explained by anxiety related to an identifiable stressor rather than OCD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) GAD Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry over many aspects of one's life; including work, family, finances, health, etc. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder have a hard time keeping these worries out of their mind, which can cause significant impairment in their daily functioning. They also may frequently experience symptoms of fatigue, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbance. The patient described in the above vignette displays many of the classic symptoms commonly seen in association with GAD. (Choice A) Acute stress disorder is very similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, with anxiety symptoms developing after experiencing or witnessing an event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury. However, symptoms in acute stress disorder do not last longer than one month. (Choice D) Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by multiple obsessions or intrusive thoughts that cause significant anxiety, or forced engagement of repetitive compulsions in an attempt to avoid otherwise significant psychological stress. Patients with OCD often recognize the unreasonable nature of their thoughts and behaviors, but are unable to stop them due to ever-increasing anxiety. (Choice E) Patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder have a preoccupation with orderliness and perfectionism that negatively impacts their functioning. They are often overly devoted to their work, are stubborn, and believe there is only one way to do things. They can have difficulty throwing out worn items, often have trouble with relationships because of their need for perfection, and even need to play games by following the rules precisely. They often do not see their behavior as a problem. (Choice F) Patients with paranoid personality disorder have a life-long pattern of distrust and suspiciousness of others. They often read too much into things, accuse others of trying to harm them in some way, and bear grudges. However, their suspiciousness is not to the level of a delusion. (Choice G) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by symptoms of anxiety that develop after experiencing or witnessing an event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury. Patients with PTSD often re-live the event through flashbacks or nightmares, avoid stimuli related to the trauma, may feel detached from others, and often have associated symptoms such as insomnia or hypervigilance. Symptoms of PTSD last longer than one month. (Choice H) Patients with social phobia show a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations accompanied by unreasonable fears that they will be humiliated or embarrassed. Affected patients will avoid these situations, and they can have panic attacks if forced into them. They usually realize that their fears are unreasonable and excessive",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cardiomyopathy. Psychosomatic disorders are conditions where psychological factors contribute to the development, progression, or exacerbation of a physical illness. These disorders are influenced by stress, emotions, and mental health conditions, but they typically involve a well-documented interaction between the mind and body. Cardiomyopathy, however, is primarily a structural and functional disorder of the heart muscle, often caused by genetic factors, infections, hypertension, or toxins such as alcohol. While stress can exacerbate cardiovascular diseases (e.g., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy), cardiomyopathy itself is not classically considered a psychosomatic disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Rheumatoid Arthritis – Correct Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder, but psychological stress has been linked to its onset and exacerbation. Emotional distress can trigger flare-ups, and patients with RA often experience higher levels of anxiety and depression, which can worsen their symptoms. Thus, RA has a psychosomatic component. C) Neurodermatitis – Correct Neurodermatitis, also known as lichen simplex chronicus, is a chronic skin condition characterized by itching and scratching in response to psychological stress or anxiety. It is directly linked to emotional and mental health factors, making it a classic example of a psychosomatic disorder. D) Ulcerative Colitis – Correct Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but stress and psychological factors play a significant role in its onset and exacerbation. Studies have shown that emotional distress can lead to increased disease activity and flare-ups, making it a recognized psychosomatic disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Antidepressant. This patient’s symptoms—persistent difficulty discarding possessions, excessive accumulation of items, distress associated with getting rid of objects, and significant impairment in daily life—are characteristic of Hoarding Disorder, a subtype of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. The first-line treatment for Hoarding Disorder includes Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically exposure therapy with response prevention. However, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant, are also effective in reducing hoarding behaviors. Even though hoarding was previously considered a symptom of OCD, it is now recognized as a distinct disorder, but it still responds well to SSRIs like fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, or sertraline. Since this patient experiences significant distress and impairment, initiating an SSRI alongside CBT is the most appropriate initial treatment approach. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Reassurance – Incorrect Simply reassuring the patient does not address the underlying pathology of Hoarding Disorder. While supportive therapy can be helpful, patients with hoarding behaviors require structured cognitive behavioral therapy and/or pharmacological treatment to manage their condition. B) Benzodiazepine (short-acting) – Incorrect Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, lorazepam) are not first-line treatments for Hoarding Disorder. They may provide temporary relief for anxiety but do not address the core symptoms of hoarding, and long-term use can lead to dependency. C) Antipsychotic – Incorrect Antipsychotic medications (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine) are primarily used for psychotic disorders, severe OCD, or treatment-resistant cases. However, Hoarding Disorder is not associated with psychosis, and antipsychotics are not considered first-line treatments. SSRIs are preferred.",

While it is common for children to experience some fear of the dark, nyctophobia becomes clinically significant when it causes excessive anxiety, distress, and avoidance behaviors that interfere with daily functioning. Individuals with this phobia may refuse to sleep without lights on, experience panic attacks in dark environments, or avoid nighttime activities altogether. This condition is classified under specific phobias (situational type) in the DSM-5 and is typically treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Claustrophobia – Incorrect Claustrophobia refers to the fear of confined or enclosed spaces, such as elevators, small rooms, or crowded places. Individuals with claustrophobia experience intense anxiety and panic in tight spaces, but their fear is unrelated to darkness, making it an incorrect answer. B) Xenophobia – Incorrect Xenophobia is the fear or intense dislike of strangers, foreigners, or people from different cultural backgrounds. This is a social or cultural phenomenon rather than a specific phobia related to darkness, making it an incorrect option. C) Mysophobia – Incorrect Mysophobia, also known as germophobia, is the excessive fear of germs, dirt, or contamination. People with mysophobia may engage in compulsive hand-washing, excessive cleaning, or avoidance of places perceived as unclean.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Agoraphobia with Panic Attack. This patient describes episodes of dizziness, intense fear of dying, and avoidance of open spaces due to fear of experiencing an attack and being unable to escape, which are hallmark symptoms of agoraphobia with panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and include symptoms like dizziness, palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain, and a fear of losing control or dying. Agoraphobia involves anxiety about being in places where escape might be difficult or help may not be available in the event of a panic attack. This often leads to avoidance behaviors, such as refusing to leave home or avoiding crowded or open spaces. The key factor in this case is that the patient is avoiding open spaces due to fear of experiencing another attack, which aligns with Agoraphobia with Panic Attacks. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Acute Anxiety Attack – Incorrect An acute anxiety attack (also called a situational anxiety attack) is a response to a specific stressor, such as a traumatic event, bad news, or overwhelming worry. It is not the same as a panic attack, which occurs spontaneously and unpredictably. The patient describes recurrent attacks and avoidance behavior, which are more characteristic of agoraphobia with panic attacks, rather than an isolated anxiety episode. C) Agoraphobia without Panic Attack – Incorrect Agoraphobia can occur with or without panic attacks. However, in agoraphobia without panic attacks, the fear is typically related to general distress in certain places rather than previous experiences of panic attacks. Since this patient describes actual panic attacks with a fear of being immobilized, the correct diagnosis includes both agoraphobia and panic attacks. D) Panic Disorder – Incorrect Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks but without significant avoidance behaviors. While this patient does experience panic attacks, her avoidance of open spaces due to fear of having another attack suggests agoraphobia in addition to panic attacks, making option B the better fit.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It is a conversion symptom. Blocq’s disease refers to a conversion disorder symptom, specifically astasia-abasia, which is characterized by inability to stand or walk normally despite having intact motor function and neurological examination. Patients with this condition may display bizarre, uncoordinated movements, exaggerated swaying, or sudden collapses without injury, yet they can often move their legs normally when lying down. It is considered a functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder), in which psychological stress is unconsciously converted into physical symptoms. Jean-Martin Charcot first described this phenomenon. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) It is a psychotic disorder – Incorrect Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, involve symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. Blocq’s disease is not associated with psychotic symptoms but rather with motor disturbances of a conversion disorder, making this option incorrect. C) It is a type of somatoform disorder – Incorrect While conversion disorder falls under somatic symptom and related disorders (previously called somatoform disorders in DSM-IV), not all somatoform disorders involve neurological symptoms. Disorders like somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder primarily involve excessive worry about physical symptoms or illness rather than functional neurological deficits. Since Blocq’s disease is specifically a conversion disorder symptom, it is more accurately classified under functional neurological symptom disorder rather than general somatoform disorders. D) It is a type of organic mental disorder – Incorrect Organic mental disorders (now referred to as neurocognitive disorders) result from brain injury, neurodegeneration, or medical conditions affecting cognition, such as dementia or delirium. Blocq’s disease is not caused by an organic brain disorder, but rather by a psychological process manifesting as a motor symptom, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hoarding behavior. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy, a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), is the gold standard treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It works by gradually exposing patients to their fears while preventing compulsive behaviors. However, ERP has a poor prognosis in patients with hoarding behavior, as hoarding is often ego-syntonic, meaning patients do not perceive it as a problem and are resistant to treatment. Unlike other OCD subtypes, where patients recognize their obsessions as distressing and intrusive, individuals with hoarding disorder often form emotional attachments to their possessions and resist discarding them, leading to poor treatment response. Additionally, hoarding disorder has been recognized as a separate disorder in DSM-5 due to its distinct neurobiological basis and poor response to traditional OCD treatments. It often requires more intensive interventions, including cognitive restructuring, motivational interviewing, and sometimes pharmacotherapy (SSRIs), in addition to ERP. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Pathological doubt – Incorrect Pathological doubt involves constant uncertainty about whether an action has been performed correctly (e.g., repeatedly checking if the door is locked or the stove is off). ERP is highly effective for this subtype, as it gradually reduces the urge to check by exposing patients to their fears and preventing compulsive behavior. B) Contamination of dirt – Incorrect Fear of contamination (germophobia or fear of dirt) is one of the most treatable OCD subtypes with ERP. Patients are gradually exposed to \"contaminated\" objects without performing compulsive hand-washing or cleaning, leading to habituation and reduced anxiety over time. D) Magical thinking – Incorrect Magical thinking in OCD involves irrational beliefs that certain thoughts or actions can influence unrelated events (e.g., \"If I don’t count to 10, my family will die\"). While challenging, ERP is still effective, as it exposes patients to feared thoughts without allowing them to engage in rituals, eventually breaking the connection between thought and feared consequence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Caudate nucleus (Brain areas involved in ocd) “Neuroimaging in patients with OCD has produced converging data implicating altered function in the neurocircuitry between orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, and thalamus. Various functional brain-imaging studies—for example, positron emission tomography (PET)—have shown increased activity (e.g., metabolism and blood flow) in the frontal lobes, the basal ganglia (especially the caudate), and the cingulum of patients with OCD. The involvement of these areas in the pathology of OCD appears more associated with corticostriatal pathways than with the amygdala pathways, which are the current focus of much anxiety disorder research. Data from functional brain-imaging studies are consistent with data from structural brain-imaging studies. Both computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found bilaterally smaller caudates in patients with OCD. Both functional and structural brain-imaging study results are also compatible with the observation that neurological procedures involving the cingulum (cingulotomy) are sometimes effective in the treatment of OCD.”",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Amnesia. Dissociative amnesia is the most common type of dissociative disorder. It is characterized by an inability to recall important personal information, typically due to psychological stress or trauma, rather than a neurological cause. This condition often involves localized or selective memory loss related to traumatic events. Patients may forget specific incidents, entire periods of their life, or even their identity in extreme cases. Unlike other dissociative disorders, dissociative amnesia does not involve the formation of alternate personalities or travel to a new location (as in fugue states). Dissociative amnesia is a defense mechanism, helping the individual cope with severe emotional distress by blocking out painful memories. Treatment typically includes psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), hypnosis, and, in some cases, medication for comorbid anxiety or depression. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Fugue – Incorrect Dissociative fugue is a rare subtype of dissociative amnesia where a person unexpectedly travels away from home or work and may assume a new identity due to memory loss. It is less common than dissociative amnesia alone, making it an incorrect answer. C) Identity Disorder – Incorrect Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly called multiple personality disorder, involves two or more distinct personality states that control a person’s behavior at different times. While it is a well-known dissociative disorder, it is far less common than dissociative amnesia. DID is typically linked to severe childhood trauma, and patients may have significant memory gaps. However, due to its lower prevalence, it is not the most common dissociative disorder. D) Trance and Possession Disorder – Incorrect This disorder involves a temporary alteration in consciousness, identity, or behavior, where a person may feel possessed by a spirit or another entity. It is more common in certain cultural or religious contexts but is not the most common type of dissociative disorder overall.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) It is more commonly seen in elderly as compared to young. Adjustment disorder is more commonly seen in young individuals than in the elderly. It occurs in response to a stressful life event, such as relationship issues, job loss, financial difficulties, or academic stress. Younger individuals experience more frequent and intense life transitions, making them more susceptible to adjustment disorder. While elderly individuals can also develop adjustment disorder, it is less common in them compared to younger populations. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Onset of symptoms must be within 1 month of stress (ICD criteria) – Correct According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 and ICD-11), adjustment disorder symptoms must develop within one month after exposure to a stressful event. This timeline helps differentiate adjustment disorder from other psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which may have delayed onset. B) Onset of symptoms must be within 3 months of stress (DSM criteria) – Correct The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines adjustment disorder as symptoms developing within three months of the stressor. This broader timeline accounts for delayed psychological responses to stressful events. C) Symptoms must improve within 6 months of termination of stress – Correct Both ICD and DSM criteria state that adjustment disorder is a time-limited condition. Symptoms should resolve within six months after the stressor is removed or the individual has adapted. If symptoms persist beyond this timeframe, a different diagnosis, such as major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, should be considered.",

The grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following the loss (more than 6 months at a minimum) and clearly exceeds expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s culture and context. Grief reactions that have persisted for longer periods that are within a normative period of grieving given the person’s cultural and religious context are viewed as normal bereavement responses and are not assigned a diagnosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Panic attack. A panic attack is a sudden, intense episode of overwhelming fear or discomfort that peaks within 10–15 minutes and is often accompanied by physical and psychological symptoms. This patient’s symptoms of sudden onset palpitations, chest tightness, and a sensation of impending doom are hallmark features of a panic attack. Other common symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, trembling, nausea, and derealization. Panic attacks can occur unexpectedly or be triggered by specific stressors. While a panic attack itself is not a disorder, recurrent panic attacks with persistent fear of future attacks suggest panic disorder. First-line treatment includes cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), while benzodiazepines may be used for acute symptom relief in severe cases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Phobia – Incorrect Phobias involve an intense, irrational fear of a specific object, situation, or activity (e.g., fear of heights, spiders, or flying). The key difference is that panic attacks occur suddenly without an identifiable trigger, whereas phobic reactions only happen when exposed to the feared stimulus. Additionally, phobias typically do not cause spontaneous physical symptoms like palpitations or chest tightness. B) Personality Disorder – Incorrect Personality disorders are long-term, pervasive patterns of behavior, emotion, and cognition that affect interpersonal relationships. They do not present with acute panic-like symptoms such as sudden onset of palpitations and chest tightness lasting for 10–15 minutes. C) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) – Incorrect GAD is characterized by chronic, excessive worry about multiple aspects of life (e.g., health, work, relationships) for at least six months. Unlike panic attacks, GAD does not involve sudden, intense episodes of fear with autonomic symptoms like palpitations and chest tightness. Instead, symptoms of GAD are persistent, gradual, and more generalized over time.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is characterized by intense fear or anxiety about being in situations where escape might be difficult or help may not be available in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating situations. Commonly feared situations include leaving home alone, traveling alone, being in a crowd, using public transportation, or being in open or enclosed spaces. The patient experiences marked anxiety, palpitations, and sweating in these situations, leading to avoidance behavior, such as not using public transport to go to work. Agoraphobia often develops after one or more panic attacks, but it can also occur without a history of panic disorder. The avoidance behavior significantly impacts daily functioning, leading to social, occupational, and personal distress. Treatment typically includes Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) – Incorrect GAD involves chronic, excessive worry about various aspects of life, such as health, work, or relationships, for at least six months. Unlike agoraphobia, GAD is not characterized by specific fears related to public spaces or traveling alone. GAD symptoms are persistent and generalized, rather than triggered by particular situations. B) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder involving hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and impaired functioning. While anxiety can co-occur with schizophrenia, the specific situational fears and avoidance behaviors described are more indicative of agoraphobia than schizophrenia. C) Personality Disorder – Incorrect Personality disorders involve long-standing, inflexible patterns of behavior and cognition that impair social functioning. While certain personality disorders, such as avoidant or dependent personality disorder, may involve anxiety, they do not specifically cause fear of leaving home or being in crowds as seen in agoraphobia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions (intrusive, distressing thoughts) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety caused by obsessions). In this case, the 15-year-old boy experiences repetitive, distressing thoughts about dirt and contamination even after cleaning himself. Despite recognizing that his fears are irrational, he is unable to stop thinking about them, leading to significant distress, compulsive behaviors, and impairment in daily life, including social withdrawal and academic difficulties. This pattern is typical of OCD, particularly the contamination subtype, where individuals have an excessive fear of dirt, germs, or contamination and engage in compulsive cleaning behaviors. OCD is a chronic condition that often begins in childhood or adolescence. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the first-line treatment, along with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if needed. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Conduct Disorder – Incorrect Conduct disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of violating societal norms, rules, and the rights of others, including aggression, deceitfulness, property destruction, and serious rule violations. The boy in this case does not display antisocial or aggressive behavior, but rather obsessive thoughts and anxiety, which are more consistent with OCD. C) Agoraphobia – Incorrect Agoraphobia involves intense fear of situations where escape may be difficult, such as open spaces, crowds, or traveling alone. Individuals with agoraphobia often avoid leaving home due to fear of panic attacks or being trapped in a stressful situation. This boy’s distress is not about being in open spaces but rather his fear of contamination, making OCD the more appropriate diagnosis. D) Adjustment Disorder – Incorrect Adjustment disorder occurs when emotional or behavioral symptoms develop in response to an identifiable stressor within three months, causing marked distress or impairment. The key difference is that adjustment disorder symptoms resolve once the stressor is removed, whereas OCD is a chronic condition characterized by persistent and intrusive thoughts. The boy’s symptoms of repetitive thoughts, compulsions, and distress lasting for a prolonged period are more indicative of OCD than adjustment disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the first-line psychotherapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and is a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In ERP, patients are gradually exposed to their feared stimuli (e.g., dirt, germs) in a controlled manner while preventing their compulsive behaviors (e.g., excessive hand washing). Over time, this reduces anxiety and the urge to perform compulsions, leading to symptom improvement. In this case, the 25-year-old female has repetitive, intrusive thoughts about contamination and compulsive hand washing despite recognizing them as excessive and distressing. These characteristics are typical of OCD, particularly the contamination subtype. As medication alone has not been effective, ERP would be the most beneficial therapy to help her resist compulsions and reduce anxiety. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Systematic Desensitization – Incorrect Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy mainly used for specific phobias, in which patients gradually expose themselves to an anxiety-provoking stimulus while using relaxation techniques. Unlike ERP, systematic desensitization does not focus on preventing compulsions, making it less effective for OCD. C) Assertiveness Training – Incorrect Assertiveness training is used to help individuals express their thoughts, feelings, and needs confidently without being aggressive or passive. It is commonly used for social anxiety, interpersonal difficulties, and communication issues but is not an effective treatment for OCD, which is characterized by intrusive thoughts and compulsions rather than difficulty asserting oneself. D) Sensate Focusing – Incorrect Sensate focusing is a behavioral therapy used in the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, such as low sexual desire or performance anxiety. It involves mindfully focusing on physical sensations without pressure to perform sexually. This therapy has no relevance to OCD symptoms like intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.",

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops after experiencing or witnessing a life-threatening or traumatic event. In this case, the lady was involved in a serious car accident and spent six months in the ICU, indicating a significant traumatic event. The hallmark symptoms of PTSD include: Intrusive symptoms (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, distressing memories) Avoidance behaviors (e.g., avoiding situations related to the trauma, such as refusing to sit in a car) Hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., waking up in terror, being easily startled, persistent fear) Negative alterations in cognition and mood (e.g., fear, guilt, emotional numbness) Since the lady frequently wakes up at night in terror and is afraid of being in a car again, she is experiencing intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal, which strongly indicate PTSD. Treatment for PTSD includes: Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Exposure therapy (gradual desensitization to feared situations) Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline or paroxetine Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Anxiety Disorder – Incorrect While PTSD is classified as a trauma- and stressor-related disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and other anxiety disorders involve chronic, excessive worry about various aspects of life without a specific traumatic trigger. The clear traumatic event (car accident) and PTSD-specific symptoms make PTSD a better diagnosis than a general anxiety disorder. B) Phobia – Incorrect A specific phobia is an intense, irrational fear of a particular object or situation (e.g., fear of heights, flying, spiders). However, phobias do not typically involve nightmares, flashbacks, or hyperarousal symptoms. The patient’s fear of cars is linked to trauma, rather than being an irrational or lifelong fear, making PTSD the correct diagnosis. C) Conversion Disorder – Incorrect Conversion disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) is characterized by neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, seizures) that are not explained by medical conditions. It usually occurs after psychological stress but does not involve nightmares, flashbacks, or avoidance behaviors. Since the patient’s symptoms align more with PTSD rather than unexplained neurological deficits, conversion disorder is unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that develops after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event such as natural disasters, accidents, war, or physical assaults. In this case, the woman suffered during an earthquake but was successfully saved. However, three years later, she continues to experience nightmares, nighttime awakenings, and intense fear. These symptoms strongly suggest PTSD, which is characterized by: Intrusive symptoms: Recurrent distressing memories, nightmares, flashbacks Avoidance behaviors: Avoiding reminders of the trauma Hyperarousal symptoms: Difficulty sleeping, irritability, exaggerated startle response Negative changes in cognition/mood: Emotional numbness, detachment, persistent fear Since her symptoms have persisted for years, PTSD is the most appropriate diagnosis. Treatment options include trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline or paroxetine. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Major Depression – Incorrect While major depressive disorder (MDD) can include sleep disturbances, nightmares, and emotional distress, PTSD is a more suitable diagnosis because the symptoms are directly linked to a past traumatic event. MDD is characterized more by persistent sadness, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts, which are not prominent in this case. C) Mania – Incorrect Mania is a mood disorder seen in bipolar disorder and is characterized by: Elevated or irritable mood Increased energy and activity levels Decreased need for sleep Grandiosity or risky behaviors The woman in this case is experiencing fear, nightmares, and nighttime awakenings—not symptoms of mania. D) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by: Hallucinations (false sensory perceptions) Delusions (false beliefs) Disorganized thinking and behavior Social withdrawal and cognitive impairment This woman’s symptoms are related to a past traumatic event and are not psychotic in nature, making schizophrenia an unlikely diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Normal grief. Grief is a natural emotional response to the loss of a loved one, and it can manifest in various ways, including sadness, longing, preoccupation with the deceased, and even transient hallucinations of the deceased person. In this case, the man lost his wife six months ago and is experiencing a common grief-related phenomenon where he perceives his wife's presence and hears her voice. This is a normal part of the grieving process and does not necessarily indicate a psychiatric disorder. Many bereaved individuals, particularly in the first year following a significant loss, report seeing or hearing the deceased, which is classified as a normal grief reaction rather than a psychotic disorder. These hallucinations are usually transient, not distressing, and the person maintains insight that their loved one is deceased. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Grief psychosis – Incorrect Grief psychosis refers to a severe, prolonged, or complicated grief reaction in which the person develops persistent delusions, hallucinations, or severe functional impairment. In grief psychosis, the individual loses insight and truly believes that the deceased is alive or communicates with them in an irrational manner. In this case, the man's experience is consistent with a normal bereavement-related hallucination, which is common and does not indicate a psychotic disorder. C) Bereavement reaction – Incorrect Bereavement reaction is a broader term that includes both normal and complicated grief reactions. While this man is experiencing a normal grief reaction, the term \"normal grief\" is a more precise choice. D) Supernatural phenomenon – Incorrect From a medical and psychiatric perspective, this is not classified as a supernatural phenomenon but rather a common and natural psychological response to grief. Many grieving individuals experience illusions or mild hallucinations of their loved ones, which is part of the emotional adjustment to loss.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Clomipramine. This elderly woman is experiencing persistent auditory hallucinations of her deceased husband, which are associated with anxiety and sadness, suggesting complicated grief with depressive symptoms. Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is effective in treating depression, obsessive rumination, and anxiety symptoms that are often seen in prolonged or pathological grief reactions. While transient auditory or visual hallucinations of a deceased loved one are common in normal grief, the persistence of distressing hallucinations, emotional preoccupation, and associated anxiety and sadness indicate a complicated grief reaction that requires pharmacological intervention. Clomipramine is particularly useful because of its strong serotonergic action, which helps in reducing intrusive thoughts and improving emotional regulation in grief-related depression. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Alprazolam – Incorrect Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and panic disorders, but it is not recommended as first-line treatment for grief-related depression. Benzodiazepines do not address the core depressive symptoms or persistent hallucinations and may only provide temporary sedation. Long-term use can lead to dependence and cognitive impairment, particularly in the elderly. C) Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) – Incorrect ECT is a treatment option for severe, treatment-resistant depression, catatonia, or psychotic depression, but it is not warranted in this case. The patient’s symptoms do not indicate severe functional impairment, suicidal risk, or psychotic depression that would necessitate ECT. D) Haloperidol – Incorrect Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic used to treat primary psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional disorder) and severe agitation. However, in bereavement-related hallucinations, antipsychotics are not the first-line treatment unless there is severe functional impairment or loss of insight. Additionally, antipsychotics can have cognitive side effects in elderly patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorder occurs in response to an identifiable stressor (in this case, the father learning about his son's leukemia). It is characterized by emotional and behavioral symptoms that develop within 3 months of the stressor but do not meet the full criteria for major depression, anxiety disorder, or PTSD. In this case, the patient is experiencing low mood, sleep deprivation, lethargy, and headache but is still able to function reasonably well socially and at work, which supports a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. The key features supporting adjustment disorder in this case include: A clear, identifiable stressor (child’s leukemia diagnosis). Onset of symptoms within a few months of the stressor. Mild depressive symptoms that do not cause significant functional impairment. No history of major depressive disorder or other psychiatric conditions. Treatment for adjustment disorder typically involves supportive psychotherapy, stress management techniques, and, in some cases, short-term pharmacotherapy for symptom relief. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Depression – Incorrect While the patient exhibits low mood, sleep issues, and lethargy, he does not meet the full criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD requires at least 5 of the 9 symptoms (SIGECAPS) lasting ?2 weeks, with significant functional impairment. This patient continues to interact well with others and has not missed work, which suggests a milder reaction to stress rather than clinical depression. Unlike MDD, adjustment disorder symptoms typically resolve once the stressor is addressed. B) Psychogenic Headache – Incorrect Headache alone is not the primary issue in this case. The emotional distress and sleep deprivation suggest a broader stress-related condition rather than isolated psychogenic pain. Headache may be a symptom of stress or adjustment disorder rather than a primary diagnosis. D) Somatization Disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder (now classified as Somatic Symptom Disorder) involves multiple physical complaints (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness) that cause significant distress and impairment but cannot be fully explained by medical conditions. The primary issue here is emotional distress related to a stressor, rather than multiple unexplained physical symptoms. The temporal relationship between the leukemia diagnosis and symptom onset suggests adjustment disorder rather than somatization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mixed anxiety-depression. Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (MADD) is a condition where symptoms of both anxiety and depression are present but do not meet the full criteria for either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). In this case, the 25-year-old woman exhibits symptoms of both anxiety (palpitations, insomnia) and depression (sadness, loss of appetite) but: She lacks core depressive symptoms like hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, or significant functional impairment. Her social and occupational life remain unaffected, ruling out major depression. Her symptoms do not fit GAD alone, as they are not purely anxiety-related. Since her symptoms overlap between anxiety and depression without meeting full criteria for either disorder, the best diagnosis is mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (MADD). Treatment for MADD typically includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and, in some cases, antidepressants such as SSRIs. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) – Incorrect GAD is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple aspects of life for at least 6 months along with symptoms like restlessness, muscle tension, and irritability. While this patient has palpitations and insomnia, she also has depressive symptoms (sadness, appetite loss), which are not prominent in GAD. Her symptoms do not revolve around chronic worrying, making MADD a better fit. C) Adjustment Disorder – Incorrect Adjustment disorder occurs in response to an identifiable stressor (e.g., job loss, divorce, death of a loved one). This patient has no history of a precipitating event, which is a key criterion for adjustment disorder. Symptoms of adjustment disorder typically resolve once the stressor is removed, but this patient’s symptoms appear more persistent. D) Mild Depressive Episode – Incorrect A mild depressive episode requires at least 2 core depressive symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, fatigue) lasting at least 2 weeks plus at least two additional symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, appetite change, guilt, suicidal ideation). This patient does not exhibit the full spectrum of major depressive symptoms (e.g., she lacks hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, significant functional impairment). Her preserved occupational and social functioning also argues against a depressive episode.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pharmacotherapy. In cases of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which this patient likely has, first-line treatment involves pharmacotherapy, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline or paroxetine. These medications help reduce intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal, anxiety, and emotional distress. SSRIs are FDA-approved for PTSD and have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness in managing symptoms. They help in stabilizing mood, reducing flashbacks, and improving sleep. Benzodiazepines are not recommended as first-line treatment due to the risk of dependence and worsening emotional numbing. Although trauma-focused psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) is an important part of PTSD management, in cases with severe symptoms, medications are typically initiated first to help stabilize the patient. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) – Incorrect CBT, especially trauma-focused CBT, is highly effective for PTSD and is an essential part of treatment. However, in patients with severe distress, intrusive symptoms, or functional impairment, pharmacotherapy is prioritized first to provide relief before engaging in psychotherapy. CBT is best introduced after initial symptom stabilization with medications. C) Psychodynamic Approaches – Incorrect Psychodynamic therapy explores unconscious conflicts and early life experiences, but it is not first-line for PTSD. PTSD requires structured, evidence-based approaches like SSRIs and trauma-focused therapies. This method is less effective in addressing the core symptoms of PTSD, such as hyperarousal and re-experiencing the trauma. D) Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) – Incorrect EMDR is an effective therapy for PTSD, but it is not considered first-line over pharmacotherapy or CBT. It involves bilateral stimulation (eye movements, tapping) while recalling the trauma, which helps in processing traumatic memories. While beneficial, SSRIs are more established as the first-line treatment, especially in cases of severe anxiety and distress.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Somatization disorder. Somatization disorder (now classified as Somatic Symptom Disorder in DSM-5) is a condition characterized by multiple, recurrent, and unexplained physical symptoms involving different organ systems. The key features include: Chronic symptoms (persisting for years) without a clear medical explanation. Involvement of multiple organ systems, such as: Neurological symptoms (tingling, paresthesia in glove-stocking pattern). Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, constipation). Sexual/reproductive symptoms (impotence). Pain symptoms (headache, vague body aches). These symptoms cause significant distress and impair the patient's daily life. This patient has a long-standing history of unexplained symptoms affecting various organ systems, making somatization disorder the most likely diagnosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Hypochondriasis – Incorrect Hypochondriasis (now called Illness Anxiety Disorder in DSM-5) is characterized by excessive worry about having a serious illness despite minimal or no symptoms. Unlike somatization disorder, patients with hypochondriasis focus on the fear of disease rather than experiencing multiple unexplained physical symptoms. In this case, the patient is experiencing actual physical complaints rather than excessive preoccupation with illness. C) Conversion Disorder – Incorrect Conversion disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) involves neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, seizures) that are inconsistent with known medical conditions and are often triggered by psychological stress. This patient has multiple organ system involvement, which is not typical of conversion disorder (which usually involves a single neurological symptom). D) Factitious Disorder – Incorrect Factitious disorder involves deliberate falsification or exaggeration of symptoms to assume the \"sick role,\" without external incentives (such as financial gain). Patients with somatization disorder genuinely experience their symptoms and are not consciously faking them. This patient's symptoms are consistent with somatization disorder rather than intentional deception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypochondriasis (Illness Anxiety Disorder in DSM-5). Hypochondriasis (Illness Anxiety Disorder) is characterized by: Excessive preoccupation with having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance and normal test results. Persistent fear or belief that one has a disease, even after multiple medical evaluations. Requests for repeated investigations, despite lack of objective findings. Minimal or absent physical symptoms, with excessive focus on the perceived illness. In this case, the patient has a continuous headache without progressive features, multiple consultations with neurologists, and persistent belief that he has a brain tumor despite normal investigations. This strongly suggests hypochondriasis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Somatization Disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder (now Somatic Symptom Disorder in DSM-5) involves multiple, persistent physical symptoms affecting multiple organ systems (e.g., gastrointestinal, neurological, and pain symptoms). This patient has a single symptom (headache) with excessive concern about a serious disease rather than multiple unexplained symptoms. C) Somatoform Pain Disorder – Incorrect Somatoform pain disorder (now classified under Somatic Symptom Disorder) involves chronic pain as the main complaint, without an identifiable medical cause. Unlike hypochondriasis, these patients focus on pain itself rather than believing they have a serious illness. This patient is not primarily complaining about pain but is convinced that he has a brain tumor. D) Conversion Disorder – Incorrect Conversion disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) presents with neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, non-epileptic seizures) that are inconsistent with medical conditions. This patient’s symptoms are not neurological in nature and do not involve motor or sensory dysfunction. The core issue here is preoccupation with a serious illness, not unexplained neurological deficits.",

Hypochondriacal Disorder (Illness Anxiety Disorder) is characterized by: Persistent fear or conviction of having a serious illness, despite normal medical evaluations. Excessive health-related behaviors, such as repeatedly seeking medical investigations. Minimal or no physical symptoms, with a strong preoccupation with having a disease. Resisting medical reassurance, continuing to believe in the illness despite negative test results. In this case, the patient firmly believes that he has lung carcinoma for over a year, despite normal clinical and investigative findings. He spends excessive time, energy, and money on medical investigations, which is typical of hypochondriacal disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Carcinoma Lung – Incorrect Lung cancer is a physical illness diagnosed through clinical signs, imaging (e.g., CT scan), and biopsy. This patient has no significant clinical findings or test results confirming cancer. His symptoms are psychological (health anxiety and preoccupation), not medical. C) Delusional Disorder – Incorrect Delusional disorder involves fixed, false beliefs that are held with absolute certainty and are not influenced by contrary evidence. In hypochondriacal disorder, the belief in illness is not delusional but rather an exaggerated fear that can fluctuate. This patient does not show other signs of delusional disorder, such as paranoia or non-health-related delusions. D) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering is intentionally faking or exaggerating symptoms for secondary gain (e.g., financial benefits, avoiding work, obtaining drugs). This patient genuinely believes he is sick and is not seeking external benefits. Hypochondriacal disorder is a psychological condition, not intentional deception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Factitious Disorder. Factitious disorder (previously known as Münchausen syndrome) is a psychiatric condition in which a person deliberately fabricates or exaggerates medical symptoms to assume the role of a sick patient. The main motivation is to receive medical attention and care, rather than external incentives (such as financial compensation). In this case, the patient: Has multiple scars from previous surgeries, indicating a history of unnecessary medical procedures. Seeks excessive medical attention and demands multiple diagnostic tests despite the absence of major physical illness. Maintains a \"sick role\" and enjoys attention from medical staff. Has a history of visiting multiple hospitals with vague complaints. These characteristics strongly suggest factitious disorder, where individuals repeatedly feign or exaggerate illness to receive medical attention. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and impaired reality testing. This patient does not exhibit any signs of psychosis, delusions, or hallucinations and has a clear goal of receiving medical attention. B) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering involves faking or exaggerating symptoms for external rewards, such as financial compensation, avoiding work, or obtaining medications. Factitious disorder differs from malingering because the primary motivation is psychological (to assume the sick role) rather than external incentives. There is no mention of financial or legal benefits in this case, making malingering unlikely. C) Somatization Disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder (now called Somatic Symptom Disorder in DSM-5) involves genuine distress about physical symptoms without conscious fabrication. Unlike factitious disorder, patients with somatic symptom disorder truly believe they are ill and do not intentionally deceive others. This patient consciously seeks medical attention despite the absence of real illness, indicating intentional fabrication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Epilepsy. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of altered consciousness, involuntary movements, memory disturbances, and other neurological symptoms due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In this case, the female patient presents with: Episodes of altered sensorium (impaired awareness or confusion) Involuntary movements (suggestive of seizures) Memory deficits (common in temporal lobe epilepsy or generalized seizures) Headache (which can be postictal or related to seizure activity) Episodes occurring both during the day and in sleep (seizures can happen at any time, including nocturnal seizures) The presence of these neurological symptoms occurring repeatedly over six months strongly suggests epilepsy rather than a psychiatric disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Somatization Disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder (now part of Somatic Symptom Disorder in DSM-5) is a psychiatric condition where a person experiences multiple unexplained physical symptoms without a medical cause. Key difference: Patients genuinely believe they are sick, but there is no neurological dysfunction like seizures or memory deficits. In this case, the presence of episodes of altered sensorium, involuntary movements, and memory deficits suggests a neurological cause rather than a psychiatric one. C) Somatoform Disorder – Incorrect Somatoform disorders involve physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition and are psychologically driven. The patient’s neurological symptoms (altered sensorium, memory deficits, involuntary movements) are not characteristic of somatoform disorders and are more suggestive of an underlying neurological etiology like epilepsy. D) Hypochondriasis – Incorrect Hypochondriasis (Illness Anxiety Disorder in DSM-5) is characterized by excessive worry about having a serious illness despite medical reassurance. This patient has clear, observable neurological symptoms rather than just excessive health anxiety. Hypochondriasis does not present with episodes of altered consciousness or involuntary movements.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Factitious disorder. Factitious disorder (also known as Munchausen syndrome) is a psychiatric condition where a person intentionally produces or feigns physical or psychological symptoms to assume the sick role, despite no external incentives like financial gain or avoiding work. In this case, the 30-year-old lady repeatedly presents with hematuria (blood in urine), seeks inpatient care, and is found to be deliberately introducing blood into her urine sample by pricking her finger. The absence of a medical cause for hematuria, Her history of multiple doctor visits, Her deliberate attempt to manipulate test results, all strongly indicate factitious disorder rather than any organic or other psychiatric condition. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering is the intentional production of false or exaggerated symptoms for external rewards, such as financial compensation, avoiding work, or obtaining drugs. In contrast, factitious disorder is motivated by an internal psychological need to be seen as ill, without obvious external benefits. In this case, the lady does not appear to be seeking financial or legal gains, making malingering less likely. C) Dissociative Disorder – Incorrect Dissociative disorders involve a disruption in memory, identity, consciousness, or perception, often linked to trauma. They do not involve deliberate fabrication of symptoms. The intentional act of adding blood to the urine sample is not a dissociative symptom but rather an act of deception, pointing to factitious disorder. D) Hypochondriasis – Incorrect Hypochondriasis (Illness Anxiety Disorder in DSM-5) involves excessive fear of having a serious illness despite medical reassurance. Patients with hypochondriasis do not deliberately induce symptoms; rather, they misinterpret normal bodily sensations as signs of severe disease. Here, the patient is intentionally faking hematuria, which is not characteristic of hypochondriasis.",

These symptoms are precipitated by psychological conflicts. The patient’s lack of anxiety and apparent lack of awareness of the conflicts with her brother are classic findings in conversion disorder and they are described as called “primary gains.” This term refers to the use of physical symptoms to express a conflict, emotion, or desire without allowing it to enter the patient’s consciousness. The patient’s enjoyment of her family’s attention is a form of “secondary gain.” Secondary gains, being experienced as pleasurable, reinforce the symptoms.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Clomipramine. The 12-year-old boy in this scenario exhibits intrusive, distressing thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive, ritualistic behaviors (compulsions) that he feels compelled to perform. These are hallmark symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The obsession involves uncontrollable intrusive blasphemous thoughts about God whenever he hears the word or passes a church. The compulsions involve repeating sentences, counting, and restarting if interrupted. These symptoms cause significant distress and impairment, which is characteristic of OCD. Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with strong serotonergic effects, has been proven to be highly effective in treating OCD, especially in children and adolescents. It inhibits serotonin reuptake, thereby helping reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline are also effective, but clomipramine remains one of the most established pharmacological treatments for OCD, particularly in severe cases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Alprazolam – Incorrect Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine primarily used for acute anxiety and panic disorders, not OCD. While it may provide short-term relief from anxiety, it does not address the core symptoms of OCD (obsessions and compulsions) and is not a first-line treatment. C) Propranolol – Incorrect Propranolol is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension, performance anxiety, and tremors, but it has no proven efficacy in OCD. It may help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g., rapid heart rate, sweating), but it does not target obsessive-compulsive symptoms. D) Lithium – Incorrect Lithium is a mood stabilizer used for bipolar disorder, particularly in treating mania and mood swings. It is not effective in treating OCD and does not target intrusive thoughts or compulsive behaviors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Social phobia. The person in the scenario experiences significant anxiety in social situations, especially when performing in front of others, interacting with seniors, or attending social gatherings. Key symptoms include: Fear of public speaking with physical symptoms such as tachycardia (increased heart rate). Avoidance of social events like parties due to anxiety. Performance-related anxiety, which affects his ability to function in front of others. These symptoms are characteristic of social phobia (social anxiety disorder), a condition marked by an intense fear of being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated in social or performance situations. Individuals with this disorder often avoid situations that trigger anxiety, leading to impairment in daily life. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Panic disorder – Incorrect Panic disorder is characterized by sudden, unexpected panic attacks with severe symptoms like chest pain, breathlessness, dizziness, and a feeling of impending doom. This person’s anxiety is situational (triggered by social interactions), whereas panic disorder involves spontaneous panic attacks that can occur without an identifiable trigger. B) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that involves delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and impaired reality testing. The individual described does not exhibit psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions but instead shows anxiety and avoidance behavior, which is more consistent with social phobia. D) Avoidant personality disorder – Incorrect Avoidant personality disorder (AVPD) involves a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism beginning in early adulthood. While AVPD and social phobia share some features, social phobia is typically focused on specific social or performance situations, whereas AVPD affects all aspects of social interactions, including personal relationships. The person in the scenario shows anxiety primarily related to public speaking and social settings, which aligns more with social phobia rather than a generalized pattern of avoidance seen in AVPD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dissociative fugue. Dissociative fugue is a subtype of dissociative amnesia characterized by sudden, unexpected travel away from home with an inability to recall one's past. However, during the fugue state, individuals appear well-groomed, alert, and behave purposefully without showing signs of confusion. Often, they assume a new identity and deny any memory loss when questioned. Once the fugue resolves, they may experience retrograde amnesia for the fugue episode. In this case, the person is found wandering with purpose, is well-groomed, and denies amnesia, which are classic signs of dissociative fugue. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Dementia – Incorrect Dementia is a chronic, progressive cognitive decline affecting memory, judgment, orientation, and personality. Patients with dementia often lack awareness of their memory loss (anosognosia) and do not purposefully wander with intact grooming and behavior. Unlike dementia, dissociative fugue is sudden in onset, reversible, and not associated with global cognitive impairment. B) Dissociative amnesia – Incorrect Dissociative amnesia is characterized by inability to recall important personal information, usually following a stressful or traumatic event. However, it does not involve purposeful travel or identity changes, which are hallmarks of dissociative fugue. The key difference is that in dissociative fugue, the person physically relocates, while in dissociative amnesia, they remain in the same place but have memory gaps. D) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought, and impaired reality testing. Patients with schizophrenia do not have episodes of sudden, purposeful wandering while being well-groomed and maintaining normal behavior. Instead, they exhibit disorganized behavior, thought disturbances, and impaired social functioning.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Specific phobia. Specific phobia is an excessive, persistent, and irrational fear of a particular object or situation, leading to avoidance behavior or significant distress. In this case, the patient has an intense fear of elevators, despite never having had a traumatic event associated with them. The avoidance of elevators to the extent of climbing 12 flights of stairs daily suggests a strong phobic response, which is characteristic of a specific phobia. Specific phobias typically begin in childhood and persist into adulthood unless treated. They do not require a past traumatic experience and can develop due to learned behavior or irrational fears. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Social phobia – Incorrect Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) involves a fear of being embarrassed, judged, or negatively evaluated in social or performance situations (e.g., public speaking, meeting strangers). This patient’s fear is not related to social interactions but rather to a specific object (elevators), which aligns with a specific phobia. B) Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) – Incorrect GAD is characterized by excessive, persistent worry about multiple aspects of life (work, health, family, finances) for at least 6 months, along with physical symptoms such as muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue. The patient’s isolated fear of elevators does not fit the broad, pervasive worry seen in GAD. D) Agoraphobia – Incorrect Agoraphobia involves fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable (e.g., crowds, open spaces, public transport). Individuals with agoraphobia may fear being trapped, but their avoidance is more generalized and not limited to one specific object or situation. This patient only fears elevators, making specific phobia the more accurate diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a marked fear or anxiety about being in situations where escape might be difficult or help may not be available in the event of a panic-like symptom. It commonly includes fear of leaving home, traveling alone, using public transportation, being in a crowd, or being in open spaces. In this case, the patient experiences intense fear and anxiety when leaving home, traveling alone, and being in crowded places. His avoidance of public transport to get to work further supports agoraphobia, as people with this condition tend to avoid feared situations to prevent anxiety and distress. Agoraphobia often develops after a panic attack or as a stand-alone condition. The hallmark feature is avoidance behavior due to fear of losing control in public places. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) – Incorrect GAD is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple aspects of life (work, health, family, finances) for at least six months. While anxiety is present in both conditions, GAD does not involve specific situational fears or avoidance behaviors like fear of leaving home or crowds. B) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and impaired reality testing. The patient in this case does not exhibit psychotic symptoms such as delusions, auditory hallucinations, or disorganized behavior. Anxiety-related avoidance behaviors are not a primary feature of schizophrenia. C) Personality Disorder – Incorrect Personality disorders are long-standing maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience. The fear of public places and travel described here is more characteristic of agoraphobia rather than any specific personality disorder. Personality disorders typically do not cause sudden onset of intense fear and avoidance behaviors related to specific situations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Paroxetine and Alprazolam. The patient's symptoms, including recurrent, sudden episodes of intense fear (\"feeling like I am going to die\"), dizziness, nausea, and a choking sensation, are characteristic of panic disorder. Panic disorder is diagnosed when a person experiences recurrent, unexpected panic attacks followed by persistent worry about future attacks or behavioral changes to avoid them. First-line treatment for panic disorder includes: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) – Paroxetine is a commonly used SSRI for panic disorder. It helps reduce the frequency and severity of panic attacks by modulating serotonin levels. Short-term benzodiazepines – Alprazolam is used for immediate symptom relief in severe cases, as it acts quickly to reduce acute anxiety and panic. However, due to the risk of dependence, benzodiazepines should be used only for short-term management until SSRIs take full effect (which may take 4-6 weeks). Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Imipramine – Incorrect Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that has been used to treat panic disorder, but it is not the first-line treatment due to its side effect profile (e.g., sedation, weight gain, cardiac toxicity). TCAs are generally less well tolerated than SSRIs, which are preferred. B) Fluoxetine – Incorrect Fluoxetine is an SSRI and is effective for panic disorder, but it has an activating effect, which can temporarily worsen anxiety symptoms at the start of treatment. Paroxetine is often preferred in panic disorder because it is less activating and has a more calming effect. C) Phenelzine – Incorrect Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), which is not a first-line treatment for panic disorder due to its serious dietary (tyramine) and drug interactions. MAOIs are typically reserved for treatment-resistant cases when SSRIs and other medications have failed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Kleptomania. Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder characterized by: Recurrent failure to resist the urge to steal items that are not needed for personal use or monetary gain. Feelings of tension before stealing and relief or pleasure afterward. Guilt and remorse following the act but an inability to stop the behavior. In this case, the patient has a long history of repeated theft, gambling, and borrowing money, followed by guilt but an inability to control his actions. The presence of guilt after stealing differentiates kleptomania from other disorders. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Antisocial Personality Disorder – Incorrect Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is characterized by a disregard for social norms, deception, impulsivity, and lack of remorse for harmful actions. People with ASPD do not feel guilt about their actions and often manipulate others for personal gain. The key difference is that kleptomania involves guilt and distress after stealing, whereas ASPD individuals lack remorse. B) Conduct Disorder – Incorrect Conduct Disorder is diagnosed only in individuals under 18 years old. It involves aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness, theft, and violation of rules. Since the patient is 37 years old, Conduct Disorder is not a valid diagnosis. C) Pathological Gambling – Incorrect Pathological gambling involves an uncontrollable urge to gamble despite financial, social, and occupational consequences. The patient's history does include gambling, but his main issue revolves around compulsive stealing, not just gambling. If gambling were the primary issue, he would meet criteria for pathological gambling, but his repeated stealing with guilt suggests kleptomania.",

Habit reversal training is a behavioral therapy used to treat trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and other body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). It involves: Awareness training – The patient is made aware of triggers and urges before hair-pulling. Competing response training – Teaching the patient to engage in an alternative behavior (e.g., making a tight fist) when the urge to pull hair arises. Motivational enhancement – Reinforcing positive behavior and identifying reasons for change. Generalization – Practicing the new behavior in real-life situations. In this case, the girl is taught to clench her fist instead of pulling her hair, which is an example of competing response training in HRT. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Extinction – Incorrect Extinction involves gradual reduction of a learned behavior by removing reinforcement that maintains it. This is commonly used in operant conditioning (e.g., ignoring tantrums in a child so that they stop seeking attention). It does not involve teaching an alternative behavior, as seen in this case. C) Flooding – Incorrect Flooding is a rapid exposure therapy used to treat phobias by exposing a patient to their fear at full intensity until anxiety diminishes. It is not used for impulse control disorders like trichotillomania. D) Desensitization – Incorrect Systematic desensitization is a gradual exposure technique used to reduce anxiety by pairing relaxation techniques with progressively increasing exposure to a feared stimulus. It is mainly used for phobias and anxiety disorders, not trichotillomania.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Modeling. Modeling is a behavioral therapy technique in which a therapist or another individual demonstrates the desired behavior, and the patient observes and learns by imitation. It is commonly used in treating phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorders. In this case, the therapist models the behavior of touching various objects while remaining calm and composed. The patient follows the therapist’s actions, learning through observation that touching these objects does not lead to harm. Over time, this helps reduce the patient’s anxiety and desensitizes them to the feared stimulus (contaminants). Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Flooding – Incorrect Flooding involves exposing the patient directly to the most feared stimulus at full intensity for an extended period until their anxiety diminishes. In this scenario, the patient is gradually introduced to feared objects with the therapist's guidance, not abruptly exposed to their worst fear. Therefore, this is not flooding. C) Positive Reinforcement – Incorrect Positive reinforcement refers to rewarding a behavior to increase its occurrence (e.g., giving praise or incentives when a patient engages in desired behavior). In this case, the therapist is modeling the behavior, not reinforcing it with a reward. D) Aversion Therapy – Incorrect Aversion therapy involves associating an unwanted behavior with an unpleasant stimulus to discourage the behavior (e.g., using nausea-inducing drugs to treat alcoholism). In this case, there is no punishment or unpleasant stimulus associated with contamination-related behavior.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This belief is an example of \"thought-action fusion,\" a cognitive distortion commonly seen in OCD. Thought-action fusion refers to the belief that merely having a thought about an event can cause it to happen in reality or that thinking about something is morally equivalent to doing it. In this case, the person believes that wishing harm upon someone might actually lead to their death, which is a typical obsessional thought in OCD. These intrusive, irrational thoughts cause distress, leading the individual to engage in compulsions (e.g., mental rituals, reassurance-seeking) to neutralize or suppress them. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia involves delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking, but the key difference is that these beliefs are fixed and not recognized as irrational by the patient. In contrast, OCD patients often recognize their thoughts as excessive or irrational but still struggle to control them. B) Mania – Incorrect Mania is characterized by elevated mood, grandiosity, impulsivity, and decreased need for sleep. While grandiose delusions can occur in mania, they typically involve overestimation of one's power, abilities, or importance, rather than irrational guilt or magical thinking as seen in OCD. D) Delusional Disorder – Incorrect Delusional disorder involves persistent, fixed, and false beliefs that are not culturally accepted and are not accompanied by hallucinations or disorganized thinking. Unlike OCD, in which the person acknowledges their thoughts as distressing and irrational, individuals with delusional disorder firmly believe in their delusions and do not seek to resist them.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders worldwide. They include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Studies suggest that anxiety disorders affect approximately 15-20% of the general population at some point in their lifetime. They frequently begin in childhood or adolescence and can persist into adulthood if left untreated. Anxiety disorders can significantly impact daily functioning, relationships, and quality of life, but they often go undiagnosed or untreated. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic psychiatric disorder, but it is far less common than anxiety disorders. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 1%, making it much rarer than anxiety disorders. C) Depression – Incorrect Depressive disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD), are highly prevalent, affecting about 10-15% of the population in their lifetime. However, anxiety disorders are still more common than depressive disorders. Depression and anxiety often co-exist, but anxiety disorders generally occur at higher rates. D) Mania – Incorrect Mania is a feature of bipolar disorder, which has a lifetime prevalence of around 1-3%. Since bipolar disorder is much rarer compared to anxiety disorders, mania alone is not the most common psychiatric condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Habit reversal training. Habit Reversal Training (HRT) is a behavioral therapy technique used to help individuals manage and reduce repetitive behaviors such as hair-pulling (trichotillomania), nail-biting, or tics. In this case, the girl repeatedly pulls her scalp hair, which is a symptom of trichotillomania, a disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to pull out one's hair. HRT involves training the patient to recognize triggers that lead to the undesired behavior and then replace it with an alternative response. Here, the girl was taught to make a tight fist whenever she felt the urge to pull her hair. This is known as a competing response—a physical action that prevents the compulsive behavior from occurring. Over time, this competing response becomes a habit, reducing the hair-pulling behavior. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Extinction – Incorrect Extinction is a behavioral technique in which a behavior is gradually reduced by removing reinforcement. It works by eliminating the reward or reinforcement that maintains the behavior. In this case, the girl was not simply deprived of reinforcement; instead, she was actively trained to engage in an alternative behavior, making extinction an incorrect choice. C) Simple Conditioning – Incorrect Simple conditioning (classical conditioning) is a learning process in which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an involuntary response (e.g., Pavlov’s dog experiment). The girl’s treatment does not involve associating a stimulus with a new response, but rather conscious behavioral modification through an alternative response. D) Flooding – Incorrect Flooding is a type of exposure therapy in which a person is exposed to a feared stimulus all at once in order to reduce anxiety. This technique is mainly used for phobias and anxiety disorders, not for compulsive behaviors like hair-pulling.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition, which was introduced by Joseph Wolpe. Reciprocal inhibition states that two conflicting emotions (e.g., anxiety and relaxation) cannot coexist at the same time. Systematic desensitization is primarily used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders by gradual exposure to a feared stimulus while simultaneously practicing relaxation techniques. The process involves three main steps: Relaxation training – The patient is taught progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing techniques. Creation of an anxiety hierarchy – The patient ranks fear-inducing situations from least to most distressing. Gradual exposure with relaxation – The patient is slowly exposed to each level of the anxiety hierarchy while using relaxation techniques to prevent anxiety. Since reciprocal inhibition is the fundamental principle behind systematic desensitization, this makes B) Systematic desensitization the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Flooding – Incorrect Flooding is an exposure therapy technique where the patient is immediately exposed to the most feared stimulus in a prolonged and intense manner. Unlike systematic desensitization, flooding does not use relaxation techniques or reciprocal inhibition. Instead, it relies on extinction, where the fear response gradually diminishes over time due to prolonged exposure without any actual harm. C) Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) – Incorrect ERP is primarily used for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and involves exposing the patient to their feared stimulus while preventing their usual compulsive response. This technique is based on habituation rather than reciprocal inhibition. The goal is to break the cycle of compulsions by allowing anxiety to naturally decrease over time, without relying on relaxation techniques. D) Psychoanalysis – Incorrect Psychoanalysis, developed by Sigmund Freud, is a psychodynamic therapy that focuses on exploring unconscious conflicts, past experiences, and repressed emotions. It does not involve behavioral conditioning or systematic exposure and does not operate on reciprocal inhibition. Instead, it aims to bring unconscious thoughts into conscious awareness through techniques like free association and dream analysis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Claustrum. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that involves dysfunction in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit. This circuit includes areas responsible for executive function, habit formation, and emotional regulation. The main brain regions involved in OCD include: Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC): Involved in decision-making and error detection, hyperactivity in the OFC is linked to obsessive thoughts. Basal ganglia: Plays a key role in habit formation and motor control, often implicated in compulsive behaviors. Head of the caudate nucleus: Important for learning and goal-directed action, dysfunction in this area leads to the inability to shift from intrusive thoughts and compulsions. The claustrum, however, is not significantly involved in OCD. The claustrum is a thin, irregular sheet of neurons located deep within the brain, thought to be involved in consciousness and attention, rather than in obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B) Orbitofrontal Cortex – Incorrect The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is one of the primary areas implicated in OCD. It is responsible for error detection, emotional processing, and inhibitory control. Hyperactivity in the OFC is associated with excessive worry and obsessional thoughts seen in OCD. C) Basal Ganglia – Incorrect The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum, plays a role in habit formation and motor behaviors. Dysfunction in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop contributes to the compulsive behaviors in OCD. Structural and functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia have been frequently reported in OCD patients. D) Head of the Caudate Nucleus – Incorrect The caudate nucleus, particularly its head region, is critical for habit learning and goal-directed actions. Overactivity in the head of the caudate leads to inability to suppress intrusive thoughts, which contributes to compulsions in OCD. Functional imaging studies have shown increased metabolic activity in the caudate nucleus in OCD patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Most people having experienced a traumatizing event will develop PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can occur after exposure to a traumatic event, such as war, natural disasters, assault, or serious accidents. However, not everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD. Only a subset of individuals exposed to trauma will develop the disorder, influenced by genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Studies suggest that about 10-20% of people exposed to severe trauma develop PTSD, meaning the majority do not develop the disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men – Incorrect Studies show that women have a higher risk of developing PTSD than men, even when exposed to similar types of trauma. This could be due to differences in hormonal responses, coping mechanisms, and social support. Women are also more likely to experience certain types of trauma (e.g., sexual violence), which have a higher risk of leading to PTSD. B) Children are less likely to experience PTSD after trauma than adults – Incorrect Children are actually more vulnerable to PTSD than adults, especially if they lack proper support systems. While some younger children may show resilience, exposure to trauma at a young age can have long-term psychological effects, including PTSD, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation. Severe or repeated trauma during childhood increases the risk of PTSD. C) War veterans are commonly at risk for PTSD – Incorrect Military veterans are one of the highest-risk groups for PTSD. Exposure to combat situations, violence, and life-threatening conditions significantly increases the likelihood of developing PTSD. The condition has been widely studied in war veterans, especially those from conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Depersonalization. Depersonalization is a dissociative symptom in which a person feels detached from their own body, thoughts, or emotions, as if they are observing themselves from an external perspective. It often occurs in conditions such as panic disorder, PTSD, anxiety disorders, and dissociative disorders. In this case, the woman with panic disorder describes feeling as if she is floating above her body, which is a classic feature of depersonalization. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Illusion – Incorrect Illusions are misinterpretations of real external stimuli (e.g., seeing a shadow and mistaking it for a person). In this scenario, the patient is not misinterpreting an actual stimulus but experiencing a sense of detachment from herself. B) Hallucination – Incorrect Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions that occur without external stimuli (e.g., hearing voices when no one is speaking or seeing things that aren't there). The feeling of floating above the body is not a sensory perception but a dissociative experience, making hallucination an incorrect choice. D) Derealization – Incorrect Derealization is the sensation that the external world feels unreal, dreamlike, foggy, or distorted. In contrast, depersonalization is the feeling of detachment from oneself. Since the patient feels disconnected from her own body, rather than the external world, depersonalization is the correct diagnosis instead of derealization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Symptom production conscious, motivation primarily unconscious. This scenario is characteristic of factitious disorder, in which a patient consciously fabricates or exaggerates symptoms but has an unconscious motivation—often to assume the \"sick role\" and receive medical attention. The key clues in this case include: Multiple hospitalizations for unexplained symptoms. No organic cause identified after thorough examination. The patient appears content despite the supposed pain. Possession of a medical textbook bookmarked on the relevant symptoms. These features strongly suggest that the patient is deliberately producing symptoms (conscious symptom production), but the motivation is unconscious because he is not doing it for external rewards, but rather for the psychological benefit of being a patient. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Symptom production conscious, motivation primarily conscious – Incorrect This would describe malingering, where the patient fakes symptoms for an external gain (e.g., avoiding military service, obtaining financial compensation, or escaping work responsibilities). In this case, there is no clear external incentive—his motivation is more related to psychological needs rather than external benefits, ruling out malingering. B) Symptom production unconscious, motivation primarily conscious – Incorrect This would describe somatic symptom disorder, where a patient genuinely experiences symptoms but is overly preoccupied with them. However, in this case, the symptom production is deliberate (conscious), making this an incorrect choice. D) Symptom production unconscious, motivation primarily unconscious – Incorrect This would describe conversion disorder, in which symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, or seizures) appear without conscious awareness or intentional fabrication. The patient's deliberate symptom creation (suggested by his knowledge of medical conditions and past hospitalizations) rules out conversion disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Decreased. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, playing a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability and promoting relaxation. Anxiety disorders are associated with reduced GABA activity, leading to overactive neural circuits, excessive worry, and heightened arousal. GABA dysfunction is particularly implicated in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and other anxiety-related conditions. Benzodiazepines, which enhance GABAergic activity, are effective anxiolytics, reinforcing the role of decreased GABA in anxiety. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies suggest reduced GABA levels in individuals with high anxiety states. Thus, in an anxious patient without physical illness, GABA activity is most likely decreased, contributing to excessive neuronal excitation and heightened anxiety symptoms. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A) Increased – Incorrect If GABA activity were increased, the patient would likely experience calming or sedative effects, not heightened anxiety. Disorders associated with increased GABA activity include sedative overdose, certain neurodegenerative disorders, and anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. C) Unchanged – Incorrect If GABA levels remained unchanged, it would suggest no neurochemical imbalance, which contradicts the well-established link between GABAergic dysfunction and anxiety disorders. D) Higher than the activity of serotonin – Incorrect While serotonin (5-HT) also plays a role in mood regulation, GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for controlling excessive neuronal firing in anxiety. Anxiety disorders often involve both low GABA and serotonin dysfunction, but GABA's role in direct neural inhibition is more critical for immediate anxiety regulation.",
