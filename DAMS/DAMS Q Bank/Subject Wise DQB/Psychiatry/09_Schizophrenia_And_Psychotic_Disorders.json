      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Antisocial personality disorder (APD). This 12-year-old boy exhibits signs of conduct disorder (CD), which includes truancy, staying out late, verbal abuse, and running away from home. Conduct disorder is a childhood precursor to antisocial personality disorder (APD), which can only be diagnosed in individuals 18 years or older. APD is characterized by a persistent pattern of violating the rights of others, deceitfulness, impulsivity, aggression, and disregard for rules and laws. Many individuals with APD exhibit conduct disorder symptoms in childhood, making this the most likely future personality disorder for this boy if his behavior persists into adulthood. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Paranoid personality disorder – Incorrect Paranoid personality disorder is marked by pervasive distrust and suspicion of others without sufficient justification. Individuals with this disorder are often hypersensitive to criticism, bear grudges, and misinterpret benign remarks as threats. This boy’s behaviors (rule-breaking, aggression, truancy) are not characteristic of paranoid personality disorder, making this option incorrect. (C) Schizoid personality disorder – Incorrect Schizoid personality disorder involves a lifelong pattern of social detachment, emotional coldness, and lack of interest in relationships. People with schizoid traits prefer solitude, show little desire for friendships, and do not seek social approval or attention. The boy in this scenario, however, is engaging in externalizing behaviors (aggression, defiance, and conflict with authority), which are inconsistent with schizoid personality disorder. (D) Schizotypal personality disorder – Incorrect Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences, and social anxiety due to paranoid fears rather than negative self-perception. It is sometimes considered a milder form of schizophrenia. However, the boy in this case displays behavioral misconduct rather than eccentric thoughts or perceptual disturbances, making schizotypal personality disorder unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cotard syndrome. Cotard syndrome, also known as \"walking corpse syndrome,\" is a rare neuropsychiatric condition characterized by delusions of nihilism. Patients strongly believe that they are dead, do not exist, or that their organs are rotting or missing. In some cases, they may report perceiving foul odors of decaying flesh or insist that they do not need food because they are no longer alive. This syndrome is often associated with severe depression, psychotic disorders, or neurological conditions such as strokes or brain trauma. The woman’s belief that she is dead and that her flesh is rotting, along with olfactory hallucinations, strongly aligns with Cotard syndrome. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Capgras syndrome – Incorrect Capgras syndrome is a delusional misidentification disorder in which a patient believes that a close friend, relative, or loved one has been replaced by an identical impostor. It is often seen in schizophrenia, dementia, or brain injury. This woman’s delusion is not about a mistaken identity but about her own nonexistence, making Capgras syndrome an incorrect choice. (C) Fregoli syndrome – Incorrect Fregoli syndrome is another delusional misidentification disorder, but in this case, the patient believes that different people are actually the same person in disguise, following them or trying to deceive them. This is most commonly associated with schizophrenia or brain damage, but it does not involve delusions of death or bodily decay, making it unlikely in this scenario. (D) Cacodemonomania – Incorrect Cacodemonomania refers to a delusional belief that one is possessed by evil spirits or demons. While Cotard syndrome may involve nihilistic or bizarre thoughts, this patient's symptoms focus on death and bodily decay, not demonic possession, making cacodemonomania an incorrect choice.",

      "map_id": 34373428,
      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schizophrenia. Homovanillic acid (HVA) is a major metabolite of dopamine, and its levels in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid can be used as an indirect marker of dopamine activity. Elevated HVA levels are typically associated with increased dopamine turnover. This is particularly relevant in schizophrenia, a psychiatric disorder that is thought to involve dopaminergic dysregulation, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. In schizophrenia, excessive dopaminergic activity in certain brain regions is believed to contribute to positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, and increased HVA levels are often found in these patients due to heightened dopamine metabolism. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Parkinson disease – Incorrect Parkinson disease is characterized by a dopamine deficiency, particularly in the nigrostriatal pathway, which leads to motor symptoms like tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. In this condition, HVA levels would typically be decreased, not elevated, due to the reduced dopamine production and turnover. (B) Depression – Incorrect While depression is associated with dysregulation of several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, it is not specifically associated with elevated HVA levels. Depression often involves lower dopaminergic activity in certain areas of the brain, so HVA levels are generally normal or low rather than elevated. (C) Pheochromocytoma – Incorrect Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. While this condition can affect the sympathetic nervous system and lead to symptoms such as hypertension, it is more commonly associated with elevated levels of metanephrines and normetanephrines in the urine or plasma rather than HVA, which is specifically a metabolite of dopamine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (A) Acute dystonia The most likely diagnosis in this case is acute dystonia, a movement disorder caused by dopamine antagonism, commonly seen after starting or increasing doses of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. Acute dystonia is characterized by sudden muscle spasms and abnormal postures, which can involve the tongue, neck, eyes (oculogyric crisis), and trunk. The patient presents with protrusion of the tongue, an oculogyric crisis, stiffness, and abnormal limb and trunk postures. The fact that the symptoms improved rapidly with the administration of diphenhydramine (an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties) further supports the diagnosis of acute dystonia, as it is responsive to anticholinergic treatment. This condition typically occurs within the first few days of antipsychotic treatment, particularly with high-potency drugs like haloperidol. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (B) Akathisia – Incorrect Akathisia refers to an inner sense of restlessness and the urge to move, often manifesting as pacing or inability to sit still. It is a common side effect of antipsychotics, but it primarily involves motor restlessness rather than the muscle spasms and abnormal postures seen in this case. Additionally, akathisia typically does not involve muscle rigidity or oculogyric crisis, which are seen in this patient. (C) Tardive dyskinesia – Incorrect Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a chronic condition that involves involuntary, repetitive movements, often affecting the face, lips, and tongue. It typically develops after long-term use of antipsychotics and is more gradual in onset. In contrast, this patient is experiencing acute symptoms that began after only 2 days of haloperidol use, making acute dystonia a more appropriate diagnosis. TD is usually not responsive to anticholinergic agents like diphenhydramine, whereas the symptoms in this case improved with such treatment. (D) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome – Incorrect Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening condition caused by dopamine blockade, and it is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysregulation, and altered mental status. While the patient has muscle rigidity, the lack of fever, autonomic instability, and mental status changes makes NMS less likely. Additionally, the rapid improvement with diphenhydramine, which is an anticholinergic agent, is not typically seen in NMS, where supportive care and dantrolene (a muscle relaxant) are often required.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Schizoaffective disorder The patient in this case presents with auditory hallucinations and paranoia consistent with a psychotic episode. Additionally, he is experiencing manic symptoms, such as increased energy, jumping on top of a car, and insomnia. His history of a similar episode one year ago, which was characterized by auditory hallucinations and paranoia without clear mood symptoms, suggests that he has experienced both psychotic symptoms and a mood disturbance (likely mania). This combination of mood symptoms (elevated mood, insomnia) and psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations, paranoia) points to schizoaffective disorder, which involves the concurrent presence of mood disorder symptoms and psychosis. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed when there is a mood episode (either manic or depressive) occurring simultaneously with psychotic symptoms, and psychotic symptoms persist for at least 2 weeks without mood symptoms. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Schizophrenia – Incorrect Schizophrenia is primarily characterized by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech. However, it does not involve the prominent mood symptoms (such as mania or depression) that this patient is exhibiting. While the patient’s auditory hallucinations and paranoia could suggest schizophrenia, the co-occurring manic symptoms (increased energy, lack of sleep, and disinhibition) make schizoaffective disorder a more appropriate diagnosis. (B) Schizotypal disorder – Incorrect Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd beliefs, eccentric behavior, and social anxiety, but it does not involve acute psychosis or the intensity of mood symptoms seen in this patient. Patients with schizotypal personality disorder do not typically experience mania or psychotic episodes as part of their condition. The psychotic symptoms in this patient suggest a more serious mental illness, such as schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. (D) Bipolar disorder – Incorrect Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and depression, but it does not typically include chronic psychotic symptoms such as auditory hallucinations or paranoia unless the patient is in a severe manic or depressive episode with psychotic features. In this case, the patient’s psychotic symptoms have been present persistently (i.e., over a year with recurrence of psychosis), which is more indicative of schizoaffective disorder rather than bipolar disorder alone. Additionally, bipolar disorder would not explain the long-term psychosis the patient has experienced without the presence of mood symptoms.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Paranoid schizophrenia The patient presents with disorganized behavior, a reduced sleep pattern, and a delusional belief that there is a camera fixed behind her head which follows her. These features suggest paranoid schizophrenia, which is a subtype of schizophrenia characterized by prominent delusions and hallucinations, particularly involving paranoia. In this case, the delusion that someone is watching or following her (via a camera) fits well within the framework of paranoid schizophrenia. Disorganized behavior is also a hallmark of schizophrenia, further supporting this diagnosis. The duration of symptoms (9 months) is sufficient for the diagnosis of a chronic psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Psychotic depression – Incorrect Psychotic depression, or major depressive disorder with psychotic features, involves symptoms of depression (such as depressed mood, anhedonia, and low energy), alongside psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. However, in this case, the patient does not exhibit any signs of depression (e.g., sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest) but instead presents with disorganized behavior and a paranoid delusion. Additionally, psychotic depression typically does not present with disorganized behavior, which is more typical of schizophrenia. (C) Delusional disorder – Incorrect Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (i.e., delusions that are possible but highly unlikely, such as being followed or watched), but it typically does not involve other psychotic symptoms like disorganized behavior or hallucinations. In this case, the patient's disorganized behavior (e.g., reduced sleep and overall disorganization) suggests a more severe psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia rather than delusional disorder. Delusional disorder does not generally present with the degree of functional impairment seen in schizophrenia. (D) Insomnia – Incorrect Insomnia refers to difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep and does not include disorganized behavior, delusions, or hallucinations. While the patient does complain of reduced sleep, this is just one symptom and does not alone explain the paranoid delusion or the disorganized behavior. The presence of these other psychotic symptoms points towards a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia rather than a sleep disorder like insomnia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Schizophrenia The patient's presentation includes gradual onset of suspiciousness, muttering, smiling without clear reason, violent outbursts, decreased socialization, and lack of interest in studies for the past 8 months. These are consistent with symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly the paranoid ideation (suspiciousness), disorganized behavior (muttering and smiling without reason), and impaired functioning (lack of interest in studies and socialization). The presence of blunted affect, thought broadcast, and impaired judgment and insight further support the diagnosis. Schizophrenia typically manifests with positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (such as decreased motivation and social withdrawal), and disorganized symptoms (such as inappropriate emotional responses and thought disturbances). This patient exhibits a range of these symptoms, which is characteristic of schizophrenia. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Delusional disorder – Incorrect Delusional disorder involves the presence of non-bizarre delusions (i.e., beliefs that are possible but unlikely), such as the belief that one is being persecuted or followed. However, the patient in this case presents with a range of disorganized behaviors (muttering, smiling without clear reason) and negative symptoms (lack of interest in studies and social withdrawal), which go beyond delusional beliefs alone. In delusional disorder, there is typically no significant impairment in cognitive function or social behavior, and there is a lack of other psychotic features like disorganized speech or thought, which is present here. (B) Depression – Incorrect While depression can involve social withdrawal, loss of interest in activities, and blunted affect, it does not typically involve paranoia, disorganized behavior, or thought broadcast. The violent outbursts and muttering are not typical symptoms of depression, and the presence of impaired judgment and insight is more suggestive of a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. Additionally, the patient's symptoms have persisted for 8 months, which is longer than what would be expected for a major depressive episode. (D) Anxiety disorder – Incorrect Anxiety disorders primarily involve excessive worry, nervousness, restlessness, or panic attacks, which are not the key features in this case. While anxiety can contribute to social withdrawal, the symptoms of suspiciousness, muttering, blunted affect, and violent outbursts suggest a more severe psychotic condition like schizophrenia. Anxiety disorders do not typically present with disorganized thinking or delusions, which are evident here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hebephrenic Schizophrenia The patient's presentation includes inappropriate laughter, confused speech, and disorganized behavior (loosening of clothes in inappropriate places, giggling to self, mirror gazing). These are characteristic features of hebephrenic schizophrenia (also known as disorganized schizophrenia). This subtype of schizophrenia is characterized by disorganized speech (incoherent or unpredictable shifts in topic), disorganized behavior, and inappropriate emotional responses (such as laughing at odd times). The patient's lack of coherence in speech and inappropriate social behavior (loosening clothes and giggling to self) align well with the symptoms of hebephrenic schizophrenia, which typically presents in young adults. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Catatonic Schizophrenia – Incorrect Catatonic schizophrenia is characterized by significant motoric disturbances, such as immobility, posturing, rigidity, or excessive purposeless movement. While the patient has disorganized behavior, there are no signs of motoric abnormalities, stupor, or excessive movement that would indicate catatonia. Catatonic schizophrenia also often involves negativism, such as resistance to movement or instructions, which is not mentioned in this case. (B) Simple Schizophrenia – Incorrect Simple schizophrenia typically involves a gradual decline in social and occupational functioning with negative symptoms such as blunted affect, apathy, and withdrawal. It is characterized by a lack of overt psychotic features like disorganized behavior and inappropriate laughter. This patient has clear disorganized behavior (laughing inappropriately, confusing speech, loosening clothes), which is more indicative of hebephrenic schizophrenia rather than simple schizophrenia. (D) Paranoid Schizophrenia – Incorrect Paranoid schizophrenia is primarily characterized by delusions (e.g., persecutory or paranoid delusions) and auditory hallucinations. While paranoia and delusions may cause irrational behavior, they do not typically lead to the disorganized speech and inappropriate emotional responses (such as inappropriate laughter and loosening clothes) seen in this case. Paranoid schizophrenia does not typically involve the disorganization of thought and behavior that is prominent in hebephrenic schizophrenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acute Psychosis The patient's symptoms of hearing voices, aggressive behavior, and muttering to self suggest the presence of psychotic features such as auditory hallucinations and disorganized behavior. The recent onset of these symptoms, along with the absence of prior psychiatric history, points to acute psychosis. Additionally, the fever and muttering may suggest a secondary cause for the psychosis, potentially an infection or medical condition, which can trigger acute psychotic symptoms in an otherwise healthy individual. Acute psychosis typically manifests suddenly and can be caused by various factors like infection, substance use, or medical illnesses. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Dementia – Incorrect Dementia is a chronic, progressive condition that involves cognitive decline, memory loss, and impairments in judgment and reasoning, typically seen in older individuals. It develops over months to years, and psychosis may occur in its later stages. In this case, the patient's sudden onset of psychotic symptoms in a young individual with fever makes dementia unlikely, as it is not typically characterized by acute onset and associated physical symptoms like fever. (C) Delirium – Incorrect Delirium is an acute confusional state typically characterized by fluctuating consciousness, disorientation, inattention, and cognitive impairment, often caused by an underlying medical issue such as infection or metabolic disturbances. Although this patient has fever, which can sometimes be associated with delirium, the presence of auditory hallucinations, aggressive behavior, and lack of cognitive impairment (such as disorientation) makes delirium less likely. Delirium is more commonly associated with disorientation and confusion rather than focused psychotic symptoms like hallucinations. (D) Delusional Disorder – Incorrect Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of fixed, false beliefs (delusions) without other psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or disorganized behavior. The patient in this case is experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and disorganized behavior (aggressive behavior, muttering to self), which are not typically seen in delusional disorder. The fever and acute onset of symptoms also point towards an organic cause for the psychosis, which is not characteristic of delusional disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Delusional disorder The patient's belief that his nose is deformed, despite multiple reassurances from plastic surgeons, points to a fixed, false belief that is not aligned with reality. This is characteristic of a delusional disorder, specifically a somatic delusion, where the individual believes that there is a physical defect or abnormality despite clear evidence to the contrary. In this case, the patient is convinced that his nose is deformed and is extremely embarrassed by it, even though no actual deformity exists. This persistence of the belief, despite reassurance, is a hallmark of delusional disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Somatization disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder involves the presence of multiple physical complaints (such as pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, etc.) that are unexplained by medical conditions. These symptoms are real to the patient, but they do not have a physical basis. In contrast, the patient in this case is not complaining of a range of physical symptoms but is focused on a specific false belief about the appearance of his nose. This is more consistent with delusional disorder than somatization disorder, where the focus is more on multiple physical complaints. (B) Hypochondriacal disorder – Incorrect Hypochondriacal disorder (also known as health anxiety) involves excessive worry about having a serious illness, even when medical investigations show no evidence of it. While the patient does have concerns about his appearance, he is not primarily concerned with having a physical illness or deformity in a medical sense, but rather holds a delusional belief about his nose being deformed. His preoccupation with a specific physical characteristic aligns better with delusional disorder than hypochondriacal disorder. (D) OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) – Incorrect OCD involves obsessive thoughts (intrusive, unwanted, distressing thoughts) and compulsive behaviors (repetitive actions performed to reduce anxiety). While this patient may feel distressed about his appearance, his belief in the deformity of his nose is a fixed delusion rather than an obsessive thought. In OCD, the individual might worry about appearance, but they would typically engage in repetitive behaviors like checking or grooming in response to the obsession, which is not evident in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Delusion of enormity. A delusion of enormity is a false belief in which a person feels that their actions have an excessively large or catastrophic impact on the world. In this case, the affected individual believes that urinating will cause a flood that will destroy the world, leading them to refuse to urinate. This type of delusion is commonly seen in schizophrenia and severe psychotic disorders, where the patient has a distorted perception of their own influence on the environment. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Delusion of grandiosity – This is a false belief in one’s superior abilities, power, or importance. People with delusions of grandeur may think they are historical figures, gods, or have supernatural abilities, but it does not typically involve the fear of flooding the world by urinating. (B) Delusion of guilt – This refers to an excessive, irrational belief of having committed a terrible sin or crime. Patients may believe they are responsible for disasters or tragedies, but it is usually related to past actions, rather than a fear of performing an action like urinating. (D) Delusion of ill health – Also known as somatic delusions, this refers to false beliefs about having a severe illness or bodily dysfunction. People with this delusion may believe that they have worms crawling under their skin or their organs have stopped working, but this does not involve fears of causing global disasters.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cannabis intoxication is indistinguishable from schizophrenia. Cannabis intoxication and schizophrenia may share some overlapping symptoms, such as paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking, but they are not indistinguishable. Cannabis intoxication typically leads to temporary psychotic-like symptoms, which resolve after the drug leaves the system, whereas schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with persistent psychotic symptoms. Additionally, schizophrenia involves negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline), which are not typically seen in cannabis intoxication. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cannabis use could be a self-medication attempt – This is true. Some individuals with schizophrenia may use cannabis as a way to cope with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, or social withdrawal. However, cannabis use can worsen psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of relapse in schizophrenia. (B) Both schizophrenia and cannabis use are high in lower socioeconomic groups – This is correct. Research has shown that both schizophrenia and substance use disorders (including cannabis use) are more prevalent in lower socioeconomic populations due to various factors, including stress, lack of access to healthcare, and social marginalization. (D) Cannabis is associated with schizophrenia in a dose-dependent fashion – This is true. Studies suggest that higher cannabis consumption increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. Frequent cannabis use, especially high-potency forms (such as those high in THC), has been linked to earlier onset and more severe forms of schizophrenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Wernicke’s aphasia. Wernicke’s aphasia, also known as receptive aphasia or fluent aphasia, is a neurological disorder caused by damage to Wernicke’s area in the left superior temporal gyrus. It is characterized by fluent but nonsensical speech, difficulty understanding spoken language, and frequent use of neologisms (made-up words) and word salad—which can resemble the disorganized speech seen in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit thought disorders, including loosening of associations, tangential speech, and incoherence, which can mimic the speech disturbances seen in Wernicke’s aphasia. However, unlike schizophrenia, Wernicke’s aphasia is due to a neurological insult, often caused by a stroke, tumor, or traumatic brain injury. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Broca’s aphasia – This is incorrect because Broca’s aphasia primarily affects speech production rather than comprehension. Patients with Broca’s aphasia have non-fluent, effortful speech with preserved comprehension, which does not resemble the disorganized, fluent, but meaningless speech seen in schizophrenia. (B) Alexia with agraphia – This condition refers to the inability to read (alexia) and write (agraphia), typically due to damage in the angular gyrus. While it is a language disorder, it does not affect spoken fluency in a way that mimics schizophrenia. (D) Transcortical aphasia – Transcortical aphasias involve disruptions in language processing but preserve repetition ability. Depending on the type (motor, sensory, or mixed), it may cause difficulties in speech initiation or comprehension but does not produce the fluent but incoherent speech seen in schizophrenia or Wernicke’s aphasia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Norepinephrine. Anhedonia—the inability to experience pleasure from normally enjoyable activities—is a negative symptom of schizophrenia. It is strongly linked to norepinephrine dysfunction, particularly in the mesocortical and reward pathways of the brain. Norepinephrine plays a crucial role in motivation, arousal, and reward processing. Dysfunction in this system, particularly reduced norepinephrine activity, is believed to contribute to the blunted affect, lack of motivation, and reduced pleasure-seeking behavior seen in schizophrenia. Additionally, the locus coeruleus, the primary source of norepinephrine in the brain, interacts with the dopaminergic reward system, and disturbances in these pathways can lead to anhedonia. Studies have shown that schizophrenia patients, especially those with prominent negative symptoms, often have lower levels of norepinephrine metabolites, supporting the role of norepinephrine dysfunction in anhedonia. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Serotonin – While serotonin is involved in mood regulation, its role in schizophrenia-related anhedonia is less direct. Serotonin dysfunction is more closely associated with depression-related anhedonia, rather than the type seen in schizophrenia. (C) Glutamate – Glutamate is a key excitatory neurotransmitter, and its dysfunction is linked to schizophrenia, particularly in cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms. However, its direct role in anhedonia is not as well established as that of norepinephrine. (D) GABA – GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter and is implicated in schizophrenia, especially in cognitive dysfunction. While GABA dysfunction may contribute to schizophrenia’s negative symptoms, it is not the primary neurotransmitter linked to anhedonia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) No intellectual impairment. Type II schizophrenia is characterized by negative symptoms, including anhedonia, social withdrawal, affective flattening, and cognitive deficits. Unlike Type I schizophrenia, which is dominated by positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder) and has a better response to treatment, Type II schizophrenia is associated with structural brain abnormalities and a poor prognosis. Intellectual impairment, particularly in attention, executive function, and memory, is a well-documented feature of Type II schizophrenia. This impairment results from underlying neurodegenerative processes and dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) CT scan: Dilated ventricles – True. Studies have shown that Type II schizophrenia is associated with structural brain abnormalities, including ventricular enlargement, cortical atrophy, and reduced gray matter volume, which contribute to cognitive decline. (B) Poor prognosis – True. Patients with Type II schizophrenia respond poorly to antipsychotic medications, as the negative symptoms are less related to dopaminergic hyperactivity and more associated with chronic neurodegeneration. This results in long-term functional disability. (C) Negative symptom predominant – True. The hallmark of Type II schizophrenia is the predominance of negative symptoms, including reduced motivation, lack of emotional expression, and social withdrawal, making it distinct from Type I schizophrenia, which is characterized by hallucinations and delusions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Catatonic schizophrenia. Catatonic schizophrenia is characterized by severe disturbances in motor behavior, including defects in conation, which refers to goal-directed behavior, motivation, and volition. Patients with catatonic schizophrenia may exhibit mutism, stupor, posturing, waxy flexibility (catalepsy), negativism, echopraxia, and stereotyped movements. In extreme cases, patients may remain in rigid postures for hours or show episodes of hyperactivity without a clear purpose. These symptoms indicate a profound disruption in the ability to initiate or control voluntary actions, making catatonic schizophrenia the subtype most associated with conative defects. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Paranoid schizophrenia – Incorrect. This subtype is dominated by delusions and hallucinations, often with themes of persecution or grandiosity. While these patients may exhibit disorganized thought processes, they typically do not have severe conative defects like those seen in catatonic schizophrenia. (B) Disorganized schizophrenia – Incorrect. Also known as hebephrenic schizophrenia, this type is marked by disorganized speech, inappropriate emotional responses, and erratic behavior. Although motivation and goal-directed behavior are impaired, it is more due to cognitive disorganization rather than conative defects. (D) Simple schizophrenia – Incorrect. Simple schizophrenia is a rare subtype where negative symptoms (apathy, withdrawal, and blunted affect) predominate, but catatonic features such as severe motor disturbances and conative defects are not prominent.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dependent personality disorder. Folie à deux, also known as shared psychotic disorder, occurs when two or more individuals share the same delusion, usually within a close relationship. One person (the primary or dominant individual) holds a delusional belief, and the second person (the submissive or dependent individual) adopts the delusion due to their close emotional attachment and lack of independent thinking. People with dependent personality disorder (DPD) are especially vulnerable to developing folie à deux because they exhibit excessive reliance on others for decision-making, fear of abandonment, low self-confidence, and submissive behavior. Their strong need for approval and compliance makes them more likely to internalize and adopt the delusions of a dominant individual in a close relationship, leading to shared psychosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Schizoid personality disorder – Incorrect. Schizoid individuals are emotionally detached, socially withdrawn, and prefer isolation. Their lack of interest in social relationships makes it unlikely for them to develop folie à deux, as they are not easily influenced by others' beliefs. (C) Anankastic personality disorder (Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, OCPD) – Incorrect. People with OCPD are rigid, perfectionistic, and highly independent in their thinking. They are unlikely to adopt someone else's delusions because they tend to be highly critical and demand logical consistency in their beliefs. (D) Avoidant personality disorder – Incorrect. While avoidant individuals are socially anxious and fear rejection, they still maintain an independent sense of reality. Unlike dependent personality disorder, they do not blindly follow or internalize others’ beliefs, making them less prone to folie à deux.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Early age. Delusional disorder typically develops in middle to late adulthood, rather than early age. It is more common in individuals over the age of 40 years, and its onset is usually insidious. Unlike schizophrenia, which often presents in late adolescence or early adulthood, delusional disorder has a later onset and is not commonly seen in younger individuals. This is why early age is not a risk factor for its development. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Social Isolation – Incorrect. Social isolation is a significant risk factor for delusional disorder. Lack of social interactions reduces reality testing, making it easier for false beliefs to persist. Isolated individuals are more likely to develop paranoid delusions due to a lack of external validation of their thoughts. (C) Recent Immigration – Incorrect. Recent immigrants are at higher risk due to the stress of cultural adjustment, language barriers, discrimination, and feelings of alienation. These stressors can contribute to paranoid delusions or persecutory beliefs, especially in individuals with pre-existing vulnerabilities. (D) Sensory Deprivation – Incorrect. Sensory deprivation (e.g., vision or hearing loss) is a well-documented risk factor for delusional disorder. Individuals with hearing impairment may develop paranoid delusions due to misinterpretation of incomplete sensory input. Similarly, Charles Bonnet Syndrome, a condition in which visually impaired individuals experience complex hallucinations, can contribute to the development of delusions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Delusional parasitosis. The \"matchbox sign\" is a characteristic feature of delusional parasitosis, a psychiatric condition in which a person has a false belief that they are infested with parasites. Patients with this disorder often collect debris, skin flakes, lint, or small insects and bring them to doctors as \"evidence\" of the infestation, usually in a matchbox, tissue, or small container—hence the name \"matchbox sign.\" This behavior is a hallmark of Ekbom's syndrome, another term for delusional parasitosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Trichotillomania – Incorrect. Trichotillomania is a compulsive hair-pulling disorder, where patients pull out their own hair leading to noticeable hair loss. It is an impulse control disorder and does not involve delusions of infestation or the matchbox sign. (B) Pyromania – Incorrect. Pyromania is an impulse control disorder characterized by repeated, deliberate fire-setting. Patients experience pleasure or relief from setting fires but do not exhibit delusional beliefs about parasites or collect objects to show as evidence. (C) Dysphoric Mania – Incorrect. Dysphoric mania refers to a mixed episode in bipolar disorder, where a person has both manic and depressive symptoms simultaneously (e.g., elevated energy with irritability and sadness).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Frontal lobe. In chronic schizophrenia, frontal lobe atrophy is a well-documented structural brain abnormality. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive functions, including decision-making, planning, social behavior, and impulse control, shows reduced volume and activity. This atrophy correlates with negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy, lack of motivation (avolition), impaired cognition, and social withdrawal. Functional imaging studies have shown hypofrontality, meaning decreased activity in the frontal lobe, which is a hallmark of schizophrenia, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Occipital lobe – Incorrect. While some studies suggest altered visual processing in schizophrenia, occipital lobe atrophy is not a primary feature. Occipital dysfunction may contribute to visual hallucinations, but it is not as significantly involved as the frontal lobe. (C) Parietal lobe – Incorrect. The parietal lobe is mainly involved in spatial awareness and sensory processing. Some studies suggest mild parietal abnormalities, but they are not as prominent as frontal atrophy in schizophrenia. (D) Temporal lobe – Incorrect. The temporal lobe, especially the superior temporal gyrus, is often affected in schizophrenia, contributing to auditory hallucinations and language processing issues. However, frontal lobe atrophy is more strongly associated with chronic schizophrenia, particularly in negative symptoms and cognitive impairment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Made affect. In schizophrenia, first-rank symptoms refer to a set of symptoms that are considered particularly characteristic of the disorder and highly diagnostic. These were initially described by Kurt Schneider. One of the classic first-rank symptoms is made affect, which refers to inappropriate or altered emotional responses that seem externally controlled. The patient may exhibit an emotion that is not congruent with the situation, like laughing when something sad happens, or the patient's affect may seem induced by outside forces. This symptom reflects the dissociation of emotional expression from reality, a common feature in schizophrenia. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Autism – Incorrect. While autism (in this context referring to social withdrawal or social isolation) is a feature often seen in schizophrenia, it is not considered a first-rank symptom. Autism can be more broadly seen as part of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia, related to emotional withdrawal or social detachment, but it doesn't meet the criteria for the first-rank symptoms set by Schneider. (C) Association loss – Incorrect. Association loss refers to the disorganization of thoughts, leading to a disrupted flow of speech (also known as thought disorder). While association loss can be seen in schizophrenia, it is not specifically a first-rank symptom. It is more of a cognitive symptom and is important in diagnosing schizophrenia but does not hold the same level of diagnostic specificity as first-rank symptoms. (D) Ambivalency – Incorrect. Ambivalence refers to the coexistence of contradictory feelings or ideas about a situation or person, which can be seen in schizophrenia, especially in decision-making and emotional responses. However, it is not a first-rank symptom. It is a more general symptom in psychotic disorders and is not as specific or diagnostically significant as symptoms like made affect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Both of the above. First-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, originally described by Kurt Schneider, are a set of symptoms considered particularly characteristic of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These symptoms, such as made affect, thought broadcasting, and auditory hallucinations, can also be seen in schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder during the psychotic phases of these conditions. In both schizoaffective disorder (which involves symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorder) and bipolar disorder (particularly during mania or severe depression with psychotic features), first-rank symptoms can emerge when the individual experiences psychosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Schizoaffective disorder – Incorrect. While first-rank symptoms are seen in schizoaffective disorder, this is just a partial explanation. Schizoaffective disorder is a mood disorder that includes psychotic symptoms seen in schizophrenia, including first-rank symptoms. These are considered part of the psychotic phase of the illness and can overlap with symptoms seen in schizophrenia. (B) Bipolar disorder – Incorrect. First-rank symptoms are also observed in bipolar disorder during manic episodes (especially with psychotic features) or severe depressive episodes with psychotic features. However, it is important to note that these symptoms are not present in all cases of bipolar disorder and are specifically part of the psychotic phases. In bipolar disorder without psychosis, these symptoms would not be present. (D) None of the above – Incorrect. This option is not correct because both schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder can indeed exhibit first-rank symptoms, particularly during their psychotic episodes. Therefore, saying \"None of the above\" would be incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schizophrenia, catatonic type. Catatonic schizophrenia is characterized by marked motor abnormalities. These can include immobility, mutism, and stereotypical movements such as posturing or echopraxia (imitating the movements of others, as described in the case of Arnab). Individuals with catatonic schizophrenia may appear rigid and unresponsive, as described in the case of Arnab who \"sits quietly for hours, rarely talking, and hardly moving, except to ape the movements of those who pass by him.\" These behaviors are consistent with catatonia, which is a subtype of schizophrenia associated with both motor immobility and repetitive behaviors. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Schizophrenia, disorganized type – Incorrect. Disorganized schizophrenia typically involves disorganized speech, thought processes, and behaviors. Patients may exhibit incoherent speech, fragmented thinking, and inappropriate emotional responses. However, the description of Arnab's behavior—being mostly quiet, immobile, and copying others' movements—does not suggest disorganized thought or speech, which are hallmark features of the disorganized type. (B) Schizophrenia, undifferentiated type – Incorrect. The undifferentiated type of schizophrenia is a diagnosis used when the patient shows symptoms of schizophrenia that do not clearly fit into one of the other subtypes. This can include symptoms from paranoid, disorganized, and catatonic types. However, Arnab’s behavior seems more characteristic of the catatonic type due to his lack of movement, quiet demeanor, and imitation of others' movements. (C) Schizophrenia, paranoid type – Incorrect. Paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by delusions (e.g., persecution, grandiosity) and auditory hallucinations, often with significant emotional reactions. Arnab’s behavior does not indicate paranoia or delusional thinking. His quiet, motionless state and imitative behavior point more toward catatonic schizophrenia rather than a paranoid type, where delusions and hallucinations are more prominent.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lurasidone. Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic that can be beneficial for patients experiencing akathisia and dystonia due to its relatively lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) compared to other antipsychotic drugs. Atypical antipsychotics like lurasidone are often preferred in treating schizophrenia as they not only improve positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) but also carry a lower risk of movement disorders such as akathisia and dystonia. Since the patient is already on Haloperidol (a first-generation antipsychotic), switching to lurasidone would help manage the EPS symptoms while continuing to control the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Chlorpromazine – Incorrect. Chlorpromazine is another first-generation antipsychotic like Haloperidol and, therefore, would not be the best choice in this scenario. First-generation antipsychotics are known to have a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), such as akathisia and dystonia. If the patient is already experiencing these side effects from Haloperidol, using chlorpromazine would likely exacerbate the symptoms rather than alleviate them. (C) Fluphenazine – Incorrect. Fluphenazine is also a first-generation antipsychotic, similar to Haloperidol in its mechanism of action and side effect profile. While it can effectively treat positive symptoms, it carries the same risks for extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) as Haloperidol. Given that the patient is already experiencing akathisia and dystonia, fluphenazine is not likely to improve these symptoms and could potentially worsen them. (D) Lithium – Incorrect. Lithium is primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder to manage mood swings and is not an effective treatment for schizophrenia or extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) associated with antipsychotic use. Lithium does not have a role in directly managing akathisia or dystonia caused by antipsychotics, making it an inappropriate choice in this scenario.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Delusional disorder. The most likely diagnosis for this patient is delusional disorder, specifically a persecutory delusion. Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (beliefs that could occur in real life, but are false) for at least 1 month or longer, without significant impairment in functioning, and without other psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or disorganized behavior. In this case, the patient has a fixed belief that someone is poisoning her food, which is a persecutory delusion. This belief leads to behaviors such as avoiding non-prepackaged food and placing locks on her food cabinets. Despite these beliefs, she remains functional in other aspects of life, such as maintaining her job and receiving a promotion, which aligns with delusional disorder, as there is no significant impairment in overall functioning outside of the delusions. The patient's mental status exam is also normal, which further supports this diagnosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Brief psychotic disorder – Incorrect. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or behavior, which last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month. In this case, the patient’s symptoms have been present for 3 months, which exceeds the duration requirement for a brief psychotic disorder. Additionally, her behavior is more consistent with delusional disorder, where there are long-standing, non-bizarre delusions without the presence of full psychotic episodes. (C) Paranoid personality disorder – Incorrect. Paranoid personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of distrust and suspiciousness of others, where the individual believes others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them. However, this disorder does not involve specific delusions like the one seen in this patient. The patient's delusional belief (someone is poisoning her food) is more fixed and specific than the general suspiciousness seen in paranoid personality disorder, and it is the hallmark of delusional disorder, not a personality disorder. (D) Schizophrenia – Incorrect. Schizophrenia typically presents with multiple psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior, and these symptoms must last for at least 6 months. This patient’s symptoms are limited to a specific delusion about food poisoning, and there are no other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or disorganized behavior. Additionally, her functioning in other areas of life, such as her job and promotion, is preserved, which is not typical in schizophrenia. (E) Schizophreniform disorder – Incorrect. Schizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia but is diagnosed when psychotic symptoms are present for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. This diagnosis would require the presence of multiple psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior) and significant functional impairment, which is not the case in this patient. The patient’s symptoms are limited to a delusion without the accompanying symptoms or significant functional impairment. (F) Schizotypal personality disorder – Incorrect. Schizotypal personality disorder is a personality disorder marked by eccentric behavior, odd beliefs, and social deficits, but delusions are not a defining characteristic. The patient's fixed belief about food poisoning is more indicative of delusional disorder than of schizotypal personality disorder, which typically involves odd beliefs or magical thinking without fixed delusions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) Schizophreniform disorder. This 15-year-old boy exhibits psychotic symptoms, including bizarre behavior, auditory hallucinations (talking with aliens), and a delusion that aliens are transmitting thoughts from his brain to their planet. These symptoms have been present for two months, which is consistent with schizophreniform disorder, a condition that shares many characteristics with schizophrenia but lasts for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. The boy’s withdrawal, declining school performance, and lack of eye contact indicate significant functional impairment, which is also typical of schizophreniform disorder. Given the shorter duration of symptoms (2 months) and the significant functional decline, this is most consistent with schizophreniform disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Brief psychotic disorder – Incorrect. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech) that last for 1 day to 1 month. In this case, the boy’s symptoms have persisted for 2 months, which exceeds the duration required for brief psychotic disorder. Additionally, his symptoms have caused functional impairment and social withdrawal, which is more consistent with a diagnosis like schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia, rather than a brief psychotic episode. (B) Delusional disorder – Incorrect. Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (e.g., being followed, poisoned, or loved by someone), but without other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or disorganized thinking. This boy’s delusions about aliens transmitting thoughts and the accompanying auditory hallucinations (talking with aliens) suggest a more complex psychotic disorder, not delusional disorder. Additionally, delusional disorder does not typically cause significant functional decline as seen here. (C) Paranoid personality disorder – Incorrect. Paranoid personality disorder involves a pervasive pattern of distrust and suspicion of others, without the presence of bizarre delusions or hallucinations. People with this personality disorder tend to be excessively guarded and suspicious, but they do not typically experience hallucinations or disorganized speech. The boy’s delusions about aliens and bizarre behavior point more toward a psychotic disorder rather than a personality disorder. (D) Schizophrenia – Incorrect. Schizophrenia is diagnosed when symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and functional impairment, persist for at least 6 months. In this case, the boy’s symptoms have been present for only 2 months, which is too short a duration for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. While the symptoms are concerning for schizophrenia, the duration of symptoms must be at least 6 months for this diagnosis, which makes schizophreniform disorder the more appropriate diagnosis. (F) Schizotypal personality disorder – Incorrect. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behaviors, odd beliefs, and social anxiety, but it does not involve hallucinations or bizarre delusions. People with schizotypal personality disorder may exhibit magical thinking or odd beliefs, but their behavior is not typically as disorganized as seen in this patient. The presence of hallucinations and delusions about aliens in this case is more indicative of a psychotic disorder than a personality disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The most likely diagnosis for this patient is schizoaffective disorder (Option C). Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by features of both schizophrenia (psychosis) and mood disorders (mania or depression). This patient has psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations, paranoia) even in the absence of mood symptoms, as evidenced by his hospitalization one year ago for psychotic symptoms without an abnormal mood. Additionally, his current episode of mania (decreased need for sleep, hyperactivity, disinhibition) suggests a mood component. In schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms must occur independently of mood disturbances for at least 2 weeks; however, mood symptoms must also be present for a significant portion of the illness. Incorrect Options: Option A: Schizophrenia – This disorder presents with psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, but without prominent mood symptoms (mania or depression). While the patient had a previous episode with only psychotic symptoms, his current episode involves a clear manic phase, which is inconsistent with schizophrenia. The presence of mood disturbances alongside psychosis makes schizoaffective disorder more likely. Option B: Schizotypal Disorder – Schizotypal personality disorder is a chronic personality disorder characterized by odd beliefs, social isolation, eccentric behavior, and unusual perceptual experiences, but not full-blown psychosis (e.g., auditory hallucinations). This patient has clear psychotic symptoms, ruling out schizotypal personality disorder. Option D: Bipolar Disorder – Bipolar disorder with psychotic features can present similarly; however, in bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood episodes (mania or depression). This patient had a prior episode of psychosis without mood symptoms, which is inconsistent with bipolar disorder. The fact that his psychotic symptoms have occurred in the absence of mood disturbances confirms schizoaffective disorder rather than bipolar disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most likely cause of Vasanthi's symptoms is acute drug dystonia (Option A), a type of extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) caused by antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol. Acute dystonia typically presents within hours to days after starting or increasing the dose of a dopamine-blocking agent, particularly first-generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine). It is characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions, often affecting the neck (torticollis), eyes (oculogyric crisis), jaw, or limbs. The persistent deviation of the neck to one side in this patient strongly suggests cervical dystonia, a common presentation of drug-induced dystonia. Treatment involves discontinuing or reducing the offending drug and administering an anticholinergic agent (e.g., benztropine) or diphenhydramine for symptom relief. Incorrect Options: Option B: Conversion Reaction – Conversion disorder presents with neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, paralysis, abnormal movements) that are inconsistent with known neurological conditions and are often triggered by psychological stress. While Vasanthi recently had an altercation with her husband, the timing of her symptoms (immediately after starting haloperidol) and the characteristic neck deviation strongly indicate a medication-induced movement disorder rather than a conversion reaction. Option C: Acute Psychosis – Acute psychosis can present with delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior, but not involuntary muscle contractions or neck deviation. While Vasanthi is on haloperidol, which is used to treat psychosis, her symptoms are due to an adverse drug reaction rather than an exacerbation of psychosis. Option D: Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) – A stroke can cause sudden neurological deficits, including weakness, facial droop, or abnormal posturing, but it is not associated with sustained muscle contractions limited to the neck. Additionally, dystonic reactions occur hours to days after drug exposure, whereas strokes typically present with a sudden onset of focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or altered consciousness. The absence of these features makes a stroke unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most likely diagnosis in this patient is acute dystonia (Option A), an extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) that occurs within hours to a few days after starting or increasing the dose of a dopamine-blocking agent, such as haloperidol. Acute dystonia is characterized by sudden, involuntary, and prolonged muscle contractions, leading to abnormal postures. The patient’s symptoms—tongue protrusion, oculogyric crisis (forced upward deviation of the eyes), limb and trunk stiffness—are classic signs of acute dystonia. The fact that symptoms improved rapidly after administration of diphenhydramine (an anticholinergic/antihistamine used to treat acute dystonia) further supports this diagnosis. Treatment of acute dystonia includes anticholinergic agents (benztropine) or antihistamines (diphenhydramine), along with dose reduction or discontinuation of the offending antipsychotic. Incorrect Options: Option B: Akathisia – Akathisia is another EPS but presents as a subjective feeling of restlessness and an inability to sit still, often accompanied by pacing and agitation. Unlike acute dystonia, akathisia does not cause sustained muscle contractions, abnormal postures, or oculogyric crisis. Additionally, akathisia responds better to beta-blockers (propranolol) or benzodiazepines rather than anticholinergic agents. Option C: Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) – Tardive dyskinesia is a chronic movement disorder that occurs after months to years of dopamine-blocking drug use. It presents as involuntary, repetitive movements such as lip smacking, tongue rolling, and choreoathetoid limb movements. The acute onset of symptoms in this patient within 2 days of haloperidol initiation rules out TD. Moreover, TD does not respond to diphenhydramine, whereas acute dystonia does. Option D: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) – NMS is a life-threatening reaction to dopamine-blocking agents, characterized by severe muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, autonomic instability (hypertension, tachycardia), and altered mental status. This patient does not have fever, autonomic instability, or loss of consciousness, which are hallmarks of NMS. Additionally, NMS does not improve rapidly with diphenhydramine, whereas acute dystonia does.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The most likely diagnosis in this patient is akathisia (Option D), a common extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) of antipsychotic medications, particularly first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol. Akathisia is characterized by a subjective feeling of inner restlessness and an inability to stay still, leading to constant pacing, fidgeting, or shifting positions. The fact that the patient started experiencing restlessness and pacing after a few days of haloperidol use strongly suggests akathisia. Additionally, tremors can also be seen with akathisia, making this diagnosis even more likely. Treatment options include reducing the dose of the antipsychotic, switching to a lower-risk medication, or adding propranolol (first-line treatment), benzodiazepines, or anticholinergics. Incorrect Options: Option A: Anhedonia – Anhedonia refers to the inability to experience pleasure and is a core symptom of depression or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It is not associated with restlessness, pacing, or tremors. Since the patient has been diagnosed with mania, anhedonia is an unlikely explanation for his symptoms. Option B: Dystonia – Acute dystonia is an EPS that presents with sustained, involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal postures (e.g., torticollis, oculogyric crisis, tongue protrusion). Unlike akathisia, dystonia does not cause restlessness or pacing. The absence of muscle spasms or abnormal fixed postures makes dystonia an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Option C: Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) – RLS is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, especially at rest and during sleep. It is relieved by movement and is not associated with antipsychotic use. The generalized restlessness and pacing in this patient suggest akathisia rather than RLS, which primarily affects the legs and occurs predominantly at night.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The most appropriate treatment strategy for this patient is the addition of a beta-blocker (Option C), most commonly propranolol, which is the first-line treatment for akathisia. Akathisia is an extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) of antipsychotics, particularly high-potency first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol. It typically develops within days to weeks of starting or increasing the dose of the medication. Symptoms include restlessness, an inability to sit still, fidgeting, irritability, and an urge to move constantly. This patient's timing of symptom onset (one week after medication initiation) and clinical presentation strongly indicate akathisia. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is the preferred treatment as it helps reduce the subjective feeling of restlessness and excessive movement. Incorrect Options: Option A: Increase in the dose of haloperidol – Increasing the dose of haloperidol would likely worsen akathisia, as higher doses of dopamine-blocking agents increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Instead, the dose should be reduced or an alternative medication considered. Option B: Addition of an anticholinergic drug – Anticholinergic agents like benztropine or trihexyphenidyl are effective for other EPS such as dystonia or Parkinsonism but are not effective for akathisia. Since this patient has akathisia rather than dystonia or Parkinsonian symptoms, anticholinergics would not be the best treatment. Option D: Adding another antipsychotic drug – Adding another antipsychotic is not an appropriate first-line strategy. Instead, dose reduction or switching to an atypical antipsychotic (e.g., quetiapine, clozapine) with a lower risk of EPS can be considered if akathisia persists. However, the initial step should be to manage akathisia symptoms with propranolol before considering a medication change.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The least likely drug to cause the side effects described is clozapine (Option B). The patient’s symptoms—purposeless involuntary facial and limb movements, constant chewing, and puffing of cheeks—are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a chronic extrapyramidal side effect (EPS) associated with long-term use of dopamine-blocking agents (antipsychotics). TD results from prolonged dopamine D2 receptor blockade, leading to upregulation and hypersensitivity of these receptors. First-generation (typical) antipsychotics, particularly high-potency ones like haloperidol and fluphenazine, are most strongly associated with TD. Clozapine, an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic, has the lowest risk of TD due to its low D2 receptor affinity and strong anticholinergic properties. In fact, clozapine is sometimes used as a treatment for TD in patients who require continued antipsychotic therapy. Incorrect Options: Option A: Haloperidol – Haloperidol is a high-potency first-generation antipsychotic with strong dopamine D2 receptor blockade, making it a major cause of TD. Long-term use of haloperidol significantly increases the risk of involuntary orofacial and limb movements due to dopamine receptor hypersensitivity. Option C: Fluphenazine – Fluphenazine, another high-potency first-generation antipsychotic, has a mechanism similar to haloperidol and carries a high risk of TD. Its long-acting depot formulations can also lead to persistent TD symptoms even after discontinuation. Option D: Loxapine – Loxapine is a mid-potency first-generation antipsychotic that has a moderate risk of TD. Though its risk is slightly lower than that of haloperidol or fluphenazine, it is still significantly higher than clozapine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most likely diagnosis is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) (Option B), a life-threatening reaction to dopamine-blocking agents, particularly high-potency first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol. NMS is characterized by a triad of fever (hyperpyrexia), autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), and severe muscle rigidity (lead-pipe rigidity, akinesia, mutism). Laboratory findings include elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK), indicating muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis). The absence of infection or other drug intake further supports this diagnosis. NMS is caused by dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia, leading to autonomic dysfunction, hyperthermia, and muscle rigidity. Treatment involves immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic, aggressive supportive care (IV fluids, cooling measures), and medications such as dantrolene (a muscle relaxant) and bromocriptine (a dopamine agonist). Incorrect Options: Option A: Drug Overdose – While an overdose of haloperidol or other antipsychotics can cause sedation, hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), it does not cause the full constellation of NMS symptoms (hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and elevated CPK/WBC count). Additionally, NMS can occur even at therapeutic doses, not just in overdose situations. Option C: Drug-Induced Parkinsonism – Drug-induced parkinsonism is an EPS caused by dopamine blockade, leading to symptoms like bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremors. However, it does not cause fever, autonomic instability, or significantly elevated CPK levels, which are hallmarks of NMS. Moreover, mutism and severe akinesia are more typical of NMS than drug-induced parkinsonism. Option D: Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) – TD is a chronic movement disorder that develops after long-term use of antipsychotics, characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements (e.g., lip smacking, tongue rolling, choreiform limb movements).

The key features of NMS—fever, autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile blood pressure, excessive sweating), muscle rigidity, confusion, and decreased communication—are all present in this case. Laboratory findings of elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels and leukocytosis further support the diagnosis, as they indicate muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) and systemic inflammation, both hallmarks of NMS. The simultaneous use of lithium and haloperidol increases the risk of NMS because lithium enhances dopamine depletion and can exacerbate neurotoxicity when combined with antipsychotics.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The most likely diagnosis in this patient is lithium toxicity (Option A). The patient, who is on lithium therapy for a mood disorder, presents with altered sensorium, tremors, increased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), urinary incontinence, and a history of recent severe gastroenteritis. The serum lithium level of 1.95 mEq/L is above the therapeutic range (0.6–1.2 mEq/L) and suggests toxicity. Lithium is excreted through the kidneys, and any condition that causes dehydration (such as gastroenteritis) can lead to reduced renal clearance, increasing lithium levels and resulting in toxicity. The neurological symptoms (altered mental status, tremors, hyperreflexia) and autonomic dysfunction (urinary incontinence) are characteristic of moderate-to-severe lithium toxicity. Management includes: Immediate cessation of lithium Aggressive hydration with intravenous fluids (to enhance renal excretion) Hemodialysis if lithium levels are severely elevated (>2.5 mEq/L) or if neurological symptoms worsen Incorrect Options: Option B: Dehydration – While dehydration due to gastroenteritis contributed to reduced lithium clearance, it does not fully explain the patient's symptoms. Dehydration alone typically causes hypotension, tachycardia, and dizziness, whereas this patient has neurological symptoms (altered sensorium, tremors, hyperreflexia), which are indicative of lithium toxicity rather than simple dehydration. Option C: Manic Episode – Mania presents with hyperactivity, euphoria, pressured speech, and insomnia, but does not cause tremors, hyperreflexia, urinary incontinence, or altered sensorium. Additionally, the elevated lithium level suggests a toxic rather than psychiatric cause. Option D: Depressive Stupor – Depressive stupor is characterized by profound psychomotor retardation, mutism, and unresponsiveness but does not explain the tremors, increased DTRs, or lithium level elevation. The presence of neuromuscular symptoms and recent gastroenteritis strongly favors lithium toxicity over a primary depressive disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most appropriate laboratory value to closely monitor in this patient is creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (Option B). The patient has chronic schizophrenia, recent dose escalation of antipsychotic medication, high fever (103°F), muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability (fluctuating blood pressure)—all of which are characteristic of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a life-threatening reaction to dopamine-blocking agents, particularly first-generation (typical) antipsychotics. A key feature of NMS is rhabdomyolysis, which leads to muscle breakdown and the release of intracellular contents, including creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Monitoring CPK levels helps assess the severity of muscle damage and the risk of complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) due to myoglobinuria. Incorrect Options: Option A: WBC (White Blood Cell Count) – Leukocytosis (elevated WBC count) can occur in NMS due to systemic stress and inflammation, but it is nonspecific and does not correlate with disease severity. While WBC levels may be elevated, they are not the most critical parameter to monitor. Option C: Creatinine Clearance – Although AKI can develop secondary to rhabdomyolysis (due to myoglobin-induced tubular damage), creatinine clearance is not the primary marker to track initially. CPK levels are a more direct measure of muscle breakdown, making them the better choice for monitoring disease progression. Option D: Antipsychotic Levels – Serum antipsychotic levels are not routinely measured in NMS. NMS is a clinical diagnosis, and its severity is not directly correlated with drug serum levels. Instead, discontinuation of the offending drug and supportive management (IV fluids, cooling, dantrolene, and bromocriptine if needed) are key interventions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) The most appropriate action in this case is to switch the patient to clozapine (Option E). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a long-term, involuntary movement disorder caused by chronic use of antipsychotics, particularly first-generation neuroleptics. In patients with TD, the movements are often irreversible, and the condition can severely affect quality of life. However, the first-line management approach for patients with TD who require continued antipsychotic treatment is to switch to a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic with a lower risk of causing or worsening TD. Clozapine is the most effective atypical antipsychotic for managing TD and is often considered the treatment of choice when other options are insufficient. It has strong antipsychotic properties and is known to improve both the psychiatric symptoms and the movement symptoms associated with TD. Incorrect Options: Option A: Start the patient on benztropine – Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is commonly used to treat extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) like acute dystonia and parkinsonism, which can occur early in the course of antipsychotic treatment. However, benztropine is not effective for tardive dyskinesia and could potentially worsen the condition by adding further anticholinergic burden. Therefore, it is not the appropriate treatment for TD. Option B: Start the patient on amantadine – Amantadine is a medication that can help alleviate symptoms of parkinsonism, including rigidity and bradykinesia. While it may be effective for some forms of drug-induced movement disorders, it is not a first-line treatment for tardive dyskinesia and has limited benefit in improving involuntary movements typical of TD. Additionally, it does not address the underlying cause of the movement disorder (dopamine receptor hypersensitivity). Option C: Start the patient on propranolol – Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is effective for treating certain types of tremors (such as essential tremor or tremors related to anxiety) but does not address tardive dyskinesia. It is not effective for managing the choreiform, stereotypical movements seen in TD, which is caused by dopamine receptor hypersensitivity. Option D: Start the patient on diphenhydramine – Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties that can help manage acute extrapyramidal side effects (e.g., dystonia or akathisia). However, diphenhydramine does not treat tardive dyskinesia, and in fact, it may not provide any benefit and could even worsen the symptoms due to its anticholinergic effects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The most probable diagnosis in this case is schizophrenia (Option C). The sudden onset of detachment, irrational writing, and nonsensical language suggest a psychotic disorder, and schizophrenia is the most likely diagnosis given these symptoms. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by disorganized thinking, delusions, and hallucinations, and the patient's behavior (writing nonsensical poems and stories that others cannot understand) is consistent with disorganized speech and thought processes. Schizophrenia often presents with cognitive disorganization, where the content of speech or writing may become illogical or disconnected from reality, as seen in this case. Incorrect Options: Option A: Mania – Mania is characterized by elevated mood, increased energy, racing thoughts, impulsivity, and grandiosity. While it may involve disorganized behavior or hyperactivity, mania typically does not manifest with nonsensical speech or irrational writing as the primary symptom. The absence of mood elevation or other manic symptoms makes this diagnosis unlikely. Option B: Genius Writer – While some genius writers may produce unique or complex works, the key distinguishing factor here is that the writing is nonsensical and irrational, which would not be expected from someone displaying the typical behaviors of a genius writer. Contextual and linguistic incoherence is indicative of a psychotic process, not mere creative or eccentric behavior. Option D: Delusional Disorder – Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (false beliefs) that are not accompanied by other significant cognitive impairments or disorganized thinking. This patient’s behavior goes beyond just delusions, as it includes disorganized thought patterns, nonsensical writing, and a lack of rational context, which are more characteristic of schizophrenia than delusional disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) is a life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic medications like trifluperazine, a typical neuroleptic. The classic features of NMS include hyperthermia, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction (such as sweating), and muscle rigidity. In order to properly assess and manage NMS, the necessary investigations would include: Hemogram (to assess for leukocytosis): Leukocytosis is commonly seen in NMS as part of the systemic inflammatory response. CPK (creatine phosphokinase): Elevated CPK is a key marker of muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) that occurs in NMS due to rigidity and muscle injury. Renal function tests: Renal function is crucial to monitor because rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) due to myoglobinuria. Thus, Option D is the correct answer because these investigations are critical for diagnosing and assessing the severity of NMS and its potential complications (like renal failure). Incorrect Options: Option A: CT scan brain and hemogram – A CT scan of the brain is not helpful in diagnosing NMS since the symptoms are due to the antipsychotic medication and not a structural brain issue. Hemogram might show leukocytosis but does not help in diagnosing the underlying cause of the symptoms like CPK and renal function tests do. Option B: Hemogram, electrolyte levels, and creatinine – While electrolyte imbalances can occur with NMS, particularly due to rhabdomyolysis or dehydration, the most critical investigation in NMS is CPK rather than electrolytes alone. Creatinine is part of renal function tests, but the inclusion of electrolytes is not the priority in this setting. Option C: ECG, chest X-ray, and hemogram – ECG and chest X-ray are unlikely to provide information relevant to the diagnosis of NMS, as the primary concern is muscle damage and renal function. A hemogram might show leukocytosis, but the investigation of CPK and renal function is more specific for diagnosing and managing NMS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The most appropriate choice in this case is aripiprazole (Option D). The patient is experiencing weight gain, breast enlargement, and lactation, which are likely side effects of the antipsychotic medication chlorpromazine. These symptoms are often caused by hyperprolactinemia, which can occur due to the dopamine-blocking effects of typical antipsychotics like chlorpromazine. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that has a partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 receptors, meaning it modulates dopamine activity rather than fully blocking it. This mechanism helps reduce the risk of hyperprolactinemia and related side effects such as galactorrhea and weight gain. Aripiprazole is known to have a favorable metabolic profile and is less likely to cause the endocrine side effects seen with other antipsychotics. Incorrect Options: Option A: Fluphenazine – Fluphenazine is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and, like chlorpromazine, is associated with a high risk of hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to breast enlargement and lactation. Switching to fluphenazine would likely exacerbate the patient's symptoms, not alleviate them. Option B: Haloperidol – Haloperidol is another typical antipsychotic that also has a high potential for causing hyperprolactinemia, leading to similar side effects like galactorrhea and weight gain. It would not be an appropriate choice if the goal is to reduce these endocrine-related side effects. Option C: Paliperidone – Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic and, although it is less likely than typical antipsychotics to cause severe extrapyramidal side effects, it still has the potential to elevate prolactin levels. Paliperidone is chemically related to risperidone, which can cause hyperprolactinemia and related symptoms. Switching to paliperidone would not resolve the issue of hyperprolactinemia in this patient.",

The patient’s twisting neck muscles, tremulousness of hands, stiffening of fingers, and protrusion of the tongue are characteristic of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), specifically acute dystonia. This reaction typically occurs soon after the initiation of antipsychotic medication or a dose increase.

Promethazine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, which can help alleviate muscle rigidity and other symptoms of dystonia by counteracting the effects of dopamine blockade. Incorrect Options: Option A: i.m. haloperidol – Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic and is not an appropriate choice for treating acute dystonia, as it may exacerbate the symptoms of extrapyramidal side effects. In fact, haloperidol can itself cause dystonic reactions, so it should not be used to treat one. Option B: i.m. olanzapine – Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic, and while it is less likely to cause severe extrapyramidal symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics, it can still cause them. In the case of acute dystonia, it is more appropriate to treat the symptoms with anticholinergic agents rather than giving more antipsychotic medication. Option D: Reassure the attendants – This option is inappropriate because acute dystonia is a serious medical condition that requires immediate treatment. It is not simply a dissociative symptom or something that can be ignored. The patient’s distress and the physical manifestations of dystonia indicate the need for urgent intervention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Neuroleptics. The patient is experiencing galactorrhea (nipple discharge) after being started on risperidone, a neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medication. Neuroleptics (like risperidone) can cause elevated prolactin levels, which is known to result in galactorrhea. Risperidone works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors, and this blockade leads to an increase in prolactin secretion, which in turn can cause breast enlargement and milk leakage in both men and women. Galactorrhea is a well-known side effect of many antipsychotics, especially those that block dopamine, like risperidone and haloperidol. Incorrect Options: Option A: Benzodiazepines – Benzodiazepines (such as diazepam or lorazepam) are primarily used for their anxiolytic and sedative effects. They do not interfere with the dopamine system and are not associated with hyperprolactinemia or galactorrhea. Therefore, they are not responsible for the patient's symptoms. Option C: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors – Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine or sertraline, primarily affect serotonin levels and are not typically associated with galactorrhea. While SSRIs can have side effects like sexual dysfunction, they do not typically elevate prolactin levels or cause lactation. Option D: Nortriptyline – Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that primarily affects norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. It is not known to interfere with dopamine pathways or cause hyperprolactinemia and, consequently, galactorrhea. Therefore, it is unlikely to be responsible for the patient’s symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Passivity phenomena. Babu's belief that his neighbors are using radio waves to control his mind is a classic example of passivity phenomena. This refers to the experience where an individual feels that their thoughts, emotions, or actions are being controlled by external forces. In Babu's case, the belief that radio waves are controlling his mind suggests a feeling of external influence on his mental processes, which is a hallmark of passivity phenomena. Incorrect Options: Option A: Delusion of persecution – Delusion of persecution involves a false belief that one is being targeted or harmed by others, such as thinking that one is being followed or spied upon. While Babu does feel that he is being followed, his primary belief involves control of his mind, which points more toward passivity phenomena than a persecutory delusion. Persecutory delusions would focus more on threats or harm, not mind control. Option C: Auditory hallucination – Auditory hallucinations involve hearing things that are not present, such as voices or sounds. Babu does not report hearing any voices or sounds in this scenario; instead, he is experiencing a delusional belief about external forces influencing his mind, which is not a hallucination. Option D: Thought insertion – Thought insertion involves the belief that one's thoughts are not their own and have been placed into their mind by an external force. While Babu may feel his mind is being controlled, his experience centers on the belief of radio waves controlling his thoughts, which is more aligned with passivity phenomena than thought insertion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Corneal deposits. The patient has a long history of schizophrenia and has been on chlorpromazine for 25 years. Chlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic that can cause corneal deposits as a side effect, especially with prolonged use. These deposits are a form of pigmentary changes in the cornea, and they are typically visible on ophthalmoscopy or through slit-lamp examination. The corneal deposits are usually harmless but can cause visual disturbances like blurred vision or glare, as the deposits interfere with the normal light passage through the cornea. Incorrect Options: Option A: Retinitis pigmentosa – Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic retinal disorder characterized by progressive night blindness and tunnel vision due to the degeneration of the retinal photoreceptors. This condition is unrelated to the use of chlorpromazine or other antipsychotics, making it an unlikely cause of the patient's vision changes. Option B: Macular degeneration – Macular degeneration primarily affects older adults and involves damage to the central retina (macula), leading to central vision loss. This is usually unrelated to chlorpromazine use and is more commonly associated with aging or other risk factors like smoking or hypertension. Option C: Glaucoma – Glaucoma refers to increased intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. While chlorpromazine can cause some side effects affecting eye pressure, it is not a typical cause of glaucoma. Glaucoma is more likely to be related to other risk factors, such as family history or age.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Schizoaffective disorder. This patient's presentation of auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and elevated mood (jumping on top of a car, feeling hyperactive) along with insomnia (not feeling tired despite not sleeping for 2 days) suggests a manic episode with psychotic features, which fits the criteria for schizoaffective disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of psychotic symptoms (like hallucinations) and mood symptoms (either mania or depression) that occur simultaneously or at different times. The fact that the patient was previously hospitalized with psychotic symptoms and a normal mood also supports the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, where mood episodes can alternate with psychotic episodes. Incorrect Options: Option A: Schizophrenia – While this patient is experiencing psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations and paranoia), the mood symptoms (insomnia and hyperactivity, possibly mania) suggest a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder rather than schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is primarily a psychotic disorder without prominent mood episodes, and the patient’s mood disturbance would not fit this diagnosis. Option B: Schizotypal disorder – Schizotypal personality disorder involves odd beliefs, eccentric behavior, and social anxiety but does not include mood disturbances like mania or psychotic episodes. This patient's acute psychosis and manic symptoms do not align with a personality disorder, making this diagnosis less likely. Option D: Bipolar disorder – Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood disturbances, specifically mania and depression. While this patient does have symptoms of mania (e.g., hyperactivity, insomnia), the presence of psychotic symptoms like auditory hallucinations points toward schizoaffective disorder rather than bipolar disorder alone. In bipolar disorder, psychosis can occur but is typically mood-congruent, which is not specified here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Schizophrenia. The patient’s firm and unshakable belief that his hands are passing through his body and gripping his lungs suggests a delusional belief, which is a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia. This type of somatic delusion, where a person believes something unusual or impossible is happening to their body, is commonly seen in schizophrenia. In this case, the delusion about the hands and lungs is bizarre (it defies the laws of physics) and is characteristic of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Incorrect Options: Option B: Depression – Depression can be associated with somatic complaints such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, and physical aches, but it does not typically present with delusional beliefs such as the one described here. While psychotic features can occur in severe major depressive disorder, these are usually mood-congruent (e.g., feelings of guilt, worthlessness) rather than bizarre delusions like the one described. Option C: Somatization – Somatization disorder involves the presence of physical symptoms that are not explained by a medical condition. However, somatization does not typically involve bizarre delusions about the body’s functioning, such as the belief that the hands are passing through the body and gripping the lungs. Somatization tends to focus more on chronic pain and physical complaints without the delusional and psychotic nature of the symptoms seen here. Option D: Asthma – Asthma is a respiratory condition characterized by wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. It does not cause delusional beliefs about the body or a sensation of the hands passing through the body. The physical symptoms of asthma may involve the lungs, but they are not related to the psychotic delusion described in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Paranoid schizophrenia. This patient presents with disorganized behavior (reduced sleep, confusion) and a paranoid delusion (believing there is a camera fixed behind her head, constantly following her). These symptoms are consistent with paranoid schizophrenia, a subtype of schizophrenia characterized by delusions (in this case, a persecutory delusion about being watched) and disorganized thinking or behavior. The duration of 9 months and the presence of psychotic features support this diagnosis. Incorrect Options: Option A: Psychotic depression – Psychotic depression involves depressive symptoms (such as low mood, anhedonia, fatigue) along with psychotic features (such as mood-congruent delusions or hallucinations). However, this patient's presentation focuses more on paranoid delusions without significant mood disturbance (e.g., sadness or hopelessness), making psychotic depression less likely. Option C: Delusional disorder – Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (e.g., believing in a situation that could realistically happen) without other psychotic features. However, the patient in this case has a bizarre delusion (a camera following her), which is more indicative of schizophrenia rather than delusional disorder. Additionally, the patient’s disorganized behavior (e.g., reduced sleep) also points to a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia rather than a delusional disorder. Option D: Insomnia – Insomnia refers to difficulty falling or staying asleep, but it does not explain the paranoid delusion about the camera or the disorganized behavior. While insomnia can be a symptom of many psychiatric disorders, it alone does not account for the psychotic features in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Schizophrenia. The patient is presenting with gradual onset of suspiciousness, muttering, smiling without clear reason, violent outbursts, and lack of interest in studies, which are all indicative of schizophrenia. The blunt affect, thought broadcast, and impaired judgment and insight are classic signs of schizophrenia, particularly the disorganized type, which often includes odd behavior, social withdrawal, and inappropriate emotional responses (such as smiling without reason). The gradual onset and preserved cognition (not significant memory or attention problems) also suggest a primary psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. Incorrect Options: Option A: Delusional disorder – Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (e.g., the belief that one is being persecuted or followed) without the broad range of other psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking or affective flattening. While this patient may exhibit paranoia, the presence of disorganized behavior, muttering, violent outbursts, and blunted affect points more toward schizophrenia rather than a delusional disorder. Option B: Depression – Depression can cause low interest in activities and social withdrawal, but it does not explain the suspiciousness, muttering, and violent outbursts, which are more typical of psychotic disorders. In addition, the blunted affect and thought broadcast are more characteristic of a psychotic disorder, particularly schizophrenia, than of depression, where affective disturbances are typically more low or sad rather than blunted. Option D: Anxiety disorder – While anxiety can lead to social withdrawal and impairment in daily activities, the patient's symptoms of suspiciousness, disorganized behavior (muttering, smiling without reason), and violent outbursts go beyond what would typically be seen in an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders generally do not present with disorganized thinking or psychotic features such as thought broadcast.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) He is reacting to external stimuli. This option suggests that the patient’s symptoms may be due to an external factor, such as a reaction to external stressors or stimuli. This does not directly relate to the pathophysiology or side effects of neuroleptic medications, nor does it specifically explain the sadness, withdrawal, and lack of communication seen in the patient. Therefore, this is the least likely cause of the symptoms, as it doesn't reflect an intrinsic medical or psychiatric issue related to the schizophrenia or its treatment. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Parkinsonism – Parkinsonism is a well-known side effect of neuroleptics (antipsychotics), particularly the older typical antipsychotics. It can cause motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, tremors, and a mask-like face, which can contribute to the patient’s withdrawal and sadness. The reduced facial expression and difficulty with movement can result in the patient appearing withdrawn and less communicative. Option B: Major depression – Depression can often coexist with schizophrenia, particularly if the patient is facing persistent life challenges or side effects from antipsychotic medications. Symptoms such as sadness, lack of communication, and withdrawal are classic signs of depression, which can develop either as a side effect of the neuroleptics or as part of the patient’s overall psychiatric condition. Option C: Negative symptoms are still persisting – Negative symptoms in schizophrenia (such as social withdrawal, blunted affect, lack of motivation, and reduced speech), are often not fully alleviated with neuroleptic treatment. Negative symptoms can persist even after psychotic symptoms are treated, which could explain the sadness and lack of engagement observed in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Delusional disorder. The patient displays a fixed, false belief that the boy is in love with her despite the boy’s clear denials. This belief is unshakable, and the woman continues to pursue the boy despite resistance from her family. Her preoccupation with the boy is a delusional belief, which is characteristic of delusional disorder, particularly the erotomanic type, where the person believes that another individual (often of higher social status) is in love with them. The patient’s ability to maintain her daily routine and the absence of significant mood disturbances also supports the diagnosis of delusional disorder rather than other psychiatric conditions. Incorrect Responses: Option B: Depression – While the patient shows signs of sadness when her efforts to meet the boy fail, this sadness does not appear to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, as she is able to maintain her daily routine and is not experiencing the full spectrum of depressive symptoms, such as low energy, worthlessness, or suicidal thoughts. The persistent delusional belief in the boy’s love is not typical of depression, which is generally characterized by more pervasive mood changes and impaired functioning. Option C: Mania – Mania typically involves a elevated mood, increased energy, impulsivity, and grandiosity, but this patient does not exhibit these features. Her behavior is more focused on the delusional belief about the boy, and she does not demonstrate the hyperactivity, risky behaviors, or excessive self-esteem that are common in mania. Option D: Schizophrenia – While schizophrenia can involve delusions, this patient does not exhibit the disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or hallucinations typically seen in schizophrenia. The delusion in this case is isolated to the belief about the boy’s love, and the patient is able to maintain social and occupational functioning, which is not typical in schizophrenia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hebephrenic Schizophrenia. This patient exhibits several hallmark features of hebephrenic schizophrenia, which is also known as disorganized schizophrenia. Key symptoms that point to this diagnosis include: Inappropriate behavior: The patient’s loosening of clothes at inappropriate places and laughing inappropriately are signs of disorganized behavior. Disorganized speech: The confusing speech that unpredictably shifts from one topic to another reflects disorganized thinking, another characteristic feature of hebephrenic schizophrenia. Other odd behaviors: Mirror gazing and giggling to self further indicate disorganized behavior and thinking typical of this subtype. These features align well with hebephrenic schizophrenia, which primarily involves disorganized thought, disorganized behavior, and inappropriate emotional responses. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Catatonic Schizophrenia – Catatonia involves motor symptoms such as immobility, mutism, posturing, or excessive movement (excitement). This patient does not exhibit these motor abnormalities, but rather has more disorganized behaviors like laughing inappropriately and confusing speech, which are not characteristic of catatonic schizophrenia. Option B: Simple Schizophrenia – Simple schizophrenia refers to a subtype of schizophrenia characterized by gradual onset of symptoms such as emotional blunting, lack of motivation, and deterioration in social and occupational functioning. This patient’s symptoms, such as inappropriate laughter, disorganized speech, and odd behavior, are more aligned with the disorganized type of schizophrenia, not the simple subtype. Option D: Paranoid Schizophrenia – Paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by delusions (often of persecution or grandeur) and hallucinations, especially auditory ones. The patient in this case does not show signs of paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations, making paranoid schizophrenia an unlikely diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms are more suggestive of disorganization than paranoia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Persistent Delusion Disorder. This diagnosis is appropriate for this patient because: The patient has persistent delusions regarding his wife’s infidelity, his friend’s involvement, and the belief that people are speaking ill of him. These are fixed, false beliefs that are not easily dispelled by reasoning or contrary evidence. The delusions are non-bizarre (i.e., they could be considered plausible but are still untrue) and persist for more than a month. Importantly, the patient does not exhibit any thought disorder, hallucinations, or other psychotic symptoms. He is otherwise functioning normally, which distinguishes this condition from more severe psychotic disorders. The delusions in persistent delusion disorder are often non-bizarre, as in this case, and the individual generally retains relatively intact functioning outside of the delusions. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Paranoid Personality Disorder – While the patient exhibits paranoid beliefs, paranoid personality disorder is characterized by pervasive mistrust and suspicion of others, including friends and family, in a chronic manner. The key difference here is that the delusions in persistent delusional disorder are more focused and specific, and the patient is not experiencing the broader pattern of suspiciousness and distrust that is typical in paranoid personality disorder. Option B: Schizophrenia – Schizophrenia typically involves a combination of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms (such as lack of motivation or flat affect). This patient has no signs of hallucinations, disorganized speech, or impaired functioning, which are key features of schizophrenia. The delusions here are isolated and do not fit the broader profile of schizophrenia. Option C: Acute and Transient Psychosis – Acute and transient psychosis involves rapid onset of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, which last for a short period (usually less than a month). This patient’s delusions have persisted for two months, which does not meet the criteria for acute and transient psychosis. Additionally, he has not exhibited a complete loss of reality or severe impairment in functioning, which typically occurs in acute psychosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acute Psychosis. This diagnosis is appropriate for the following reasons: The patient is experiencing hallucinations (hearing voices) and aggressive behavior, which are characteristic features of acute psychosis. Additionally, the patient has a fever and the symptoms have been present for 2 days. The acute onset of these symptoms, especially with the presence of fever, suggests a possible medical condition (e.g., infection) triggering the psychosis, often referred to as secondary psychosis. This is different from a primary psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. The absence of a history of psychiatric illness supports the likelihood of an acute onset of psychosis rather than a chronic psychotic disorder. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Dementia – Dementia is typically a chronic, progressive decline in cognitive function, which is not seen here. This patient has an acute onset of symptoms (fever, hallucinations, aggression), which points to a much more recent and acute issue. Dementia would not cause sudden auditory hallucinations in a young individual. Option C: Delirium – While delirium can cause confusion, hallucinations, and agitation, it is often associated with disorientation, impaired attention, and fluctuating consciousness. The primary feature of delirium is acute confusion, and the patient here does not display significant disorientation or fluctuating consciousness. The presence of fever in this case could indicate an underlying infection, but delirium would typically involve more global cognitive impairment rather than focused psychotic symptoms. Option D: Delusional Disorder – Delusional disorder involves the presence of persistent, non-bizarre delusions (false beliefs), but it does not typically include hallucinations, especially auditory hallucinations. This patient’s presentation, with fever, hallucinations, and aggressive behavior, is more indicative of an acute psychotic episode rather than a delusional disorder, which would usually involve chronic false beliefs without the acute onset of symptoms seen here.",

He also avoids social situations like school and markets due to these fixed, false beliefs. These are hallmark features of paranoid schizophrenia, a subtype of schizophrenia characterized by prominent delusions of persecution and social withdrawal. His beliefs are delusional, not just excessive fears, which points toward psychosis, not neurosis. Incorrect Options and Why They Are Incorrect: A. Anxiety neurosis While anxiety can cause social avoidance, it does not involve delusions. In social anxiety disorder, the person fears judgment, not persecution or harm. The boy’s belief that others are talking about and trying to harm him is more paranoid than anxious. B. Manic Depressive Psychosis (Bipolar Disorder) There’s no evidence of mood symptoms such as mania (elevated mood, overactivity) or depression (sadness, hopelessness). The predominant feature is paranoia, not mood swings. C. Adjustment reaction This is a short-term emotional response to an identifiable stressor. The boy’s fixed paranoid thoughts and social withdrawal suggest a more severe and chronic condition than a simple adjustment disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Clozapine therapy Clozapine is the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In this case, the patient has not responded to two different antipsychotics (Risperidone and Haloperidol), which is indicative of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. When patients fail to respond to at least two adequate trials of antipsychotic medications (typically one atypical and one typical), clozapine is recommended. Clozapine has been shown to be more effective than other antipsychotics in such cases and can help reduce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It is the next best course of action when other medications have failed. Incorrect Responses: Option A: A combination of two typical antipsychotics – Combining two typical antipsychotics (such as Haloperidol and another similar drug) is not recommended because it does not provide any additional benefit over using a single medication. Moreover, combining typical antipsychotics increases the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects. This approach is typically avoided in modern psychiatric practice. Option B: A combination of typical and atypical antipsychotics – Combining typical and atypical antipsychotics may be considered in some cases, but the practice is generally not supported by strong evidence. The combination might increase the risk of side effects without significantly improving outcomes compared to switching to clozapine or trying other strategies for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Thus, this is not the most effective next step. Option C: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) – ECT is considered a last-resort treatment for severe cases of schizophrenia, particularly when symptoms are life-threatening or when other treatments (including clozapine) have failed. However, it is typically reserved for cases where there are severe mood symptoms (e.g., psychotic depression) or in cases of catatonia, and is not the first-line option for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine remains the preferred treatment when pharmacologic agents have failed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The correct treatment for a pregnant woman with mania who has a history of recurrent episodes of major depression is Haloperidol, which is a typical antipsychotic. In this case, the woman is presenting with symptoms of mania (decreased sleep, increased appetite, and hyperactivity), which is part of bipolar disorder. During pregnancy, haloperidol is considered one of the safer antipsychotics for the treatment of acute mania because it is a low-risk medication in pregnancy compared to other options. It helps manage symptoms effectively while minimizing potential risks to the fetus. Incorrect Responses: Option B: Lithium – Lithium is a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder and is highly effective in treating both manic and depressive episodes. However, lithium poses significant teratogenic risks during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, where it can cause cardiac malformations (such as Ebstein’s anomaly). Due to these risks, lithium is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester unless the benefits outweigh the risks. It would not be the preferred choice in this case. Option C: Promethazine – Promethazine is an antihistamine commonly used for its sedative and antiemetic effects, but it is not used to treat the symptoms of mania or bipolar disorder. It is not indicated for treating mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder, and would not address the core symptoms of mania in this patient. Option D: Clonazepam – Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used to manage anxiety and seizures. Although benzodiazepines can have sedating effects and might be used in some mood disorders for short-term symptom control (especially for anxiety), clonazepam is not an appropriate first-line treatment for mania. In addition, long-term use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is not recommended due to potential risks to the fetus, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in neonates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Delusional disorder The correct diagnosis for this patient is Delusional disorder. This condition is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions that are held with strong conviction despite evidence to the contrary. In this case, the patient believes that his nose is deformed despite multiple reassurances from plastic surgeons, which indicates a fixed, false belief. This belief is not based in reality, and the patient experiences significant distress and embarrassment due to it. These characteristics align with delusional disorder, specifically a somatic type, where the delusion involves a false belief about the body or a body part (in this case, the nose). Incorrect Responses: Option A: Somatization disorder – Somatization disorder (now called somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5) involves multiple physical complaints that cannot be fully explained by a medical condition, but the key difference is that the individual in somatization disorder does not have a fixed belief that the physical symptoms are caused by a specific physical deformity. Instead, the patient typically expresses worry or distress over the symptoms themselves, rather than a firm conviction about a physical deformity, as seen in this case. Option B: Hypochondriacal disorder – Hypochondriacal disorder (now called illness anxiety disorder in DSM-5) involves excessive worry about having or developing a serious illness, but it is not typically based on a fixed delusion about a specific body part, as seen here. In hypochondriacal disorder, the worry is about being ill or having a disease, but the individual may not have a clear, false belief of deformity or physical change in a particular body part, as the patient does in this case. Option D: OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) – OCD is characterized by obsessions (recurrent, intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors performed to alleviate the anxiety caused by obsessions). While the patient may be excessively concerned about the appearance of their nose, there is no mention of compulsions (e.g., checking or grooming behavior) in this case. The belief about the deformity is delusional, not driven by repetitive behaviors or intrusive thoughts as seen in OCD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A seizure disorder The correct response is D. A seizure disorder. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia but carries a risk of seizures. Seizures are a known side effect, especially at higher doses or in individuals with a history of seizure disorders. Therefore, a seizure disorder is considered a relative contraindication for clozapine use, as the drug can lower the seizure threshold. Incorrect Responses: Option A: A history of severe extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) while on haloperidol – Extrapyramidal symptoms are a side effect of typical antipsychotics like haloperidol, but they are not a contraindication to clozapine. In fact, clozapine is less likely to cause EPS compared to typical antipsychotics. Therefore, a history of EPS with haloperidol does not preclude the use of clozapine and may even be a reason to try clozapine, given its relatively lower risk of EPS. Option B: The presence of mild tardive dyskinesia – Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder caused by prolonged use of antipsychotics, especially typical antipsychotics. While it is important to consider TD when prescribing antipsychotic medications, clozapine has been shown to have a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia compared to typical antipsychotics. Therefore, mild tardive dyskinesia is not a contraindication to clozapine therapy. Option C: A history of recurrent depressive symptoms – A history of depressive symptoms does not necessarily contraindicate clozapine use. In fact, clozapine has been shown to have some antidepressant effects, especially in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Depression in schizophrenia can coexist with the condition, and clozapine is often used when other antipsychotics are ineffective. A history of depressive symptoms is not a major contraindication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Intrusive and critical families have a detrimental effect on schizophrenic patients The correct answer is C. Intrusive and critical families have a detrimental effect on schizophrenic patients. Families play a significant role in the psychosocial recovery of individuals with schizophrenia. Critical, intrusive, or overly demanding family interactions can lead to increased stress and worsening of symptoms. Expressed emotion (EE), which includes criticism, hostility, and emotional over-involvement, has been associated with worse outcomes in schizophrenia, including relapse and poor adherence to treatment. In this scenario, the patient's parents' disappointment and their critical attitude may contribute to further psychological distress for the patient, which could exacerbate his symptoms. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Schizophrenic patients do not need constant encouragement to stay motivated – This statement is incorrect because motivation is often impaired in individuals with schizophrenia, particularly in terms of self-care and social functioning. Patients may require ongoing encouragement and support from both healthcare providers and their families to engage in activities like attending group therapy or maintaining their personal hygiene. Hence, the idea that they don’t need encouragement is misleading. Option B: Family style of interaction makes no difference in the prognosis – This statement is incorrect because the style of family interaction does influence prognosis in schizophrenia. Positive family involvement and supportive communication are beneficial, while critical or emotionally over-involved families can lead to poorer outcomes. Studies consistently show that families' behavior can significantly impact relapse rates and the overall course of the illness. Option D: Family therapy has not proved to be of value in the treatment of schizophrenia – This statement is incorrect because family therapy has actually been shown to be beneficial for patients with schizophrenia. Family interventions can improve communication, reduce expressed emotion, and promote adherence to treatment. Family therapy is considered a valuable component of a comprehensive treatment plan for schizophrenia, particularly in preventing relapse and enhancing the patient's social functioning.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Clozapine The correct answer is B. Clozapine. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is especially effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. When a patient with schizophrenia continues to experience auditory hallucinations despite being on first-line antipsychotics like chlorpromazine (CPZ), clozapine is often used as a second-line treatment for those who do not respond adequately to typical antipsychotics. Clozapine is particularly beneficial in patients with resistant schizophrenia and has been shown to significantly reduce positive symptoms (such as hallucinations) in such cases. It is also considered for patients with recurrent psychosis despite adequate trials of other antipsychotics. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Haloperidol – Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic and is commonly used in the acute management of schizophrenia. However, since the patient has developed auditory hallucinations despite being on chlorpromazine, which is another typical antipsychotic, switching to another typical antipsychotic like haloperidol may not be the most effective option. Haloperidol might not offer a substantial advantage over chlorpromazine in this case, and it does not address treatment resistance as well as clozapine. Option C: Sulpiride – Sulpiride is a dopamine antagonist used as an antipsychotic, but it is generally not as effective for treatment-resistant schizophrenia as clozapine. While it can be useful for treating positive symptoms, its efficacy in refractory cases is not as high as that of clozapine. Therefore, in cases where a patient has not responded to chlorpromazine, sulpiride would not be the preferred next step. Option D: Tianeptine – Tianeptine is an antidepressant rather than an antipsychotic. It is used primarily for the treatment of depression and has no role in treating schizophrenia or its symptoms, including auditory hallucinations. This makes it an inappropriate choice for a patient experiencing a recurrence of psychotic symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dyskinesia The correct answer is A. Dyskinesia. Dyskinesia refers to involuntary, irregular movements, often in the form of tremors, tics, or writhing motions. These movements are commonly seen in patients who have been on long-term antipsychotic medications (especially dopamine antagonists like haloperidol or chlorpromazine). Over time, the dopamine receptors become supersensitive as a result of prolonged dopamine blockade. This heightened sensitivity to dopamine can lead to tardive dyskinesia, a specific type of dyskinesia that manifests as involuntary movements, especially of the face, mouth, and tongue. The supersensitivity of dopamine receptors is thought to be a key mechanism behind this condition. Incorrect Responses: Option B: Akathisia – Akathisia is a restlessness or compulsive urge to move that results from dopamine receptor antagonism, particularly with the use of antipsychotics. It is different from dyskinesia in that it primarily involves motor restlessness rather than involuntary, purposeless movements. Akathisia is related to dopamine blockade, but it is not caused by supersensitivity of dopamine receptors. Option C: Pseudoparkinsonism – Pseudoparkinsonism is characterized by rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor, resembling the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is caused by dopamine blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, not by the supersensitivity of dopamine receptors. The supersensitivity of dopamine receptors leads to dyskinesia, not pseudoparkinsonism. Option D: Dystonia – Dystonia involves muscle contractions that result in twisting movements or abnormal postures. It is typically seen as a side effect of dopamine antagonists and is thought to be caused by an acute imbalance in dopamine levels. Dystonia usually occurs early in the course of antipsychotic treatment, whereas dyskinesia is associated with long-term use and dopamine receptor supersensitivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Schizophrenia The PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) is a clinical tool specifically used to assess the severity of symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. It evaluates the positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms of schizophrenia, which include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, as well as social withdrawal and emotional blunting. The PANSS scale is commonly used in both clinical practice and research to track symptom changes and assess the effectiveness of treatments in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Incorrect Responses: Option B: Mania – The PANSS scale is not used to assess mania. Mania is typically evaluated using tools like the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), which focuses on symptoms such as elevated mood, increased activity, and impulsivity. While there can be overlapping symptoms in different mental health disorders, PANSS is specifically designed for schizophrenia and not for mood disorders like mania. Option C: Dementia – Dementia is assessed using scales like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. These tools focus on cognitive decline, memory issues, and functional impairments, rather than the symptoms specific to schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, which are addressed by the PANSS scale. Option D: Depression – Depression is assessed using scales like the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) or the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). These scales focus on symptoms of mood, interest, sleep, and appetite disturbances, which are different from the positive and negative symptoms seen in schizophrenia. PANSS is not designed for depression assessments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acetylcholine – This is the correct answer because abnormalities in acetylcholine have not been strongly linked to catatonia. While dopamine, GABA, and glutamate have all been implicated in the pathophysiology of catatonia, acetylcholine does not appear to play a significant role in its development or symptoms. Catatonia is more commonly associated with disturbances in other neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involved in movement regulation and excitability. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Dopamine – This is incorrect because abnormalities in the dopamine system are well-established in catatonia. Dopamine dysregulation, especially dopaminergic hyperactivity, has been implicated in catatonic symptoms, such as motor immobility, posturing, and odd movements. Dopamine antagonists (like antipsychotics) are commonly used in the treatment of catatonia, indicating its involvement in the condition. Option B: GABA – This is incorrect because abnormalities in the GABAergic system have been associated with catatonia. GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, is thought to contribute to motor control, and its dysfunction can lead to the development of motor abnormalities seen in catatonic patients. Benzodiazepines, which enhance GABAergic transmission, are a first-line treatment for catatonia, further supporting the role of GABA in the disorder. Option D: Glutamate – This is incorrect because abnormalities in the glutamatergic system have been reported in catatonia. Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, plays a crucial role in various neurological functions, including motor control. Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling, particularly through NMDA receptors, has been implicated in catatonic states. There is evidence that NMDA antagonists can induce catatonic-like symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Early treatment can decrease episode length and it may last less than a week. – This is the correct answer because postpartum psychosis is a severe mental health disorder that typically presents within the first few days to weeks after childbirth. Early intervention with appropriate treatment (which often includes antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and sometimes hospitalization) can help reduce the length of the episode and may even result in resolution of symptoms in a matter of days to weeks. If treated promptly, the psychotic episode can indeed last less than a week, with a good response to medication. Incorrect Responses: Option B: In general, those who have the disorder have a poor prognosis. – This is incorrect because while postpartum psychosis is a serious condition, the prognosis is generally good when it is treated early and appropriately. Most women recover completely with treatment, especially when psychiatric care is started promptly. Long-term outcomes are generally positive, and recurrence of episodes is not guaranteed in all cases. Option C: Women with this illness may be at decreased risk of later psychiatric admission. – This is incorrect because women who have experienced postpartum psychosis are at an increased risk of future psychiatric episodes, including later admissions to psychiatric hospitals. While many women recover fully after the acute episode, those who have had postpartum psychosis may have a higher risk of developing mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder, later in life. Option D: Antipsychotics are contraindicated. – This is incorrect because antipsychotics are often used as part of the treatment for postpartum psychosis, particularly for those with severe psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotics, including atypical antipsychotics, are not contraindicated and are commonly used to manage the psychotic features of the disorder, especially when there are delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. The benefits typically outweigh the risks when managed carefully, especially with newer medications that have a better safety profile.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) It does not respond to the usual treatments. – This is the false statement because late-onset schizophrenia (which typically develops after the age of 45) does respond to treatment. In fact, it is often treated with antipsychotic medications, similar to early-onset schizophrenia. While there might be variations in treatment responses, the disorder is responsive to the usual treatments like antipsychotics and sometimes mood stabilizers or antidepressants. In fact, many patients with late-onset schizophrenia can have substantial symptom improvement with appropriate pharmacologic interventions. Incorrect Responses: Option A: It occurs more frequently in older women. – This is true. Late-onset schizophrenia is more commonly seen in older women, particularly those over 45 years old. This age-specific increase is particularly noted in women who may have a hormonal component (such as menopause) influencing the onset of symptoms. Option B: Those with this disorder tend to have fewer negative symptoms. – This is true. Late-onset schizophrenia tends to be associated with fewer negative symptoms (such as apathy, social withdrawal, or lack of motivation) compared to those who develop schizophrenia earlier in life. Individuals with late-onset schizophrenia may have more positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations) and fewer cognitive impairments, making the presentation somewhat different from early-onset cases. Option C: Neuropsychological testing may reveal deficits. – This is true. Even in late-onset schizophrenia, neuropsychological testing can often reveal cognitive deficits, particularly in areas like attention, memory, and executive function. These deficits are typically less severe than those observed in early-onset schizophrenia but are still present in many cases.",

It is often experienced as an uncanny or unsettling sensation of encountering one's own double or an identical version of oneself. This phenomenon can be associated with various psychological conditions, including dissociation and certain forms of schizophrenia or other mental health disorders. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Shadow following person – This is incorrect. A shadow is simply a dark area or shape produced by a body coming between rays of light and a surface. While a shadow might seem to follow someone, this is not the definition of a doppelgänger, which specifically refers to a feeling or belief of having a double. Option C: Identification of stranger as familiar – This is incorrect. The experience of identifying a stranger as familiar is typically associated with déjà vu or familiarity illusions and does not correspond to the concept of a doppelgänger. A doppelgänger is related to the feeling of having a double of oneself, not a misidentification of someone else.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Higher socioeconomic status – This is not an environmental risk factor for schizophrenia. While lower socioeconomic status has been linked with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia, higher socioeconomic status does not contribute to an increased risk. In fact, social stressors and adverse living conditions in lower socioeconomic groups are often more closely associated with the development of schizophrenia. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Cannabis use – This is correct as an environmental risk factor. Cannabis use, especially during adolescence, has been strongly linked to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia in individuals who are genetically predisposed. It is considered a modifiable risk factor that may increase the likelihood of onset or exacerbation of symptoms in those already vulnerable. Option B: Migration – This is correct as an environmental risk factor. Migration, particularly moving from one country or culture to another, is associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. The stress of migration, discrimination, and cultural challenges can contribute to the onset of psychosis in vulnerable individuals. Option D: Obstetric complications – This is correct as an environmental risk factor. Obstetric complications such as prenatal exposure to infections, malnutrition, or hypoxia during birth have been found to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. These prenatal factors may disrupt the normal development of the brain, leading to an increased risk for psychosis later in life.",

This genetic condition is associated with a deletion on chromosome 22 and is linked to a significantly increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Individuals with DiGeorge syndrome have a higher risk of psychotic disorders, particularly schizophrenia, in comparison to the general population. It is considered a high-risk genetic condition for the development of schizophrenia. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Down's syndrome – While individuals with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) may have developmental and intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia is not a common feature of this condition. People with Down's syndrome may experience other psychiatric conditions, such as depression or anxiety, but the prevalence of schizophrenia is lower compared to other genetic disorders like DiGeorge syndrome. Option C: Klinefelter’s syndrome – Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY) is a chromosomal condition that affects males and is characterized by an extra X chromosome. Individuals with this syndrome may have some cognitive and behavioral issues, but schizophrenia is not commonly associated with Klinefelter’s syndrome. However, there may be an increased risk for other psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety. Option D: Neurofibromatosis – Neurofibromatosis (both type 1 and type 2) is a genetic disorder that causes growth of tumors along nerves in the skin, brain, and other parts of the body. While there is some evidence that individuals with neurofibromatosis may have an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is not a hallmark feature of this condition.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Echopraxia – Echopraxia refers to the involuntary imitation or mimicking of another person’s movements or body posture. This symptom is typically observed in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, and it occurs when a person repeats or mirrors the physical actions of others. In this case, the patient mimics the examiner’s body posture and movements, which is characteristic of echopraxia. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Perseveration – Perseveration refers to the repetition of a particular response or behavior despite the cessation of the stimulus or the fact that the response is no longer appropriate. This can occur in various conditions, including brain injuries or certain psychiatric disorders. However, perseveration does not involve the imitation of others' movements, as seen in this case, but rather the persistence of a previously performed action. Option B: Palilalia – Palilalia is characterized by the repetition of one’s own words or phrases, typically in a rapid or accelerated manner. This symptom is often seen in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease or other disorders involving motor and speech control. However, it does not refer to the imitation of another person’s behavior or posture. Option C: Echolalia – Echolalia refers to the repetition of another person’s speech. This symptom is often observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, certain neurological conditions, and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. While echolalia involves repeating another person's words, it does not pertain to mimicking physical movements or body posture, as seen in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Decreased, increased, decreased – In individuals with schizophrenia, structural brain changes are often observed over time. These changes typically include: Decreased hippocampal volume: Schizophrenia is associated with reduced hippocampal size, which is involved in memory and emotional regulation. Hippocampal shrinkage is a common finding in individuals with schizophrenia and may contribute to cognitive deficits. Increased size of cerebral ventricles: Enlargement of the ventricles (the fluid-filled spaces in the brain) is a well-documented feature of schizophrenia, indicating a loss of brain tissue. This enlargement can be observed over time, particularly in chronic cases. Decreased glucose utilization in the frontal cortex: Reduced glucose metabolism in the frontal cortex is another common feature of schizophrenia. This area of the brain is involved in executive functions, such as decision-making and impulse control. Dysfunction in the frontal cortex contributes to the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia. Incorrect Responses: Option A: Increased, increased, increased – While there is evidence of increased cerebral ventricle size in schizophrenia, the hippocampus volume is typically decreased in these patients, not increased. Similarly, glucose utilization in the frontal cortex is usually decreased, not increased, in schizophrenia. Therefore, this answer is not correct. Option B: Decreased, decreased, decreased – While the hippocampus and ventricles are both affected in schizophrenia, with the hippocampus being decreased and the ventricles increased, glucose utilization in the frontal cortex is decreased, not further decreased. Therefore, this option does not fit the expected pattern of changes in the brain observed in schizophrenia. Option C: Decreased, decreased, increased – Although the hippocampus and ventricles do show decreased and increased changes respectively in schizophrenia, glucose utilization in the frontal cortex tends to be decreased, not increased. This makes this option incorrect.",
