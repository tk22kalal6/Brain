In this case the patient feels that they have a limb from which in fact they are not receiving any sensations either because it has been amputated or because the sensory pathways from it have been destroyed. In most phantom limbs the phenomenon is produced by peripheral and central disorders. Phantom limb occurs in about 95% of all amputations after the age of 6 years.",

This is because posturing is defined as the spontaneous and active assumption and maintenance of a bizarre or inappropriate posture for a prolonged period. The patient in the scenario is voluntarily holding his arms in an extended position, which is a classic example of this symptom. While catalepsy is a related condition, it specifically refers to a state of sustained posture where the patient's limbs can be molded into a new position by an examiner and will remain there, which is known as waxy flexibility. Since the patient is actively initiating and maintaining the pose, and resisting the examiner, posturing is the most accurate",
