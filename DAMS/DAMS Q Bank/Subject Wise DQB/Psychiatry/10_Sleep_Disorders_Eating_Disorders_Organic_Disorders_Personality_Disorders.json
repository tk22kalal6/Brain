      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sexual sadism. Sexual sadism disorder is a paraphilic disorder characterized by deriving sexual arousal from inflicting pain, humiliation, or suffering on another person. Individuals with this condition often require their partner to experience physical or emotional suffering to achieve sexual gratification. In this case, the patient’s partner enjoys inflicting pain on him, which is a defining feature of sexual sadism disorder. When this behavior causes distress to the affected partner or leads to non-consensual harm, it is classified as a paraphilic disorder rather than just a personal preference. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Sexual masochism – Incorrect Sexual masochism is the opposite of sexual sadism. It involves deriving sexual pleasure from experiencing pain, humiliation, or suffering. However, in this scenario, the patient’s partner enjoys inflicting pain rather than receiving it, making sexual masochism an incorrect choice. (C) Exhibitionism – Incorrect Exhibitionism is a paraphilic disorder in which an individual gains sexual pleasure from exposing their genitals to unsuspecting strangers. This behavior is driven by shock or fear reactions from others and is unrelated to the infliction of pain seen in this case. (D) Frotteurism – Incorrect Frotteurism involves gaining sexual gratification by rubbing against a non-consenting person in a crowded place (e.g., subways or public spaces). This disorder is characterized by secretive, non-consensual physical contact, which is unrelated to the sadistic behaviors described in the case.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd beliefs, eccentric behavior, and social anxiety, along with paranoid ideation or magical thinking. Individuals with this disorder may appear odd or peculiar in their thinking and behavior, and they often experience difficulty forming close relationships due to their social anxiety and mistrust of others. While they may not have full-blown psychosis, their odd beliefs (such as magical thinking or ideas of reference) and paranoid behavior make this diagnosis the most appropriate for this patient. The patient's odd beliefs, paranoia, and lack of close friends are hallmarks of schizotypal personality disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Avoidant personality disorder – Incorrect Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by social inhibition, a fear of criticism, and a desire for acceptance but with an overwhelming fear of rejection. These individuals avoid social interactions because they feel inadequate and excessively anxious about being judged. However, they do not exhibit paranoia or odd beliefs, which are more characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder. The lack of close friends in avoidant personality disorder is due to fear of rejection, not the paranoia seen in schizotypal personality disorder. (B) Paranoid personality disorder – Incorrect Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive distrust and suspicion of others, often leading individuals to believe that others are plotting against them. While paranoid behavior is common in both paranoid and schizotypal personality disorders, schizotypal personality disorder also involves more eccentric beliefs (e.g., magical thinking, odd perceptions) and social anxiety, which this patient demonstrates. Paranoid personality disorder is primarily about distrust and suspicion without the more eccentric beliefs seen in schizotypal personality disorder. (C) Narcissistic personality disorder – Incorrect Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Individuals with this disorder typically exhibit self-centered behaviors, seek to be admired, and often have an inflated sense of their own importance. The patient’s odd beliefs, paranoia, and lack of close friends are not indicative of narcissistic personality disorder, which focuses more on self-importance and exploitation of others.",

      "difficulty_level": "intermediate",
      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, along with impulsivity. Individuals with BPD often experience intense emotions and have a fear of abandonment, which leads to unstable relationships. They may also demonstrate impulsivity, such as engaging in risky behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, reckless driving), and show irritability or anger outbursts. The woman's presentation of unstable relationships, poor self-image, and impulsivity aligns well with BPD, making it the most appropriate diagnosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Histrionic personality disorder – Incorrect Histrionic personality disorder involves a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors. People with this disorder may be dramatic and seek to be the center of attention, often using seductive behavior or exaggerated emotions to gain attention. However, unlike BPD, histrionic personality disorder is not characterized by impulsivity or unstable relationships. The patient’s poor self-image and impulsivity are more indicative of BPD than histrionic personality disorder. (C) Antisocial personality disorder – Incorrect Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for others’ rights, deceitfulness, manipulation, and lack of remorse for harmful behaviors. Individuals with this disorder often engage in criminal activities or violate social norms without feeling guilt. While the woman may show impulsivity, antisocial behavior (e.g., criminality) and lack of empathy for others are not described in her presentation. The primary focus of BPD is emotional instability and relationship issues, rather than antisocial traits. (D) Dependent personality disorder – Incorrect Dependent personality disorder is characterized by excessive need to be taken care of, submissiveness, and difficulty making decisions independently. People with dependent personality disorder may have a fear of abandonment, but they do not tend to exhibit the impulsivity, irritability, or unstable relationships seen in BPD. This woman’s pattern of impulsiveness and irritability makes BPD a better fit than dependent personality disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Panic disorder. The patient exhibits symptoms of a panic attack, which is a key feature of panic disorder. These symptoms include sharp chest pain, shortness of breath, racing heartbeat, cold sweats, and fear of dying, all of which are characteristic of panic attacks. Panic disorder is marked by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks followed by persistent concern or worry about future attacks. The fact that the cardiac workup came back negative for myocardial ischemia further supports the diagnosis of panic disorder, as these physical symptoms are often not related to a medical condition but instead to intense psychological distress. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Hypochondriasis – Incorrect Hypochondriasis, now referred to as Illness Anxiety Disorder, involves excessive preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness, often despite medical evidence to the contrary. While the patient in this case is experiencing distressing physical symptoms, her concern is more about a sudden fear of dying rather than an ongoing worry about a specific illness. The acute nature of her symptoms suggests panic disorder rather than illness anxiety disorder. (B) Malingering – Incorrect Malingering is characterized by intentional production of false symptoms to achieve an external goal, such as financial compensation or avoiding work. There is no indication from the scenario that the patient is seeking to gain something external from her symptoms. The patient's distress appears genuine, with a fear of dying, which is more consistent with panic disorder. (C) Pain disorder – Incorrect Pain disorder (or somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain) involves experiencing significant physical pain that is not fully explained by a medical condition, but it is usually associated with chronic pain or discomfort. The symptoms in this case are acute, involve a variety of physical symptoms beyond just pain, and include significant emotional distress, such as fear of death. This is more consistent with a panic attack than with pain disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Symptom production conscious, motivation primarily unconscious. In this case, the 12-year-old boy is intentionally producing symptoms (pain) that are not supported by any medical findings, which is a conscious act. However, the motivation for this behavior is likely unconscious. The boy is not consciously aware of the psychological factors driving his behavior, such as the attention or sympathy he may receive due to his symptoms. His history of repeated hospitalizations for unexplained pain, his knowledge of medical texts, and the improvement in his condition when not being observed suggest that the pain may be a form of psychosomatic symptom (somatic symptom disorder), where the boy's unconscious psychological needs are being expressed through physical symptoms. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Symptom production conscious, motivation primarily conscious – Incorrect While the boy is consciously producing symptoms, his motivation is likely not fully conscious. In this case, he is likely unaware of the deeper psychological factors influencing his pain, such as seeking attention or avoiding other stressors, which would make the motivation more unconscious than conscious. (B) Symptom production unconscious, motivation primarily conscious – Incorrect This option suggests that the boy is unconsciously producing pain symptoms, which does not fit the case. The boy appears to be aware of his symptoms, as evidenced by his intentional use of a medical textbook and his understanding of the terminology related to his condition. The symptoms are not being produced without his awareness. (D) Symptom production unconscious, motivation primarily unconscious – Incorrect This option would suggest that the boy is both unconsciously producing the symptoms and unaware of the motivation behind them. However, the boy is intentionally producing symptoms, as seen in his awareness of medical literature and the fact that his condition improves when not under observation. Thus, his symptom production is conscious.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dissociative identity disorder. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states or identities, each with its own pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the world. In this case, the woman cannot remember posing for the photograph and does not recognize the man who signed the letter. These memory gaps, especially when they involve actions that are out of character for her, suggest the possibility of DID, where different identities may take control of her behavior at different times, leading to dissociative amnesia for those actions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Dissociative amnesia – Incorrect Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually following a traumatic or stressful event. While the woman has amnesia for the photograph and the man who sent it, the presence of a new identity or a sense of a \"different person\" engaging in behaviors she cannot recall points more specifically to DID, not just a general amnesia. (B) Dissociative fugue – Incorrect Dissociative fugue is a subtype of dissociative amnesia, in which a person suddenly travels away from their usual surroundings and is unable to recall their past, sometimes adopting a new identity. While the woman experiences memory loss, there is no indication that she has traveled or adopted a completely new identity during a period of dissociation, making this diagnosis less likely. (D) Depersonalization disorder – Incorrect Depersonalization disorder involves persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached or estranged from one's own body or mental processes, as if one is an outside observer of their thoughts or actions. While the woman experiences amnesia for a portion of her life, there is no indication that she feels detached from her own identity or body in the manner typical of depersonalization disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Kleine–Levin syndrome The description of **\"bouts of overeating\" and \"oversleeping\", lasting from a few days to a few weeks, is most consistent with Kleine–Levin syndrome (KLS). KLS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by recurring episodes of excessive sleepiness (hypersomnia), overeating (hyperphagia), and behavioral changes such as irritability, confusion, or altered mood. The episodes typically last for days to weeks, and between episodes, the person returns to normal functioning. KLS is most often seen in adolescents and can occur in both males and females, although it is more common in males. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (B) Kluver-Bucy syndrome – Incorrect Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a rare neurological condition caused by damage to the temporal lobes, often involving bilateral lesions in the amygdala. The condition is characterized by hyperphagia (compulsive overeating), hyperorality (putting objects in the mouth), visual agnosia, and hypersexuality, but it does not present with episodic patterns of symptoms lasting weeks, as seen in Kleine–Levin syndrome. The symptoms of Kluver-Bucy syndrome are more constant, not episodic. (C) Narcolepsy – Incorrect Narcolepsy involves excessive daytime sleepiness and may also include cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. However, the hallmark feature of narcolepsy is recurrent episodes of sleepiness throughout the day, typically with sudden and irresistible sleep attacks, rather than the prolonged episodes of hypersomnia and hyperphagia seen in KLS. Additionally, narcolepsy does not typically involve the episodic nature of symptoms or the marked overeating described here. (D) Obstructive sleep apnoea – Incorrect Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, leading to sleep disruption, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. OSA typically does not involve episodes of overeating or long periods of excessive sleep as in KLS. Moreover, OSA is more commonly seen in adults, particularly those with risk factors like obesity, rather than in adolescents as a primary cause.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dysthymia The patient's symptoms, including irritability, low mood, lack of interest in surroundings, and general dissatisfaction, lasting for 3 years but without significant changes in sleep or appetite, are consistent with dysthymia, now referred to as persistent depressive disorder (PDD) in the DSM-5. Dysthymia is characterized by a chronic low-grade depression that lasts for at least 2 years (with no more than 2 months without symptoms), and patients typically experience symptoms like low mood, irritability, and lack of interest, but often without the severity of symptoms found in major depression. The absence of sleep disturbances or appetite changes further supports this diagnosis. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Major depression – Incorrect Major depression is characterized by more severe symptoms that significantly interfere with a person’s daily functioning. Typical symptoms include marked changes in sleep, appetite, energy levels, concentration, and often suicidal thoughts. The patient described in this case does not exhibit the intensity of symptoms usually associated with major depression, such as significant weight loss, insomnia, or feelings of worthlessness. The symptoms in this case are more consistent with the chronic, low-grade nature of dysthymia, rather than the episodic and more disabling features of major depressive disorder. (B) No psychiatric disorder – Incorrect While the patient does report symptoms of low mood and irritability, the duration (3 years) and the nature of the symptoms are enough to suggest a diagnosis of dysthymia. The absence of significant disruptions to sleep or appetite does not rule out a psychiatric disorder. In fact, these milder, chronic depressive symptoms fit the criteria for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) rather than being classified as \"no psychiatric disorder.\" (D) Chronic fatigue syndrome – Incorrect Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by profound fatigue that is not improved with rest and often includes additional symptoms such as muscle pain, headaches, memory issues, and sleep disturbances. The patient in this case does not report the characteristic fatigue or physical symptoms associated with chronic fatigue syndrome. His mood-related symptoms (irritability, low mood, and lack of interest) point more toward a depressive disorder rather than a somatic condition like chronic fatigue syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adjustment disorder The most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old father is adjustment disorder. This condition arises when an individual experiences difficulty coping with a stressful life event, such as learning that their child has leukemia. The father exhibits symptoms like low mood, sleep deprivation, and headache, which are common in adjustment disorder. However, the key feature is that these symptoms are a reaction to the stressor (his son's illness), and the person is still able to function reasonably well, as evidenced by his interaction with others and continuing to go to work. Adjustment disorder is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that occur in response to identifiable stressors but do not meet the criteria for a more severe psychiatric condition like major depression. It usually resolves once the individual adjusts to the stressor or the stressor is removed. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Depression – Incorrect While this father is experiencing symptoms like low mood, sleep deprivation, and headache, which are common in depression, there are a few distinguishing factors. Depression typically involves more severe and persistent symptoms that interfere with daily functioning, such as a marked decrease in interest in activities, social withdrawal, and a lack of energy. Although the father has a low mood, he is still able to interact reasonably well and attend work, which suggests the symptoms are less severe than what is typically seen in major depression. (B) Psychogenic headache – Incorrect Psychogenic headache refers to a headache that is primarily caused by emotional or psychological factors rather than any underlying medical condition. While the father’s headache might be influenced by stress, the broader context of sleep deprivation, low mood, and lethargy points to an emotional response to a stressful life event (his son's illness), which is better described by adjustment disorder rather than a diagnosis of psychogenic headache. The presence of other symptoms beyond just the headache further supports the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. (D) Somatization disorder – Incorrect Somatization disorder involves the presence of multiple, unexplained physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by medical conditions. While the father does have headaches, these are likely a response to the psychological stressor of his son’s illness, and the symptoms do not appear to be chronic or widespread as would be expected in somatization disorder. The father's symptoms seem to have a clear cause (the stress of his son’s illness) and are not presenting as a pattern of unexplained physical symptoms typical of somatization disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Somatization disorder The most probable diagnosis for this 45-year-old male is somatization disorder. Somatization disorder is characterized by the presence of multiple physical symptoms that are unexplained by medical or neurological conditions, typically affecting several organ systems. In this case, the patient is experiencing headache, body pains, diarrhea and constipation, impotence, and tingling/paresthesia in a glove and stocking pattern, which points toward a chronic pattern of unexplained physical complaints across different body systems. The lack of a clear medical diagnosis to explain these symptoms, along with the chronicity of the symptoms and the fact that they are vague and intermittent, fits well with somatization disorder, where individuals express their psychological distress through physical symptoms. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Hypochondriasis – Incorrect Hypochondriasis (now referred to as illness anxiety disorder) involves excessive worry about having a serious illness, despite the absence of significant symptoms or a medical diagnosis. In this case, the patient does have physical symptoms, and it is more likely that these symptoms are genuine, though unexplained by medical conditions. Somatization disorder is characterized by physical complaints with no clear medical cause, whereas hypochondriasis involves excessive fear of disease rather than actual physical symptoms. This makes hypochondriasis an incorrect diagnosis. (C) Conversion disorder – Incorrect Conversion disorder (also known as functional neurological symptom disorder) involves the presence of neurological symptoms (such as paralysis, blindness, or seizures) that cannot be explained by medical conditions. These symptoms are thought to be psychologically induced, often related to a stressful event. However, this patient’s symptoms, which include headache, body pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and tingling in a glove and stocking pattern, are not confined to neurological symptoms alone, and do not clearly suggest the acute, dramatic neurological deficits typically seen in conversion disorder. (D) Factitious disorder – Incorrect Factitious disorder involves intentionally producing or feigning physical or psychological symptoms in order to assume the sick role. This diagnosis would be more likely if the patient were intentionally fabricating or exaggerating his symptoms. There is no indication that the patient is intentionally faking his symptoms; rather, the patient is genuinely experiencing these physical complaints, which appear to be unexplained by medical causes. Somatization disorder fits better as the diagnosis in this case because the symptoms are unexplained but are not intentionally produced.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Kleptomania The most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is kleptomania. This disorder is characterized by a compulsive urge to steal, often without the need for the stolen items, and is usually accompanied by guilt or remorse after the theft. The patient exhibits repetitive stealing behavior, particularly stealing money and borrowing money from friends and family, with a strong sense of guilt afterward, which is typical of kleptomania. The patient also describes an inability to control the impulse to steal, indicating a compulsive nature of the behavior, which is the hallmark of kleptomania. Explanation of Incorrect Responses: (A) Antisocial personality disorder – Incorrect Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) involves a pattern of disregard for the rights of others, and includes behaviors like deceitfulness, impulsivity, aggression, and a lack of remorse for causing harm to others. While this patient has engaged in stealing and reckless behavior, ASPD would be indicated if the patient showed a more pervasive pattern of violating the rights of others without guilt or remorse. The key distinction here is the guilt the patient feels, which is inconsistent with ASPD. Kleptomania involves stealing due to an impulse control disorder, with remorse afterward, whereas ASPD is marked by a lack of remorse. (B) Conduct disorder – Incorrect Conduct disorder is typically diagnosed in children and adolescents and involves a pattern of aggressive behavior, violating societal norms, and disregard for others' rights. While stealing may be part of conduct disorder, it is not the primary feature. Additionally, this patient's behavior has persisted into adulthood and is associated with a compulsive impulse to steal, which points more toward kleptomania rather than conduct disorder. (C) Pathological gambling – Incorrect Pathological gambling is characterized by a compulsive need to gamble, often leading to financial ruin and a preoccupation with gambling. While this patient has engaged in betting in the past, his behavior is primarily centered on stealing and not gambling. The compulsive stealing and the guilt he feels after his actions are more indicative of kleptomania rather than pathological gambling.",

However, Kleine-Levin syndrome predominantly affects males, with a higher incidence in males than females. This makes option A incorrect, as female predominance is not a feature of the syndrome. Incorrect Options: B. Hypersomnia: Hypersomnia is a hallmark feature of Kleine-Levin syndrome. Individuals with KLS experience periods of excessive sleep, which can last for days, weeks, or even longer, often with minimal wakefulness during these episodes. Therefore, hypersomnia is a correct characteristic of the condition. C. Hypersexuality: Hypersexuality is a well-known symptom of Kleine-Levin syndrome. During episodes of the syndrome, patients may exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior, which can manifest as an increase in sexual desire or activity. This is an established and common symptom of KLS. D. Hyperphagia: Hyperphagia, or excessive eating, is another common symptom of Kleine-Levin syndrome. Patients during an episode may consume large amounts of food and exhibit an insatiable appetite. This is frequently reported alongside hypersomnia and hypersexuality in KLS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Consciousness intact Somnambulism, also known as sleepwalking, occurs during deep non-REM sleep and involves complex behaviors such as walking or performing tasks while asleep. Despite engaging in these behaviors, the person is not conscious or aware of their actions during the episode. This makes option D (consciousness intact) incorrect. In fact, during somnambulism, consciousness is not intact, and the individual is typically in a state of partial arousal, which is why they are unaware of their actions. Incorrect Options: A. Disorder of sleep arousal: Somnambulism is indeed considered a disorder of sleep arousal, as it occurs during transitions between sleep stages, particularly during deep non-REM sleep. The person is aroused partially, but not fully, leading to automatic behaviors like walking or talking. This is a correct statement about the disorder. B. Also known as sleep walking: Somnambulism is another term for sleepwalking, which accurately describes the behavior of walking or engaging in activities while in a state of sleep. This is a well-known characteristic of the condition, so this option is correct. C. Slow motor skills: During somnambulism, individuals tend to exhibit slow, clumsy motor skills as they are still in a sleep-like state. While they can walk or perform tasks, their coordination is often impaired, and movements may appear slow or awkward. This is an accurate description of the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Orgasm stage Premature ejaculation is a sexual dysfunction that typically occurs during the orgasm stage of the sexual response cycle. This is when ejaculation happens sooner than desired, often before or shortly after penetration, and usually with minimal sexual stimulation. It is considered a disorder of the orgasm phase of sexual function, and it is primarily due to early reflexive ejaculation, often influenced by factors such as anxiety, hypersensitivity, or a lack of control over the ejaculatory reflex. Incorrect Options: A. Excitement stage: The excitement stage of the sexual response cycle involves the initial physical arousal, such as increased heart rate, muscle tension, and genital vasocongestion. While difficulties in arousal can contribute to sexual dysfunction, premature ejaculation does not typically arise from issues at this stage, so this option is incorrect. B. Plateau stage: The plateau stage is characterized by increased sexual tension and arousal, just before the orgasm. While some sexual dysfunctions may be related to issues during this stage (such as erectile dysfunction or performance anxiety), premature ejaculation specifically occurs during the orgasm phase, not the plateau stage. Therefore, this option is incorrect. D. Resolution stage: The resolution stage follows orgasm and involves the body returning to a non-aroused state. This phase is not associated with premature ejaculation, as ejaculation itself has already occurred. Any dysfunction occurring during resolution would be related to issues such as delayed or absent ejaculation, not premature ejaculation. Hence, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sudden NREM Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that involves excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden onset of sleep. In narcolepsy, individuals can experience REM sleep abnormalities, such as entering REM sleep directly from wakefulness, rather than going through the typical NREM sleep stages first. Therefore, the option that mentions sudden NREM is incorrect because narcolepsy is associated with sudden transitions to REM sleep rather than NREM. Incorrect Options: A. Familial with mutation of anti-gen of class II MHC: Narcolepsy has a genetic component, and studies have shown that it can be familial. The disorder is linked to a mutation in the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) gene, particularly in class II MHC molecules, which are involved in immune system regulation. This genetic predisposition increases the risk of narcolepsy, making this statement true. B. Sudden loss of muscle tone: A hallmark symptom of narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is a sudden and temporary loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions, such as laughter or surprise. This is a key feature of the condition and supports the truth of this option. D. Irresistible desire to sleep: A central symptom of narcolepsy is the irresistible urge to sleep, which can occur at inappropriate times, such as during work or social activities. Individuals with narcolepsy often experience overwhelming sleepiness and may fall asleep suddenly, even in the middle of conversations or tasks. This statement is also true.",

Epidemiological studies have shown that OCPD is more frequently diagnosed in men, particularly in comparison to women. This makes the statement in option C incorrect. Incorrect Options: A. The essential feature of the disorder is a pervasive pattern of perfectionism and inflexibility: This is the defining characteristic of OCPD. Individuals with this disorder often exhibit perfectionism, a need for control, and rigidity in their thinking and behavior. They may also have difficulty delegating tasks and often become preoccupied with rules, order, and details. This statement is true. B. Epidemiologically, DSM 5 reports an estimated prevalence ranging from 2 to 8 percent: The estimated prevalence of OCPD in the general population, as reported in the DSM-5, is between 2% and 8%, which is accurate. This is in line with the general understanding of how common OCPD is in the population, making this statement true. D. Freud hypothesized that the disorder is associated with difficulties in the anal stage of psychosexual development: Sigmund Freud theorized that OCPD may be linked to unresolved conflicts during the anal stage of psychosexual development. He suggested that if a child experiences harsh or overly strict toilet training, it could lead to a fixation that results in behaviors seen in OCPD, such as a need for control and order. This statement is true and reflects Freud's psychoanalytic perspective on personality development.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Low cortisol In anorexia nervosa, low cortisol is not typically seen. Instead, patients may experience an increase in cortisol levels due to stress and starvation. The body responds to the stress of malnutrition by releasing more cortisol, which is a stress hormone. This is the reason D is the correct answer, as low cortisol is not a common complication in anorexia nervosa. Incorrect Options: A. Low LH/FSH: In anorexia nervosa, low LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are commonly observed. These hormones play a role in the reproductive system, and their levels often drop due to nutritional deprivation, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This leads to reduced sexual function and amenorrhea in females. This statement is true. B. Low thyroid hormones: Low thyroid hormones (such as low T3 and T4) are commonly seen in anorexia nervosa, a condition known as euthyroid sick syndrome. The body reduces thyroid hormone production during periods of starvation or severe caloric restriction to conserve energy. This statement is true. C. Low estrogen/testosterone: Both estrogen in females and testosterone in males are typically low in anorexia nervosa due to the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This contributes to menstrual irregularities in women and decreased libido and sexual dysfunction in both sexes. This statement is true.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bruxism. Bruxism, which refers to the grinding or clenching of teeth, is commonly observed during NREM stage II of sleep. This stage is characterized by light sleep, and the body undergoes a series of physiological changes, including muscle relaxation, which can lead to involuntary actions such as teeth grinding. Bruxism tends to occur during this stage due to the transition between deeper sleep stages and light sleep, where the body may not be as relaxed as in deep sleep (NREM stage III). Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Night terrors: Night terrors occur during NREM stage III or deep sleep, not stage II. They are intense episodes of fear, confusion, and panicking, which are usually accompanied by screaming and thrashing. These typically happen in the first few hours of sleep during the deeper stages of NREM sleep, especially stage III, not stage II. C. Nocturnal enuresis: Nocturnal enuresis, or bedwetting, typically happens during deep sleep (stage III) as well, which involves loss of control over the bladder due to deep relaxation of the body. It is less likely to occur during NREM stage II, which is lighter sleep compared to stage III. D. Somniloquy: Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur during any stage of sleep, including both NREM and REM. However, it is more commonly associated with REM sleep or during transitions between sleep stages, especially when the brain is more active. While it can happen during NREM stage II, it is not specific to it.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Splitting. Splitting is considered the primary defense mechanism in borderline personality disorder (BPD). This involves viewing situations, people, or oneself as all good or all bad, with no middle ground. Individuals with BPD may oscillate between idealizing others and then devaluing them, which reflects an inability to integrate these extremes. This pattern helps them cope with emotional instability, as the rigid thinking shields them from more painful or complex feelings. Now, let’s examine why the other options are incorrect: A. Repression: Repression is a defense mechanism in which distressing thoughts, memories, or impulses are unconsciously blocked from conscious awareness. While it can be present in various psychological disorders, it is not the primary mechanism in BPD. People with BPD are more likely to experience intense emotions that are not repressed but are instead split between extremes. B. Projection: Projection involves attributing one’s own unacceptable feelings or thoughts onto others. Though projection can occur in BPD, it is not as central as splitting. People with BPD may use projection as a way to cope with their own fears of abandonment or self-identity issues, but splitting is more characteristic of the disorder. C. Identification: Identification involves adopting the characteristics or behaviors of another person, often to reduce anxiety. While it can play a role in certain disorders, it is not the primary defense mechanism in BPD. Individuals with BPD are more likely to exhibit splitting as a way of dealing with emotional turmoil and relationship instability.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Primary erectile dysfunction is more common than secondary erectile dysfunction. Secondary erectile dysfunction is actually more common than primary erectile dysfunction. Secondary erectile dysfunction occurs after a period of normal sexual function, often due to medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, which can impair blood flow to the penis. In contrast, primary erectile dysfunction refers to a lifelong inability to achieve or maintain an erection, which is less common. The higher prevalence of secondary erectile dysfunction is attributed to the increased risk factors such as aging and chronic health conditions. Now, let’s examine why the other options are incorrect: A. Presence of nocturnal penile tumescence rules out medical causes: Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), or spontaneous erections during sleep, is typically a sign that the erectile dysfunction is psychological rather than organic. If NPT is present, it suggests that the physical structures necessary for an erection are functioning properly, which rules out many medical causes. However, it does not completely rule out all medical causes, as some conditions like neurological disorders may not impact NPT. B. It is the most common sexual disorder in males: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is indeed the most common sexual disorder in males, especially as they age. It affects a significant portion of the male population, with prevalence increasing with age and often being linked to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity. C. Aetiology can be mixed (i.e. both organic as well as psychogenic factors can be present): Sexual arousal disorder in males can have both organic (such as hormonal imbalances, vascular issues, or neurological conditions) and psychogenic (such as stress, anxiety, or relationship problems) factors. It is often the case that a combination of these factors contributes to the disorder, making the etiology complex and multifactorial.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Compulsive checking behavior. Compulsive checking behavior is more characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) rather than obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). While both disorders share some traits, such as perfectionism and preoccupation with rules, OCPD typically involves a pattern of being overly focused on orderliness, perfectionism, and control, rather than the intrusive obsessions and compulsions like compulsive checking seen in OCD. OCPD does not generally involve the time-consuming rituals associated with compulsions, like checking. Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Perfectionism interfering with performance: One of the hallmark features of OCPD is perfectionism, which often interferes with performance. Individuals with OCPD tend to set unrealistically high standards for themselves and others, leading to frustration and a decrease in overall productivity. This perfectionism can result in an inability to complete tasks or a sense of dissatisfaction even with completed work. C. Preoccupation with rules: A preoccupation with rules, order, and structure is a defining characteristic of OCPD. Individuals with this disorder are often excessively focused on following strict rules or procedures, to the point where they may disregard flexibility and spontaneity. This preoccupation can negatively impact their relationships and daily functioning. D. Indecisiveness: Indecisiveness is common in OCPD due to the individual’s need for certainty and fear of making mistakes. Because they are overly concerned with getting things perfect and making the \"right\" choice, they often struggle with decision-making and can be paralyzed by the fear of making errors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are often used to treat stage 4 sleep disorders or parasomnias due to their sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. These medications help reduce the frequency and intensity of parasomnias such as sleepwalking, night terrors, and REM sleep behavior disorder. By enhancing GABAergic activity, benzodiazepines help induce a calming effect, allowing for smoother transitions through sleep stages and reducing the risk of disruptive behaviors associated with parasomnias. Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Melatonin: Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, and while it is useful for treating insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, it is not effective for parasomnias. Parasomnias involve abnormal behaviors during sleep, which melatonin alone cannot address, as it primarily works to initiate and regulate sleep timing rather than reduce disruptive behaviors during deep sleep stages. B. Ramelteon: Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that is mainly used to treat insomnia, particularly for individuals with difficulty falling asleep. Like melatonin, it helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle but is not a primary treatment for parasomnias. It lacks the sedative and muscle-relaxant effects needed to address the specific symptoms of stage 4 sleep disorders. C. Zolpidem: Zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic, is used to treat insomnia by helping individuals fall asleep. Although it may help with sleep initiation, it is not as effective for treating parasomnias. Unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem does not have the same muscle-relaxing properties or broader calming effects that are needed to manage parasomnias effectively.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lewy body dementia. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is most commonly associated with Lewy body dementia (LBD). In LBD, RBD occurs as a result of dysfunction in the brainstem regions that regulate sleep. RBD is characterized by the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to physical movements such as kicking, punching, or even acting out dreams. This disorder is frequently observed in individuals with LBD and is considered an early sign or prodrome of neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: B. MSA with parkinsonism: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) with parkinsonism is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects multiple systems in the body, including the autonomic nervous system. While RBD can be seen in MSA, it is less commonly associated with the condition than with Lewy body dementia. The predominant symptoms of MSA are related to motor dysfunction, including rigidity, bradykinesia, and autonomic disturbances. C. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and rapidly progressive prion disease that leads to severe neurological decline. While sleep disturbances, including insomnia and other parasomnias, can occur in CJD, RBD is not a hallmark feature of the disease. CJD typically presents with rapidly progressive cognitive decline, myoclonus, and ataxia rather than the abnormal REM sleep behaviors seen in RBD. D. Semantic variant of frontotemporal dementia: The semantic variant of frontotemporal dementia (svFTD) primarily affects the temporal lobes and is characterized by profound language deficits, including loss of word meaning and semantic memory. While frontotemporal dementia can present with a variety of behavioral disturbances, RBD is not typically associated with the semantic variant of FTD. The most common sleep disturbances in FTD are related to sleep-wake cycle disruptions rather than RBD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyperactivity of orexin releasing neurons in hypothalamus. In narcolepsy, the issue is actually a deficiency of orexin (also known as hypocretin), a neuropeptide involved in regulating wakefulness and REM sleep. Individuals with narcolepsy have a loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus, which leads to poor regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. This deficiency results in the hallmark symptoms of narcolepsy, including excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and disrupted sleep patterns. Hyperactivity of orexin neurons is not a feature of the disorder, making option B incorrect. Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Related gene on 6th chromosome MHC 2 HLA DR 2: This statement is true. Narcolepsy has a genetic component, and the HLA-DR2 gene on chromosome 6 is strongly associated with the condition. This gene is part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which plays a role in immune system function. The presence of this gene is thought to contribute to the immune-mediated destruction of orexin-producing neurons in the brain. C. Inability of brain to regulate sleep-wake cycle: This is true. Narcolepsy is characterized by an inability of the brain to properly regulate the sleep-wake cycle. This is due to the loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus, which are critical for maintaining wakefulness and controlling transitions between sleep stages. D. Sudden onset of REM sleep: This is true. One of the hallmark features of narcolepsy is the sudden onset of REM sleep, particularly during the transition from wakefulness. This can lead to symptoms like sleep paralysis or vivid hallucinations. Normally, REM sleep occurs later in the sleep cycle, but in narcolepsy, it can begin immediately upon falling asleep.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Masochism. Masochism is characterized by the derivation of sexual pleasure or orgasm from experiencing pain, humiliation, or suffering, often in the context of a sexual relationship. In this case, the woman reports that she can only achieve orgasm while recalling a previous abusive boyfriend, which suggests that her sexual arousal might be linked to the emotional pain or humiliation experienced during the abusive relationship. This is consistent with the characteristics of sexual masochism, where individuals may derive sexual pleasure from their own suffering or degradation. Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: B. Transvestitism: Transvestitism, or cross-dressing, refers to the act of dressing in clothing typically worn by the opposite sex for sexual arousal or pleasure. However, there is no indication in this case that the woman’s sexual arousal is linked to cross-dressing or gender expression, making this option unlikely to be the correct diagnosis. C. Sadism: Sadism involves deriving sexual pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others. In this case, the woman is experiencing sexual pleasure linked to her own emotional or physical suffering, rather than inflicting harm on someone else, so sadism does not fit this scenario. D. Pedophilia: Pedophilia involves sexual attraction to children or prepubescent individuals. There is no mention of children or inappropriate sexual attraction in this scenario, so this option is unrelated to the case.",

It is often characterized by a persistent and overwhelming preoccupation with sexual thoughts, fantasies, and behaviors, which can significantly impact an individual's daily life and relationships. The term is used to describe a hypersexual state in men, analogous to nymphomania in women. Now, let’s look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Nymphomaniac: The term nymphomaniac refers to excessive sexual desire, but it is typically used to describe females. It does not apply to males, so it is not the correct term in this case. B. Frigidity: Frigidity is an outdated term used to describe a lack of sexual desire or arousal in women. It does not refer to increased sexual desire in males, making it incorrect for this question. D. Orgasmic dysfunction: Orgasmic dysfunction refers to the inability or difficulty in achieving orgasm, not an increase in sexual desire.

The EEG typically shows low-amplitude mixed frequency activity, with occasional muscle twitches (myoclonus) and a decrease in eye movement. Now, let’s review the other options: B. Sleep stage 2 (N2): In stage 2 sleep, the EEG shows the presence of sleep spindles (short bursts of high-frequency activity) and K-complexes (a large amplitude wave) that help distinguish it from stage 1. It’s a deeper sleep stage than N1. C. Sleep stage 3 (N3): Stage 3 is characterized by delta waves (slow, high-amplitude brain waves) and is considered the deepest stage of NREM sleep. It is often called \"deep sleep\" or \"slow-wave sleep.\" D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dependent personality disorder. The woman in the scenario demonstrates several key features that are consistent with dependent personality disorder (DPD). Individuals with DPD have a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behaviors, and fears of separation. Her history of relying on her parents to make decisions for her, along with her current fear of being alone and staying in an abusive relationship, are hallmark traits of this disorder. People with DPD often have difficulty making decisions independently and may tolerate mistreatment to avoid being alone or facing the prospect of independence. Now, let’s review the other options: A. Schizoid personality disorder: Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a detachment from social relationships and a limited range of emotional expression. People with schizoid personality disorder often prefer solitary activities and have little interest in forming close relationships, which is in stark contrast to the woman in this scenario, who is clearly seeking connection and dependent on others. C. Schizotypal personality disorder: Schizotypal personality disorder involves eccentric behavior, odd beliefs, and social anxiety, often accompanied by peculiar speech or thoughts. While this disorder shares some traits with social anxiety, it does not typically include the deep need for reassurance or the submissive behavior seen in dependent personality disorder. D. Avoidant personality disorder: Avoidant personality disorder involves social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism. While this woman does exhibit anxiety about being alone, the key difference is that individuals with avoidant personality disorder avoid situations because of fear of criticism or rejection. In contrast, this woman is motivated more by a fear of abandonment and dependence on others rather than fear of social judgment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schizotypal personality disorder. The daughter in this scenario demonstrates behaviors consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. Individuals with this disorder often exhibit eccentric behaviors, odd beliefs, and magical thinking. The daughter’s intense interest in witchcraft, belief in having supernatural powers, and secretive nature are key signs of schizotypal personality disorder. These individuals may also struggle with forming close relationships, as seen in her lack of dating, friendships, and reluctance to participate in activities with peers. While she maintains good academic performance, her eccentric beliefs and social withdrawal are characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder. Now, let’s review the other options: A. Avoidant personality disorder: Avoidant personality disorder involves feelings of inadequacy, social inhibition, and hypersensitivity to criticism. While individuals with avoidant personality disorder avoid social interactions due to fear of rejection, this woman’s behavior is more aligned with eccentricity and magical thinking, not a pervasive fear of criticism. She avoids social engagement, but it is not due to feelings of inferiority or fear of judgment. B. Dependent personality disorder: Dependent personality disorder is characterized by an excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive behaviors and difficulty making decisions without reassurance. This woman does not exhibit dependence on others or a lack of autonomy. Instead, she prefers solitude and holds unusual beliefs, which aligns more with schizotypal personality disorder. C. Schizoid personality disorder: Schizoid personality disorder involves a pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression. While this woman avoids social interactions and is solitary, her beliefs in supernatural powers and eccentric behavior (such as her obsession with witchcraft) are more indicative of schizotypal personality disorder, which also includes odd beliefs and perceptions, whereas schizoid personality disorder is marked by a lack of interest in social relationships altogether.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Observe the patient for 2 hours after giving meal. In cases of anorexia nervosa, where the patient is on a treatment plan but still not gaining weight, the issue may be related to food restriction behaviors, purging, or compulsive exercise that might not be immediately apparent. To ensure that the food is being consumed and not being purged (vomiting or laxative use), it is critical to observe the patient for a period after meals. This helps to identify any hidden behaviors such as vomiting, which may be contributing to the lack of weight gain despite adequate caloric intake. Monitoring after meals is a standard step in the management of anorexia nervosa. Now, let’s review the other options: A. Increase fluid intake: Increasing fluid intake is not directly related to the lack of weight gain in this scenario. While hydration is important, the issue here is more likely related to eating behaviors or underlying psychiatric factors that affect food intake, rather than a simple issue of dehydration. C. Increase the dose of anxiolytics: While anxiolytics might be helpful in addressing underlying anxiety or obsessive-compulsive behaviors in anorexia nervosa, they are not the first-line intervention for the failure to gain weight. The focus should be on addressing the eating behaviors and ensuring that the food is being properly ingested and absorbed. D. Increase the caloric intake from 1500 kcal to 2000 kcal per day: Increasing caloric intake is important in treating anorexia nervosa, but in this case, the lack of weight gain is likely due to issues related to the patient's food consumption behaviors, not the caloric amount. If the patient is not consuming the food as intended, simply increasing the caloric intake will not address the core issue. Therefore, the immediate next step should be to ensure that the patient is eating the food provided, which is best achieved by observing the patient after meals.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) According to DSM-5, Weight less than 85 percent of expected and BMI < 17.5 are a part of diagnostic criteria. This statement is not true. According to the DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa, there is no specific cutoff for weight loss in terms of percentage of expected weight or BMI. Instead, the criteria emphasize that the individual has an intense fear of gaining weight or a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, and that their body weight is significantly lower than what is expected (generally defined as a BMI of less than 18.5). A BMI less than 17.5 is often used in clinical practice, but it is not an explicit part of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5. Now, let’s review the other options: A. Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality amongst all mental disorders: This is true. Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate among mental health disorders, with the risk of death being higher than many other psychiatric conditions. This is primarily due to complications like malnutrition, organ failure, and suicide. C. According to DSM-5, diagnosis is clinical and severity is based on BMI values: This is true. The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is primarily clinical, based on the patient's history, behavior, and symptoms. The severity of the condition is often assessed using BMI values (for example, mild, moderate, and severe anorexia are classified based on BMI thresholds), which can help guide treatment. D. Patient may or may not verbally tell about self-perception of being fat: This is true. Individuals with anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image and may or may not explicitly acknowledge this perception. Some patients may deny or minimize their concerns about body image, while others may openly express them. Regardless, the distorted perception of weight or shape is a central feature of the disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Impulsivity that is antisocial. This statement is not true for borderline personality disorder (BPD). While impulsivity is a hallmark feature of BPD, it is typically manifested in behaviors such as reckless driving, binge eating, substance abuse, unsafe sex, or self-harm. This impulsivity is often driven by emotional instability and an attempt to cope with intense feelings. Antisocial impulsivity, on the other hand, refers to behaviors that involve a disregard for the rights of others, persistent deceitfulness, manipulation, or criminal activity, which are characteristic of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), not BPD. Explanation of the Correct Answer: Impulsivity in BPD is emotionally driven, stemming from difficulties with emotional regulation. It’s not inherently manipulative or criminal, which differentiates it from antisocial impulsivity seen in ASPD. Hence, D is the correct answer as it does not belong to the symptom profile of BPD. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: A. Chronic feelings of emptiness: This is true for BPD. Individuals with BPD frequently experience persistent feelings of emptiness or boredom, which can contribute to impulsive behaviors as they seek to fill this emotional void. B. Disturbances in and uncertainty about self-image: This is also true for BPD. People with BPD often have an unstable self-image or sense of self. They may frequently change their goals, values, career plans, or even sexual identity, reflecting deep-rooted insecurity. C. Excessive efforts to avoid abandonment: This is true and one of the core features of BPD. Individuals with BPD may go to extreme lengths to avoid real or perceived abandonment, including emotional outbursts, clinging behaviors, or self-harm threats. This fear of abandonment can occur even in situations where there is no actual threat of being left.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Later age of onset. Explanation of the Correct Answer: A later age of onset in anorexia nervosa is considered a poor prognostic factor. Typically, anorexia nervosa begins during adolescence, and when it occurs in this age group, patients are often more responsive to treatment, especially when early intervention is provided, and family support is strong. However, when anorexia nervosa starts in adulthood or later in adolescence, the disorder tends to have a more chronic course, with greater resistance to treatment, more entrenched maladaptive behaviors, and a higher likelihood of co-occurring psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety). This delayed onset often reflects more rigid personality traits and established cognitive distortions, which are harder to modify, thereby contributing to a poorer prognosis. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: B. Family history of anorexia nervosa: While a family history of anorexia nervosa indicates a genetic predisposition to the disorder, it does not necessarily predict a poor prognosis. It may suggest a higher risk of developing the condition but does not directly correlate with treatment outcomes. In fact, awareness within the family might even lead to earlier detection and intervention. C. Female gender: Female gender is associated with a higher prevalence of anorexia nervosa, but it is not a poor prognostic factor. In fact, females tend to have better treatment outcomes compared to males, possibly due to earlier diagnosis, better social support, and greater likelihood of seeking help. Conversely, males with anorexia often have worse outcomes due to delayed recognition and social stigma. D. Family history of bulimia nervosa: A family history of bulimia nervosa may indicate a familial vulnerability to eating disorders in general, but it is not a specific poor prognostic factor for anorexia nervosa. While both disorders share some genetic and environmental risk factors, the prognosis of anorexia is influenced more by the severity of the illness, age of onset, chronicity, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions rather than the presence of bulimia in family members.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Borderline personality disorder. Explanation of the Correct Answer: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) does not belong to Cluster C; instead, it is part of Cluster B personality disorders. Cluster B disorders are characterized by dramatic, emotional, and erratic behaviors. Individuals with BPD often exhibit intense emotional instability, fear of abandonment, impulsivity, unstable relationships, and self-destructive behaviors. The hallmark features include mood swings, identity disturbances, and chronic feelings of emptiness. Since option B incorrectly places BPD in Cluster C, this statement is false, making it the correct answer to the question. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: A. Cluster B: Antisocial personality disorder: This statement is true. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) belongs to Cluster B. It is characterized by a disregard for the rights of others, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, aggression, and lack of remorse for harmful actions. ASPD is common in individuals with criminal behaviors and is often associated with manipulative and exploitative tendencies. C. Cluster C: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD): This statement is true. OCPD falls under Cluster C, which includes disorders marked by anxious and fearful behaviors. OCPD is characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, control, and adherence to rules, often at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. This differs from OCD, as OCPD does not involve true obsessions or compulsions. D. Cluster B: Histrionic personality disorder: This statement is true. Histrionic personality disorder is part of Cluster B. It is characterized by excessive emotionality, attention-seeking behaviors, a strong desire for approval, and inappropriate seductive behaviors. Individuals often display dramatic expressions of emotion and are uncomfortable when not the center of attention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Significantly lesser weight for height. Explanation of the Correct Answer: Significantly lesser weight for height is a key differentiating feature between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Individuals with anorexia nervosa typically have a markedly low body weight (significantly below the normal range for age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health) due to extreme caloric restriction, excessive exercise, or other weight-loss behaviors. This low weight is a defining criterion in the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. In contrast, bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. However, individuals with bulimia nervosa usually maintain a normal or near-normal body weight. Therefore, the presence of significantly low weight helps distinguish anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa, making option A the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: B. Binge eating: This is incorrect because binge eating can occur in both anorexia nervosa (specifically the binge-eating/purging subtype) and bulimia nervosa. While binge eating is a hallmark of bulimia, it is not exclusive to it, thus not a definitive differentiator. C. Fear of becoming fat: This is incorrect because an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat is common to both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Both disorders involve body image disturbances and a preoccupation with weight and shape, so this symptom does not help differentiate between the two conditions. D. Purging episodes: This is incorrect because purging behaviors (such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, or diuretics) are seen in both bulimia nervosa and the binge-eating/purging subtype of anorexia nervosa. Therefore, the presence of purging alone does not clearly distinguish one disorder from the other.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anorexia nervosa. Explanation of the Correct Answer: The most appropriate diagnosis for this young woman is anorexia nervosa, specifically the binge-eating/purging subtype. This subtype is characterized by episodes of binge eating and purging behaviors (such as self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives), which she exhibits frequently (5-10 times a week). Despite these behaviors, the defining feature that distinguishes anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa is her abnormally low body weight. Other key features supporting this diagnosis include: Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. A distorted body image, where she perceives herself as fat despite being underweight. Amenorrhea, which is commonly associated with anorexia nervosa due to hormonal disruptions from severe caloric restriction. These features collectively meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa according to the DSM-5. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: B. Bulimia nervosa: This is incorrect because although the patient shows classic bulimic behaviors (binge eating and purging), individuals with bulimia nervosa typically have a normal or near-normal body weight. The presence of abnormally low body weight in this patient suggests anorexia nervosa instead. Bulimia nervosa also does not typically lead to amenorrhea. C. Endogenous depression: This is incorrect because while depression can cause appetite changes, weight loss, and amenorrhea, it does not explain the patient’s intense fear of gaining weight, distorted body image, or binge-purge cycles. These are hallmark features of an eating disorder, not depression. D. Schizophrenia: This is incorrect because schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms. The patient’s symptoms are more related to body image disturbance and eating behaviors, with no evidence of psychosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bulimia nervosa. Explanation of the Correct Answer: The young lady’s history of repeated episodes of overeating (binge eating) followed by purging behaviors (using laxatives) is characteristic of bulimia nervosa. This eating disorder is defined by: Recurrent episodes of binge eating: Consuming large amounts of food in a short period with a sense of loss of control. Compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain: This includes purging methods like self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, fasting, or excessive exercise. Preoccupation with body image: Individuals often have an intense concern about their body shape and weight, although their body weight typically remains within the normal range. Bulimia nervosa differs from anorexia nervosa because patients are usually of normal weight or slightly overweight, and the primary issue revolves around the binge-purge cycle rather than severe caloric restriction leading to extreme weight loss. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: B. Schizophrenia: This is incorrect because schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms (such as flat affect and social withdrawal). It does not involve disordered eating behaviors like bingeing and purging. C. Anorexia nervosa: This is incorrect because while purging behaviors can occur in the binge-eating/purging subtype of anorexia, the key differentiator is that individuals with anorexia nervosa have a significantly low body weight due to extreme caloric restriction. The question does not mention any marked weight loss or intense fear of weight gain, which are hallmark features of anorexia nervosa. D. Benign eating disorder: This is incorrect because there is no recognized diagnosis called \"benign eating disorder.\" The symptoms described are clinically significant, causing distress and functional impairment, which rules out any suggestion of a \"benign\" condition. The behavior clearly fits the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bulimia nervosa. Explanation of the Correct Answer: The medical student presents with key clinical features suggestive of bulimia nervosa, including: Normal body weight: Unlike anorexia nervosa, where patients typically have significantly low body weight, individuals with bulimia often maintain a normal or near-normal weight. Parotid gland swelling (parotid abscess): Chronic self-induced vomiting leads to recurrent stimulation of the parotid glands, causing parotid hypertrophy or swelling. Although an actual abscess is less common, the swelling might be misinterpreted as one. Dental caries: Repeated exposure of teeth to gastric acid from vomiting erodes the dental enamel, leading to dental caries and enamel erosion, particularly on the lingual surfaces of the teeth. Irritability when questioned about eating habits: Patients with bulimia often experience shame, guilt, and denial regarding their disordered eating behaviors. They may become defensive or irritated when confronted about these habits. These symptoms collectively point toward bulimia nervosa, characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (e.g., vomiting, misuse of laxatives) and an intense preoccupation with body image. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: A. Adjustment disorder: This is incorrect because adjustment disorder typically occurs in response to a specific stressor, leading to emotional or behavioral symptoms. It does not cause physical symptoms like parotid swelling or dental caries. Additionally, eating disturbances are not a hallmark of adjustment disorders. C. Anorexia nervosa: This is incorrect because anorexia nervosa is characterized by significantly low body weight due to severe caloric restriction and an intense fear of gaining weight. While the binge-eating/purging subtype of anorexia can involve purging behaviors, the patient in this case has a normal weight, which is more consistent with bulimia nervosa. D. Conversion reaction (Conversion disorder): This is incorrect because conversion disorder involves neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness, seizures) that are inconsistent with medical conditions and are often linked to psychological stress. It does not involve eating disorders or physical signs like dental caries or parotid swelling due to vomiting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Explanation of the Correct Answer: The patient’s presentation is most consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which is characterized by pervasive patterns of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions, along with marked impulsivity. Key features in this case include: Recurrent suicidal behavior or self-harm: The patient has a history of suicidal attempts, including the current wrist-cutting episode, often seen in BPD as a response to interpersonal stressors. Fear of abandonment and relationship instability: The recent breakup with her boyfriend triggered the crisis, suggesting an intense fear of abandonment, common in BPD. Unstable and intense interpersonal relationships: The patient's rude behavior toward the nurse and dramatic shift to sweet behavior with the handsome male doctor highlight the characteristic \"splitting\"—seeing people as all good or all bad and fluctuating rapidly between idealization and devaluation. Emotional lability and impulsivity: Rapid mood changes and impulsive actions (like self-harm) are core symptoms. These symptoms align closely with the diagnostic criteria for BPD in the DSM-5. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: A. Schizophrenia: This is incorrect because schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, avolition). The patient exhibits no signs of psychosis; her behavior is emotionally driven, not due to a loss of contact with reality. B. Schizoid Personality Disorder: This is incorrect because schizoid personality disorder involves detachment from social relationships, a preference for solitary activities, and emotional coldness. Individuals with this disorder are typically indifferent to praise or criticism and unlikely to form intense emotional attachments, unlike the patient’s dramatic interpersonal interactions. C. Histrionic Personality Disorder: While this might seem plausible due to her attention-seeking behavior toward the male doctor, this is incorrect because histrionic personality disorder primarily involves excessive emotionality and attention-seeking without the self-harm or suicidal behaviors typical of BPD. Additionally, histrionic individuals tend to display more superficial relationships without the intense fear of abandonment seen here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). Explanation of the Correct Answer: The patient's symptoms are characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), which is a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, often at the expense of flexibility, efficiency, and openness. Key features in this case include: Perfectionism: The patient is described as a perfectionist, staying late to check punctuation and spelling meticulously, which reflects an excessive concern with minor details. Preoccupation with order and control: Her extreme neatness and insistence on doing things in a specific, precise way are hallmark traits of OCPD. Rigidity and stubbornness: She believes that her colleagues do not take their work seriously, indicating a rigid mindset and a sense of moral superiority, common in individuals with OCPD. Workaholism: Her tendency to stay long after working hours, not due to external demands but because of her internal drive for perfection, aligns with the over-dedication to work typical of OCPD. Unlike Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), OCPD is ego-syntonic, meaning the behaviors are consistent with the person’s self-image and are not seen as problematic by the individual themselves. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: B. Paranoid Personality Disorder: This is incorrect because paranoid personality disorder involves pervasive distrust and suspicion of others, often interpreting their motives as malevolent. While the patient is critical of her colleagues, it’s due to perfectionistic standards rather than a suspicion of ill intent. C. Hysterical Personality Disorder (now referred to as Histrionic Personality Disorder): This is incorrect because histrionic personality disorder is marked by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behaviors, such as being dramatic, flirtatious, or overly concerned with appearance. The patient shows no signs of emotional excess or attention-seeking behavior. D. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): This is incorrect because BPD involves emotional instability, impulsivity, intense interpersonal conflicts, fear of abandonment, and self-harming behaviors, none of which are present in this case. The patient's issues revolve around control and perfectionism, not emotional dysregulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gender Identity Disorder (now referred to as Gender Dysphoria in the DSM-5). Explanation of the Correct Answer: The symptoms described are consistent with Gender Identity Disorder (GID), now termed Gender Dysphoria. This condition involves a persistent discomfort or distress with one’s assigned biological sex and a strong desire to be of the opposite gender. Key features in this case include: Persistent discomfort with assigned sex: The person feels that they are “imposed by a female body,” indicating a deep incongruence between their experienced gender and biological sex. Desire to be another gender: This individual’s persistent discomfort with their sex suggests they identify with a gender different from their assigned sex at birth. Not related to sexual orientation: While the question mentions the person is homosexual, it’s important to note that gender identity and sexual orientation are distinct concepts. Gender Dysphoria is about one's internal sense of gender, not who they are attracted to. A person of any sexual orientation can experience Gender Dysphoria. The distress experienced due to this incongruence is a defining feature of Gender Dysphoria. Treatment may involve psychological support, hormone therapy, and sometimes gender-affirming surgeries, depending on the individual’s needs. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: B. Transvestism (Transvestic Disorder): This is incorrect because transvestism involves recurrent, intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing in clothing typically associated with the opposite gender. It is a paraphilic disorder if it causes significant distress or impairment. In this case, the person’s distress is not related to cross-dressing for sexual arousal but to their core gender identity. C. Voyeurism (Voyeuristic Disorder): This is incorrect because voyeurism involves sexual arousal from observing unsuspecting individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaging in sexual activity. The person described here does not exhibit such behaviors. Their concerns are about their gender identity, not voyeuristic tendencies. D. Paraphilias: This is incorrect because paraphilias refer to a group of disorders characterized by intense, persistent sexual interests in objects, situations, or individuals that are atypical (e.g., fetishism, exhibitionism, voyeurism). The individual’s gender discomfort is not related to atypical sexual interests, making paraphilia an inappropriate diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Aversive therapy. Explanation of the Correct Answer: Aversive therapy involves pairing an aversive (noxious) stimulus with a pleasant stimulus to reduce undesirable behaviors. In the context of alcohol dependence or sexual disorders, this therapy pairs a pleasant stimulus (e.g., a pleasurable activity) with noxious stimuli (e.g., an unpleasant odor or mild electric shock). The goal is to make the pleasurable activity unpleasant, thus discouraging the associated behavior. This form of therapy is designed to create an aversive response to the behavior, such as drinking alcohol or engaging in unwanted sexual behaviors. A well-known example is disulfiram (Antabuse) therapy for alcohol dependence, where the individual experiences nausea and vomiting if they drink alcohol while on the medication. This is an example of aversive conditioning used to treat alcohol dependence. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: A. Negative reinforcement: This is incorrect because negative reinforcement involves removing an aversive stimulus to increase the likelihood of a desired behavior. In contrast, aversive therapy specifically involves adding a noxious stimulus to decrease an undesirable behavior, which is the opposite of negative reinforcement. C. Punishment: This is incorrect because punishment typically refers to a consequence that decreases a behavior (such as a timeout or a fine). While punishment can involve aversive stimuli, it is a broader concept that doesn’t necessarily involve pairing a pleasurable stimulus with an aversive one, as in aversive therapy. The focus of punishment is typically to stop an unwanted behavior, while aversive therapy aims to condition an individual to associate the behavior with discomfort. D. Flooding: This is incorrect because flooding involves exposing an individual to an intense, overwhelming stimulus (such as the feared object or situation) in order to reduce anxiety or fear responses over time. It’s used more in the treatment of phobias, and doesn’t involve the pairing of a pleasurable stimulus with a noxious one as in aversive therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Narcolepsy. Explanation of the Correct Answer: Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of sleep attacks, which can occur at any time, even during activities such as laughing. A common symptom of narcolepsy is cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions like laughter. This can cause the person to collapse or drop to the floor, as described in the scenario. The man’s sudden collapse during laughter suggests he may be experiencing cataplexy, a hallmark feature of narcolepsy. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: A. Catalepsy: This is incorrect because catalepsy refers to a condition characterized by muscle rigidity, immobility, and waxy flexibility, typically seen in certain neurological conditions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease). The sudden collapse associated with laughing is more characteristic of cataplexy in narcolepsy, not catalepsy. C. Hysteria: This is incorrect because hysteria (now often referred to as conversion disorder) involves physical symptoms (such as paralysis, blindness, or seizures) that are psychological in origin, often linked to trauma or stress. It does not typically include the sudden collapse triggered by laughter seen in narcolepsy. D. Histrionic personality: This is incorrect because histrionic personality disorder involves a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior, but it does not typically cause physical symptoms like cataplexy triggered by laughter. People with histrionic personality disorder may exaggerate emotions to gain attention, but they do not exhibit sudden muscle weakness or collapse as seen in narcolepsy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Paralysis with Sleep-Awake Junction Hallucinations The 30-year-old gentleman presents with excessive daytime sleepiness and a history of sudden falls, particularly during emotional situations like partying with friends. These features strongly suggest narcolepsy with cataplexy. Narcolepsy is a neurological sleep disorder characterized by a tetrad of symptoms: Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) – persistent sleepiness regardless of adequate nighttime sleep. Cataplexy – sudden, brief episodes of muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions like laughter, excitement, or surprise. Sleep Paralysis – transient inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking, despite being conscious. Hypnagogic or Hypnopompic Hallucinations – vivid, often frightening visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations occurring at the transition between sleep and wakefulness. In this case, the patient's symptoms align with narcolepsy, making paralysis with sleep-wake junction hallucinations (i.e., sleep paralysis and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations) the correct answer, as these are hallmark features of narcolepsy. Incorrect Options: A. Restlessness of the Legs Before Going to Bed: This symptom is characteristic of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), a condition marked by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms worsen during periods of rest and improve with movement. Unlike narcolepsy, RLS does not cause cataplexy, sudden falls, or excessive daytime sleepiness due to sleep attacks. B. Snoring with Witnessed Sleep Apnea: This is a classic presentation of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which involves repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to snoring, gasping, and fragmented sleep. While OSA can cause daytime sleepiness, it does not cause cataplexy, sudden falls triggered by emotions, or sleep paralysis, distinguishing it from narcolepsy. C. Generalized Seizure While Awake: Generalized seizures involve sudden, uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, leading to loss of consciousness, convulsions, and postictal confusion. The patient’s episodes are emotion-triggered, brief, and without postictal confusion, suggesting cataplexy rather than seizures. Additionally, seizures are not typically associated with sleep paralysis or hypnagogic hallucinations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Borderline Personality Disorder The woman’s presentation is highly suggestive of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), a Cluster B personality disorder characterized by pervasive patterns of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, emotions, and marked impulsivity. Key features of BPD evident in this case include: Emotional Instability: Periodic anxiety and depression reflect mood dysregulation, a hallmark of BPD. Impulsivity: Engaging in self-defeating behaviors, sexual promiscuity, and impulsive actions are common in BPD. Self-Harm and Suicidal Gestures: Recurrent suicidal behaviors, gestures, or threats are typical coping mechanisms in response to emotional distress. Chronic Feelings of Emptiness: Describing herself as both “desperate and bored” reflects a chronic sense of emptiness, often reported by individuals with BPD. Unstable Relationships: Though not explicitly mentioned, individuals with BPD often have intense and unstable interpersonal relationships, alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation (splitting). BPD often emerges in early adulthood, with symptoms persisting over time, as seen in her 5–6-year history. Incorrect Options: A. Narcissistic Personality Disorder: This disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy. While individuals may display emotional instability when their self-esteem is threatened, they typically do not exhibit chronic suicidal behaviors, impulsivity, or feelings of emptiness. The patient's desperation and self-destructive tendencies are not consistent with narcissistic traits. B. Histrionic Personality Disorder: Histrionic Personality Disorder involves excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior. Individuals may be sexually provocative and display shallow, rapidly shifting emotions. However, they do not typically engage in suicidal gestures, chronic self-harm, or experience significant identity disturbances as seen in BPD. C. Antisocial Personality Disorder: Antisocial Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others, including deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, aggression, and lack of remorse. While impulsivity is common to both disorders, antisocial individuals do not typically struggle with mood instability, intense fear of abandonment, or suicidal gestures, which are core features of BPD.",

She was convinced that her neighbours were plotting against her life for a brief time after she was mugged and thrown onto the pavement by a teenager, but now thinks that this is not the case. She believes in the “power of crystals to protect me” and has them strewn haphazardly throughout her house. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Schizotypal Personality Disorder The woman’s presentation is characteristic of Schizotypal Personality Disorder (STPD), a Cluster A personality disorder marked by pervasive patterns of social and interpersonal deficits, along with cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentric behaviors. Key features evident in this case include: Eccentric Behavior and Appearance: Wearing odd, out-of-fashion clothes and living in an unkempt environment reflects her eccentricity. Magical Thinking: A strong belief in the protective power of crystals indicates magical thinking, which is common in STPD. Paranoid Ideation: Being suspicious of her neighbors and previously believing they were plotting against her (even though transient) suggests paranoid thinking. Social Isolation: Despite her family's efforts, she remains isolated, a common feature in individuals with STPD due to discomfort in close relationships. Odd Thinking and Perceptions: Her unusual cognitive patterns are seen in her superstitious beliefs and suspiciousness, but without full-blown psychosis. While her paranoia after being mugged was transient and has resolved, individuals with STPD often experience such brief psychotic episodes, especially under stress, differentiating it from more severe psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Incorrect Options: A. Schizoid Personality Disorder: Schizoid Personality Disorder involves detachment from social relationships and a limited range of emotional expression. Individuals prefer solitary activities, show emotional coldness, and lack interest in forming close relationships. However, they do not typically exhibit paranoid ideation, magical thinking, or eccentric behaviors, which are prominent in this case. B. Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type: Paranoid schizophrenia (now referred to as schizophrenia with prominent delusions or hallucinations) requires persistent psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations lasting for at least 6 months. This woman’s paranoia was brief and stress-related (after the mugging) and has resolved, and there’s no evidence of sustained psychosis, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or negative symptoms, ruling out schizophrenia. D. Avoidant Personality Disorder: Avoidant Personality Disorder is characterized by social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. While individuals with this disorder avoid social interactions, their behavior is driven by fear of rejection rather than eccentricity, paranoia, or magical thinking, which are key features in this woman’s presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep The patient's EEG findings and clinical features strongly indicate that he was in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep when awakened. REM sleep is characterized by: EEG Pattern: Low-voltage, mixed-frequency activity with sawtooth waves, which are distinctive triangular waveforms seen during REM sleep. Dream Recall: Individuals awakened from REM sleep often vividly recall dreams, as this is the stage where most dreaming occurs. Sleep Cycle Timing: REM sleep typically occurs about 90 minutes after sleep onset, fitting the timeline in this case. Physiological Features: Despite an active EEG resembling wakefulness, the body experiences muscle atonia (paralysis), preventing physical movement during dreams, along with rapid eye movements and fluctuating heart rate and breathing. These hallmark features confirm that the patient was in REM sleep when he was awakened. Incorrect Options: A. NREM 2: NREM Stage 2 is characterized by sleep spindles (short bursts of high-frequency activity) and K-complexes (large, slow waves followed by a faster burst). While this stage is part of light sleep, it lacks sawtooth waves and vivid dream recall. Dreaming is less common and not as vivid as in REM sleep. B. NREM 3: NREM Stage 3, also known as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep, is dominated by delta waves—high-amplitude, low-frequency waves. This stage is crucial for restorative processes. Dreaming is rare, and individuals awakened from this stage are often confused or groggy, unlike the vivid dream recall reported here. C. NREM 4: NREM Stage 4 is no longer a distinct classification in modern sleep staging (it was combined with Stage 3 as part of slow-wave sleep in recent sleep studies). Like Stage 3, it features delta waves and lacks the rapid, low-voltage EEG activity or vivid dreams seen in REM sleep.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mood Fluctuations Mood fluctuations are not a characteristic feature of Type A personality. Type A personality is primarily defined by behavioral traits related to stress, competitiveness, and a sense of urgency rather than mood instability. Mood fluctuations, such as rapid changes in emotional states, are more commonly associated with mood disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder) or certain personality disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder). Type A individuals may experience stress or frustration, but their mood does not fluctuate unpredictably. Their emotional responses are typically linked to external stressors rather than intrinsic mood instability. Incorrect Options: A. Hostile: Hostility is a key component of Type A personality, often manifesting as anger, irritability, and a tendency to respond aggressively to stress or frustration. Hostility has been strongly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, particularly due to its effects on stress response and physiological arousal. B. Time Pressure: A defining trait of Type A personality is a constant sense of time urgency. Individuals with this personality type often feel pressured to complete tasks quickly, are impatient with delays, and have a persistent need to manage time efficiently. This urgency contributes to their heightened stress levels. C. Competitiveness: Competitiveness is another hallmark feature of Type A personality. These individuals are highly driven to succeed, often setting ambitious goals and striving to outperform others. Their competitive nature fuels both personal and professional achievements but can also contribute to chronic stress.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep Ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) spikes are distinctive electrical waveforms that occur during REM sleep. They originate in the pons, propagate to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and finally reach the occipital cortex—hence the name. PGO spikes are strongly associated with the initiation of REM sleep and are believed to play a key role in visual imagery during dreams. They are closely linked to rapid eye movements, which are characteristic of this sleep stage. Additionally, REM sleep is known for vivid dreaming, low-amplitude mixed-frequency EEG activity, sawtooth waves, and muscle atonia, with PGO spikes serving as a neurophysiological marker of this stage. Incorrect Options: A. Stage 1 NREM: Stage 1 NREM is the lightest stage of sleep, marked by theta waves on EEG. It serves as a transitional phase from wakefulness to sleep. PGO spikes are not seen in this stage, as it lacks the complex neural activity associated with REM sleep. B. Stage 2 NREM: Stage 2 NREM sleep is characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes, which are distinct from PGO spikes. This stage represents a deeper phase of light sleep but does not involve the rapid eye movements or vivid dreaming that are linked to PGO activity. C. Stage 3 NREM (Slow-Wave Sleep): Stage 3 NREM, also known as slow-wave sleep or deep sleep, is dominated by delta waves. This stage is associated with physical restoration, memory consolidation, and reduced brain activity. PGO spikes are absent in this stage, as it lacks the high cortical activation typical of REM sleep.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) An Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be helpful in the evaluation of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), especially when there's a need to rule out neurological conditions that might mimic or contribute to aggressive outbursts. While IED is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, impulsive episodes of aggressive behavior, it’s important to differentiate it from conditions like epilepsy (especially temporal lobe epilepsy), which can present with similar sudden behavioral changes or aggression. EEG can help detect abnormal brain activity, such as epileptiform discharges, which may indicate a seizure disorder rather than a primary psychiatric condition. Hence, while EEG is not diagnostic for IED itself, it is useful in the differential diagnosis when aggression might have an underlying neurological cause. Incorrect Options: B. Panic Disorder: Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks with intense fear and physical symptoms (e.g., palpitations, sweating, chest pain). It is primarily diagnosed through clinical history and psychological assessment. EEG is not useful in diagnosing panic disorder because it does not show specific brain activity patterns associated with this condition. C. Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar disorder involves mood disturbances with episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation of mood symptoms, behavior, and history. EEG has no diagnostic role in bipolar disorder, as it does not detect mood-related brain activity changes. However, EEG might be used if there’s suspicion of comorbid neurological issues, like seizure disorders, but not for bipolar disorder itself. D. Social Phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder): Social phobia is characterized by intense fear of social situations due to concerns about being judged or embarrassed. Like other anxiety disorders, it is diagnosed based on clinical criteria without the need for EEG. EEG does not provide any specific information for diagnosing social anxiety disorder, as there are no characteristic EEG changes in this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Diffuse Slowing of Background Rhythm The most common EEG abnormality is diffuse slowing of the background rhythm, which reflects generalized cerebral dysfunction. This abnormality is characterized by a reduction in the frequency of the normal background EEG activity, often shifting from the typical alpha rhythm (8–13 Hz) to theta (4–7 Hz) or delta (<4 Hz) frequencies. Diffuse slowing is nonspecific and can occur in a wide range of conditions, including: Metabolic encephalopathies (e.g., hepatic or uremic encephalopathy) Toxic states (due to drug overdose or poisoning) Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury Degenerative neurological disorders Delirium Since many medical and neurological conditions can affect brain function globally, diffuse slowing is frequently observed in clinical practice, making it the most common EEG abnormality. Incorrect Options: B. Focal Slowing of Background Rhythm: Focal slowing indicates localized brain dysfunction, often seen in conditions like stroke, tumors, traumatic brain injury, or localized infections (e.g., abscess). While important diagnostically, it is less common than diffuse slowing because focal brain insults are less frequent than global encephalopathic conditions in EEG studies. C. Epileptiform Discharges: Epileptiform discharges (e.g., spikes, sharp waves, spike-and-wave complexes) are specific markers of epilepsy. Although they are critical for diagnosing seizure disorders, they are not as common overall as diffuse slowing, especially considering the broad range of non-epileptic conditions where EEG is used. D. Generalized Periodic Sharp Waves: Generalized periodic sharp waves are rare EEG patterns often associated with severe neurological conditions, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). This is a very specific but infrequent finding compared to diffuse slowing, which occurs across a wider spectrum of conditions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) NREM 2 In NREM Stage 2 sleep, the EEG shows distinctive patterns, including sleep spindles (short bursts of high-frequency oscillations, around 12–16 Hz) and K-complexes (large, slow waves followed by a faster burst). This stage represents light sleep and is characterized by a decrease in muscle activity, with the individual being harder to wake up than in Stage 1 but not yet in the deep sleep stages. The presence of sleep spindles and K-complexes is the hallmark of Stage 2 NREM, distinguishing it from the other stages. Incorrect Options: A. NREM 1: In NREM Stage 1, the EEG shows theta waves (4–7 Hz), which are slower than the alpha waves seen during wakefulness. This stage is the transition from wakefulness to sleep and typically lasts for a few minutes. It lacks the distinctive spindles and K-complexes seen in Stage 2. C. Deep Sleep: Deep sleep refers to NREM Stage 3 and 4 (slow-wave sleep), characterized by delta waves (0.5–4 Hz), which are much slower than the brain waves in Stage 2. It is the most restorative phase of sleep, and the EEG shows large, high-amplitude, slow waves. D. REM Sleep: In REM sleep, the EEG resembles wakefulness with low-voltage, mixed-frequency activity that is often similar to a fully awake state. The key feature of REM is the occurrence of rapid eye movements and vivid dreaming, which is not seen in Stage 2.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) NREM Stage The column 3 of the polysomnography (PSG) set corresponds to the NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) stage of sleep. NREM sleep is divided into three stages (1-3), with stages 2 and 3 showing slower brainwave activity compared to the wake stage and REM sleep. In this stage, the EEG typically shows theta waves (Stage 1), sleep spindles and K-complexes (Stage 2), and delta waves (Stage 3). The pattern in column 3 likely indicates a stage of NREM sleep where the brain is transitioning into deeper, restorative sleep. Incorrect Options: A. Awake Stage: The awake stage on PSG is characterized by alpha waves (8-13 Hz) when the person is relaxed but awake, often with occasional beta waves during mental activity. The EEG would show higher frequency, lower amplitude waves in this stage, which is distinct from the slower waves seen in NREM stages. B. REM Stage: During the REM sleep stage, the EEG shows a low-voltage mixed frequency pattern, resembling wakefulness. There is no significant sleep spindles or delta waves, and rapid eye movements are prominent. The pattern in column 3, if showing slower waves, would not correspond to REM sleep, which is much more active in terms of brainwave frequency. D. Drowsy Due to Medications: When an individual is drowsy due to medications, their EEG can show mixed patterns, but this would typically not be consistent with specific stages of sleep like NREM. Medication-induced drowsiness may lead to some abnormal or transient EEG changes, but these are not typically classified in the structured stages of sleep unless the person falls into actual sleep.",

It involves the use of magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain. The procedure typically targets areas like the prefrontal cortex and is primarily used for treatment-resistant depression. The treatment involves delivering repetitive magnetic pulses to modulate neuronal activity. It has been shown to help improve mood and cognitive function in patients with various psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Incorrect Options: B. VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation): VNS is a neurostimulation technique where a device is implanted under the skin, usually in the chest, and connected to the vagus nerve. Electrical impulses are sent to the brain via the vagus nerve, primarily used for treatment-resistant epilepsy and depression. It is different from rTMS, as it involves implantation and continuous stimulation rather than external magnetic pulses. C. DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation): DBS involves the implantation of electrodes into specific brain regions to treat various neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is invasive and involves surgical implantation, which makes it distinct from the non-invasive method of rTMS. D. ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy): ECT is a highly effective, but invasive treatment primarily used for severe depression and other psychiatric disorders. It involves the use of electric currents to induce a seizure in the brain, under controlled medical supervision.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anhedonia Anhedonia, which is the inability to experience pleasure from normally enjoyable activities, is not a criterion for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). While anhedonia is common in mood disorders, particularly depression, it is not listed as one of the diagnostic criteria for BPD. Instead, BPD is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, along with marked impulsivity and self-destructive behaviors, rather than a core symptom of anhedonia. Incorrect Options: A. Chronic Feelings of Emptiness: Chronic feelings of emptiness are a recognized diagnostic criterion for BPD. People with BPD often experience a pervasive sense of emptiness or boredom, which can contribute to their emotional instability and struggles with self-identity. This feeling is a common manifestation of the disorder. C. Recurrent Self-Mutilatory Behavior: Recurrent self-mutilatory behavior, such as cutting or burning oneself, is another important criterion for BPD. This impulsive and self-destructive behavior often occurs in response to emotional distress, and it plays a significant role in the diagnosis of BPD. It’s considered a coping mechanism for emotional pain and an attempt to gain control over intense feelings. D. Marked Impulsivity: Marked impulsivity is also a diagnostic feature of BPD. Impulsivity in areas such as spending, eating, risky sexual behavior, and substance abuse can cause significant harm and instability in the person's life. This impulsivity is a key characteristic that differentiates BPD from other personality disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Decreased Mental Alertness Sleep deprivation primarily leads to decreased mental alertness. Lack of adequate sleep impairs cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and decision-making. This makes it harder to focus, process information, and react quickly, which significantly affects performance in daily tasks. Studies show that sleep deprivation leads to both short-term and long-term impairments in attention and cognitive processing. Incorrect Options: A. Psychotic Behaviour: While severe and prolonged sleep deprivation can occasionally lead to symptoms resembling psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), these are rare and typically occur in extreme cases. Psychotic behavior is not a common result of typical sleep deprivation, and psychosis generally involves underlying psychiatric disorders or extreme conditions, not just lack of sleep. C. Emotional Disturbances: Although emotional disturbances such as irritability, mood swings, and increased stress can occur with sleep deprivation, they are typically not as prominent or defining as the decreased mental alertness. Emotional disturbances are more commonly a consequence of chronic sleep deprivation, which can lead to conditions like depression and anxiety in the long term, but the immediate impact is usually cognitive. D. Anxiety Neurosis: Sleep deprivation can exacerbate anxiety or contribute to anxiety symptoms, but it does not directly cause anxiety neurosis (which is now more commonly referred to as generalized anxiety disorder). Anxiety neurosis typically involves chronic, excessive worry and is not a direct result of sleep loss, though lack of sleep can worsen anxiety symptoms over time.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypersomnia Klein-Levin Syndrome (KLS) is primarily characterized by hypersomnia, a condition where the individual experiences excessive sleep for extended periods, often lasting for days or weeks. During these episodes, affected individuals may sleep up to 20 hours a day. In addition to hypersomnia, KLS can also involve changes in behavior and cognition, such as hyperphagia (excessive eating) and hypersexuality, but the hallmark symptom is the prolonged and recurrent episodes of excessive sleep. Incorrect Options: A. Insomnia: Insomnia refers to difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, which is the opposite of hypersomnia. Individuals with Klein-Levin syndrome do not experience insomnia; instead, they are characterized by an overwhelming need to sleep for prolonged periods. B. Anxiety: While anxiety can be a secondary symptom or may appear in some individuals due to the distress caused by other symptoms of KLS, it is not a primary feature of the disorder. The main symptom is excessive sleep, not anxiety. C. Depression: Depression can sometimes be associated with sleep disorders, but hypersomnia in KLS is not directly linked to clinical depression. Although mood disturbances can occur during episodes, depression is not the defining feature of Klein-Levin Syndrome, unlike the recurrent hypersomnia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Koro The disorder described in the question is Koro, a culture-bound syndrome predominantly found in some parts of Asia. Koro is characterized by a belief that the penis is retracting into the body and that this retraction will lead to death. This irrational fear is associated with intense anxiety and a sense of impending death, and the person often seeks help to prevent the perceived retraction. The condition is considered to be a form of somatic delusion and is often influenced by cultural beliefs and social pressures. Incorrect Options: A. Dhat Syndrome: Dhat syndrome is a psychological condition observed mainly in South Asia, where individuals believe that they are losing semen, typically during urination or after sexual activity, and that this loss causes physical weakness, fatigue, and anxiety. Unlike Koro, Dhat syndrome does not involve the belief of a bodily organ retracting and causing death. C. Latah: Latah is a cultural syndrome observed primarily in Southeast Asia, characterized by a startle reaction to unexpected stimuli, resulting in involuntary imitative behaviors, such as repeating words or actions of others. It is not related to the belief of genital retraction, which is central to Koro. D. Munchausen Syndrome: Munchausen syndrome is a factitious disorder where individuals deliberately feign or induce symptoms of illness to gain attention and sympathy. It does not involve delusions of genital retraction or the belief in imminent death as seen in Koro.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Loss of weight according to patient In anorexia nervosa, patients often underestimate or deny the severity of their weight loss and may not recognize how much weight they have lost. In contrast to option D, patients may perceive themselves as overweight even when they are severely underweight. The perception of body image is distorted, leading them to believe they are still too fat despite the extreme weight loss. Therefore, \"loss of weight according to patient\" is not true for anorexia nervosa, as their perception of their body is often inaccurate. Incorrect Options: A. Loss of 15% of body weight: A weight loss of at least 15% below the expected body weight is one of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. This significant weight loss often results from severe food restriction and an intense fear of gaining weight, which are core features of the disorder. B. Amenorrhea: Amenorrhea, or the absence of menstruation, is commonly observed in females with anorexia nervosa due to hormonal imbalances resulting from extreme weight loss and malnutrition. While it is not a required criterion for diagnosis (since some individuals may have anorexia without it), it is a common symptom. C. Over-consciousness about body structure: Individuals with anorexia nervosa are extremely preoccupied with their body shape and weight. They have an intense fear of gaining weight and may engage in restrictive eating behaviors or excessive exercise. This over-consciousness about their body structure is a hallmark feature of the disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Invariable weight loss with endocrine disorder Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise, or laxative abuse. However, weight loss is not an invariable feature of bulimia nervosa. Many individuals with bulimia may maintain a normal weight or may be overweight. While there can be endocrine changes due to the repeated cycles of binging and purging (such as irregular menstrual cycles), endocrine disorders and invariable weight loss are not characteristic or required for the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Incorrect Options: B. Occurrence of both binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors at least twice weekly on an average for 3 months: This statement is true. According to the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa, individuals must experience binge eating episodes and engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors (such as vomiting, misuse of laxatives, or excessive exercise) at least twice a week for a duration of three months for a diagnosis to be made. C. Recurrent episodes of binge eating: This is a core feature of bulimia nervosa. Recurrent binge eating episodes, characterized by the consumption of an excessive amount of food within a short period, coupled with a sense of lack of control, is central to the disorder. D. Recurrent self-induced vomiting: This is also true. Self-induced vomiting is one of the most common compensatory behaviors in bulimia nervosa. Individuals often use vomiting to prevent weight gain after binge eating episodes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Decreased appetite is a feature In anorexia nervosa, individuals do not typically experience decreased appetite. Instead, they have an intense fear of gaining weight, which leads to self-imposed starvation and extreme food restriction. The key feature of anorexia nervosa is voluntary food restriction rather than a loss of appetite. In fact, some individuals may experience an increased preoccupation with food and engage in ritualistic eating behaviors despite limiting their intake. Incorrect Options: A. Psychiatric symptoms such as depression may be associated: Psychiatric symptoms, including depression, are indeed commonly associated with anorexia nervosa. The stress of the disorder, as well as its impact on emotional well-being, can lead to mood disturbances such as depression, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation in some cases. Mental health comorbidities are common in individuals with anorexia nervosa. B. Excessive exercising can be a feature: Excessive exercising is often a feature of anorexia nervosa, as individuals may engage in rigorous physical activity to burn calories or prevent weight gain. This behavior is part of the compensatory actions to avoid gaining weight and can be a dangerous cycle that exacerbates malnutrition and physical harm. C. Weight loss is a feature: Weight loss is indeed a key feature of anorexia nervosa. Individuals with anorexia nervosa intentionally restrict their food intake, leading to significant weight loss, often below what is considered normal for their age and height. This weight loss is driven by their fear of gaining weight and their distorted body image.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Occurs in NREM sleep Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) refers to the spontaneous erections that occur during sleep, particularly during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, not NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. During REM sleep, erections are common and are often associated with dreaming. This is a normal physiological process and is unrelated to sexual arousal. The occurrence of NPT in NREM sleep is therefore incorrect. Incorrect Options: A. Totals about 100 min/night: This is true. During a typical night’s sleep, nocturnal penile tumescence can total about 100 minutes, with several episodes occurring throughout the night, typically lasting around 25-30 minutes each. These episodes happen intermittently during REM sleep. B. Normal phenomenon: This is true. Nocturnal penile tumescence is a normal physiological phenomenon in healthy men and is unrelated to sexual activity or arousal. It serves as an indication of healthy erectile function and is often used as a diagnostic tool for differentiating between psychological and organic causes of erectile dysfunction. D. Can be used to distinguish between psychological or organic impotence: This is true. The presence of nocturnal penile tumescence typically suggests that the erectile dysfunction may be psychological in nature, as organic impotence (e.g., due to vascular or neurological issues) usually does not involve NPT. The absence of NPT can indicate an organic cause of erectile dysfunction, while its presence points to a psychological cause.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Children Somnambulism, commonly known as sleepwalking, is most frequently observed in children. It typically occurs during NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, especially in the deeper stages of sleep. Although it can also be seen in adolescents and adults, it is much more common in childhood, often occurring between the ages of 4 to 8 years old. As children grow, the frequency of somnambulism generally decreases, and it may resolve on its own as they approach adolescence. Incorrect Options: B. Adolescents: While somnambulism can also occur in adolescents, it is less common compared to childhood. Adolescents may experience sleepwalking, but the frequency and occurrence are much lower than in children. In some cases, sleepwalking in adolescence may be associated with factors like stress, sleep deprivation, or other sleep disorders, but it is not as prevalent as in childhood. C. Adults: Somnambulism is less frequent in adults, and when it does occur, it is typically associated with sleep disorders, medications, or significant stress. The vast majority of individuals who experience sleepwalking in adulthood often have a history of it during childhood, but it tends to decrease or resolve as they age. D. All age groups: While somnambulism can technically affect people of all age groups, it is most commonly seen in children. Therefore, the option \"all age groups\" is not the best answer in terms of frequency, as children are the most affected demographic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyposexually In Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS), patients experience episodes of hypersomnia lasting days to weeks, but hyposexuality is not typically a hallmark feature of the disorder. In fact, increased sexual drive (often referred to as hypersexuality) can actually occur during episodes of KLS, which is contrary to the idea of hyposexuality. Therefore, hyposexuality is not associated with this syndrome. Incorrect Options: A. Hypersomnia: This is true. One of the defining features of Kleine-Levin syndrome is hypersomnia (excessive sleep), where patients experience episodes of prolonged sleep for up to 20 hours per day. These episodes of excessive sleep may last for several days to weeks and alternate with periods of normal functioning. C. Spontaneous resolution: This is true. Kleine-Levin syndrome often resolves spontaneously with time. Most individuals experience recurrences of the disorder during their lifetime, but the episodes typically become less frequent and eventually stop occurring. The spontaneous resolution of symptoms is a characteristic feature of this disorder. D. Also called sleeping beauty syndrome: This is true. Kleine-Levin syndrome is sometimes referred to as the \"sleeping beauty syndrome\" due to the resemblance to the fairy tale, where the affected individual falls into prolonged episodes of sleep.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Methohexital The anesthetic agent commonly used in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is methohexital. Methohexital is a barbiturate with a rapid onset and short duration of action, which is ideal for ECT procedures, as it allows for quick sedation and short-term anesthesia. This helps minimize the patient’s discomfort and the risks associated with the seizure induction during the procedure. Incorrect Options: A. Ketamine: Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that can be used in certain medical situations, including as an anesthetic agent for procedures involving pain, but it is not typically used in ECT. It may cause psychotomimetic effects (such as hallucinations), which are not desirable in ECT. Ketamine is more commonly used in settings where pain management and maintaining airway reflexes are key. B. Thiopentone: Thiopentone is a barbiturate with a slightly longer duration of action compared to methohexital. While thiopentone has been used in ECT, it is less commonly used today because of its longer recovery time compared to methohexital, making it less ideal for ECT procedures, where rapid recovery is desirable. C. Propofol: Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent commonly used in general anesthesia due to its rapid onset and short duration of action. While propofol can be used for ECT, it is generally not the first choice due to the potential for hypotension and respiratory depression. Methohexital remains the preferred choice because of its favorable pharmacokinetics for ECT.",
