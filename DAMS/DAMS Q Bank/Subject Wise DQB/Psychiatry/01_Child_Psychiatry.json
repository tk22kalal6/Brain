      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Making friends. This 7-year-old boy exhibits behavior that is highly suggestive of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly given his lack of social interest (e.g., not wanting to be held, difficulty with eye contact), rigid routines (e.g., distress when routines are changed), and focused, repetitive interests (e.g., obsession with car license plates). One of the hallmark features of ASD is social communication deficits, which often lead to difficulty forming and maintaining friendships. As the child grows into adolescence, his challenges with social reciprocity, interpreting social cues, and engaging in typical peer interactions will likely make friendship-building the most difficult area for him. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Paying attention in school – Incorrect While children with ASD may have challenges with attention due to difficulties in shifting focus or engaging in tasks of interest, the problem described here is more social in nature rather than related to general attention in academic settings. Additionally, the boy’s ability to speak in complete sentences and have a good vocabulary suggests he might have adequate cognitive functioning to manage attention tasks. (B) Concentrating on relevant stimuli – Incorrect Children with ASD often have trouble with sensory processing and can become fixated on specific stimuli (as seen with the boy's interest in license plates). However, the primary issue described here is social interaction difficulties, not a general problem with focusing on stimuli. Therefore, while concentration issues may arise, they are not the most pressing concern in this case. (C) Caring for pets – Incorrect Although children with ASD may struggle with empathy or reciprocal care in relationships (including with pets), there is no direct indication from the scenario that this boy has difficulties with caring for pets. The focus in this case is on his social difficulties and behavioral rigidity, rather than his ability to care for others or animals.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) X. The symptoms described in the scenario are most consistent with Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females. Rett syndrome typically presents with normal early development followed by a period of regression, often between 6 to 18 months of age. This regression includes a loss of purposeful hand movements, social withdrawal, loss of speech, and the development of stereotypical hand movements such as hand wringing. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene located on the X chromosome, which is why the most likely chromosome involved in this disorder is the X chromosome. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) 21 – Incorrect Chromosome 21 is associated with Down syndrome, a condition caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, physical growth delays, and certain characteristic facial features. While developmental delays are a feature of Down syndrome, the specific symptoms described in this question (social withdrawal, cessation of speech, and hand wringing) are not typical of Down syndrome. (B) 16 – Incorrect Chromosome 16 is associated with various genetic disorders, but it is not the chromosome involved in Rett syndrome. Some disorders related to chromosome 16 may include various types of epileptic syndromes and autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, but Rett syndrome is not linked to this chromosome. (C) 18 – Incorrect Chromosome 18 is associated with conditions like Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), which causes severe developmental and physical abnormalities, often leading to death in infancy or early childhood. While these children may exhibit developmental delays, the specific regression of speech and hand movements described in Rett syndrome is not characteristic of Edwards syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited type. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition that can occur in young children who have experienced extreme neglect or a lack of stable attachment figures, such as children who have been in foster care or orphanages. RAD can present in two types: Inhibited type: Children are emotionally withdrawn and do not seek comfort or show an interest in social interactions. Disinhibited type: Children display indiscriminate friendliness, being overly affectionate and engaging with strangers in an inappropriate or overly familiar manner. The behavior described in this case — the child being overly friendly and affectionate with strangers, seeking out physical closeness with them — is characteristic of disinhibited RAD. This behavior reflects a lack of appropriate attachment to caregivers and the absence of selective bonding, which are hallmark features of the disorder. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Autism – Incorrect While children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may exhibit difficulties with social interaction and communication, the behavior described (excessive friendliness and affection toward strangers) is not characteristic of autism. In fact, children with ASD may show social withdrawal or difficulty with social cues, which is different from the indiscriminate friendliness seen in RAD (disinhibited type). Additionally, autism typically involves restricted or repetitive behaviors, which are not described in this case. (B) Rett’s disorder – Incorrect Rett’s disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that typically affects females and is characterized by a period of normal development followed by a regression in motor and social skills. Symptoms include loss of purposeful hand movements, impaired speech, and stereotyped hand wringing. This diagnosis does not align with the description of the child’s behavior in this case, which is more focused on social interactions with strangers rather than the developmental regression typical of Rett’s disorder. (C) Reactive attachment disorder, inhibited type – Incorrect In the inhibited type of RAD, children tend to be withdrawn and do not seek comfort or respond to social interactions. They may avoid emotional connections with others. However, the behavior described in the case — the child’s affection toward strangers and desire to be picked up — is not consistent with the inhibited type, but rather with the disinhibited type, where children show excessive social behavior and indiscriminate attachment to others.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) SLD (Latest exam Q) · A diagnosis of disorder of written expression is based on a child's poor performance on composing written text, including handwriting and impaired ability to spell and to place words sequentially in coherent sentences, compared with most other children of the same age and intellectual ability. In addition to spelling mistakes, a child with writing disorder may have serious grammatical mistakes, such as using incorrect tenses, forgetting words in sentences, and placing words in the wrong order. Punctuation may be incorrect, and the child may have poor ability to remember which words begin with capital letters. Poor handwriting may also contribute to writing disorder, including letters that are not legible, inverted letters, and mixtures of capital and lowercase letters in a given word. · Children with disorder of written expression have difficulties early in grade school in spelling words and expressing their thoughts according to age-appropriate grammatical norms. Their spoken and written sentences contain an unusually large number of grammatical errors and poor paragraph organization. During and after the second grade, these children commonly make simple grammatical errors in writing a short sentence. For example, despite constant reminders, they frequently fail to capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence and to end the sentence with a period. Common features of the disorder of written expression are spelling errors, grammatical errors, punctuation errors, poor paragraph organization, and poor handwriting. · As they grow older and progress into higher grades in school, such children's spoken and written sentences become more conspicuously primitive, odd, and inferior to what is expected of students at their grade level. Their word choices are erroneous and inappropriate; their paragraphs are disorganized and are not in proper sequence; and spelling correctly becomes increasingly difficult as their vocabulary becomes larger and more abstract. Associated features of disorder of written expression include refusal or reluctance to go to school and to do assigned written homework, poor academic performance in other areas (e.g., mathematics), general avoidance of school work, truancy, attention deficit, and conduct disturbance",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Risperidone Tic disorders are distinguished by the type of tic symptoms, their frequency, and the pattern in which they emerge over time. Tics are abnormal movements or vocalizations that most commonly affect the muscles of the face and neck, such as eye-blinking, head-jerking, mouth-grimacing, or head-shaking. Typical vocal tics include throat-clearing, grunting, snorting, and coughing. Tics are defined as rapid and repetitive muscle contractions resulting in movements or vocalizations that are experienced as involuntary. Motor and vocal tics are divided into simple and complex types. Simple motor tics are those composed of repetitive, rapid contractions of functionally similar muscle groups for example, eye-blinking, neck-jerking, shoulder-shrugging, and facial-grimacing. Common simple vocal tics include coughing, throat-clearing, grunting, sniffing, snorting, and barking. Complex motor tics appear to be more purposeful and ritualistic than simple tics. Common complex motor tics include grooming behaviors, the smelling of objects, jumping, touching behaviors, echopraxia (imitation of observed behavior), and copropraxia (display of obscene gestures). Complex vocal tics include repeating words or phrases out of context, coprolalia (use of obscene words or phrases), palilalia (a person's repeating his or her words), and echolalia (repetition of the last-heard words of others). The treatment of chronic motor or vocal tic disorder depends on the severity and frequency of the tics; the patient's subjective distress; the effects of the tics on school or work, job performance, and socialization; and the presence of any other concomitant mental disorder. Psychotherapy may be indicated to minimize the secondary social difficulties caused by severe tics. Several studies found that behavioraltechniques, particularly habit reversal treatments, were effective in treating chronic motor or vocal tic disorder. “When severe, tics may be reduced through the use of atypical antipsychotics such as RISPERIDONE”. (Note: Tic being a hyperdopaminergic state, responds to D2 blockers, risperidone and haloperidol etc)",

During this time, age-appropriate skills such as verbal and nonverbal communication, social relationships, bowel and bladder control, and play all develop normally. The disease manifests itself as a clinically significant loss of previously acquired skills before the age of 10. In Rett disorder, the onset of the disease occurs earlier, usually 6 months after birth, and there are characteristic hand stereotypies that do not occur in childhood disintegrative disorder. The presence of the apparently normal development of speech and other behaviors, followed by the loss of these, distinguishes this disorder from autism and Asperger disorder where there is no loss of previously acquired skills.",
