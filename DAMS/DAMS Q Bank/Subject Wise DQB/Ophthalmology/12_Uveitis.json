      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lymphocytes In non-granulomatous uveitis, the type of cells typically found in the keratic precipitates (KP) on the corneal endothelium are lymphocytes. This type of uveitis is characterized by an inflammatory response that involves predominantly T lymphocytes, which are part of the cell-mediated immune response. The presence of lymphocytes in the anterior chamber and keratic precipitates is a hallmark of this condition, which is typically less severe than granulomatous uveitis and does not involve the formation of granulomas. Incorrect Options: A. PMN cells (Polymorphonuclear cells): PMN cells, also known as neutrophils, are more commonly seen in granulomatous forms of uveitis or in infections with bacterial or fungal etiology. They are not the predominant cell type seen in non-granulomatous uveitis, where the inflammatory response is primarily mediated by lymphocytes. B. Monocytes: Monocytes are often involved in granulomatous uveitis or in certain systemic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, syphilis). While they can occasionally be seen in non-granulomatous uveitis, they are not the primary cell type involved in the inflammatory process. D. Plasma cells: Plasma cells are more characteristic of chronic or systemic inflammatory conditions and are commonly found in granulomatous uveitis or conditions like syphilis or sarcoidosis. They are not typically the most abundant cell type seen in non-granulomatous uveitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Most of the cases occur within two weeks of injury Sympathetic ophthalmitis is a rare, bilateral, granulomatous uveitis that typically occurs after a penetrating injury or surgery to one eye. It is thought to be an autoimmune response in which the immune system attacks the uveal tissue of both eyes, triggered by exposure to uveal antigens from the injured eye. However, the majority of cases do not occur within two weeks of the injury. Instead, they usually develop several weeks to months after the trauma, with the onset often delayed by 3 to 8 weeks. Incorrect Options: A. Earliest sign is retrolental flare: One of the earliest signs of sympathetic ophthalmitis is indeed a retrolental flare, which refers to the appearance of inflammatory cells and proteins in the aqueous humor, often seen with slit-lamp biomicroscopy. This is a hallmark feature of anterior uveitis, which is part of the condition. C. Uveal antigen has been implicated as the responsible exciting agent: The uveal antigen present in the eye that is involved in the immune response is thought to trigger sympathetic ophthalmitis. The inflammation occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the uveal tissue of the uninjured eye, following the initial trauma to the other eye, where the antigen is released. D. First symptom is loss of accommodation: Loss of accommodation is a possible early symptom of sympathetic ophthalmitis. This is due to inflammation in the anterior segment, particularly the ciliary body, which can impair the eye's ability to focus on nearby objects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pilocarpine Pilocarpine is a miotic agent (a drug that constricts the pupil), which is contraindicated in subacute anterior uveitis with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). While pilocarpine can reduce IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, its use in uveitis is problematic. Pilocarpine-induced miosis (pupil constriction) can lead to the formation of posterior synechiae (adhesions between the iris and the lens), worsening the uveitis. Additionally, in the presence of elevated IOP, pilocarpine can exacerbate the inflammation in the anterior chamber, making it an inappropriate choice for treatment. Incorrect Options: A. Acetazolamide: Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces aqueous humor production, thus lowering intraocular pressure. It is commonly used in uveitis associated with raised IOP to help manage elevated pressure. This makes it an appropriate choice for treatment. B. Timolol: Timolol is a beta-blocker that works by reducing the production of aqueous humor, which in turn lowers intraocular pressure. It is frequently used to treat elevated IOP in cases of uveitis. Timolol is effective in managing the increased pressure, making it a valid treatment option. C. Cyclopentolate: Cyclopentolate is an anticholinergic drug that helps to dilate the pupil and relax the ciliary muscle. It is used in anterior uveitis to prevent the formation of adhesions between the iris and the lens (synechiae) and to reduce pain. Cyclopentolate is often used in uveitis to improve comfort and prevent complications, making it an appropriate treatment in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sympathetic ophthalmitis Dalen-Fuch’s nodules are characteristic of sympathetic ophthalmitis, which is a bilateral, granulomatous uveitis that occurs after trauma or surgery to one eye. These nodules are composed of granulomatous inflammation and are typically seen in the posterior part of the eye, particularly on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid. The nodules are a hallmark of sympathetic ophthalmitis and represent an immune response to uveal antigens from the injured eye. The condition is an autoimmune reaction where the immune system attacks the unaffected eye. Incorrect Options: A. Mycotic endophthalmitis: Mycotic endophthalmitis is caused by fungal infections of the eye and typically presents with pus-filled inflammation in the vitreous and anterior chamber. While there may be retinal changes, Dalen-Fuch's nodules are not associated with fungal infections. B. Phacotoxic endophthalmitis: Phacotoxic endophthalmitis occurs due to the release of lens material into the vitreous cavity after cataract surgery or trauma. The inflammation is primarily due to the toxicity of the lens material and does not involve the formation of Dalen-Fuch's nodules, which are specific to sympathetic ophthalmitis. C. Bacterial endophthalmitis: Bacterial endophthalmitis is caused by bacterial infections, often after eye surgery or trauma. It typically presents with rapid, severe inflammation and purulent discharge in the eye. Dalen-Fuch's nodules are not a feature of bacterial endophthalmitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ring In iris bombe, the iris becomes pushed forward due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), typically as a result of conditions like angle-closure glaucoma. In this condition, the peripheral iris is adherent to the cornea, and the anterior portion of the iris forms a ring-shaped synechiae around the cornea. This ring-shaped synechiae is characteristic of iris bombe and occurs at the peripheral iris where it is attached to the trabecular meshwork, preventing normal fluid drainage and leading to further pressure build-up. Incorrect Options: A. Total: Total synechiae refers to complete adhesion between the iris and lens (posterior synechiae) or iris and cornea (anterior synechiae). It is not typical of iris bombe, where the synechiae are ring-shaped around the peripheral iris, not total. B. Goniform: Goniform synechiae refers to iris adhesions that are shaped like a cone. This is not a typical feature of iris bombe, where the synechiae form a ring. D. Filiform: Filiform synechiae refers to thin, thread-like adhesions.

However, Behcet’s disease is not typically associated with HLA-B27. Behcet's disease is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, along with ocular inflammation (including uveitis), but it is usually associated with the HLA-B51 allele, not HLA-B27. Incorrect Options: B. Psoriasis: Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition often associated with HLA-B27, particularly in patients with psoriatic arthritis.

The infection typically causes ocular toxoplasmosis, which affects the retina and can lead to retinal scarring, choroiditis, and ultimately blindness if untreated. Ocular involvement is often characterized by focal retinal lesions that may recur, leading to vision loss. Incorrect Options: A. Toxocariasis: Toxocariasis, caused by the larvae of Toxocara species (usually Toxocara canis), can lead to ocular infections such as vitritis, retinal detachment, or maculopathy. While it is a significant cause of blindness in children, it is less common in adults compared to toxoplasmosis. C. Taenia solium: Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) can cause neurocysticercosis, which is a major health issue in some parts of the world. Ocular cysticercosis is a possible complication, but it is less frequent compared to toxoplasmosis as a cause of blindness. D.

This indicates inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye. Sympathetic ophthalmitis is a rare, bilateral granulomatous uveitis that typically occurs after trauma or surgery to one eye, leading to an immune-mediated reaction in the unaffected eye. The condition often begins with mild anterior uveitis with retrolental flare and can progress to more severe inflammation, including panuveitis. Incorrect Options: B. Aqueous flare: Aqueous flare is a sign of intraocular inflammation that occurs when inflammatory cells and proteins are present in the anterior chamber. While it is also associated with uveitis, it is not the first sign of sympathetic ophthalmitis. Retrolental flare (which appears as a result of aqueous flare) is considered the earliest and most specific sign. C. Dilated pupil: A dilated pupil can be a sign of iritis or uveitis, but it is not specific to sympathetic ophthalmitis. In fact, in sympathetic ophthalmitis, the pupil may be constricted due to inflammation and iris involvement. D. Constricted pupil: A constricted pupil (miosis) can occur in uveitis and is related to the inflammatory process.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Root of iris Circularis Iridis major is an anatomical feature located at the root of the iris, where the iris is attached to the ciliary body. It refers to a prominent circular furrow that encircles the iris and can be seen during a slit-lamp examination. This feature marks the junction between the iris and the ciliary body, and it is one of the characteristic landmarks of the iris's anatomy. Incorrect Options: A. Ciliary body: The ciliary body is responsible for producing aqueous humor and controlling the shape of the lens. While the root of the iris is adjacent to the ciliary body, Circularis Iridis major is specifically located at the root of the iris, not directly on the ciliary body itself. C. Collarette of iris: The collarette is a prominent feature of the iris, but it is located at the mid-peripheral part of the iris, not at the root. The collarette is the area between the pupillary and ciliary zones of the iris and is not where Circularis Iridis major is located. D. Pupillary margin of iris: The pupillary margin refers to the border of the iris around the pupil. It is important for controlling the size of the pupil, but it does not contain Circularis Iridis major. The root of the iris, not the pupillary margin, is where this feature is found.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cataract The most common complication of recurrent anterior uveitis is the formation of a cataract. Recurrent inflammation in the anterior segment of the eye can lead to damage to the lens or lens opacities, resulting in cataract formation. Additionally, long-term use of steroid treatment for managing uveitis can accelerate cataract development. Cataracts are a common sequela of chronic inflammation, particularly in the context of uveitis, and can impair vision. Incorrect Options: A. Staphyloma: A staphyloma is an area of ocular tissue that has become thin and bulging, typically occurring due to chronic high intraocular pressure or trauma. It is not a common complication of anterior uveitis. While staphyloma may occur in certain eye conditions, it is more commonly associated with posterior uveitis or high myopia, not recurrent anterior uveitis. B. Glaucoma: Glaucoma can indeed be a complication of uveitis, particularly if the inflammation leads to elevated intraocular pressure. However, it is not as common as cataract in the context of recurrent anterior uveitis. Glaucoma typically occurs in chronic uveitis or as a side effect of steroid treatment rather than as the most common complication. D. Vitreous hemorrhage: Vitreous hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding into the vitreous body, which is typically a complication of posterior segment conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, or trauma. It is not a common complication of anterior uveitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Corneal ulcer Iridocyclitis, which is inflammation of both the iris and the ciliary body (anterior uveitis), can lead to several complications, but corneal ulcer is not typically one of them. Corneal ulcers are usually caused by infections (e.g., bacterial, fungal) or trauma, not by iridocyclitis itself. While the inflammation in iridocyclitis can affect the corneal endothelium and lead to keratic precipitates, it does not directly result in corneal ulceration. Incorrect Options: A. Secondary glaucoma: Secondary glaucoma can occur as a complication of iridocyclitis, typically due to inflammation of the trabecular meshwork, which impedes aqueous humor outflow, or from the use of steroid medications that increase intraocular pressure. This is a common complication of chronic or recurrent uveitis. B. Complicated cataract: A complicated cataract is a frequent complication of iridocyclitis. Chronic inflammation in the anterior segment of the eye can lead to lens opacification, and prolonged inflammation can accelerate cataract formation. This is particularly common in patients with chronic anterior uveitis. C. Phthisis bulbi: Phthisis bulbi refers to the shrinking and atrophy of the eyeball as a result of chronic inflammation, which can occur in severe or long-standing cases of iridocyclitis. This is a late-stage complication, but it is still a known risk in poorly controlled or recurrent cases of anterior uveitis.",

This is due to inflammation in the anterior segment of the eye, specifically involving the ciliary body and iris, which are crucial for accommodation (focusing on nearby objects). This loss of near vision typically occurs before other symptoms like photophobia, pain, or loss of distant vision become more apparent. Incorrect Options: A. Photophobia: Photophobia (sensitivity to light) is a common symptom of uveitis, including sympathetic ophthalmia, but it tends to develop later in the course of the condition. It is not typically the earliest symptom. B. Pain: Pain is another common symptom of sympathetic ophthalmia, but it generally develops as the inflammation progresses, not as the first symptom. Pain is more associated with acute uveitis rather than being the very first sign of sympathetic ophthalmia. D. Loss of distant vision: Loss of distant vision can occur due to complications from sympathetic ophthalmia, particularly if there is significant inflammatory damage to the retina or other structures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Small, irregular In acute anterior uveitis, the pupil is typically small and irregular. This occurs due to inflammation of the iris and ciliary body, which can cause iris ischemia, leading to an irregular shape. The pupillary reflex is impaired because of the inflammation affecting the sphincter muscle of the iris, and the pupil often becomes constricted (miosis) and irregular in shape, a condition known as iritis. Additionally, the inflamed iris may become stuck to the lens (posterior synechiae), which can further contribute to the irregular shape of the pupil. Incorrect Options: A. Oval: An oval pupil can be seen in conditions such as traumatic iritis or ciliary body muscle spasm, but it is not the typical presentation in acute anterior uveitis. The pupil in acute anterior uveitis is usually small and irregular, not oval-shaped. B. Circular: A circular pupil is typical in a healthy eye under normal conditions, but in acute anterior uveitis, inflammation causes the pupil to become small and irregular. A circular pupil would not be a characteristic feature of uveitis. D. Dilated: A dilated pupil is typically seen in conditions like trauma or as a reaction to certain medications (e.g., atropine). In acute anterior uveitis, the pupil is usually constricted due to inflammation affecting the iris, so a dilated pupil is not a typical sign.",

This syndrome involves a T-cell mediated autoimmune response against melanocytes, which leads to inflammation in various organs, including the skin, eyes, and ears. Incorrect Options: B. Waardenburg syndrome: Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, pigmentary abnormalities (such as two-toned hair, heterochromia of the eyes), and wide-set eyes. However, it does not typically cause uveitis or tinnitus, making it distinct from VKH syndrome. C. Apert syndrome: Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones), syndactyly (fusion of fingers or toes), and intellectual disability. It is not associated with uveitis, skin depigmentation, or tinnitus. D. Werner’s syndrome: Werner's syndrome is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in the WRN gene.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Retinal detachment Retinal detachment is not a typical complication of anterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis primarily affects the anterior segment of the eye, specifically the iris and ciliary body, and leads to inflammation. While it can cause complications within the anterior segment, such as glaucoma, cataract, and occasionally corneal calcification (due to long-standing inflammation), it is not commonly associated with retinal detachment, which involves the posterior segment of the eye. Retinal detachment is more often linked to conditions like diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, or trauma, not anterior uveitis. Incorrect Options: A. Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a known complication of anterior uveitis. Inflammation in the eye can lead to blockage of the trabecular meshwork, preventing proper drainage of aqueous humor and resulting in increased intraocular pressure (IOP). This can lead to secondary glaucoma in uveitis. B. Cataract: Cataract formation is another common complication of anterior uveitis. Chronic inflammation can lead to lens opacity, and steroid treatment for uveitis can further accelerate the development of cataracts. C. Calcification of cornea: Corneal calcification (or band-shaped keratopathy) can occur in chronic or severe cases of anterior uveitis. This results from the deposition of calcium salts in the corneal epithelium, often secondary to long-standing inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Narrow beam of slit lamp Aqueous flare refers to the presence of protein and inflammatory cells in the aqueous humor (the fluid in the front part of the eye), which occurs in conditions like uveitis. The narrow beam of a slit lamp is the best tool to demonstrate aqueous flare. This is because the slit lamp allows for high magnification and precise illumination, with the narrow beam highlighting the presence of proteins and cells in the anterior chamber. The flare appears as a milky or hazy appearance in the anterior chamber and is a key sign of anterior segment inflammation. Incorrect Options: A. Torch light: A torch light can be used for basic illumination but does not provide the necessary magnification and precision to demonstrate aqueous flare. It is not capable of detecting subtle changes in the aqueous humor, which is why a slit lamp is preferred. B. Corneal loupe: A corneal loupe is a magnifying tool used for examining the cornea and the anterior segment, but it is not equipped to visualize aqueous flare. The slit lamp, with its focused narrow beam, is much better suited for this task. D. Direct ophthalmoscopy: Direct ophthalmoscopy is primarily used for examining the fundus (retina and optic nerve) of the eye and is not effective for evaluating the anterior chamber or detecting aqueous flare.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fuch’s uveitis syndrome The Amsler sign is associated with Fuch’s uveitis syndrome, a form of chronic, granulomatous uveitis that primarily affects the anterior segment of the eye, often leading to inflammation in the iris and ciliary body. Amsler sign refers to the presence of macular edema or macular abnormalities observed during visual field testing, and is indicative of potential macular involvement in uveitis. Fuch's uveitis syndrome is typically unilateral and can result in vision changes, including macular edema, leading to Amsler's sign. Incorrect Options: A. Posner-Schlossmann syndrome: Posner-Schlossmann syndrome is a rare form of anterior uveitis associated with recurrent attacks of glaucoma. It is characterized by increased intraocular pressure and mild anterior chamber inflammation, but it does not typically cause Amsler sign, which is related to macular changes in uveitis. C. Lepromatous uveitis: Lepromatous uveitis occurs in leprosy, and while it can lead to anterior segment inflammation, it is not typically associated with Amsler sign. The ocular findings in lepromatous uveitis may involve iris atrophy and cataract formation, but macular involvement with Amsler’s sign is not a hallmark feature. D. Ocular toxocariasis: Ocular toxocariasis, caused by the larvae of the Toxocara canis worm, leads to retinal inflammation, usually with a granulomatous response. Although it can cause retinal lesions and vitritis, Amsler sign is not commonly associated with ocular toxocariasis, which tends to affect the retina in a different manner than Fuch’s uveitis syndrome.",

It typically presents with bilateral uveitis and other systemic features like tinnitus and alopecia, but heterochromia (difference in eye color) is not a typical feature of VKH syndrome. In fact, VKH syndrome more commonly causes inflammation in the iris and other structures but does not lead to color differences in the iris. Incorrect Options: A. Siderosis: Siderosis refers to iron deposition in the eye, typically due to retained foreign bodies, such as a metal object. This can lead to heterochromia as a result of the deposition of iron in the iris, which changes the color of the affected eye. B. Congenital Horner’s syndrome: Congenital Horner’s syndrome is associated with a disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathways that affect the eye, leading to ptosis, miosis (constricted pupil), and heterochromia. The difference in iris color occurs because of a lack of sympathetic stimulation to the melanocytes in the iris. C. Waardenberg’s syndrome: Waardenberg’s syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes congenital deafness, pigmentary abnormalities, and heterochromia. Individuals with this condition may have eyes of different colors due to abnormal pigment distribution in the iris.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Toxoplasmosis The headlight-in-fog appearance of the retina is a characteristic finding in ocular toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii. This appearance is due to the presence of retinal inflammation and vitritis (inflammation of the vitreous body). The \"headlight\" refers to a focal retinal lesion, which may appear bright, and the \"fog\" refers to the vitreous haze caused by inflammatory cells in the vitreous humor. This pattern is commonly seen in cases of active toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, and it is a distinctive feature that can help in diagnosing ocular toxoplasmosis. Incorrect Options: B. Toxocara: Ocular toxocariasis caused by Toxocara larvae typically presents with vitritis, retinal lesions, and granulomatous inflammation. However, the \"headlight-in-fog\" appearance is not commonly seen in toxocariasis. C. Herpes: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster virus (HZV) can cause retinitis and uveitis, but they do not typically produce the headlight-in-fog appearance. The findings in herpes-related retinitis are often more related to pale retinal lesions and hemorrhages. D. Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is most often seen in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS) and typically presents with retinal hemorrhages and necrosis rather than the \"headlight-in-fog\" appearance. CMV retinitis can cause extensive retinal damage but does not typically result in the characteristic pattern seen in toxoplasmosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterior uveitis The patient’s presentation of severe, sudden onset pain, corneal congestion, photophobia, and a deep anterior chamber is characteristic of anterior uveitis (also known as iritis). The inflammation primarily affects the iris and ciliary body, causing the symptoms mentioned, such as pain, redness (congestion), and light sensitivity (photophobia). The sacroiliitis observed on the X-ray is also an important clue, as it is strongly associated with HLA-B27-related diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, which commonly causes anterior uveitis. Given that the other eye is normal, this indicates an acute episode of unilateral anterior uveitis, a condition that can be linked to systemic diseases like ankylosing spondylitis, which is known to present with sacroiliitis. Incorrect Options: B. Posterior uveitis: Posterior uveitis involves inflammation in the choroid or retina, which typically presents with symptoms like visual disturbances (e.g., floaters, blurred vision), rather than the acute pain, photophobia, and corneal congestion seen in this case. Since the anterior chamber is deep and there is no mention of retinal involvement or vision changes, posterior uveitis is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. C. Intermediate uveitis: Intermediate uveitis primarily affects the vitreous and the peripheral retina, causing floaters and less severe pain compared to anterior uveitis. The hallmark of intermediate uveitis is inflammation of the pars plana (the peripheral part of the retina), but it would not typically present with the corneal congestion, photophobia, or a deep anterior chamber seen in this case. Therefore, intermediate uveitis is unlikely. D. Scleritis: Scleritis involves inflammation of the sclera (the white part of the eye) and is typically associated with more severe pain than that seen in uveitis. The pain in scleritis is often described as boring or deep, and it can be associated with eye tenderness on palpation. While scleritis can sometimes be associated with systemic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, it does not present with corneal congestion or photophobia as seen in uveitis. Additionally, the deep anterior chamber and symptoms of photophobia are more indicative of anterior uveitis.",

Ankylosing spondylitis primarily causes unilateral anterior uveitis, which may be recurrent, but it typically does not lead to inflammation in the posterior and intermediate segments of the eye, which is characteristic of panuveitis. Incorrect Options: B. Leprosy: Leprosy (or Hansen's disease) can cause panuveitis, particularly in its lepromatous form, where there is widespread inflammation of the uveal tract. Leprosy-associated uveitis can affect the anterior, intermediate, and posterior segments of the eye, leading to panuveitis. C. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that often causes panuveitis, involving inflammation of the anterior, intermediate, and posterior segments of the eye. The condition is a well-known cause of bilateral panuveitis, often accompanied by other systemic features such as granulomas in various organs, including the lungs and skin. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Acute uveitis typically involves inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye, particularly the iris and ciliary body, leading to several characteristic features. However, limited movements of the globe is not a typical feature of acute uveitis. Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body does not usually cause restriction in eye movement. Limited eye movement is more commonly associated with conditions like orbital cellulitis or extraocular muscle involvement, not uveitis. Incorrect Options: A. Circumcorneal congestion: Circumcorneal congestion, also known as ciliary flush, is a hallmark sign of acute anterior uveitis. It refers to the redness around the cornea, caused by the dilation of the small blood vessels around the limbus (the junction of the cornea and sclera). This is a common feature of acute uveitis. B. Deep anterior chamber: A deep anterior chamber is also a typical finding in acute uveitis, particularly in the early stages. Inflammation of the ciliary body can lead to the deepening of the anterior chamber, often seen during slit-lamp examination. C. Miosis: Miosis (constriction of the pupil) is a common response in acute uveitis. This occurs due to spasm of the iris sphincter muscle, which is often caused by inflammation in the eye. Miosis is commonly seen in iritis (inflammation of the iris) as part of the body’s inflammatory response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pars planitis Snow-banking is a characteristic finding in pars planitis, a type of intermediate uveitis. It refers to the appearance of white, fluffy exudates in the pars plana region of the eye, which is located between the ciliary body and the retina. These exudates are composed of inflammatory cells and proteins and resemble snowflakes, hence the name \"snow-banking.\" This is a common feature of pars planitis, where inflammation typically affects the vitreous and the peripheral retina. Incorrect Options: B. Endophthalmitis: Endophthalmitis is a severe infection inside the eye, typically caused by bacteria or fungi. It presents with pus formation, pain, and often decreased vision. While there can be significant inflammation in the eye, snow-banking is not associated with endophthalmitis. The clinical appearance of endophthalmitis is more likely to show vitritis, hypopyon, and increased intraocular pressure, rather than the characteristic snow-banking seen in pars planitis. C. Coat’s disease: Coat’s disease is a condition characterized by retinal telangiectasia and exudation of fluid under the retina, leading to retinal edema and hard exudates. It does not typically present with snow-banking in the pars plana or other signs associated with intermediate uveitis. Instead, the disease is primarily a vascular disorder of the retina. D. Panophthalmitis: Panophthalmitis refers to a severe, diffuse inflammation involving the entire eye, including the cornea, sclera, choroid, and retina. While it can present with extensive inflammation, snow-banking is not a feature of panophthalmitis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ciliary body The ciliary body is referred to as the \"dangerous area\" of the eye because it is the region where inflammation or infection can quickly spread and lead to more severe complications, such as glaucoma or uveitis. This area is rich in blood vessels, making it a focal point for the spread of infection or inflammation within the eye. Inflammation in the ciliary body can lead to secondary glaucoma due to blockage of aqueous humor outflow, and it is also associated with iritis and other anterior segment conditions. Due to its proximity to the anterior chamber and optic nerve, the ciliary body plays a crucial role in maintaining the internal pressure of the eye and proper eye function. Incorrect Options: B. Sclera: The sclera is the outer, protective layer of the eye. While it is important for maintaining the shape and integrity of the eyeball, it is not considered a \"dangerous\" area. Although conditions like scleritis (inflammation of the sclera) can be painful and involve systemic diseases, the sclera is less likely to lead to rapid and severe complications compared to the ciliary body. C. Optic nerve: The optic nerve is crucial for vision, transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. While damage to the optic nerve (such as in optic neuropathy or glaucoma) can result in vision loss, it is not typically referred to as a \"dangerous area\" in the context of infectious or inflammatory conditions. The optic nerve is protected by the skull and is less vulnerable to direct infection compared to the anterior structures of the eye. D. Retina: The retina is essential for vision but is not generally considered the \"dangerous area\" of the eye in terms of infection or inflammation. While diseases affecting the retina, such as diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration, can lead to significant vision loss, the retina itself is not as directly involved in eye pressure regulation or the immediate risk of spreading infection or inflammation, as seen in the ciliary body.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Keratic precipitates The pathognomonic diagnostic sign of anterior uveitis is keratic precipitates. These are small inflammatory cells that accumulate on the endothelium (inner surface) of the cornea. Keratic precipitates are a hallmark feature of anterior uveitis, particularly in iritis (inflammation of the iris) and iridocyclitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body). These precipitates can appear as granular or mutton-fat deposits, depending on the severity and chronicity of the uveitis. Incorrect Options: A. Aqueous flare: Aqueous flare is a sign of intraocular inflammation caused by the presence of protein and cells in the aqueous humor. While it is a common finding in anterior uveitis, it is not considered a pathognomonic sign. Aqueous flare can be seen in various forms of uveitis and other inflammatory conditions, making it less specific than keratic precipitates. C. Constriction of pupil: Miosis (constriction of the pupil) is a common symptom of anterior uveitis and occurs due to spasm of the iris sphincter muscle in response to inflammation. However, pupil constriction alone is not pathognomonic for uveitis, as it can also be seen in other conditions such as Horner’s syndrome or after use of miotic drugs. D. Raised IOP: Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) can occur in anterior uveitis, particularly in chronic cases or when treated with steroids. However, elevated IOP is not specific to uveitis and can occur in various other conditions, including glaucoma or ocular hypertension, making it less diagnostic for anterior uveitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lepromatous uveitis Iris pearls are a characteristic feature of lepromatous uveitis, which is a complication of leprosy (Hansen's disease). They represent small, white nodules on the iris and are due to the presence of granulomatous inflammation. In lepromatous uveitis, the granulomas can form on the iris, leading to the appearance of these characteristic iris pearls. Incorrect Options: A. Herpes simplex keratitis: Herpes simplex keratitis primarily affects the cornea, and while it can lead to anterior uveitis, it does not typically present with iris pearls. The condition is more likely to cause dendritic ulcers on the cornea, keratic precipitates, and iris involvement but not the granulomatous iris nodules seen in leprosy. B. Syphilitic uveitis: Syphilitic uveitis is caused by the Treponema pallidum infection and can lead to anterior or posterior uveitis. While it is associated with features like posterior synechiae and keratic precipitates, iris pearls are not a typical finding. Gummatous lesions can be seen in syphilis, but they are different from the granulomatous nodules seen in lepromatous uveitis. C. Herpes Zoster uveitis: Herpes Zoster uveitis is caused by the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) and is associated with inflammation in the anterior or posterior segments of the eye. The typical findings include dendritic lesions on the cornea and uveitis, but iris pearls are not characteristic of this infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Aqueous cell in the anterior chamber The sign of activity in anterior uveitis is the presence of aqueous cells in the anterior chamber. These are inflammatory cells (primarily leukocytes) that accumulate in the aqueous humor, indicating active inflammation within the eye. The presence of these cells is a key marker of the severity and activity of uveitis. The cells can be visualized using a slit-lamp examination and are a direct sign of ongoing inflammation in the iris and ciliary body. Incorrect Options: A. Aqueous flare: Aqueous flare refers to the presence of protein in the aqueous humor due to increased vascular permeability from inflammation. While aqueous flare is a sign of inflammation in the anterior segment, it is not as specific or sensitive for gauging active inflammation compared to aqueous cells. Aqueous flare is often seen in both active and resolving uveitis but does not provide as direct a sign of active disease as the presence of cells in the anterior chamber. C. Constricted pupil: A constricted pupil (miosis) is a common finding in anterior uveitis, but it is not a direct sign of inflammation activity. It is typically due to spasm of the iris sphincter muscle in response to inflammation. While a constricted pupil can be present during active uveitis, it does not specifically indicate the degree of activity or the presence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, unlike aqueous cells. D. Raised IOP: Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) can occur in anterior uveitis, particularly in cases of chronic uveitis or in those treated with steroids. However, increased IOP is not a direct sign of inflammation activity. It is more of a secondary effect and can occur in both active and chronic uveitis, making it less specific for determining the current state of inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypopigmented iris Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis is a chronic, low-grade form of anterior uveitis that is often associated with hypopigmentation of the affected iris. This condition primarily affects one eye (unilateral), leading to iris atrophy and heterochromia (difference in color between the two irises). The affected eye often appears to have a lighter, hypopigmented iris due to the loss of melanin in the iris stroma. The condition typically presents with mild anterior uveitis, and other features include cataract formation, vitritis, and occasionally retinal changes. Incorrect Options: A. Hyperpigmented iris: In Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis, the affected eye tends to have a hypopigmented iris, not hyperpigmented. Hyperpigmentation can be seen in other forms of uveitis, such as Horner's syndrome, but not in Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis. C. Posterior synechiae: While posterior synechiae (adhesions between the iris and the lens) can occur in uveitis, they are not a hallmark feature of Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis. This condition tends to have less severe inflammation, and posterior synechiae are typically not as common as in other forms of uveitis. D. Coarse KPs (keratic precipitates): Coarse keratic precipitates (KPs) are typically seen in granulomatous uveitis, but Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis is usually associated with fine, stellate KPs rather than coarse ones. The KPs in Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis are small and fine, which is another distinguishing feature of this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bilateral non-suppurative inflammation Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare, bilateral, granulomatous uveitis that occurs after trauma or surgery to one eye. It is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks both eyes due to the release of uveal antigens from the injured eye. The disease typically presents with non-suppurative (non-purulent) inflammation in both eyes, which means there is no pus formation. The inflammation primarily affects the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, and it is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, leading to a variety of symptoms, including pain, photophobia, and decreased vision. Incorrect Options: A. Unilateral non-suppurative inflammation: Sympathetic ophthalmia is bilateral, meaning it involves both eyes, not just one. The condition begins in the injured eye and then triggers inflammation in the uninjured eye, making unilateral inflammation incorrect. C. Bilateral suppurative inflammation: Suppurative inflammation, which involves pus formation, is not typical of sympathetic ophthalmia. The inflammation in this condition is non-suppurative (no pus), and it is characterized by granulomatous rather than suppurative inflammation. D. Unilateral suppurative inflammation: While unilateral inflammation might occur in other forms of uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmia is specifically bilateral in nature. Additionally, it is non-suppurative, not involving pus, so unilateral suppurative inflammation is not a feature of the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Retinal S antigen The neoantigen responsible for triggering sympathetic ophthalmia is the Retinal S antigen. This is a protein found in the retina. When trauma or surgery to one eye causes the release of retinal antigens (specifically the S antigen), the body's immune system mistakenly identifies these as foreign, leading to an autoimmune response that affects both eyes. This results in bilateral uveitis (inflammation of the uvea) in sympathetic ophthalmia. The immune system’s attack on the unaffected eye is what defines the condition. Incorrect Options: A. Lens protein: While lens proteins have been implicated in autoimmune reactions in other conditions (e.g., lens-induced uveitis), they are not the specific neoantigen involved in sympathetic ophthalmia. The lens proteins can be released after trauma and may contribute to inflammation, but the primary trigger in sympathetic ophthalmia is the retinal S antigen. B. Ciliary protein: Ciliary body proteins are involved in some autoimmune eye conditions, but they are not the primary neoantigen for sympathetic ophthalmia. The ciliary body can be inflamed during uveitis, but the specific antigen responsible in sympathetic ophthalmia is the retinal S antigen. D. All of the above: While lens proteins, ciliary proteins, and the retinal S antigen can all play roles in ocular immune responses, sympathetic ophthalmia is primarily triggered by the retinal S antigen, not all of the listed antigens.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Iridocyclitis Posner-Schlossmann syndrome is a type of iridocyclitis, which is an inflammation of the iris and ciliary body (parts of the anterior uvea). This condition is typically characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation in the eye with raised intraocular pressure (IOP), which can lead to secondary glaucoma. The hallmark of Posner-Schlossmann syndrome is the presence of mild to moderate iridocyclitis with high IOP, and it is often associated with mild anterior chamber inflammation and keratic precipitates. This syndrome can affect both eyes but tends to occur intermittently. Incorrect Options: B. Glaucoma: While Posner-Schlossmann syndrome can lead to secondary glaucoma due to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma itself is not the primary feature of the syndrome. Glaucoma in this context is a complication of the iridocyclitis and not the defining characteristic. C. Corneal ulcer: Corneal ulcer is an infection of the cornea, typically caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses, and is not associated with Posner-Schlossmann syndrome. While corneal changes may occur in certain eye conditions, corneal ulcers are not a hallmark feature of iridocyclitis or Posner-Schlossmann syndrome. D. Conjunctivitis: Conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the conjunctiva (the thin membrane covering the white part of the eye and inside of the eyelids). It is a different condition from iridocyclitis, and Posner-Schlossmann syndrome is specifically a form of anterior uveitis, not conjunctivitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Posterior segment of eye in sympathetic ophthalmitis Dalen-Fuch's nodules are characteristic of sympathetic ophthalmitis, a type of bilateral granulomatous uveitis that typically occurs following trauma or surgery to one eye. These nodules are found in the posterior segment of the eye, specifically on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid, indicating an autoimmune response triggered by the release of uveal antigens from the injured eye. This leads to inflammation in both eyes. Incorrect Options: A. Anterior segment of eye in sympathetic ophthalmitis: While sympathetic ophthalmitis involves inflammation of the anterior segment (like the iris and ciliary body), Dalen-Fuch's nodules are localized to the posterior segment of the eye, particularly on the RPE and choroid. B. Anterior segment of eye in sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can indeed cause granulomatous uveitis, but it does not typically present with Dalen-Fuch's nodules. Instead, granulomas can be seen in the anterior segment, and complications like cystoid macular edema (CME) may occur in the posterior segment, but Dalen-Fuch's nodules are exclusive to sympathetic ophthalmitis.

These arteries supply the anterior segment of the eye, including the iris, ciliary body, and conjunctiva. The muscular arteries provide blood to the extraocular muscles, and some branches of these arteries form the anterior ciliary arteries as they pass forward around the sclera. Incorrect Options: A. Short PCA (Posterior Ciliary Arteries): The short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCA) supply the choroid and optic nerve head. These arteries do not contribute to the formation of the anterior ciliary arteries, which are derived from the muscular arteries, not from the posterior circulation of the eye. B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Syphilis Iris roseola refers to a specific type of granulomatous inflammation in the iris, characterized by the presence of small, yellowish-white lesions in the anterior chamber, particularly on the iris. It is typically associated with syphilis, especially in the tertiary stage, where ocular syphilis can lead to inflammation of the iris and other parts of the uveal tract. These lesions are often referred to as \"rose-colored\" due to their appearance. Iris roseola can be seen in syphilitic uveitis, a form of granulomatous uveitis caused by the Treponema pallidum infection. Incorrect Options: A. Leprosy: Leprosy (or Hansen's disease) is caused by Mycobacterium leprae and can lead to uveitis, but it does not typically present with iris roseola. Instead, leprosy-related uveitis is more commonly associated with iris atrophy, and there are other features like corneal ulceration and visual impairment due to nerve damage. B. Rubella: Rubella (German measles) is a viral infection that can cause congenital cataracts and retinopathy, particularly in newborns. However, iris roseola is not a feature of rubella-induced uveitis. The typical ocular findings in rubella are more related to retinal changes, such as salt-and-pepper retinopathy. D. TB (Tuberculosis): Tuberculosis (TB) can cause granulomatous uveitis, but it is not typically associated with iris roseola. Tuberculous uveitis usually presents with posterior segment involvement, such as choroiditis and retinitis, rather than the characteristic iris roseola seen in syphilis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Behcet’s disease Transient and recurrent hypopyon is a characteristic feature of Behcet’s disease, a systemic inflammatory condition that causes recurrent oral and genital ulcers, as well as ocular involvement, including uveitis. In Behcet’s disease, hypopyon (accumulation of inflammatory cells and fluid in the anterior chamber) can appear and disappear over time, hence being transient and recurrent. This phenomenon is associated with severe anterior uveitis and can recur with flare-ups of the disease. Incorrect Options: B. Still’s disease: Still’s disease, also known as adult-onset still's disease (AOSD), is a systemic inflammatory disorder that can present with systemic symptoms such as fever, rash, and arthritis, but hypopyon is not typically a hallmark feature. Although uveitis can occur in some cases, it is not commonly associated with transient and recurrent hypopyon. C. Rheumatoid arthritis: While rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that can cause secondary uveitis, it is not typically associated with transient and recurrent hypopyon. RA can cause other ocular findings such as scleritis and dry eyes (due to Sjögren's syndrome), but hypopyon is more characteristic of other forms of uveitis, such as that seen in Behcet’s disease. D. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can cause granulomatous uveitis, which may lead to uveitic complications like posterior synechiae and cataracts, but hypopyon is not a common feature of sarcoidosis-related uveitis. Sarcoidosis typically affects the posterior segment of the eye, and granulomas may be present in the anterior chamber, but hypopyon is more characteristic of Behcet’s disease.",

Unlike sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and brucellosis, which are caused by infectious agents, Fuch’s heterochromic iridocyclitis is an idiopathic condition and is not typically associated with granulomatous inflammation caused by infectious organisms. Incorrect Options: A. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a well-known cause of chronic granulomatous uveitis, where the granulomas are formed in various organs, including the eye. It can cause bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis with keratic precipitates, iris nodules, and cystoid macular edema. B. Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can lead to chronic granulomatous uveitis. It typically involves the posterior segment (such as choroiditis) and can cause granulomatous inflammation in the eye, including iris granulomas and uveitis. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Steroid The drug of choice for treating iridocyclitis (inflammation of both the iris and ciliary body) is steroids. Steroids (usually in the form of topical corticosteroids) are commonly used to control the inflammation in the anterior segment of the eye. In cases of more severe or persistent inflammation, systemic corticosteroids may also be used. Steroids help reduce swelling, prevent complications like synechiae (adhesions), and alleviate pain associated with inflammation. Incorrect Options: A. Atropine: Atropine is used to dilate the pupil and prevent synechiae (adhesions between the iris and lens) in cases of iridocyclitis. While it is an important adjunctive therapy, it is not the primary treatment for inflammation. Atropine helps in reducing pain and preventing complications but does not address the inflammation itself, which is why steroids are the primary treatment. C. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a miotic agent that constricts the pupil and is sometimes used in cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma to lower intraocular pressure. However, it is contraindicated in iridocyclitis because it may worsen the pain by causing pupil constriction, which can aggravate the inflammation and synechiae formation. D. Timolol: Timolol is a beta-blocker used to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and is commonly prescribed for glaucoma. However, it is not the drug of choice for iridocyclitis, which is primarily treated with steroids to manage inflammation. Timolol may be used if increased IOP develops as a result of inflammation or steroid use but is not the first-line treatment for the condition itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage Eale’s Disease is a condition primarily characterized by recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. It is a type of retinal vasculitis, which often affects young adults, especially in individuals of Indian and Middle Eastern descent. The disease involves inflammation of the retinal blood vessels, leading to vascular occlusions, and the formation of new blood vessels that may rupture, causing recurrent vitreous hemorrhages. The hemorrhages can lead to vision problems, including floaters and blurred vision. Incorrect Options: A. Recurrent anterior uveitis: While Eale’s disease can sometimes cause anterior uveitis, it is not primarily characterized by recurrent anterior uveitis. The hallmark of Eale's disease is the involvement of the posterior segment, particularly retinal vasculitis and vitreous hemorrhages. Anterior uveitis may occur secondary to the posterior segment inflammation but is not the primary feature. C. Recurrent macular hemorrhage: Macular hemorrhages are not a typical feature of Eale’s disease. While vitreous hemorrhages can occur in the disease, macular hemorrhages are more commonly seen in other conditions like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration. In Eale’s disease, the vascular changes are usually more prominent in the retinal vessels rather than localized in the macula. D. Recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage: Subconjunctival hemorrhages are small, localized bleeding under the conjunctiva and are generally caused by trauma or increased intraocular pressure. They are not typically associated with Eale’s disease, which primarily affects the retina and causes vitreous hemorrhage due to retinal vasculitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Neurofibromatosis Lisch nodules are pigmented hamartomas of the iris that are a characteristic feature of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease. These nodules appear as small, brown, dome-shaped lesions on the iris and are typically asymptomatic. The presence of Lisch nodules is one of the diagnostic criteria for Neurofibromatosis type 1, along with other features such as café-au-lait spots, optic gliomas, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Incorrect Options: A. Amyloid oasis: There is no condition known as amyloid oasis. However, amyloidosis can cause deposits in various tissues, including the eye, but it does not typically lead to the development of Lisch nodules. B. Tuberous sclerosis: Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that leads to the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, kidneys, and heart. While retinal hamartomas can occur in tuberous sclerosis, they are not the same as Lisch nodules, which are specific to Neurofibromatosis type 1. D. None of the above: This option is incorrect because Lisch nodules are a feature of Neurofibromatosis, not a feature of amyloid oasis or tuberous sclerosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is a rare, systemic autoimmune disorder that is characterized by bilateral uveitis, meningitis, encephalitis, and deafness. It affects the eyes, ears, skin, and central nervous system (CNS). The condition is most commonly associated with inflammation of the uveal tract (uveitis), as well as inflammation of the meninges and encephalitis, leading to neurological symptoms. VKH syndrome is typically seen in individuals with darker skin, such as Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Incorrect Options: A. Sympathetic ophthalmitis: Sympathetic ophthalmitis is a bilateral granulomatous uveitis that occurs following trauma or surgery to one eye. While it involves both eyes, it is not associated with encephalitis. It is an immune-mediated condition where the body's immune system attacks both eyes after the initial injury. C. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can cause granulomatous uveitis, but it is not typically associated with encephalitis. It primarily affects the lungs, lymph nodes, and eyes, and although neurological involvement can occur (like neurosarcoidosis), it does not specifically cause encephalitis as seen in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. D. Behçet's disease: Behçet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder that often involves recurrent uveitis along with oral and genital ulcers and vascular disease. While it can affect the nervous system (causing neuro-Behçet's), it is not typically associated with encephalitis. The neurological manifestations are more related to meningitis or stroke rather than encephalitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Interstitial Stromal Keratitis Interstitial stromal keratitis is not a Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. Instead, it is usually associated with syphilis and is a result of bacterial infection (not autoimmune inflammation). This condition involves inflammation of the corneal stroma and is often due to a chronic infection or a syphilitic etiology. The immune response in interstitial keratitis can involve a variety of mechanisms, including Type 3 hypersensitivity (immune complex-mediated), particularly when caused by syphilis, and may involve granulomatous inflammation. Incorrect Options (Type 4 Hypersensitivity): A. Eale’s disease: Eale’s disease is a type of posterior uveitis associated with recurrent vitreous hemorrhage and is mediated by a Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. It is a form of ocular vasculitis that can trigger granulomatous inflammation. Eale’s disease is one of the autoimmune-mediated conditions associated with Type 4 hypersensitivity, characterized by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). B. Disciform keratitis: Disciform keratitis is a type of inflammatory corneal disease that is often caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is also considered a Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, as it is cell-mediated. The immune response to the HSV infection results in inflammation of the corneal stroma, and this condition is commonly treated with antiviral therapy and topical steroids. C. Sympathetic ophthalmitis: Sympathetic ophthalmitis is a bilateral granulomatous uveitis that develops after trauma or surgery to one eye. It is mediated by a Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, where the body’s immune system reacts against uveal antigens released from the injured eye, leading to inflammation in both eyes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tuberculosis The salt and pepper fundus refers to a distinctive retinal appearance characterized by light and dark speckled pigmentation in the retina, resembling grains of salt and pepper. This pattern is typically seen in conditions that cause retinal pigmentation changes due to inflammation or pigmentary disturbances. Salt and pepper fundus is not a feature of tuberculosis. While tuberculosis can cause choroiditis and retinal inflammation, it does not typically produce the characteristic salt-and-pepper appearance. Instead, tuberculosis may present with choroidal granulomas and other findings like retinal vasculitis, but the typical salt-and-pepper pattern is absent. Incorrect Options: A. Rubella: In congenital rubella syndrome, a salt and pepper fundus is a classic finding. The retinal changes in rubella result from retinal pigmentary abnormalities and retinal dystrophy, causing a speckled pattern in the retina. This is one of the hallmark ocular findings of congenital rubella. B. Syphilis: In ocular syphilis, particularly in the congenital form, the retina may show a salt and pepper fundus appearance due to retinal pigmentary changes. This can occur as part of syphilitic retinitis or retinal vasculitis. C. Retinitis pigmentosa: Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic retinal degenerative disease that can also present with a salt and pepper fundus appearance. The condition causes retinal pigment deposits and degeneration of the photoreceptors, resulting in a characteristic speckled appearance in the retina.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bacillus cereus Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive bacterium that is known to cause severe post-traumatic endophthalmitis with the poorest prognosis. It is a rapidly proliferating organism that produces toxic exotoxins that can lead to severe tissue destruction, especially in the eye. Bacillus cereus is commonly associated with contaminated trauma, such as open globe injuries, and its infection can progress rapidly, often leading to loss of vision despite aggressive treatment. This is why it carries the poorest prognosis among the organisms listed. Incorrect Options: A. Streptococcus pneumoniae: Streptococcus pneumoniae can indeed cause endophthalmitis following trauma or surgery, and while it is a serious pathogen, it generally has a better prognosis compared to Bacillus cereus. Streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis often responds well to antibiotics, though it can still result in vision loss if not treated promptly. B. Acanthamoeba: Acanthamoeba is an amoeba that can cause severe keratitis and endophthalmitis, especially in contact lens wearers. While Acanthamoeba infections are difficult to treat and can have a poor prognosis, they are less aggressive in their post-traumatic course compared to Bacillus cereus, which can cause rapid necrosis of intraocular tissues. C. Aspergillus: Aspergillus is a fungus that can cause fungal endophthalmitis, typically after trauma or in immunocompromised individuals. It generally requires antifungal therapy and can be difficult to treat, but its prognosis is not as poor as Bacillus cereus, which is more rapidly destructive to the eye.",
