      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Concussion injury Angle recession glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma that occurs due to trauma, typically following a concussion injury to the eye. In a concussion injury, blunt trauma can cause damage to the anterior chamber angle structures, particularly a tear between the longitudinal and circular fibers of the ciliary muscle. This results in angle recession, which may not cause immediate issues but can later lead to impaired aqueous humor outflow and elevated intraocular pressure, ultimately causing glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Radiation injury: Radiation injury to the eye can cause complications like cataracts, retinopathy, and optic neuropathy, but it is not typically associated with angle recession or secondary glaucoma caused by angle damage. C. Perforating injury: A perforating injury can lead to secondary glaucoma through mechanisms such as hyphema, inflammation, or scarring, but it does not typically result in angle recession, as the trauma is direct and penetrating rather than blunt. D. Chemical injury: Chemical injuries to the eye cause damage to the cornea, conjunctiva, and other ocular structures but do not lead to angle recession. Secondary glaucoma in this scenario is more likely due to scarring or inflammation in the anterior chamber.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Epidemic dropsy Hypersecretory glaucoma is a condition where there is an increased production of aqueous humor, leading to elevated intraocular pressure. It is commonly associated with epidemic dropsy, which is caused by the consumption of adulterated mustard oil contaminated with Sanguinarine toxin. This toxin leads to widespread vascular leakage, inflammation, and increased secretion of aqueous humor, resulting in secondary glaucoma with a hypersecretory mechanism. Incorrect Answers: B. Marfan's syndrome: Marfan's syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that may lead to lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) and secondary glaucoma due to lens-related issues or angle abnormalities. However, it is not associated with hypersecretion of aqueous humor. C. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is another connective tissue disorder that can cause ocular complications like keratoconus, blue sclera, and glaucoma due to structural abnormalities. It is not linked to hypersecretory mechanisms. D. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum: This condition affects elastic fibers in the body, leading to systemic vascular issues and retinal complications like angioid streaks, but it does not cause hypersecretory glaucoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Goniosynechiae Vogt’s triad is a set of clinical features commonly associated with chronic angle closure glaucoma. The triad includes: Iris atrophy – The iris undergoes structural damage due to chronic pressure elevation. Glaucomflecken – These are anterior subcapsular lens opacities caused by lens epithelial cell necrosis due to intermittent high intraocular pressure. Pigment dispersion – Pigment from the posterior layer of the iris is released into the aqueous humor and deposited on various structures, including the trabecular meshwork. Goniosynechiae, which refers to adhesions between the iris and the angle structures, is not a component of Vogt’s triad, though it is commonly observed in chronic angle closure glaucoma. It is a structural finding detected on gonioscopy but not part of the diagnostic Vogt’s triad. Incorrect Answers: B. Iris atrophy: This is a key feature of Vogt’s triad caused by ischemic damage to the iris from intermittent angle closure and elevated intraocular pressure. C. Glaucomflecken: Glaucomflecken are part of the Vogt’s triad and represent necrotic changes in the lens due to acute or chronic pressure elevation. D. Pigment dispersion: Pigment dispersion is a diagnostic feature of Vogt’s triad and results from mechanical rubbing of the iris against the lens or zonules, leading to pigment release.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sturge-Weber syndrome In Sturge-Weber syndrome, a congenital condition associated with facial port-wine stains and vascular malformations, raised episcleral venous pressure can lead to secondary glaucoma. The abnormal venous drainage in the episcleral veins due to the vascular malformations causes increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor, leading to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma: Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is caused by the deposition of exfoliative material on the anterior segment structures, particularly the trabecular meshwork, which impairs aqueous humor outflow. It is unrelated to episcleral venous pressure. B. Phacomorphic glaucoma: Phacomorphic glaucoma is a type of secondary angle-closure glaucoma caused by an intumescent (swollen) lens that obstructs the flow of aqueous humor and causes angle closure. Episcleral venous pressure is not involved. C. Neovascular glaucoma: Neovascular glaucoma is due to the formation of abnormal new blood vessels on the iris and trabecular meshwork, often secondary to conditions like diabetes or retinal vein occlusion. It results from vascular obstruction, not raised episcleral venous pressure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Scotoma in Bjerrum area The earliest visual field defect in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) typically occurs in the Bjerrum area, which is an arcuate region extending from 10° to 20° from fixation above or below the horizontal meridian. The defect often begins as a localized depression or small scotoma in this region and can progress to form an arcuate scotoma. This area is particularly vulnerable to damage due to the arrangement of nerve fibers in the retina, which are affected early in glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Seidel's scotoma: A Seidel's scotoma is an extension of the blind spot and is seen in more advanced stages of glaucoma, not as an early defect. B. Arcuate scotoma: While an arcuate scotoma is a classic visual field defect in glaucoma, it typically develops later in the disease as the Bjerrum scotoma progresses and coalesces with other defects. C. Roenne's nasal steps: Nasal steps occur due to loss of nerve fibers near the horizontal raphe and are common in glaucoma, but they usually appear slightly later than initial scotomas in the Bjerrum area.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Iris hyperpigmentation Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analog used to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma, has a well-documented side effect of iris hyperpigmentation. This occurs due to increased melanin production in iris melanocytes, particularly in individuals with mixed-colored or lighter-colored irises. The pigmentation change is typically permanent but does not cause functional vision problems. Incorrect Answers: A. Visual blur: While transient blurred vision can occur with some eye drops, it is not a significant or common side effect of Latanoprost. B. Adenochrome deposition: Adenochrome deposition in the conjunctiva is a side effect associated with epinephrine-containing medications, not prostaglandin analogs like Latanoprost. D. Iris hypopigmentation: Latanoprost causes hyperpigmentation, not hypopigmentation. Hypopigmentation is not a recognized side effect of this medication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Laser iridotomy In acute congestive glaucoma (acute angle-closure glaucoma), the treatment of choice is laser iridotomy. This procedure creates a small hole in the peripheral iris, allowing the aqueous humor to bypass the pupillary block and flow directly from the posterior to the anterior chamber, thereby reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). It is a definitive treatment that addresses the underlying mechanism of angle closure and prevents recurrence in the affected and fellow eye. Incorrect Answers: A. Pilocarpine: While pilocarpine can be used in acute angle-closure glaucoma to constrict the pupil and open the drainage angle, its efficacy is limited in the presence of severe IOP elevation. Additionally, pilocarpine may not work well when the iris is ischemic, which is common in acute congestive glaucoma. B. Trabeculectomy: Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure used in chronic glaucoma to lower IOP by creating a new drainage pathway. It is not the first-line treatment for acute congestive glaucoma, as laser iridotomy is less invasive and more effective for addressing the acute condition. D. Trabeculoplasty: Trabeculoplasty is a laser procedure used to treat open-angle glaucoma by improving trabecular outflow. It is not effective in acute angle-closure glaucoma because the drainage angle is physically obstructed.",

Tonometry: This is highly valuable in glaucoma as it measures intraocular pressure (IOP), a critical factor in the pathogenesis and management of open-angle glaucoma. B. Perimetry: This is essential for detecting visual field defects, which are the hallmark of glaucoma. It helps monitor disease progression and the effectiveness of treatment. C. Indirect ophthalmoscopy: Indirect ophthalmoscopy is of limited value in open-angle glaucoma because it provides a wide-field view of the retina but does not allow detailed evaluation of the optic nerve head, which is critical in glaucoma assessment. D. Direct ophthalmoscopy: While not as comprehensive as modern imaging techniques, direct ophthalmoscopy allows a detailed view of the optic nerve head, enabling the detection of glaucomatous changes like cupping.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Thick cornea Primary angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the anterior chamber angle is narrowed or closed, impeding the outflow of aqueous humor and leading to increased intraocular pressure. Several anatomical factors predispose to this condition by contributing to a crowded anterior segment. Anatomical Changes That Predispose to Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma: A. Small cornea: A smaller cornea is often associated with a smaller anterior segment and shallower anterior chamber, increasing the risk of angle closure. C. Anterior chamber shallow: A shallow anterior chamber is one of the primary risk factors for angle closure because it reduces the space between the iris and cornea, predisposing to pupillary block and angle closure. D. Short axial length of the eyeball: A shorter axial length is commonly seen in hyperopic eyes, which have smaller anterior segments and shallow anterior chambers, increasing the risk of angle closure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In the upward direction The peripheral field of vision refers to the area of vision outside of the central visual field. It is generally less extensive in certain directions due to the anatomical configuration of the eye and its surrounding structures. In the right eye, the peripheral visual field is usually least in the upward direction. This is due to the position of the eyelid, brow, and the more limited range of upward gaze compared to other directions. As a result, the visual field is slightly more restricted upward than in other directions. Incorrect Answers: A. On the left side (nasally): The visual field extends more to the nasal side due to the way the retina is organized. The temporal fields from each eye overlap in the central region, allowing for good peripheral vision on the left (nasal) side of the right eye. B. In the downward direction: The downward peripheral visual field is relatively expansive. The anatomical structures like the lower eyelid and the alignment of the eye allow a broader visual range downward. D.

This side effect can occur due to the preservatives in the medication, such as benzalkonium chloride, which is often included in topical glaucoma medications. The preservatives can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some individuals, leading to blepharoconjunctivitis. Incorrect Answers: B. Latanoprost: Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog used in glaucoma treatment. While it can cause side effects like iris pigmentation and eyelash changes, it is not typically associated with blepharoconjunctivitis. However, it can cause other ocular side effects like eye irritation or conjunctival hyperemia. C. Dorzolamide: Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. While it can cause ocular side effects such as burning or stinging on instillation, it is not as commonly associated with blepharoconjunctivitis compared to beta-blockers like timolol. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cupping of the disc Cupping of the optic disc is a key diagnostic feature of open-angle glaucoma. It occurs due to damage to the optic nerve fibers as a result of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The increased pressure causes a loss of neural tissue at the optic nerve head, creating a characteristic cup that is larger than the normal physiological cup. In open-angle glaucoma, the cup-to-disc ratio is typically increased, which can be observed on fundoscopy. This is one of the primary signs that help in diagnosing glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: B. Depth of anterior chamber: While a shallow anterior chamber can predispose to angle-closure glaucoma, it is not typically relevant in open-angle glaucoma, which is characterized by a normal anterior chamber depth and the obstruction occurring at the level of the trabecular meshwork rather than the angle. C. Visual acuity and refractive error: These are important for general eye health but are not typically affected early in open-angle glaucoma. In fact, visual acuity often remains normal until late in the disease, while refractive error does not play a role in diagnosing glaucoma. D. Angle of the anterior chamber: The anterior chamber angle is usually open in open-angle glaucoma, hence this finding is not useful for diagnosing it. A narrow or closed angle is typically seen in angle-closure glaucoma, not open-angle glaucoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dipivefrine In a hypertensive patient with glaucoma, Dipivefrine is typically not recommended because it is a prodrug of epinephrine and has alpha and beta-adrenergic effects. These adrenergic effects can potentially increase blood pressure, which is a concern for patients with hypertension. Dipivefrine works by increasing aqueous humor outflow but may exacerbate hypertension due to its systemic vasoconstrictive effects. Incorrect Answers: B. Beta blockers: Beta-blockers (e.g., timolol) are commonly used to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients. In hypertensive patients, beta-blockers are often used both for glaucoma and to control blood pressure, as they lower IOP by reducing aqueous humor production. C. Alpha agonist: Alpha agonists (e.g., brimonidine) are used in glaucoma management to reduce IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. These drugs are safe for use in hypertensive patients and do not typically raise blood pressure. D. Laser trabeculoplasty: Laser trabeculoplasty (e.g., argon laser trabeculoplasty, selective laser trabeculoplasty) is a procedure that can be used to treat open-angle glaucoma by improving the outflow of aqueous humor. It is safe for hypertensive patients as it directly affects the drainage angle and does not influence systemic blood pressure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phacolytic glaucoma Phacolytic glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma that occurs when a hypermature cataract (often a mature or intumescent cataract) undergoes spontaneous rupture or leakage of the lens proteins into the aqueous humor. This can lead to an inflammatory response and blockage of the trabecular meshwork, causing an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The patient's symptoms — including ciliary congestion, photophobia, blurring of vision, and a deep anterior chamber — suggest an inflammatory process in the eye, with the right eye being affected. The deep anterior chamber indicates that the cause is more likely to be a posterior lens rupture or leakage, which is characteristic of phacolytic glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Phacomorphic glaucoma: This occurs when a mature or intumescent cataract causes anterior chamber angle closure due to lens enlargement. It is typically associated with a shallow anterior chamber and does not usually present with a deep anterior chamber like in this case. B. Phacotoxic glaucoma: This type of glaucoma occurs when the lens material is released into the eye following cataract surgery, leading to toxic damage to the trabecular meshwork and elevated IOP. This condition is usually associated with surgical trauma and not the spontaneous rupture of a hypermature cataract. C. Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma: This occurs when lens material (proteins) provoke a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, leading to inflammation and elevated IOP. It often involves a strong allergic response and is typically more acute and inflammatory. It is less likely in the absence of a history of trauma or surgery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Folliculosis Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist commonly used to treat glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure through increased aqueous humor outflow. While it has several known side effects, folliculosis (the formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva) is not one of them. Known Side Effects of Pilocarpine: A. Shallow anterior chamber: Pilocarpine causes pupil constriction (miosis), which can lead to an anterior chamber that becomes shallow in some individuals, especially if the angle is already narrow. This can increase the risk of angle-closure glaucoma. C. Posterior synechiae: Pilocarpine can cause the formation of posterior synechiae, which are adhesions between the iris and the lens due to the intense constriction of the pupil. D. Punctal stenosis: Pilocarpine can lead to punctal stenosis (narrowing of the tear drainage ducts), which can result in tear drainage issues and cause dryness or irritation in the eye.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Optic disc The blind spot in the eye occurs at the optic disc, which is the point where the optic nerve exits the retina. The optic disc lacks photoreceptor cells (rods and cones), so it cannot detect light or form visual images. As a result, this area of the retina is insensitive to light and creates a \"blind spot\" in the visual field. This spot is present in both eyes, but the brain typically compensates by filling in the missing information from the surrounding visual cues, so we are usually unaware of it in our daily vision. Incorrect Answers: B. 2mm away from disc: The blind spot is located at the optic disc itself, not 2mm away from it. This is not where the blind spot occurs. C. Yellow spot: The yellow spot, or macula lutea, is responsible for central vision and is rich in cones that allow for sharp, detailed vision. The macula does not contribute to the blind spot. D. Corneo-scleral function: This refers to the structural function of the cornea and sclera in maintaining the shape and integrity of the eye. It is unrelated to the blind spot, which is due to the absence of photoreceptor cells at the optic disc.",

This condition is typically caused by ischemic events or conditions that lead to hypoxia in the eye, stimulating angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). Conditions Associated with Neovascular Glaucoma: A. Ocular ischemic syndrome: This syndrome results from reduced blood flow to the eye, often due to carotid artery occlusion, leading to hypoxia and the subsequent development of neovascularization in the retina and iris. This can lead to neovascular glaucoma. B. Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO): CRVO can cause retinal ischemia, leading to neovascularization in the retina and iris, which can result in neovascular glaucoma. D.

It is commonly performed in infants and young children diagnosed with congenital glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Trephining: Trephining is a procedure generally used for creating a surgical opening in the cornea, often used in cases of corneal transplants or perforated corneal ulcers, but it is not the preferred treatment for congenital glaucoma. C. Scheie's operation: Scheie's operation is a type of surgery used to treat open-angle glaucoma in adults by creating an opening in the trabecular meshwork, but it is not typically used for congenital glaucoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Betaxolol causes bronchoconstriction Betaxolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, meaning it primarily targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart rather than beta-2 receptors in the lungs. As a result, it has minimal effect on the lungs and is less likely to cause bronchoconstriction compared to non-selective beta-blockers like timolol, which affect both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors and can potentially cause bronchoconstriction, particularly in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, bronchoconstriction is not a recognized side effect of betaxolol. Incorrect Answers: A. Pilocarpine causes myopia: Pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist, induces pupil constriction (miosis) and accommodation. In individuals with existing myopia or long-term use, this can lead to accommodative spasm, which can cause temporary myopia (nearsightedness). Hence, myopia is a recognized side effect of pilocarpine. B. Adrenaline causes cystoid macular oedema: Adrenaline (epinephrine), when used in glaucoma treatment, has alpha and beta-adrenergic effects, and one of its ocular side effects is the development of cystoid macular edema (CME), particularly in patients with a history of cataract surgery or diabetes. Therefore, CME is a known side effect of adrenaline. D. Acetazolamide causes renal stones: Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, can alter the balance of electrolytes and increase the excretion of calcium in the urine. This can lead to the formation of renal stones (calcium phosphate stones) as a side effect. Thus, renal stones are a recognized side effect of acetazolamide.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Does not occur if there is a functioning trabeculectomy Malignant glaucoma, also known as inverse glaucoma, is a rare and severe form of glaucoma that often occurs as a post-operative complication following cataract surgery or trabeculectomy. It is characterized by high intraocular pressure (IOP) despite an open or functioning anterior chamber angle, caused by an abnormal accumulation of aqueous humor in the posterior segment, resulting in a shallow anterior chamber. Treatment typically involves vitrectomy to relieve the pressure by allowing aqueous humor to flow more freely. Incorrect Answers: A. Is a post-operative complication: This is true. Malignant glaucoma is a known post-operative complication, particularly after cataract surgery or trabeculectomy, and can develop when there is improper aqueous humor dynamics post-surgery. C. Is also known as inverse glaucoma: This is true. Malignant glaucoma is sometimes referred to as inverse glaucoma because it involves the abnormal accumulation of aqueous humor in the posterior segment rather than the anterior chamber, which is the opposite of how typical glaucoma manifests. D. Can be relieved by vitrectomy: This is true. Vitrectomy is one of the most effective treatments for malignant glaucoma. The procedure helps by allowing the aqueous humor to bypass the anterior segment, relieving the increased intraocular pressure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cyclocryotherapy Absolute glaucoma refers to a condition where the intraocular pressure (IOP) is extremely high, often in a blind eye that no longer responds to medical therapy. The pain associated with absolute glaucoma is typically due to ischemic damage and elevated IOP. One of the most effective ways to relieve this pain is cyclocryotherapy, a procedure where cryotherapy (freezing) is applied to the ciliary body to decrease aqueous humor production and lower IOP. This procedure can provide significant relief from pain and prevent further complications in the affected eye. Incorrect Answers: A. Retrobulbar injection of alcohol: Retrobulbar injection of alcohol is sometimes used to reduce pain in certain ocular conditions, including those with severe pain from an eye with no visual potential. However, it is not the first-line treatment for pain relief in absolute glaucoma, and its effects are less predictable than cyclocryotherapy. B. Analgesics: While analgesics (pain relievers) may provide temporary relief from the discomfort of absolute glaucoma, they do not address the underlying cause of the pain, which is elevated IOP and the inability to drain aqueous humor. They are used for symptomatic relief but are not effective in resolving the root cause of the pain. D. Trabeculectomy: Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure typically used to treat open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma by creating a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor. However, it is not indicated for pain relief in absolute glaucoma, as the damage to the eye is often irreversible, and the eye has usually lost its ability to function in a meaningful way.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Field charting Campimetry is a type of visual field testing used to measure the field of vision or peripheral vision of a patient. It helps in detecting any visual field defects or loss of peripheral vision, which is crucial for diagnosing conditions such as glaucoma, retinal diseases, and neurological disorders. The term \"field charting\" refers to the process of mapping out the visual field to assess any abnormalities or areas of vision loss. Incorrect Answers: A. Squint: Squint (or strabismus) refers to the misalignment of the eyes, where the eyes do not look in the same direction at the same time. While some forms of vision testing may be used in the evaluation of squint, campimetry is not used to diagnose or measure squint directly. B. Angle of anterior chamber: The angle of the anterior chamber (which is important in conditions like angle-closure glaucoma) is typically measured using techniques like gonioscopy, not campimetry. Campimetry assesses the visual field, not the anatomical structures. C. Pattern of retina: The pattern of the retina can be evaluated with fundoscopy or optical coherence tomography (OCT). Campimetry, on the other hand, assesses the visual field, not the retinal pattern.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Keratoconus Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a type of secondary glaucoma characterized by the growth of new blood vessels in the iris and trabecular meshwork, which leads to a blockage in the aqueous humor drainage system and an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The conditions that can produce NVG generally involve retinal ischemia or conditions that cause poor blood flow to the retina, leading to the release of angiogenic factors that stimulate new vessel growth. Conditions that Can Produce NVG: A. Periphlebitis retinae: This condition, also known as retinal vein occlusion, particularly in the form of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), can lead to retinal ischemia. This ischemia triggers the formation of new blood vessels in the retina and the iris, causing NVG. B. CRVO (Central Retinal Vein Occlusion): CRVO is a major cause of retinal ischemia, which can trigger neovascularization and eventually lead to NVG. It is one of the classic conditions that cause NVG. C. DM (Diabetes Mellitus): Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of retinal ischemia and neovascularization. When the retinal blood vessels are damaged due to chronic hyperglycemia, it leads to neovascular glaucoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mannitol The treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma (a medical emergency) involves rapidly lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent damage to the optic nerve. The drug of choice in this situation is mannitol, which is an osmotic diuretic. Mannitol works by drawing fluid out of the eye and reducing IOP quickly. It is typically administered intravenously to reduce the volume of aqueous humor in the eye, providing rapid relief from elevated IOP. Incorrect Answers: A. Timolol maleate: Timolol is a beta-blocker used in the chronic management of glaucoma, particularly open-angle glaucoma, to lower IOP by reducing aqueous humor production. However, it is not the drug of choice in acute angle-closure glaucoma because it does not provide rapid or effective enough reduction in IOP in this emergency situation. B. Phospholine iodide: Phospholine iodide (echothiophate) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can help lower IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. However, it is not used in acute angle-closure glaucoma due to its slower onset of action and potential for causing side effects, particularly in acute emergencies. C. Clonidine: Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to lower blood pressure and may have a modest effect on IOP. However, it is not the preferred choice in acute angle-closure glaucoma. It does not work fast enough or as effectively as osmotic agents like mannitol in acute situations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Congenital glaucoma The symptoms of large cornea, lacrimation, and photophobia in a 5-year-old child are characteristic of congenital glaucoma. This condition is caused by a developmental defect in the drainage system of the eye, leading to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The increased pressure can result in buphthalmos (enlargement of the eyeball) and a larger cornea. Additionally, the irritation caused by the elevated IOP leads to symptoms like lacrimation (tearing) and photophobia (sensitivity to light). Incorrect Answers: A. Megalocornea: Megalocornea refers to an abnormally large cornea but typically does not present with lacrimation and photophobia. It is generally a non-glaucomatous condition and does not involve elevated IOP or the associated symptoms seen in congenital glaucoma. C. Congenital cataract: Congenital cataracts may cause visual disturbances and sometimes a white reflex in the eye (leukocoria), but they do not typically present with a large cornea, lacrimation, and photophobia. These are more characteristic of congenital glaucoma. D. Anterior uveitis: Anterior uveitis is an inflammatory condition that can cause photophobia, but it does not typically cause a large cornea.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute Congestive Glaucoma In acute congestive glaucoma (also known as acute angle-closure glaucoma), a mildly dilated pupil that does not react to light is one of the classic signs. This occurs because the iris is pushed forward, which leads to angle closure and pupillary block, resulting in a mid-dilated, non-reactive pupil. This non-reactive pupil is due to the increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which impairs the normal functioning of the pupillary sphincter. Other associated symptoms include pain, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. Incorrect Answers: B. Chronic Congestive Glaucoma: In chronic congestive glaucoma (often associated with open-angle glaucoma), the pupil is typically reactive. The condition develops gradually, and the pupil usually remains normal or slightly sluggish, but it doesn't show the significant dilation and non-reactivity seen in acute angle-closure glaucoma. C. Open Angle Glaucoma: Open-angle glaucoma typically presents with gradual loss of peripheral vision and has no acute changes in pupil size or reactivity. The pupil usually reacts to light unless there's significant optic nerve damage. This condition does not cause a mildly dilated, non-reactive pupil. D. Congenital Glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma usually presents in infants with corneal enlargement and buphthalmos. The pupil in congenital glaucoma may be larger or show other abnormalities but is typically reactive to light. Non-reactivity is not a characteristic sign.",

It helps to assess how efficiently the aqueous humor is draining from the anterior chamber through the trabecular meshwork and the outflow pathway. The procedure involves measuring the intraocular pressure (IOP) over a period of time after a small amount of pressure is applied to the eye. The results help determine whether the drainage system is functioning properly and can identify conditions such as glaucoma where aqueous humor outflow is impaired. Incorrect Answers: A. Rate of formation of aqueous: While tonography provides information about the outflow of aqueous humor, it does not directly measure the rate of formation of aqueous humor. Measurement of aqueous humor production is typically done through other methods, like fluorophotometry. C. The levels of intraocular pressure at different times: Tonography does not directly measure intraocular pressure at different times; it measures the outflow facility, which is related to changes in pressure. Intraocular pressure measurements are usually done through methods like tonometry. D. None of the above: This is incorrect because facility of outflow is a key aspect of tonography, so option B is the correct answer.",

In patients with bronchial asthma, this can precipitate status asthmaticus, a severe and potentially life-threatening asthma attack. Therefore, Levobunolol can be a causative agent in this case. Incorrect Answers: A. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist used to treat glaucoma by increasing aqueous humor outflow. It primarily acts on the pupil and ciliary muscle and is not known to cause bronchoconstriction or exacerbate asthma. B. Betaxolol: Betaxolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker that primarily affects beta-1 receptors in the heart and has minimal effect on beta-2 receptors in the lungs. It is less likely to cause bronchoconstriction or worsen asthma compared to non-selective beta-blockers. D.

This type of scotoma is most commonly associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a hereditary retinal disorder that causes progressive peripheral vision loss and leads to the formation of ring scotomas around the central vision. As the disease progresses, the ring scotoma may expand, and central vision may eventually be affected. Incorrect Answers: A. Panophthalmitis: Panophthalmitis refers to a severe, widespread inflammation of all layers of the eye, often following infection or trauma. While it can cause significant vision problems, ring scotomas are not a typical feature. The vision loss in panophthalmitis is usually due to inflammation and infection rather than a ring-shaped defect. C. Sympathetic ophthalmia: Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare bilateral inflammation of the uveal tract that typically occurs after trauma to one eye. It does not cause a ring scotoma but can lead to other forms of vision loss due to inflammation, such as blurry vision, blind spots, or visual field loss. D. Vitreous hemorrhage: Vitreous hemorrhage is bleeding into the vitreous body of the eye, often due to conditions like diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork In open-angle glaucoma (OAG), the major site of obstruction to aqueous humor outflow is typically the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork. This part of the trabecular meshwork is located near the Schlemm's canal and is responsible for regulating the flow of aqueous humor into the canal. In OAG, increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow occurs in this area, leading to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and damage to the optic nerve. Incorrect Answers: A. Corneal trabecular meshwork: The corneal trabecular meshwork is part of the trabecular meshwork but not the primary site of obstruction in open-angle glaucoma. It does contribute to aqueous humor outflow, but the juxtacanalicular portion is the more important site in terms of resistance in OAG. B. Uveo-scleral trabecular meshwork: The uveoscleral pathway is an alternative route for aqueous humor outflow, which involves the uveal tissue and sclera. It is not the primary site of obstruction in open-angle glaucoma, as the main problem is usually in the trabecular meshwork itself. D. Scleral spur: The scleral spur serves as a landmark for the attachment of the trabecular meshwork but is not the site of obstruction in open-angle glaucoma. The juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork is where the obstruction occurs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Myopia Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist commonly used in the treatment of glaucoma. In young myopes (individuals with existing myopia), pilocarpine can exacerbate the condition by inducing accommodation (the process by which the eye adjusts to focus on near objects). The pupillary constriction (miosis) and increased accommodation caused by pilocarpine can lead to an increase in nearsightedness (myopia), worsening their refractive error. For this reason, pilocarpine is typically not recommended for young myopic individuals. Incorrect Answers: A. Folliculosis: Pilocarpine is not known to cause folliculosis (formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva). This is not a typical side effect of pilocarpine. B. Iris cyst: While pilocarpine may cause some changes in the iris, iris cysts are not a known side effect of pilocarpine. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Betaxolol In a patient with bronchial asthma and open-angle glaucoma, the drug of choice for managing glaucoma would be betaxolol. Betaxolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, meaning it primarily affects beta-1 receptors in the heart, with minimal effects on beta-2 receptors in the lungs. This makes it safer for use in patients with asthma because it has a lower risk of causing bronchoconstriction, which is a major concern with non-selective beta-blockers like timolol. Incorrect Answers: A. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that constricts the pupil and increases aqueous humor outflow. While it can be used in the treatment of glaucoma, it can increase bronchoconstriction and exacerbate asthma, so it is not ideal for asthma patients. B. Timolol: Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) by reducing aqueous humor production. However, because it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, it can potentially cause bronchoconstriction and worsen asthma symptoms. Therefore, it is not recommended for patients with asthma. C. Ipratropium bromide: Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic used for managing asthma, specifically to relax the smooth muscles in the airways. However, it is not used for treating glaucoma, and it does not affect aqueous humor production or outflow, so it is not relevant in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Congenital glaucoma In congenital glaucoma, the anterior chamber is typically deep due to impaired aqueous humor outflow. This leads to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which causes buphthalmos (enlargement of the eyeball) and can also contribute to the enlargement of the cornea. Despite the high IOP, the anterior chamber may remain deep, especially in the early stages before significant optic nerve damage occurs. Incorrect Answers: A. Microcornea: Microcornea refers to an abnormally small cornea, which is often associated with a shallow anterior chamber. This can predispose to angle-closure glaucoma, not a deep anterior chamber. B. Hypermetropia (farsightedness): In hypermetropia, the anterior chamber can be somewhat shallow, particularly in individuals with high hypermetropia. A shallow anterior chamber is more common in hypermetropia than a deep one. D. Anterior synechiae: Anterior synechiae refers to adhesions between the iris and the corneal endothelium.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Watering of the eyes The most common symptom of infantile glaucoma (also called congenital glaucoma) is watering of the eyes (epiphora). This occurs because the impaired drainage of aqueous humor leads to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which in turn causes the lacrimal system to be affected, resulting in tearing. Other symptoms like photophobia, pain, and nystagmus may also occur but are less common than watering. Incorrect Answers: A. Photophobia: Photophobia (sensitivity to light) is a common symptom in glaucoma, but in infantile glaucoma, watering of the eyes tends to be the most frequent presenting symptom. B. Pain: Pain is often absent in the early stages of infantile glaucoma, but as the condition worsens or if left untreated, pain may develop due to elevated IOP and corneal edema. However, watering of the eyes is more typical. D. Nystagmus: Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) can occur in severe cases of glaucoma, especially if optic nerve damage occurs due to prolonged elevated IOP.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Spherophakia Inverse glaucoma, also known as malignant glaucoma, is a type of secondary glaucoma where there is increased intraocular pressure (IOP) due to misdirection of aqueous humor. In spherophakia, which is a condition where the lens is smaller and more spherical than normal, there is a risk of the lens causing angle-closure or pupillary block, leading to this form of glaucoma. The abnormal lens shape or position can block the outflow of aqueous humor, resulting in inverse glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Complicated cataract: Complicated cataract refers to cataracts that occur secondary to other ocular conditions or trauma. Although cataracts can cause changes in the anterior segment, they are not typically associated with inverse glaucoma, which primarily involves the lens in conditions like spherophakia. C. Pigmentary glaucoma: Pigmentary glaucoma is caused by the dispersion of pigment from the iris, which obstructs the trabecular meshwork. It does not cause inverse glaucoma, which involves abnormal aqueous humor dynamics rather than pigmentary dispersion. D. Glaucoma capsulare: Glaucoma capsulare refers to elevated IOP resulting from capsular block during cataract surgery. It involves trabecular meshwork obstruction due to the accumulation of material within the eye, but it is not considered inverse glaucoma, which involves misdirected aqueous humor flow.",

This damage typically occurs due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), but the defining characteristic of glaucoma is the progressive loss of optic nerve fibers, leading to visual field loss. Glaucoma is primarily a nerve disease and is characterized by gradual damage to the optic nerve head, leading to permanent vision loss if untreated. Incorrect Answers: B. Raised intraocular pressure: Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma, but it is not always present in every case. Some patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) can develop optic neuropathy without elevated IOP. Thus, raised IOP is not the defining feature of glaucoma. C. Reduced vision: While reduced vision can result from glaucoma due to optic nerve damage, it is not the defining feature. In the early stages of glaucoma, vision may remain normal until significant optic nerve damage occurs. D. Painful: Glaucoma is typically a painless condition, especially in open-angle glaucoma, which is the most common form.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Brimonidine Brimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients. One of its known side effects is drowsiness or sedation. This occurs because brimonidine acts on the central nervous system (CNS), and its systemic absorption can cause CNS effects like drowsiness, fatigue, and sometimes even a dry mouth. Although these side effects are generally mild, they are more commonly observed with brimonidine compared to other glaucoma medications. Incorrect Answers: A. Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that causes pupil constriction and increases aqueous humor outflow. Its common side effects include eye irritation, headache, and blurred vision, but drowsiness is not typically associated with pilocarpine. C. Betaxolol: Betaxolol is a beta-blocker used in glaucoma to lower IOP. While beta-blockers can cause fatigue in some people, drowsiness is not a common side effect of betaxolol. Additionally, betaxolol is cardioselective, meaning it affects beta-1 receptors more than beta-2 receptors, which reduces the likelihood of CNS side effects. D. Prostaglandin analogues: Prostaglandin analogues (e.g., latanoprost, bimatoprost) work by increasing aqueous humor outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. Their side effects typically include eye redness, eyelash growth, and iris pigmentation, but drowsiness is not a known side effect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Panretinal photocoagulation Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a form of secondary glaucoma that is characterized by the formation of abnormal blood vessels on the iris and the angle of the anterior chamber, which obstruct the outflow of aqueous humor, leading to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The primary cause of NVG is retinal ischemia, which stimulates the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to neovascularization. The treatment of choice for NVG is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). PRP is used to treat the underlying retinal ischemia by using laser to create multiple small burns in the retina, thereby reducing ischemic areas and the release of VEGF. This can help to reduce or eliminate the neovascularization and lower IOP. Incorrect Answers: B. Glaucoma Drainage Device (GDD): While GDDs (such as the Ahmed valve) are sometimes used in NVG when medical therapy and laser treatment fail, they are not the first-line treatment. They are typically used in cases of refractory NVG or when surgery is needed to control IOP after laser treatment. C. Trabeculectomy: Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure to create a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor in glaucoma patients. However, it is not as effective in NVG due to the fibrosis and scar tissue formation around the drainage site, and the presence of neovascularization often makes the procedure less successful. D. Prostaglandin analogues: Prostaglandin analogues (such as latanoprost) are used to reduce IOP by increasing aqueous humor outflow. However, they do not treat the underlying cause of NVG (retinal ischemia and neovascularization) and are not the first-line treatment for NVG.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pilocarpine Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that works by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system, which causes pupillary constriction (miosis). This miosis opens up the trabecular meshwork, allowing for increased aqueous humor outflow through the conventional trabecular pathway. As a result, pilocarpine is effective in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma by enhancing aqueous humor drainage. Incorrect Answers: A. Betaxolol: Betaxolol is a beta-blocker that primarily works by reducing aqueous humor production rather than affecting outflow. It decreases IOP by lowering the production of aqueous humor from the ciliary body. C. Brimonidine: Brimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. While it has some effect on outflow, its primary mechanism is not through the trabecular meshwork. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pseudoexfoliation syndrome Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is the most common cause of secondary glaucoma. It is a condition where abnormal material (pseudoexfoliative material) is deposited on various ocular structures, including the lens, iris, and trabecular meshwork. The material can cause mechanical obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, which impedes aqueous humor outflow and leads to an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), resulting in secondary open-angle glaucoma. Incorrect Answers: A. Pigmentary glaucoma: Pigmentary glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma caused by the dispersion of pigment from the posterior iris into the aqueous humor, which then accumulates in the trabecular meshwork and obstructs aqueous humor drainage. While it is a well-known secondary glaucoma, it is not as common as pseudoexfoliation syndrome. C. Neovascular glaucoma: Neovascular glaucoma is a serious form of secondary glaucoma caused by the formation of abnormal blood vessels on the iris and trabecular meshwork, usually due to retinal ischemia. While it is a devastating condition, it is less common compared to pseudoexfoliation syndrome. D.

Infants are particularly sensitive to brimonidine, and it can lead to serious side effects such as lethargy, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Incorrect Answers: B. Latanoprost: Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog that works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, primarily through the uveoscleral pathway. It is generally considered safe in children, including infants, although it should be used with caution in certain populations. C. Bimatoprost: Bimatoprost is another prostaglandin analog used to lower IOP. Like latanoprost, it works by increasing aqueous humor outflow. Bimatoprost is also used in pediatric cases, particularly for conditions like congenital glaucoma, under medical supervision. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma Laser trabeculoplasty is a treatment commonly used in open-angle glaucoma, including pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is characterized by the deposition of abnormal fibrillar material in the anterior segment of the eye, which can lead to blockage of the trabecular meshwork and result in increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Laser trabeculoplasty is used to improve aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork, helping to lower IOP and manage the condition effectively. Incorrect Answers: A. Chronic angle-closure glaucoma: Laser trabeculoplasty is not typically used for angle-closure glaucoma because this condition is caused by physical blockage of the anterior chamber angle, not impaired outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Laser iridotomy or laser iridoplasty are the primary treatments for angle-closure glaucoma. B. Neovascular glaucoma: Neovascular glaucoma is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the iris and trabecular meshwork, often secondary to retinal ischemia. The treatment involves panretinal photocoagulation to reduce the ischemia, and surgical interventions or anti-VEGF injections, rather than laser trabeculoplasty. D. Uveitic glaucoma: Uveitic glaucoma is associated with inflammation in the eye, which can lead to increased IOP. The treatment typically focuses on controlling the inflammation (e.g., using corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs), and laser trabeculoplasty is not the primary treatment. Corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory therapies are more commonly used.",

These signs are highly suggestive of acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG), which can be a side effect of the antiepileptic drug topiramate. Topiramate, an anticonvulsant, is known to be associated with angle-closure glaucoma. It can cause a pupillary block, leading to a build-up of fluid in the anterior chamber, resulting in a shallow anterior chamber, increased IOP, and corneal edema. This can present as a painful loss of vision and is considered a medical emergency. Incorrect Options: A. Chlorpromazine: Chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic, can cause corneal deposits and cataracts with long-term use, but it is not typically associated with acute angle-closure glaucoma. The symptoms described in the patient are more likely due to topiramate than chlorpromazine. B. Sodium valproate: Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant that does not typically cause acute angle-closure glaucoma. Its known side effects include weight gain, tremors, and hepatotoxicity, but it is not associated with the eye findings described in this case. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Angle closure glaucoma This 59-year-old woman presents with severe left periorbital pain, blurred vision, headache, and vomiting shortly after entering a theater. The key clinical findings are conjunctival injection, edematous cornea, a mid-dilated, irregular pupil that is non-reactive to light, and severe corneal edema. These features are highly suggestive of acute angle-closure glaucoma (ACG), a medical emergency. Acute angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the angle between the iris and cornea is closed, leading to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), resulting in symptoms like: Severe ocular pain (often described as periorbital or behind the eye). Blurred vision, halos around lights, and corneal edema. A mid-dilated pupil that is non-reactive to light (due to the high IOP compressing the optic nerve and affecting the pupillary reflex). Nausea and vomiting can occur due to the pain and increased IOP. The patient’s history of acute sinusitis (which can affect the sinuses close to the eye) and her hypertension and atrial fibrillation (which may increase her risk for conditions like glaucoma) are important considerations. This condition is more common in individuals with hypermetropia (farsightedness) or narrow angles, which may predispose them to angle-closure glaucoma. Incorrect Options: A. Acute iridocyclitis: Iridocyclitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body) can present with eye pain and visual disturbances, but it usually causes more diffuse redness of the eye and does not cause corneal edema or the pupil abnormalities seen here (mid-dilated and non-reactive). Iridocyclitis also does not typically cause the severe nausea and vomiting seen in this patient, which is more consistent with increased IOP in angle-closure glaucoma. B. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO): CRAO is caused by blockage of the central retinal artery, leading to sudden, painless vision loss in one eye. However, it typically does not cause severe ocular pain, corneal edema, or pupil abnormalities. CRAO presents with fundoscopic findings, such as a cherry red spot in the macula, but this patient’s fundus exam was inconclusive due to corneal edema, and the symptoms of pain and vomiting are more suggestive of angle-closure glaucoma. D. Retrobulbar neuritis: Retrobulbar neuritis involves inflammation of the optic nerve behind the eye and presents with vision loss, but it typically causes pain on eye movement rather than the severe, constant pain seen in angle-closure glaucoma. Additionally, retrobulbar neuritis does not cause conjunctival injection, corneal edema, or pupil abnormalities as seen in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Latanoprost This 55-year-old male with open-angle glaucoma is concerned about color changes in his iris. The drug most likely responsible for this change is Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue commonly used to lower intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. One of the well-known side effects of Latanoprost is increased brown pigmentation of the iris. This occurs due to increased melanin production in the melanocytes of the iris. The color change is typically gradual and more noticeable in patients with lighter-colored (blue or green) eyes. The effect is generally irreversible but does not affect vision. Latanoprost works by increasing uveoscleral outflow and is widely prescribed for glaucoma because of its efficacy and convenience (once-daily dosing). However, the cosmetic effect on iris pigmentation is a known adverse effect. Incorrect Options: A. Timolol: Timolol is a beta-blocker that is also used in the treatment of glaucoma. It lowers intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production. However, Timolol does not cause any change in iris color. Its side effects are typically related to systemic absorption (e.g., bradycardia, fatigue, respiratory issues) but not to iris pigmentation. B. Dorzolamide: Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that works by reducing aqueous humor production, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. Similar to Timolol, it does not cause any change in iris color. Its common side effects are related to ocular discomfort or systemic issues like bitter taste or headache, but it does not affect iris pigmentation. C. Apraclonidine: Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to lower intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma. It is generally used for short-term control of intraocular pressure, especially post-operatively, and does not cause changes in iris color. Its side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, or ocular irritation, but it is not associated with iris pigmentation changes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Latanoprost This 64-year-old woman presents with gradually worsening blurry vision over 5 months, intermittent headaches, and findings suggestive of glaucoma on fundoscopic examination. The key findings of bilateral narrowing of the visual fields, optic disk cupping, and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (27 mm Hg in the right eye and 26 mm Hg in the left eye) strongly point to open-angle glaucoma. Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue, is a first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma. It works by increasing uveoscleral outflow and reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). It is typically prescribed for patients with elevated IOP to help prevent optic nerve damage and further vision loss. Latanoprost is well tolerated and can be used once daily, making it an effective treatment choice for this patient. Incorrect Options: A. Trabeculectomy: Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat glaucoma when medical therapy is ineffective or when the disease is not controlled by medications. This patient has elevated IOP, but it is not yet clear whether she has progressive optic nerve damage or has failed medical treatment. Surgery is generally reserved for patients who do not respond to medications like prostaglandin analogs or other first-line treatments. Therefore, trabeculectomy is not indicated at this stage. B. Pilocarpine eye drops: Pilocarpine is a miotic agent that constricts the pupil and can increase aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork, lowering IOP. However, pilocarpine is typically used in acute angle-closure glaucoma to constrict the pupil and relieve pressure. It is not effective in treating open-angle glaucoma, where prostaglandin analogs (like latanoprost) are preferred. C. Timolol: Timolol is a beta-blocker that reduces aqueous humor production and lowers IOP. It is a commonly used treatment for glaucoma, but prostaglandin analogs like latanoprost are generally more effective and better tolerated than timolol for long-term management. Latanoprost has the advantage of being once-daily and more effective in lowering IOP in most patients with open-angle glaucoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Biomicroscopy To assess the fundus in a patient suspected of having glaucoma or other retinal diseases, biomicroscopy (also known as slit-lamp examination) is the most effective method. It allows for a detailed examination of the anterior segment, including the optic nerve head, which is critical in diagnosing glaucoma. The use of a slit-lamp with a fundus lens provides a magnified view of the retina and optic disc, helping the clinician assess any optic disc cupping, nerve fiber layer loss, and retinal changes associated with glaucoma. Incorrect Options: A. Biometry: Biometry is primarily used for measuring eye length (axial length) and other parameters for cataract surgery planning (e.g., IOL calculation). It does not assess the fundus or optic nerve, so it is not useful in determining whether vision loss is due to glaucoma. C. Direct ophthalmoscopy: Direct ophthalmoscopy allows for a quick and easy examination of the retina and optic disc. However, it provides a limited field of view and does not allow for detailed assessment of the optic nerve head, which is crucial in diagnosing glaucoma. The image is not as magnified or clear as what is achieved with biomicroscopy or indirect ophthalmoscopy. D. Indirect ophthalmoscopy: Indirect ophthalmoscopy offers a wider field of view and is useful for viewing the periphery of the retina. However, biomicroscopy (slit-lamp examination) is generally preferred for assessing the optic nerve head in patients with suspected glaucoma, as it provides higher magnification and more detailed visualization.",
