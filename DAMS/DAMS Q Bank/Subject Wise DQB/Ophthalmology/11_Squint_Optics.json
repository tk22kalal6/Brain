      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Silicone. Silicone is the material best suited for the manufacture of gas permeable contact lenses. Silicone contact lenses are highly oxygen permeable, which allows better oxygen flow to the cornea compared to older materials, such as PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). This increased oxygen transmission is essential for maintaining corneal health and comfort during long hours of lens wear. Silicone-based lenses can provide enhanced comfort, longer wear times, and are a key component in modern rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: A. Glass Glass is not used for contact lenses, as it is not flexible or lightweight enough. It also does not allow for the oxygen transmission needed for corneal health. While glass was historically used in the first versions of contact lenses, it has been replaced by more suitable materials like silicone and methyl methacrylate (PMMA). B. Methyl methacrylate Methyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a type of plastic that was widely used in the past for rigid contact lenses. However, PMMA is not oxygen-permeable, which can lead to corneal hypoxia (lack of oxygen). Because of this, PMMA is no longer used in modern gas permeable lenses, as it doesn't provide the necessary oxygen transmission required for long-term eye health. D. Rubber Rubber is not suitable for contact lenses, as it is not compatible with the requirements for optical clarity and oxygen permeability. Additionally, rubber can irritate the eye and would not provide the needed comfort for daily wear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 6 months. The fixation of visual reflexes is typically accomplished by 6 months of age. During this early period, the infant’s visual system undergoes rapid development, and by 6 months, the ability to fixate on objects and track them with both eyes (binocular fixation) is generally established. This is an important milestone in visual development, as it indicates that the visual reflexes are becoming well coordinated. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: B. 1 year By 1 year, most children have well-developed fixation reflexes and visual coordination. However, 6 months is when fixation and the ability to follow objects are typically well established, making 1 year an unnecessary overestimate. C. 2 years By 2 years, most children have matured visually and are able to perform more complex visual tasks, such as recognizing objects and associating images with meaning. The basic fixation reflexes are typically in place by 6 months, so 2 years would be too late for fixation to be \"accomplished.\" D. 3 years At 3 years, the visual system continues to develop, but fixation and basic visual reflexes should have already been well established by 6 months, making 3 years too late for the fixation process.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Uncrossed diplopia. Lateral Rectus (LR) palsy results in uncrossed diplopia, meaning that the double vision is horizontal and appears with the affected eye deviating outward (abducted). The lateral rectus muscle is responsible for abducting the eye (moving it outward), so when it is paralyzed, the eye cannot move outward properly, causing misalignment of the eyes and diplopia (double vision). In the case of LR palsy, the patient will see double vision that is uncrossed, meaning the images will be side by side (not up and down) and will occur when the patient attempts to look toward the affected side. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: A. Crossed diplopia Crossed diplopia is typically seen in conditions where there is a medial rectus palsy (the muscle responsible for turning the eye inward), resulting in double vision that appears crossed or misaligned in the near field. This is not characteristic of LR palsy, where the diplopia is uncrossed. C. Divergent squint A divergent squint (strabismus) can occur with LR palsy, but it is not always present. Divergence of the eyes occurs when the lateral rectus muscle cannot pull the eye outward, causing it to drift inward. However, the key characteristic is uncrossed diplopia, not necessarily the presence of squint. D. Pupillary dilation Pupillary dilation (mydriasis) is not typically associated with LR palsy. Pupillary dilation is more commonly associated with third nerve palsy (oculomotor nerve), which affects the pupil and eye movements. LR palsy affects eye movement without directly affecting the pupil.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Intraocular lens (IOL). The treatment of choice in aphakia (a condition where the natural lens of the eye is absent, typically after cataract surgery) is the implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL). An IOL is surgically placed inside the eye, in the position where the natural lens would normally be, allowing for proper focusing and improving vision. This method provides a more permanent and comfortable solution compared to spectacles or contact lenses. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: A. Spectacles While spectacles can be used to correct the refractive error caused by aphakia, they are typically not the preferred treatment due to the thickness and weight of the lenses required for significant refractive corrections in aphakia. Spectacles also have limitations in terms of visual quality and may cause significant visual distortions. B. Contact lens Contact lenses are another option for correcting aphakia, particularly hard contact lenses or soft lenses. However, they can be inconvenient for long-term use and may require careful maintenance. While they provide good optical correction, they do not provide the same permanent solution as an IOL. D. Epikeratophakia Epikeratophakia is a surgical procedure that involves the use of a donor corneal graft to correct aphakia by reshaping the cornea to correct the refractive error. While it is a possible treatment, it is not the first-line treatment in most cases, as IOL implantation has become the standard of care due to its superior outcomes and simplicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Corneal curvature. Corneal curvature plays the most significant role in focusing light on the retina. It bends (refracts) light entering the eye and is responsible for a large portion of the eye's focusing power. A change in corneal curvature, such as in astigmatism, can lead to blurred vision because the light is not properly focused on the retina. The incorrect options: A. Lens: While the lens does help to fine-tune the focus of light on the retina, it plays a smaller role than the cornea in focusing light. The lens adjusts its shape to focus on objects at different distances, but its primary function is to accommodate rather than to provide the main focusing power. C. Axial length of the eyeball: This refers to the distance from the front (cornea) to the back (retina) of the eye. While it does affect the focus, it is not the primary factor in focusing light. A longer axial length can lead to myopia, while a shorter length can result in hyperopia. D. Media length of the eyeball: This term is not typically used in the context of focusing light on the retina. However, the media (cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor) are all involved in light transmission, but the curvature of the cornea is the most significant for focusing.",

This is the total refractive power of the eye, which includes contributions from the cornea and the lens. The cornea provides most of the eye's refractive power, while the lens fine-tunes it for focusing on objects at varying distances. The incorrect options: A. 15D: This is much lower than the typical power of the human eye. The refractive power at 15D would result in significant vision problems, such as being highly nearsighted. B. 29D: This is also an underestimation of the eye's total power. While the eye's power can vary somewhat between individuals, 29D is still significantly lower than the normal 58D. D. 100D: This is much higher than normal and would typically be seen in an extremely myopic eye, but it's not representative of the average refractive power of the human eye.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Paralytic squint. In paralytic squint, one of the extraocular muscles is paralyzed, leading to an inability to properly move the eye. This results in a misalignment of the eyes, which causes secondary deviation (the deviation of the eye when the unaffected eye is covered) to be greater than the primary deviation (the deviation of the eye when both eyes are open). This happens because the affected eye has a limited range of movement, and covering the unaffected eye forces the paralyzed eye to take up the full strain, exaggerating the misalignment. Diabetes can lead to diabetic neuropathy, which may affect the cranial nerves controlling the extraocular muscles, leading to paralytic squint. The secondary deviation in this case would be more pronounced due to the restricted eye movement caused by the paralysis. The incorrect options: A. Spastic squint: This is due to overactivity or spasm of the extraocular muscles, typically causing the eyes to be misaligned. In spastic squint, there is not a significant difference between the primary and secondary deviations. C. Concomitant squint: In concomitant squint, the deviation of the eyes is the same in all positions of gaze, meaning that both primary and secondary deviations are usually equal. D. Restrictive squint: This occurs when the movement of the eye is restricted due to fibrosis or scarring of the extraocular muscles, which may result in unequal deviations, but not typically with the secondary deviation being more than the primary in the way that occurs with paralytic squint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Occlusion of one eye. The treatment of amblyopia (commonly referred to as \"lazy eye\") in a young child typically involves occlusion therapy, where the stronger eye is patched to force the weaker eye to work and develop better vision. This approach is most effective when started early, ideally before the age of 7, as the visual system is still developing. By covering the better-seeing eye, the brain is encouraged to use the amblyopic eye, thus improving its function. The incorrect options: A. Orthoptic exercises: These exercises are used to improve coordination and alignment of the eyes, often for conditions like strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), but they are not the primary treatment for amblyopia in children. Occlusion is generally more effective for amblyopia. C. Prism: Prisms are typically used to treat strabismus or double vision, not amblyopia. They can help correct eye alignment but do not directly address the vision impairment associated with amblyopia. D. Surgery: Surgery may be considered for correcting strabismus (if misalignment is present) but is not the first line of treatment for amblyopia itself. The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion therapy or, in some cases, refractive correction (glasses) if needed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Refractive correction. Accommodative strabismus is a type of strabismus (eye misalignment) that occurs when the eyes turn due to a need to focus (accommodate) on nearby objects, typically due to uncorrected refractive errors such as hyperopia (farsightedness). The focusing effort required to see clearly at near distances can cause the eyes to cross. The treatment of accommodative strabismus usually involves refractive correction with glasses or contact lenses to correct the underlying refractive error, eliminating the need for excessive accommodation and reducing the strabismus. In many cases, this treatment alone can correct the eye alignment. The incorrect options: A. Orthoptic exercises: These exercises are used to improve eye coordination and fusion, which is beneficial for conditions like concomitant strabismus or after surgery for strabismus. However, they are not the first-line treatment for accommodative strabismus, where refractive correction is the primary intervention. B. Lens implant: This is not typically used to treat accommodative strabismus. Lens implants are more commonly associated with treating conditions like cataracts or refractive surgery (e.g., for presbyopia or myopia), but they are not a standard treatment for strabismus. D. Prism correction: Prisms are typically used to manage non-accommodative strabismus, where the eye misalignment is constant or does not resolve with refractive correction. They are not effective for accommodative strabismus, which is mainly caused by refractive errors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypermetropic. Infants are typically born with a hypermetropic (farsighted) eye, meaning their eyes have a natural tendency to focus light behind the retina. This is due to their relatively short axial length (distance from the cornea to the retina) at birth. As the child grows, the eye elongates, and the refractive power of the eye adjusts, often reducing the hypermetropia and leading to a more emmetropic (normal) vision in childhood or later. The incorrect options: A. Myopic: Myopia (nearsightedness) occurs when the eyeball is too long or the refractive power of the eye is too strong, causing light to focus in front of the retina. Infants are not typically born myopic. C. Astigmatic: Astigmatism is a refractive error caused by an irregular curvature of the cornea or lens, leading to blurred vision. While it can be present at birth, it is not a physiological characteristic of all infants. D. Emmetropic: Emmetropia refers to a condition where the eye has perfect focus, and light is focused exactly on the retina. Newborns are usually not emmetropic but rather hypermetropic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Face turn to left. In right-sided VIth nerve palsy, the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) is affected, which controls the lateral rectus muscle of the right eye, responsible for abduction (movement of the eye outward). When this nerve is paralyzed, the eye cannot move outward (abduct) properly, leading to the clinical features of the condition. Incorrect Options: A. Convergent squint: This is a common feature in VIth nerve palsy. Because the right eye cannot abduct due to the loss of lateral rectus function, the left eye often compensates by turning inward, causing a convergent squint (esotropia). C. Inability to abduct right eye: This is a classic symptom of VIth nerve palsy, as the lateral rectus muscle cannot function, and the affected eye (right eye in this case) will not move outward. D. Diplopia: Diplopia (double vision) is a common symptom in VIth nerve palsy due to the misalignment of the eyes. As the right eye cannot abduct, the images seen by the two eyes do not align, leading to double vision",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Extorsion. The superior oblique muscle has several important actions, and it is primarily responsible for intorsion, depression, and abduction. When the eye is in an adducted position (looking towards the nose), the superior oblique muscle causes intorsion (rotation of the eye inward). It also assists in depression (moving the eye downward), especially when the eye is adducted. Additionally, the superior oblique aids in abduction, moving the eye outward, although this is not its primary function. The incorrect actions: A. Intorsion: This is the primary action of the superior oblique. It rotates the eye inward (medially), especially when the eye is looking downward. C. Depression: The superior oblique muscle contributes to depression when the eye is adducted. It helps move the eye downward, especially when the gaze is directed towards the nose. D. Abduction: The superior oblique muscle also contributes to abduction, or moving the eye outward, although this is not its most dominant action. The lateral rectus muscle is more responsible for this movement. B. Extorsion: The superior oblique does not cause extorsion (outward rotation). This action is mainly performed by the inferior oblique muscle, which rotates the eye outward when the eye is in an adducted position. Therefore, extorsion is not a function of the superior oblique muscle.",

Pseudomonas is a bacteria that can thrive on contact lenses, especially if the lenses are not cleaned properly or if they are worn for extended periods. The incorrect options: A. Recurrent corneal ulcer: While contact lenses can lead to corneal ulcers, recurrent corneal ulcers are more typically seen in patients with a history of previous corneal injury or other underlying conditions (like herpetic keratitis), rather than directly due to contact lens use. B. Acanthamoeba ulcer: This is a rare but serious infection often associated with poor contact lens hygiene or exposure to contaminated water (such as swimming pools or hot tubs). Although it can be a risk for contact lens wearers, it is much less common than pseudomonal infections. D.

Antibiotic and cycloplegic: While antibiotics and cycloplegics may be necessary if there is a secondary bacterial infection or inflammation, over-wearing syndrome itself typically does not require immediate antibiotic treatment unless there is evidence of infection. C. Change the contact lens: The contact lens may not necessarily need to be changed immediately. The primary focus should be on giving the eye a rest to heal from over-wearing syndrome. Changing the lens would not address the underlying issue of overuse. D. Send the lens for culture and sensitivity: This would only be necessary if there were signs of an infection (such as purulent discharge, significant pain, or corneal ulcers). In the case of over-wearing syndrome, the primary management is to allow the eye to recover by refraining from lens wear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anisometropic Amblyopia. In this case, the patient has a significant difference in the refractive error between the two eyes (+4.5 D in the right eye (RE) and +1.5 D in the left eye (LE)), which leads to anisometropia. Anisometropia occurs when the refractive power of the two eyes is unequal, which can cause one eye to develop amblyopia (a condition where one eye has poor vision that is not correctable by glasses or contact lenses). The condition described is consistent with anisometropic amblyopia, where the visual acuity in the right eye (RE) remains poor even after correction with glasses. This is because the brain suppresses the input from the eye with the significantly different refractive power, leading to amblyopia. The incorrect options: A. Refractive error: While refractive errors exist in both eyes, the main issue here is the difference in refractive errors between the two eyes (anisometropia), which leads to amblyopia in the right eye. Just having a refractive error wouldn't cause the vision discrepancy seen in this case. C. Strabismic Amblyopia: Strabismic amblyopia occurs when there is an eye misalignment (strabismus), leading to suppression of one eye's image. There is no indication of strabismus in this case, and the fundus is normal, making strabismic amblyopia less likely. D. Anisometropia: While the patient has anisometropia (unequal refractive errors), the main problem here is anisometropic amblyopia, which is a specific type of amblyopia caused by anisometropia. Anisometropia by itself does not necessarily result in poor vision in one eye unless amblyopia develops.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Myopia. The symptoms described—difficulty seeing the blackboard and frequent squinting or squeezing the eyes—are typical of myopia (nearsightedness). In myopia, the child can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry because light entering the eye is focused in front of the retina due to an elongated eyeball or excessive refractive power. Squinting or squeezing the eyes is a common compensatory mechanism used by individuals with myopia to temporarily improve focus by changing the shape of the eye. The incorrect options: B. Hypermetropia: Hypermetropia (farsightedness) typically presents with difficulty seeing nearby objects clearly, not distant ones. A child with hypermetropia may also squint to improve focus, but the primary complaint would be blurry near vision, not difficulty with the blackboard. C. Presbyopia: Presbyopia is an age-related condition typically affecting adults over the age of 40. It involves the loss of accommodation (the ability to focus on near objects), and is not seen in children. The complaint of difficulty seeing the blackboard would not be typical in presbyopia. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that causes muscle weakness, particularly in the ocular muscles. The key symptoms in this case—ptosis (drooping eyelid) and diplopia (double vision) on looking in all directions—are highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis, especially in a young adult. In myasthenia gravis, the weakness of the extraocular muscles causes difficulty with eye movements, resulting in diplopia, and ptosis due to weakened eyelid muscles. The difficulty in reading near print could be related to weakened accommodation or eye muscle fatigue, which is common in myasthenia gravis. The incorrect options: A. Lateral rectus palsy: Lateral rectus palsy would typically cause double vision but only in one direction (specifically, when the patient tries to move the affected eye outward). It would not cause ptosis or difficulty in reading near print as seen here. B. Oculomotor palsy: Oculomotor nerve palsy causes ptosis and diplopia but usually results in specific eye movement limitations such as inability to move the eye upward, downward, or inward, and may also affect pupillary reactions (due to the parasympathetic fibers). It doesn't typically cause difficulty reading near print unless there are associated accommodation issues. C. Presbyopia: Presbyopia is an age-related condition affecting the ability to focus on near objects due to loss of lens accommodation. It usually presents in individuals over 40 and would not explain the ptosis or diplopia observed in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Move with the mirror. In retinoscopy, the movement of the light reflex (image) observed depends on the refractive error of the eye being tested. For a myopic (nearsighted) patient, the eye is unable to focus on light rays coming from a distant object. When you perform retinoscopy at a distance of 1 metre, the light rays from the retinoscope are focused in front of the retina due to the eye's myopia. This leads to the reflex from the retina appearing to move in the same direction as the mirror (i.e., the image moves with the mirror). This is characteristic of myopia, where the light focuses in front of the retina. The incorrect options: B. Move opposite to the mirror: This occurs with hypermetropia (farsightedness), where the light rays are focused behind the retina, causing the reflex to move in the opposite direction of the mirror. C. No movement of image with the mirror: This is typically observed when the eye is emmetropic (having normal vision) or if the retinoscope is perfectly aligned with the optical axis, causing no apparent movement. D. Image can move on any side: This is not correct, as the direction of movement of the reflex is predictable based on the refractive error.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pseudomonas infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen that causes keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) in soft contact lens users, especially when the lenses are not cleaned properly or worn for extended periods. This bacterium can rapidly invade the cornea, causing serious infections, particularly in the presence of a compromised corneal surface (e.g., due to poor lens hygiene, overnight wear, or trauma). The infection is often characterized by pain, photophobia, blurry vision, and sometimes a corneal ulcer. The incorrect options: A. Acanthamoeba ulcer: Although Acanthamoeba can cause severe corneal infections, it is more commonly associated with poor hygiene and contact with contaminated water (e.g., swimming pools or hot tubs). It is a less frequent cause of keratitis compared to Pseudomonas in soft contact lens users. B. Erosion of cornea: Corneal erosion refers to the loss of the corneal epithelium, which can occur from trauma or other conditions but is not typically an infectious cause of keratitis. It may lead to pain and sensitivity to light, but it is not primarily caused by infection. D. Herpes infection: Herpes simplex virus can cause herpetic keratitis, but this condition is typically not associated with contact lens use. Herpes keratitis tends to recur, and while it can cause corneal ulcers, it is less common in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Oculomotor. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) controls most of the eye's movements, including the ability to look up, medially (towards the nose), and downward. It also controls the levator palpebrae (which lifts the eyelid) and the pupillary constrictor muscles. When the oculomotor nerve is affected, the eye often deviates laterally (due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus muscle, which is controlled by the abducens nerve) and downward (due to loss of control of the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles). The patient will also have difficulty looking upward or medially, as these movements require intact oculomotor nerve function. The incorrect options: A. Trochlear: The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) controls the superior oblique muscle, which helps the eye move downward and laterally. Damage to the trochlear nerve typically causes difficulty with downward and inward eye movement, often leading to vertical diplopia (double vision) when looking down, but it does not cause a lateral and downward deviation as seen with oculomotor nerve palsy. B. Trigeminal: The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) is responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions for mastication (chewing). It does not control eye movements and would not cause the symptoms described. D. Abducens: The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) controls the lateral rectus muscle, which moves the eye outward. Damage to the abducens nerve would result in an inability to move the eye laterally, causing medial deviation of the eye, rather than lateral and downward deviation.",

Right IR and Left SO: The right inferior rectus (IR) and left superior oblique (SO) do not function together for dextroelevation. The IR is involved in depression, not elevation, and the SO is involved in intorsion, not outward movement. C. Right SO and Left IR: The right superior oblique (SO) and left inferior rectus (IR) also do not work together for dextroelevation. The SO primarily causes intorsion, while the IR causes depression, both of which are not aligned with the upward and outward movement needed for dextroelevation. D. Right IO and Left SR: The right inferior oblique (IO) and left superior rectus (SR) do not work together for dextroelevation. The IO is involved in elevation, but it works with the opposite eye's superior rectus to produce elevation in the opposite direction. The SR in the left eye causes elevation in the opposite direction as well.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Squint The Hirschberg test is primarily used to detect squint (also known as strabismus). This test involves shining a light in the eyes and observing the reflection of the light off the corneas. In a normal eye, the light reflex is centered on the cornea, whereas in a person with squint, the reflex will be displaced. The degree and direction of this displacement help in assessing the type and magnitude of the squint. Incorrect Answers: B. Visual acuity: The Hirschberg test does not measure visual acuity, which refers to the sharpness or clarity of vision. Visual acuity is usually assessed using an eye chart, not the Hirschberg test. C. Retinal defect: The Hirschberg test does not detect retinal defects. Retinal issues are typically diagnosed through fundoscopy or specialized imaging techniques, not by observing the corneal light reflex. D. Optic neuritis: Optic neuritis, an inflammation of the optic nerve, is not diagnosed using the Hirschberg test. Diagnosis typically involves clinical assessment, visual field testing, and MRI, not a corneal light reflex evaluation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) SR and SO are abductors The superior rectus (SR) and superior oblique (SO) are not abductors. The SR is primarily an elevator and an intorter, while the SO is responsible for intorsion and depression. Neither of these muscles is primarily involved in abduction, which refers to the movement of the eye outward, away from the nose. Therefore, this combination is false. Incorrect Answers: A. SR and SO are intorters: This is correct. The superior rectus (SR) and superior oblique (SO) muscles both contribute to intorsion of the eye. The SR, when the eye is in a primary position, produces some intorsion, and the SO is a strong intorter. B. SR and IR are adductors: This is also correct. The superior rectus (SR) and inferior rectus (IR) muscles both assist in adduction, which is the movement of the eye toward the midline. The SR aids in adduction when the eye is elevated, while the IR assists in adduction when the eye is depressed. D. IR and IO are extorters: This is correct. The inferior rectus (IR) and inferior oblique (IO) are extorters, meaning they rotate the eye outward. The IR causes extorsion when the eye is in a downward position, and the IO causes extorsion when the eye is in an upward position.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Child has both increased AC/A and increased refraction for age In mixed-type accommodative esotropia, the child typically has both increased accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio and high refractive error for their age. This means that the child’s eyes converge excessively when accommodating, and they also have significant refractive error (commonly hyperopia) that exacerbates the esotropia, particularly when they try to focus on near objects. Incorrect Answers: A. Child has normal AC/A but high refractive error: This is incorrect because in mixed-type accommodative esotropia, the AC/A ratio is typically increased, not normal. The high refractive error contributes to the strabismus, but the AC/A ratio is part of the abnormal presentation. B. Child has abnormal AC/A ratio and normal refraction: This is incorrect because the child with mixed-type accommodative esotropia typically has high refractive error, not normal refraction. The abnormal AC/A ratio is present, but the refractive error also plays a significant role in the condition. D. None of the above: This is incorrect because C is the correct answer.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Phenylephrine Phenylephrine is not a cycloplegic. It is a sympathomimetic drug that works primarily as a mydriatic (pupil dilator) and vasoconstrictor, but it does not affect accommodation (the ability of the eye to focus on near objects). Cycloplegics, on the other hand, not only dilate the pupil but also paralyze the ciliary muscle, thus inhibiting accommodation. Incorrect Answers: B. Atropine: Atropine is a cycloplegic and a mydriatic. It works by inhibiting the action of acetylcholine on the ciliary muscle, causing paralysis of accommodation. C. Homatropine: Homatropine is a cycloplegic and mydriatic agent, though its effect is less potent than atropine. It works similarly by blocking the action of acetylcholine on the ciliary muscle, leading to cycloplegia. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hering’s law Hering’s law of equal innervation states that when one eye moves in a certain direction, the opposite eye receives equal innervation in the same direction. In the context of secondary deviation, this law applies because when there is an abnormal movement in one eye (such as due to a paralytic strabismus), the secondary deviation occurs in the opposite eye due to the unequal muscle forces in both eyes. Incorrect Answers: A. Donders law: Donders' law applies to the movement of the eye in three-dimensional space and states that the eye’s position is determined by two components: the horizontal and vertical positions of the eye. This law primarily addresses the mechanics of eye rotation, not the concept of secondary deviation. B. Listing law: Listing's law describes the three-dimensional rotation of the eye. It states that the eye's rotation occurs around an axis in a plane that is parallel to the horizontal plane. It is relevant to eye movements, but it is not related to secondary deviation, which concerns muscle imbalance. D. Sherrington’s law: Sherrington’s law is related to reciprocal innervation, which explains that when one muscle contracts, its antagonist relaxes. This is not directly related to secondary deviation, which deals with the effects of muscle imbalance and equal innervation as described by Hering's law.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Keratometer The keratometer is based on the principle of first Purkinje images. These images are reflections from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea, and the keratometer uses the reflection of light from the corneal surface (specifically the first Purkinje image, which is the reflection from the corneal anterior surface) to measure the curvature of the cornea. This measurement is essential in determining the refractive power of the cornea, which is crucial for fitting contact lenses and for assessing astigmatism. Incorrect Answers: A. Retinoscope: A retinoscope is used to examine the refractive status of the eye by observing the reflection of light from the retina. It does not rely on the first Purkinje image but rather on the reflex from the retina to estimate the refractive error of the eye. B. Slit lamp: The slit lamp is used to examine the anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, lens, and iris. It is not based on the first Purkinje images but on a light beam that can be adjusted into a slit, allowing for detailed observation of eye structures. C. Cross-Cylinder: The cross-cylinder is used in refraction to assess astigmatism by introducing cylindrical lenses in different orientations. It does not rely on the principle of the first Purkinje image but rather on direct optical manipulation to evaluate how the eye responds to different cylindrical powers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tropicamide Tropicamide is the most rapidly acting cycloplegic among the options. It typically produces full cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) and mydriasis (pupil dilation) within 20 to 30 minutes of application, making it the fastest in terms of onset. It is commonly used for routine eye examinations, particularly for pupil dilation, as it acts quickly and has a relatively short duration of action (4-6 hours). Incorrect Answers: A. Atropine: Atropine is a very potent and long-acting cycloplegic, but it has a much slower onset compared to tropicamide. It can take up to 30 to 60 minutes to achieve full cycloplegia and lasts for several days (up to a week). C. Homatropine: Homatropine acts more slowly than tropicamide but is faster than atropine. Its onset is typically around 30 to 60 minutes, and it has a shorter duration of action compared to atropine. D. Cyclopentolate: Cyclopentolate is a moderately fast-acting cycloplegic, with an onset of action around 20 to 30 minutes, similar to tropicamide. However, tropicamide is generally preferred for its faster action in routine procedures.",

It consists of a series of fused cylindrical lenses that are aligned in such a way that they create a line or streak of light. This tool is typically used in tests like the Maddox rod test, where it helps to determine the presence and type of eye misalignment (such as in cases of heterophoria or strabismus). Incorrect Answers: B. Series of fused prisms of increasing length: This description does not match the Maddox rod. The Maddox rod uses cylindrical lenses, not prisms, and it does not involve a series of prisms of increasing length. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Indirect ophthalmoscopy The patient is reporting floating opacities and decreased vision, which are symptoms suggestive of vitreous changes, such as vitreous floaters or potentially a retinal condition. Indirect ophthalmoscopy is the best investigation in this case, as it allows for a detailed examination of the posterior segment, including the retina, vitreous, and optic nerve. This would help in assessing any retinal pathology (like a retinal tear, detachment, or hemorrhage) that might be contributing to the visual symptoms. Incorrect Answers: A. Retinoscopy: Retinoscopy is typically used for determining refractive error and would not be useful for evaluating the patient's reported symptoms of floaters and decreased vision. The issue seems to be more related to the retina or vitreous, not refraction. B. Refraction: Refraction measures the refractive error of the eye, which is already known in this patient (-6D and -8D). While refraction can help in vision correction, it is not useful in diagnosing retinal or vitreous issues. D. Distant direct ophthalmoscopy: Direct ophthalmoscopy provides a limited view of the retina and is generally used for a basic, more superficial examination. Indirect ophthalmoscopy is preferred in this case as it offers a wider and more detailed view, especially when evaluating the vitreous and retina for potential pathology",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 2D When performing retinoscopy at a closer distance, such as 50 cm, the correction factor used for prescription changes because the distance is shorter than the standard 1 meter. The retinoscopy correction factor at 1 meter is typically 1D, and when the retinoscopy is done at 50 cm, the correction factor doubles. This happens because the vergence of light is more converged at a shorter distance, which results in the need for a higher corrective value when converting to the prescription. For a 50 cm distance, the correction factor becomes 2D because the effective distance is half of the standard 1-meter distance. Incorrect Answers: B. 1D: This is the standard correction factor when retinoscopy is done at 1 meter, not at a closer distance like 50 cm. C. 1.5D: This is not correct, as the factor for 50 cm is 2D, not an intermediate value.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Periphery of the lens magnifying more than the centre of the lens Pincushion distortion occurs when the periphery of the lens magnifies more than the center, which is common in aphakic glasses (lenses used after cataract surgery when the natural lens of the eye is removed). The lens curvature in aphakic glasses is often more pronounced at the periphery, leading to the magnification being greater towards the edges than at the center. This distortion causes straight lines to appear curved inward, resembling the shape of a pincushion. Incorrect Answers: B. Centre of the lens magnifying more than the periphery of the lens: This is incorrect because the center of the lens does not typically magnify more than the periphery in the case of pincushion distortion. This would result in barrel distortion, not pincushion distortion. C. Thickness of the lens: While the thickness of the lens affects magnification, the primary cause of pincushion distortion is the variation in magnification across the lens, with the periphery magnifying more than the center. Thickness alone is not the main factor for this type of distortion. D. Size of the lens: The size of the lens affects the field of view, but it does not directly cause pincushion distortion. The distortion is due to the lens's optical properties, not its physical size.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Convergent squint Miotics are drugs that constrict the pupil by stimulating the muscarinic receptors in the eye, typically causing the sphincter pupillae muscle to contract. These medications are most commonly used in convergent squint (esotropia). In convergent squint, where the eyes are misaligned inward, miotics help by causing pupil constriction, which indirectly aids in the alignment of the eyes by enhancing convergence through the accommodation reflex. This can improve binocular function and reduce the inward deviation. Incorrect Answers: A. Divergent squint: Miotics are not used for divergent squint (exotropia), where the eyes are misaligned outward. The treatment for divergent squint usually involves other strategies, such as prisms or surgery, rather than miotics. C. Paralytic squint: Miotics are not typically used for paralytic squint, which is caused by a weakness or paralysis of the eye muscles. The treatment for paralytic squint often focuses on addressing the underlying nerve or muscle problem. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) With the rule astigmatism & vertical meridian steeper. In the given keratometry data: The vertical meridian has a diopteric power of 45D and a radius of curvature of 6.25mm. The horizontal meridian has a diopteric power of 41D and a radius of curvature of 7.00mm. The relationship between diopteric power and radius of curvature is inverse; a steeper cornea (shorter radius) corresponds to a higher diopteric power. Since the vertical meridian has a higher diopteric power (45D) and a shorter radius (6.25mm) compared to the horizontal meridian (41D, 7.00mm), it is the steeper of the two meridians. This indicates with the rule astigmatism, where the vertical meridian is steeper than the horizontal meridian. Incorrect Options: B. Against the rule astigmatism, vertical meridian steeper: This option is incorrect because in against the rule astigmatism, the horizontal meridian is steeper than the vertical meridian. In the given case, the vertical meridian is steeper, so this is not a correct description of the astigmatism. C. Against the rule astigmatism, horizontal meridian steeper: This option would be correct if the horizontal meridian had a higher diopteric power and a shorter radius than the vertical meridian. However, in this case, the vertical meridian is steeper (more curved, with higher diopteric power), making this option incorrect. D. With the rule astigmatism & horizontal meridian steeper: This option contradicts the data provided, as the vertical meridian is steeper, not the horizontal one. With the rule astigmatism involves the vertical meridian being steeper than the horizontal meridian, making this answer incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Uncontrolled diabetic state In an uncontrolled diabetic state, particularly when blood sugar levels fluctuate widely, the lens of the eye undergoes changes in hydration, leading to changes in its refractive index. This results in a constantly changing refractive error. Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) causes the lens to swell and change shape, altering the focusing power of the eye. This is a typical feature seen in diabetic patients who do not have their blood sugar levels under control. The refractive error can fluctuate, leading to changes in vision, often improving with a reduction in blood glucose levels, but can worsen again if blood glucose levels rise. Incorrect Options: B. Traumatic cataract: A traumatic cataract results from physical injury to the eye, leading to clouding of the lens. While it can cause a change in vision, it does not typically result in constantly changing refractive error. The refractive error due to cataracts is usually progressive (i.e., it worsens over time) but does not fluctuate in the way it does in uncontrolled diabetes. C. Corneal opacity: Corneal opacity (scarring of the cornea) can result in reduced vision and may lead to astigmatism or other refractive errors, but it does not usually cause constantly changing refractive error. The refractive error in cases of corneal opacity is typically stable unless there is significant swelling or other secondary changes, which are less common than in an uncontrolled diabetic state. D. Central serous retinopathy: Central serous retinopathy (CSR) is a condition involving fluid accumulation under the retina, leading to vision changes like blurred central vision. However, CSR does not cause a constantly changing refractive error. The refractive error in CSR is more likely related to retinal edema and visual distortion rather than fluctuations in the eye's focusing power.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Myopia (nearsightedness) is the most probable cause in a child who is having difficulty seeing the blackboard at school and is frequently squeezing or squinting his eyes. In myopia, distant objects appear blurry because the image is focused in front of the retina rather than directly on it. This is typically due to an eyeball that is too long or a cornea that is too curved. Children with myopia can usually see nearby objects clearly (like reading a book), but struggle with far vision tasks such as reading from the blackboard. Squinting is a common behavior in myopic individuals because it reduces the size of the blurred image on the retina, temporarily improving clarity. Since these signs are classic and commonly observed in school-aged children, myopia is the most likely diagnosis in this scenario. Incorrect Options: a. Hypermetropia: Also known as farsightedness, hypermetropia causes difficulty with near vision, not distant vision. Children with hypermetropia may complain of eye strain, headaches, or difficulty reading up close, but they generally see distant objects like a blackboard clearly, especially if the condition is mild and the eye's accommodation compensates. c. Presbyopia: Presbyopia is an age-related condition caused by the loss of elasticity of the lens, usually occurring after the age of 40. It leads to difficulty focusing on close objects. Since the case describes a child, presbyopia is not a possible diagnosis here. d. Astigmatism: Astigmatism occurs when the cornea or lens has an irregular shape, causing blurry or distorted vision at all distances. While it can cause squinting and visual discomfort, it does not specifically cause difficulty only with distant vision like the blackboard. Also, the symptom of squeezing eyes to see far is more specifically associated with myopia than astigmatism.",
