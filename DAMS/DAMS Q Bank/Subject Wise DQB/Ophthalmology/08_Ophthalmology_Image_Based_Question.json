      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Human papilloma virus (HPV) Human papillomavirus (HPV) is commonly associated with the development of cutaneous lesions such as warts. These warts can appear on various parts of the body, including the eyelids, and are typically flesh-colored, raised, and may have a rough surface. HPV is the virus responsible for causing warts and some lesions seen in the skin and mucous membranes. It is particularly associated with verrucous lesions on the skin, including verruca vulgaris and condyloma acuminata. Incorrect Options: A. Molluscum contagiosum virus: Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus that causes pearl-like, dome-shaped lesions with a central depression (umbilication) and is typically seen in children or immunocompromised patients. While it can affect the eyelids and skin, the lesions are distinctively different from those caused by HPV. B. HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus): Herpes simplex virus can cause herpetic lesions on the skin and mucous membranes, including around the eyes (e.g., herpes keratitis or cold sores). The lesions caused by HSV typically appear as painful, fluid-filled blisters rather than the wart-like growths associated with HPV. C. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): Epstein-Barr virus is most commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis and certain cancers like Burkitt's lymphoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma, rather than skin lesions like warts. While EBV can cause oral and other mucosal lesions, it is not typically responsible for the warts seen with HPV.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The least helpful blood test in this case is C. HIV antibodies. The patient's symptoms, including peripheral corneal stromal thinning, fluorescein pooling, and corneal neovascularization, are more suggestive of conditions that involve autoimmune processes or infectious causes that can affect the cornea. HIV itself does not commonly cause such corneal findings, and while HIV may cause ocular complications (e.g., retinitis, keratitis), HIV antibodies are not directly useful for investigating the cause of corneal stromal thinning in this patient. Therefore, this blood test is least relevant in this case. Reasons for the Incorrect Options: A. Purified protein derivative skin test (PPD test): The PPD test is used to check for tuberculosis (TB) exposure, which can lead to corneal involvement, including ulceration, stromal thinning, and neovascularization. Given the patient’s Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, where TB is more prevalent, the PPD test is highly relevant. If the patient is found to have TB, it could explain the corneal symptoms, making this test useful. B. Rheumatoid factor: The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is associated with rheumatoid scleritis, a condition that can cause corneal neovascularization and stromal thinning. Considering the patient's age and the potential for autoimmune causes of her symptoms, testing for rheumatoid factor is relevant and can help rule out or confirm a rheumatoid etiology for the corneal findings. D. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA): ANCA testing is used to diagnose granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis), an autoimmune condition that can cause corneal thinning and neovascularization due to systemic vasculitis. Given the patient’s corneal symptoms and the possibility of an autoimmune vasculitic process, this test is appropriate for exploring this diagnosis.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dendrites can be seen This 30-year-old female presents with sudden painful vision loss and has a history of contact lens use. She also describes washing the contact lens with tap water before reusing it, which is a known risk factor for Acanthamoeba keratitis, a severe and painful corneal infection. Acanthamoeba keratitis is often caused by the use of contaminated water on contact lenses, and the condition can cause severe pain and vision loss that is often out of proportion to the signs seen on the cornea. One of the key features of Acanthamoeba keratitis is the presence of painful corneal ulcers and stromal infiltrates, which can lead to vision loss. The classic dendritic pattern seen in herpes simplex keratitis (HSK), which features branching lesions with terminal bulbs, is not typical of Acanthamoeba keratitis, so the statement \"dendrites can be seen\" is false in this case. Incorrect Options: A. Symptom > signs: In Acanthamoeba keratitis, the pain often significantly outweighs the signs seen on the cornea. This condition is known for causing severe pain, which can be much more intense than what would be expected from the corneal findings. This is characteristic of Acanthamoeba keratitis, so the statement is true. C. Culture medium is non-nutrient E. coli: To diagnose Acanthamoeba keratitis, a culture of the corneal scraping is often performed, and non-nutrient agar with E. coli is the preferred medium for Acanthamoeba culture. E. coli serves as food for Acanthamoeba, making it suitable for growing the organism. This is a true statement. D. PHMB is preferred drug: The treatment for Acanthamoeba keratitis involves the use of antiseptics like Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), which is one of the most effective drugs for treating Acanthamoeba infections. PHMB is commonly used in the management of this condition, so the statement is true.",

Here's how hypertensive retinopathy is graded: • Grade 1: Arteriolar narrowing and increased arteriovenous (AV) ratio, but no obvious retinal changes. • Grade 2: Arteriolar narrowing with increased AV nicking (where veins are compressed by arteries). • Grade 3: Flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and exudates are seen in addition to arteriolar narrowing and AV nicking. • Grade 4: In Grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy, in addition to flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and exudates, there is also optic disc edema (papilledema). The key findings in this patient: • Flame-shaped hemorrhages: These are typically seen in more advanced stages of hypertensive retinopathy and reflect damage to the superficial retinal layers. • Cotton wool spots: These are indicative of retinal ischemia and poor blood flow, commonly seen in Grade 3 or higher hypertensive retinopathy. • Disc edema (papilledema): This is a hallmark of Grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy and indicates increased intracranial pressure or severe retinal involvement due to high blood pressure.",
