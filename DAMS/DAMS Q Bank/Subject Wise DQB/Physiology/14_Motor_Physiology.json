      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Are proportional to the amount of transmitter released by the presynaptic neuron. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are graded potentials that occur when excitatory neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to the opening of ligand-gated ion channels. This results in the influx of positive ions (like sodium) into the postsynaptic cell, causing depolarization. The magnitude of an EPSP is directly proportional to the amount of neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic neuron. If more neurotransmitter is released, a greater number of ligand-gated ion channels are activated, resulting in a larger EPSP. This property makes EPSPs graded, meaning they vary in size depending on the strength of the stimulus. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Are self-propagating: This is incorrect because EPSPs are not self-propagating like action potentials. EPSPs are localized changes in membrane potential that diminish as they spread across the membrane (they exhibit decremental conduction). They do not travel over long distances unless they summate at the axon hillock to trigger an action potential. B. Show all-or-none response: This is incorrect because EPSPs do not follow the all-or-none principle. Unlike action potentials, which occur only when the threshold is reached, EPSPs are graded responses. Their amplitude depends on the strength of the stimulus (i.e., the amount of neurotransmitter released), not an all-or-none phenomenon. D. Are inhibitory at presynaptic terminal: This is incorrect because EPSPs are excitatory in nature, as the name suggests. They lead to depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, making it more likely for the neuron to reach the threshold and fire an action potential. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), on the other hand, hyperpolarize the membrane and decrease the likelihood of firing an action potential.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Gamma. Gamma motor neurons specifically innervate the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindle, which are specialized sensory structures within the skeletal muscles. These intrafusal fibers play a critical role in detecting changes in muscle length and tension, contributing to proprioception and the stretch reflex. Gamma motor neurons regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindle by controlling the contraction of the intrafusal fibers, ensuring the spindle remains taut even when the muscle is shortened. This allows the muscle spindle to detect and respond to changes in muscle stretch under varying conditions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Alpha: This is incorrect because alpha motor neurons innervate the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscles, which are responsible for generating force and causing muscle contraction. While alpha motor neurons are essential for voluntary and reflexive movements, they do not innervate intrafusal fibers. B. Beta: This is incorrect because beta motor neurons innervate both extrafusal and intrafusal fibers. However, they are less common compared to alpha and gamma motor neurons. The question specifically asks for the type of motor neuron that innervates only the intrafusal fibers, which is the role of gamma motor neurons. D. Delta: This is incorrect because delta motor neurons do not exist as a classification for skeletal muscle innervation. Delta fibers are typically associated with small-diameter sensory fibers that conduct pain and temperature sensations, not motor functions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The muscle spindle is not a receptor for tension, which makes this the correct answer in a question asking for \"All Except.\" Muscle spindles are stretch receptors found within the belly of skeletal muscles. Their main role is to detect changes in the length of the muscle and the rate at which the length is changing. When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle is activated and sends afferent signals to the spinal cord, triggering a reflex contraction to resist the stretch — this is known as the stretch reflex. This mechanism plays a vital role in maintaining muscle tone, balance, and posture. However, muscle spindles do not monitor the force or tension generated during muscle contraction. That function belongs to a different receptor, the Golgi tendon organ, which is why tension is not sensed by muscle spindles. Option B: Length This option is incorrect because muscle spindles are specifically designed to detect changes in muscle length. They are activated when a muscle is stretched, and their afferent fibers send signals that reflect the degree of muscle elongation. This helps the body monitor and adjust muscle activity, particularly during fine motor tasks and posture maintenance. Since sensing length is one of the primary functions of the muscle spindle, this option is not the correct answer to an \"All Except\" question. Option C: Proprioception This option is also incorrect because muscle spindles play an important role in proprioception, which is the body’s ability to perceive its own position and movement in space. The information gathered by muscle spindles about muscle stretch and length changes contributes significantly to proprioceptive feedback. This input allows the central nervous system to coordinate movement and maintain balance. Since muscle spindles are key players in proprioception, this option is not the right answer. Option D: Stretch This is an incorrect choice because the main function of muscle spindles is to detect muscle stretch. When a muscle is passively or actively stretched, the intrafusal fibers inside the spindle respond by sending signals to the spinal cord. This leads to activation of alpha motor neurons that cause the muscle to contract — a protective mechanism against overstretching. Therefore, muscle spindles are directly responsible for sensing stretch, making this option incorrect in the context of an \"All Except\" question.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stretch reflex. The stretch reflex is the basic postural reflex that helps maintain posture and balance. It is initiated when a muscle is stretched, causing a reflex contraction to resist further stretching and maintain the muscle's length. This reflex plays a key role in stabilizing the body against external forces and adjusting posture automatically without conscious effort. A. Crossed extensor reflex: The crossed extensor reflex is a more complex reflex that occurs in response to a painful stimulus, leading to withdrawal of the affected limb and extension of the opposite limb for support. While it is important for protective movements, it is not the basic reflex responsible for maintaining posture. B. Golgi tendon reflex: The Golgi tendon reflex helps to prevent muscle damage from excessive tension by inhibiting muscle contraction when the tension becomes too high. While important for muscle safety, it is not a primary reflex for posture maintenance like the stretch reflex. D. Positive supporting reflex: The positive supporting reflex involves the automatic extension of the lower limbs when a weight-bearing surface is placed under the feet. Although important for posture and standing, it is more specialized and less fundamental than the stretch reflex in maintaining posture.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Rapid shallow breathing. Gamma efferent discharge is primarily involved in regulating muscle spindle sensitivity, which helps in fine motor control and maintaining muscle tone. However, rapid shallow breathing is not typically associated with increased gamma efferent discharge. Rapid shallow breathing is more related to the activation of the respiratory centers in the brainstem and is influenced by factors like anxiety or metabolic changes, rather than direct modulation of gamma motor activity. A. Jendrassik’s maneuver: The Jendrassik maneuver, which involves the reinforcement of a deep tendon reflex by having the patient interlock their fingers and pull them apart while the reflex is tested, increases gamma efferent discharge. This enhances the sensitivity of muscle spindles, making the reflex more pronounced. B. Anxiety: Anxiety can increase gamma efferent discharge as part of the body's stress response. Increased gamma activity contributes to heightened muscle tone and tension, which is commonly seen in anxious states as part of the \"fight or flight\" response. D. Stimulation of skin: Stimulation of the skin, especially in the context of reflex responses or proprioceptive feedback, can lead to increased gamma efferent discharge. This helps to maintain proper muscle tone and posture in response to sensory input.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. The gamma efferent neuron plays a crucial role in modulating the sensitivity of muscle spindles. It innervates intrafusal fibers (the muscle fibers within the spindle), which are responsible for detecting changes in muscle length and tension. Gamma motor neurons have a smaller diameter than alpha motor neurons and are involved in adjusting the sensitivity of the muscle spindle. They help to fine-tune muscle tone and facilitate proprioception, which is critical for smooth and coordinated movement. A. An ‘A’ group motor neuron with a smaller diameter than that of alpha efferent neurons: Gamma efferent neurons belong to the 'A' group of motor neurons but have a smaller diameter compared to alpha efferent neurons. The smaller diameter results in slower conduction velocities compared to alpha neurons. B. Innervates intrafusal fibres: This is correct. Gamma motor neurons specifically innervate the intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles, which are specialized muscle fibers that detect changes in muscle length and tension. C. Innervates muscle fibres that stretch annulospiral endings: This is also correct. The intrafusal fibers have sensory endings called annulospiral endings, which are sensitive to stretch.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Receptor for stretch receptor reflex. The muscle spindle is a specialized sensory receptor that detects changes in muscle length and is primarily responsible for the stretch reflex. When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle is activated, leading to a reflexive contraction of the muscle to resist further stretching. This reflex is important for maintaining posture and balance, and it helps protect the muscle from overstretching. A. Receptor for a variety of multisynaptic reflexes: While muscle spindles are involved in the stretch reflex, they are not typically involved in multisynaptic reflexes. The stretch reflex is a monosynaptic reflex, meaning it involves only one synapse between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron. Other multisynaptic reflexes involve different pathways and structures, such as the withdrawal reflex. C. Occurs only in antigravity extensor muscles: Muscle spindles are found in many muscles, not just in antigravity extensor muscles. While they are especially important in muscles that maintain posture and balance (like extensor muscles), they are present in both flexor and extensor muscles throughout the body. D. Excited by both stretch and contraction of the muscles in which it is located: The muscle spindle is primarily excited by stretch, not contraction. When the muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers of the spindle are also stretched, which activates the spindle and triggers the stretch reflex. Contraction of the muscle does not activate the muscle spindle in the same way, though the gamma motor neurons can adjust the sensitivity of the spindle during contraction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Spinal cord. The stretch reflex is a monosynaptic reflex that occurs at the level of the spinal cord. It involves the direct communication between a sensory neuron (from the muscle spindle) and a motor neuron that causes the muscle to contract in response to stretching. The spinal cord is the primary site where this reflex is integrated, and no higher brain involvement is required for its execution. A. Cerebral cortex: The cerebral cortex is involved in higher-order motor control, voluntary movements, and conscious perception of sensations, but the stretch reflex itself does not require cortical input. It operates at the spinal cord level without conscious awareness or cortical involvement. B. Medulla: The medulla is part of the brainstem and plays a role in regulating vital functions like breathing and heart rate, but it is not the primary site for the integration of the stretch reflex. Reflexes such as the stretch reflex occur lower in the nervous system, specifically in the spinal cord. C. Lower medulla: While the lower medulla does play a role in some reflexes, particularly autonomic reflexes, the stretch reflex is specifically integrated at the spinal cord level. The lower medulla is more involved in controlling functions such as respiration and blood pressure rather than somatic reflexes like the stretch reflex.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Withdrawal reflex. The crossed extensor reflex is a type of withdrawal reflex that helps protect the body from harmful stimuli. When a painful stimulus is applied to one limb, the body will not only withdraw the affected limb away from the stimulus (through flexion) but will also extend the opposite limb to maintain balance and support the body. This reflex involves both sides of the body (crossed), as the flexion of the injured side is paired with the extension of the opposite side. B. Postural reflex: While the crossed extensor reflex does play a role in maintaining balance, it is not classified as a postural reflex. Postural reflexes primarily help maintain body posture and stability without necessarily being triggered by noxious stimuli, unlike the crossed extensor reflex, which is a protective withdrawal mechanism in response to pain. C. Monosynaptic reflex: The crossed extensor reflex is not a monosynaptic reflex because it involves multiple synapses. The withdrawal reflex involves the activation of sensory neurons that synapse in the spinal cord with interneurons, which then activate motor neurons. This process involves at least one interneuron, making it a polysynaptic reflex, not monosynaptic. D. Sympathetic: The crossed extensor reflex is not a sympathetic reflex. The sympathetic nervous system is primarily involved in the \"fight or flight\" response, regulating functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. The crossed extensor reflex is mediated by the spinal cord and does not involve the autonomic sympathetic pathways.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pyramidal cells. Upper motor neurons (UMNs) include pyramidal cells, which are large neurons located in the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) of the cerebral cortex. These neurons are responsible for initiating voluntary motor movements. Their axons form the corticospinal tract, which travels down to the spinal cord and synapses with lower motor neurons (LMNs) in the spinal cord or brainstem, thereby transmitting motor commands to the muscles. B. Peripheral nerves: Peripheral nerves are composed of lower motor neurons (LMNs), not upper motor neurons. LMNs are the final pathway through which motor signals reach muscles, while UMNs send signals to LMNs. Therefore, peripheral nerves do not consist of UMNs. C. Anterior horn cells: Anterior horn cells are lower motor neurons located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. They directly innervate muscles and are part of the pathway that transmits motor commands from the central nervous system (CNS) to the muscles. Since these cells are lower motor neurons, they are not classified as UMNs. D. Glial cells: Glial cells are non-neuronal cells in the CNS that support and protect neurons. They do not transmit motor signals. While glial cells play important roles in maintaining the function of neurons, they are not involved in motor pathways like UMNs. Therefore, they are not classified as UMNs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Senses muscle tension. The Golgi tendon organ (GTO) is a sensory receptor located at the junction between muscles and tendons. Its primary function is to monitor the tension or force generated by muscle contraction. When the muscle contracts and generates tension, the Golgi tendon organ becomes activated, providing feedback to the central nervous system to help prevent damage due to excessive force by triggering a protective reflex. This process is part of the autogenic inhibition reflex, which helps regulate muscle tension by causing muscle relaxation when excessive force is detected. Incorrect options: A. Senses dynamic length of muscle: This is incorrect because the Golgi tendon organ does not measure muscle length. The muscle spindle is the receptor responsible for sensing muscle length and changes in length (static and dynamic). The muscle spindle monitors the stretch and length of the muscle, whereas the Golgi tendon organ focuses on the tension within the muscle. B. Involved in reciprocal innervation: This is incorrect because reciprocal innervation involves the coordination between agonist and antagonist muscles, typically regulated by muscle spindles and stretch reflexes. The Golgi tendon organ, on the other hand, plays a role in autogenic inhibition, not reciprocal innervation. It inhibits the contracting muscle to prevent excessive tension but does not directly mediate the relaxation of antagonistic muscles as in reciprocal inhibition. C. motor neuron stimulation: This is incorrect and incomplete. The Golgi tendon organ does not directly stimulate ?-motor neurons. Instead, it influences the alpha motor neurons through feedback mechanisms. The GTO's primary role is to protect the muscle from excessive tension, and it does this by inhibiting the activity of the alpha motor neurons through the autogenic inhibition reflex.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Smoothens and coordinates movement. The spinocerebellar tract is a pathway that carries proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebellum, which plays a critical role in the smooth coordination and fine-tuning of voluntary movements. This tract helps the cerebellum to adjust and regulate muscle activity for precise, coordinated movement. Incorrect options: A. Equilibrium: This is incorrect because equilibrium is primarily regulated by the vestibulocerebellar pathway, which deals with balance and the sense of spatial orientation. While the spinocerebellar tract contributes to motor control, it does not directly govern equilibrium. C. Learning induced by change in vestibulo-ocular reflex: This function is more closely associated with the vestibular system and the vestibulocerebellar pathway, not the spinocerebellar tract. The vestibulo-ocular reflex helps stabilize vision during head movements, and while the cerebellum is involved in adjusting this reflex, the spinocerebellar tract is not directly responsible for this learning process. D. Planning and programming: This function is mainly attributed to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and the corticospinal tract. The spinocerebellar tract is involved in coordinating movement rather than planning or programming it. The cerebellum helps fine-tune and smooth movements but is not responsible for planning or initiating motor actions.",

Muscle spindles are specialized sensory receptors located within skeletal muscles that detect changes in muscle length and the rate of change. When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle detects the stretch and sends a signal to the spinal cord, which immediately sends a signal back to the muscle to contract, counteracting the stretch and maintaining muscle tone. Incorrect options: A.

It is not directly responsible for the myotactic reflex, which involves muscle length detection. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A fibers are more sensitive to pressure than C fibers. Explanation: In the scenario described, Rakesh experiences motor paralysis in his arm without loss of pain sensation after sleeping with his arm under his head. This suggests that the motor fibers (which are primarily A fibers) are more susceptible to pressure-induced impairment than the sensory fibers (which include C fibers). A fibers, being larger and more myelinated, are more sensitive to mechanical compression, leading to transient motor deficits without affecting pain sensation. Incorrect options: A. A fibers are more susceptible to hypoxia than B fibers: While A fibers are large and myelinated, B fibers are smaller and less myelinated. B fibers are more susceptible to hypoxia due to their smaller size and less efficient oxygen diffusion. MCQMATE C. C fibers are more sensitive to pressure than A fibers: C fibers are unmyelinated and smaller in diameter compared to A fibers. They are less sensitive to pressure and more susceptible to chemical and thermal stimuli. D. Motor nerves are more affected by sleep than sensory nerves: This statement is not accurate. Both motor and sensory nerves can be affected by external pressure during sleep, but the degree of impairment depends on the type of nerve fibers and the nature of the pressure applied.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) This patient's right-sided dysmetria and dysrhythmia is suggestive of a right-sided lateral and intermediate cerebellar hemispheric stroke. Purkinje fibers from these cerebellar regions project into the dentate and interposed (eboliform and globose) deep cerebellar nuclei. The cerebellum can be divided into three functional components: the lateral hemisphere, intermediate hemisphere, and vermis. The lateral cerebellar hemisphere plays a role in motor planning of the extremities (which projects to the dentate nucleus), the intermediate hemisphere plays a role in coordinating the distal limbs (which projects to the interposed nucleus), and the vermis plays a role in coordinating the proximal limbs and trunk (which projects to the fastigial nucleus). Therefore, a cerebellar lesion lateral to the vermis will result in appendicular ataxia, and a lesion in the vermis will result in truncal ataxia. The vestibular nucleus influences vestibulo-ocular control, which does not explain what was found on physical exam.",

      "text": "A 74-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because of a tremor that he has developed over the last several months. He says that the tremor is worst when he is resting but becomes better when he engages in movements such as picking up the remote for his TV. His wife also says that his movements have become slower over the last few months. Physical exam reveals increased resistance to passive motion of his extremities. Gait exam also shows trouble with starting movement and short, shuffling steps. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms involve the degeneration of a certain subset of neurons. When the substance released by these neurons interact with a G-alpha-s coupled receptor, which of the following effects occurs?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) This patient with resting tremor, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity most likely has Parkinson disease with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. When dopamine interacts with D1 receptors, the globus pallidus internus is inhibited. Dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta produce dopamine, which is important in the regulation of the basal ganglia. Importantly, dopamine can bind to D1 receptors located on neurons of the direct pathway, or D2 receptors located on neurons of the indirect pathway. The direct pathway D1 receptors are coupled to a G-alpha-s second messenger pathway and are activated by dopamine binding. Increased activity of these direct pathway neurons are responsible for inhibiting the globus pallidus internus. Inhibition of the globus pallidus externus is the effect of the indirect dopamine pathway, but these neurons have G-alpha-i coupled D2 receptors. Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus occurs because its inhibitor is inhibited; however, these interactions are part of the indirect pathway.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The patient in the question likely has a B12 deficiency leading to demyelination of her posterior columns. Her clinical picture shows loss of vibration and proprioception in her feet, which corresponds to the fasciculus gracilis. The sensations of vibration and proprioception are carried by the dorsal columns, which include the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus. The fasciculus gracilis carries sensations from the lower body and lower extremity to synapse in the ipsilateral medulla and cross in the arcuate fibers to become the contralateral medial lemniscus. The fasiculus cuneatus carries sensations from the upper body and extremities to synapse in the ipsilateral medulla and cross to become the contralateral medial lemniscus. Of note, because B12 is typically obtained from animal products, vegans of many years run the risk of acquiring a B12 deficiency.",
