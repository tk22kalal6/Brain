      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Free nerve endings. Free nerve endings are the primary receptors for pain. They are widely distributed throughout the body, especially in tissues like the skin, mucous membranes, and organs. These nerve endings respond to noxious stimuli (such as extreme heat, pressure, or chemical damage) and transmit pain signals to the brain. They are not specialized like other sensory receptors, but they are highly sensitive to harmful stimuli and play a crucial role in the sensation of pain. A. Ruffini organs: Ruffini organs are mechanoreceptors responsible for detecting stretch and pressure, particularly in the skin and joints. They are not involved in pain perception but rather contribute to the sensation of sustained pressure and stretch. B. Meckel’s bodies: Meckel’s bodies, also known as tactile corpuscles, are specialized sensory receptors found in the skin that detect light touch and pressure. They are not involved in pain sensation, which is handled by free nerve endings. C. Golgi bodies: Golgi bodies (or Golgi tendon organs) are found in tendons and are responsible for sensing tension or stretch in muscles and tendons. Their primary function is proprioception and preventing muscle damage from excessive force, not pain sensation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Spinal cord. The first relay station for pain is the spinal cord, specifically in the dorsal horn. When pain signals are generated by nociceptors (pain receptors) in response to harmful stimuli, these signals travel through afferent nerves to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, the signals are processed and relayed to higher centers, such as the brainstem and thalamus, for further processing. The spinal cord plays a critical role in transmitting and modulating pain information. B. Medulla: The medulla is involved in autonomic functions and some sensory processing, but it is not the first relay station for pain. Pain signals are relayed from the spinal cord to the brainstem and then to the thalamus for higher processing. C. Pons: The pons is another part of the brainstem that helps relay signals, including some sensory information, but it is not the primary relay station for pain. The first major relay for pain occurs in the spinal cord, which then sends signals to higher regions. D. Thalamus: The thalamus is a crucial sensory relay center in the brain, including for pain, but it is not the first relay station. Pain signals first arrive in the spinal cord and then travel to the thalamus, which further processes and sends them to the appropriate cortical regions for conscious perception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ventral spinothalamic tract. The ventral spinothalamic tract is responsible for transmitting crude touch sensations, which are less refined than fine touch and include sensations like the ability to sense the presence of an object without precise localization. This tract carries these sensations from the spinal cord to the thalamus, where they are processed before being sent to the sensory cortex for further interpretation. A. Lateral spinothalamic tract: The lateral spinothalamic tract is responsible for carrying pain and temperature sensations, not crude touch. It transmits information about noxious stimuli and thermal changes from the body to the brain. C. Posterior columns: The posterior columns are responsible for transmitting fine touch, proprioception, and vibration sensations, not crude touch. They carry more detailed and precise sensory information from the body to the brain, such as the ability to detect exact positions or subtle textures. D. Pyramidal tracts: The pyramidal tracts are involved in the voluntary control of movement and carry motor information from the brain to the spinal cord.

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Frequency of action potential. The intensity of sensory stimuli is determined by the frequency of action potentials fired by sensory neurons. A stronger or more intense stimulus causes a higher frequency of action potentials, which is interpreted by the brain as a stronger sensation. This mechanism is known as frequency coding, where the brain differentiates the strength of stimuli based on how rapidly action potentials are generated. A. Duration of latent period: The latent period is the time between the application of a stimulus and the response, but it is not directly related to the intensity of the stimulus. The latent period may vary depending on the type of stimulus or receptor but does not determine the perceived intensity. B. Amplitude of action potential: The amplitude of an action potential is typically fixed for a given neuron and does not vary with the strength of the stimulus. Action potentials follow an all-or-nothing principle, meaning that once a threshold is reached, the action potential will have the same amplitude regardless of stimulus strength. Therefore, amplitude is not a factor in determining stimulus intensity. D. Amplitude of generator potential: The amplitude of the generator potential (the graded response at the receptor level) does reflect the strength of the stimulus, but it does not directly determine the intensity as perceived by the brain. It influences the frequency of action potentials, which is the actual determinant of intensity.",

The nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus are the first synapse points in the dorsal columns pathway, which is responsible for transmitting fine touch, proprioception, and vibration sensations from the body to the brain. Sensory fibers from the lower and upper body respectively synapse in the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus in the medulla. After this synapse, the second-order neurons cross over to the opposite side and ascend to the thalamus. B. Dorsolateral tract: The dorsolateral tract (also known as the tract of Lissauer) carries pain and temperature sensations and does not synapse in the nucleus gracilis or nucleus cuneatus. It transmits sensory information in a different pathway, specifically related to the spinothalamic system. C. Ventral spinothalamic tract: The ventral spinothalamic tract carries crude touch sensations and synapses in the spinal cord, not the nucleus gracilis or nucleus cuneatus. These structures are not involved in the ventral spinothalamic tract pathway, which deals with more generalized touch perception. D. Lateral spinothalamic tract: The lateral spinothalamic tract is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensations.

They are highly sensitive to high-frequency vibrations and are located in deep layers of the skin, joints, and other tissues. When these receptors are compressed or deformed by vibrations, they generate action potentials that are sent to the brain for processing. A. Pressure: Although Pacinian corpuscles can detect changes in pressure, their primary function is more focused on vibration rather than sustained pressure. Other receptors, like the Ruffini endings, are more responsible for detecting sustained pressure. B. Pain: Pain sensation is primarily mediated by nociceptors, not Pacinian corpuscles. Nociceptors respond to harmful stimuli such as extreme temperature, mechanical injury, or chemical damage, not vibration. C. Touch: While Pacinian corpuscles are involved in detecting tactile stimuli, they are not the primary receptors for general touch. Merkel discs and Meissner's corpuscles are more directly responsible for detecting fine touch and light pressure. Pacinian corpuscles are more specialized for vibration detection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cerebral cortex. Loss of the ability to feel the size and shape of an object, a condition known as stereognosis, is typically associated with damage to the somatosensory cortex in the cerebral cortex. The somatosensory cortex processes information related to touch, proprioception, and the recognition of object properties like size, shape, and texture. Damage to this area can impair the ability to recognize objects by touch, even though the sensation of touch may still be intact. A. Tractus gracilis: The tractus gracilis carries sensory information from the lower part of the body (below the T6 level), specifically for fine touch and proprioception, but it does not directly affect the ability to perceive the size and shape of objects. Lesions here would lead to loss of sensory input from the lower body, but stereognosis is a function of the cortical processing of sensory information, not a deficit in the tract itself. B. Tractus cuneatus: Similar to the tractus gracilis, the tractus cuneatus carries sensory information from the upper body, specifically fine touch and proprioception. While lesions in this tract may cause loss of sensation from the upper body, it would not specifically result in the inability to perceive the size and shape of objects. That type of dysfunction is more related to cortical processing. C. Lateral spinothalamic tract: The lateral spinothalamic tract carries information related to pain and temperature sensation, not fine touch or proprioception. A lesion here would result in loss of pain and temperature sensation, but it would not affect the ability to perceive the size or shape of objects, which is a higher-level cortical function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Substantia gelatinosa. The gate control theory of pain suggests that pain signals can be modulated or \"gated\" at the level of the substantia gelatinosa, a region located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This area acts as a \"gate\" to either allow or inhibit the transmission of pain signals from the peripheral nerves to the brain. When non-painful stimuli (such as touch or pressure) are applied, they activate large-diameter fibers that inhibit the transmission of pain signals through smaller-diameter fibers. This modulation helps to reduce the perception of pain. B. Dorsal root ganglion: The dorsal root ganglion contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons and plays a role in transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the spinal cord. However, the dorsal root ganglion is not the site of the gate control mechanism for pain. The substantia gelatinosa in the spinal cord is where the gate control of pain occurs. C. Both: While the dorsal root ganglion is involved in transmitting sensory signals, the gate control of pain occurs specifically at the substantia gelatinosa in the spinal cord, so both is not the correct answer. The dorsal root ganglion does not play a direct role in the gating of pain. D. None: The correct answer is not \"none\" because the gate system for pain control is indeed located at the substantia gelatinosa, so this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The back of scapula. The ability to perceive two separate touch stimuli as distinct, known as two-point discrimination, varies across different parts of the body. The back of the scapula has a relatively larger receptive field and fewer sensory receptors compared to areas like the lips or fingertips. Therefore, two stimuli need to be separated by a greater distance for them to be perceived as two separate stimuli. This is because the density of sensory receptors (particularly mechanoreceptors) is lower in this area, leading to a reduced ability to distinguish between closely spaced touch sensations. A. The lips: The lips have one of the highest densities of sensory receptors, particularly mechanoreceptors, which makes them very sensitive to touch. Because of this high receptor density, the two-point discrimination threshold is very small, meaning two touch stimuli can be perceived as separate even when they are close together. Therefore, the distance for perceiving separate stimuli is small at the lips. B. The palm of the hand: The palm of the hand has a relatively high density of sensory receptors, though not as high as the lips or fingertips. The ability to distinguish two-point touch stimuli is better here than on the back of the scapula, but it is not as acute as areas like the lips or fingertips. Thus, the distance required to perceive separate stimuli is smaller than on the back of the scapula but larger than on the lips. D. The dorsum of the hand: Similar to the palm, the dorsum of the hand has a moderate density of sensory receptors. Two-point discrimination is better here than on the back of the scapula but still not as sharp as the lips. The threshold for perceiving separate stimuli is larger than areas like the lips, but smaller than the back of the scapula.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Left lateral spinothalamic tract. An anterolateral cordotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting a part of the spinal cord to relieve pain. The lateral spinothalamic tract is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensations from the body to the brain. Since pain sensation crosses over to the opposite side of the body at the level of the spinal cord, cutting the left lateral spinothalamic tract will interrupt the pain transmission from the right side of the body, specifically the right leg in this case. This procedure is effective in treating pain on the contralateral side (the opposite side) of the body. A. Left dorsal column: The dorsal column carries sensory information related to touch, vibration, and proprioception, not pain or temperature. Cutting the left dorsal column would affect sensations like touch and proprioception from the left side of the body, not pain from the right leg. Therefore, it wouldn't be effective in relieving pain from the right leg. B. Left ventral spinothalamic tract: The ventral spinothalamic tract primarily carries sensations of crude touch and pressure. Cutting the left ventral spinothalamic tract would affect these sensations but would not be as effective for relieving pain and temperature sensations from the right leg. The lateral spinothalamic tract is the primary pathway for pain relief, not the ventral spinothalamic tract. D. Right lateral spinothalamic tract: The right lateral spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature sensations from the right side of the body, but cutting this tract would affect pain sensations on the same side (right leg). Since the procedure involves an anterolateral cordotomy, which targets the opposite (contralateral) side, cutting the left lateral spinothalamic tract is the correct approach to relieve pain in the right leg.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vasodilatation. The body's first physiological response to high environmental temperatures is vasodilatation. When exposed to heat, the blood vessels, particularly those near the skin, dilate (widen), increasing blood flow to the skin. This allows for increased heat dissipation through the skin, helping the body cool down. Vasodilatation facilitates the process of heat loss through radiation and convection by allowing more blood to flow near the skin surface, where heat can be released into the environment. A. Sweating: Sweating is another important mechanism for heat loss, but it typically occurs after vasodilatation. When blood vessels dilate and heat reaches the skin, sweat glands are activated to release sweat. As sweat evaporates from the skin, it further helps in cooling the body. However, sweating is not the first response; it follows after vasodilatation to enhance the cooling process. C. Decreased heat production: Decreased heat production (through mechanisms like decreased physical activity or reduced metabolic rate) is a longer-term response to heat exposure, not the initial one. In the early stages of exposure to high environmental temperatures, the body primarily tries to lose heat through vasodilatation and sweating rather than reducing its internal heat production. D. Non-shivering thermogenesis: Non-shivering thermogenesis is primarily involved in heat production, not cooling. It occurs in response to cold exposure when the body attempts to generate heat through processes like brown adipose tissue activation. In a hot environment, non-shivering thermogenesis is not relevant, and the body focuses on cooling rather than heat generation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pain loss in the opposite side of lesion. Brown-Séquard syndrome is a neurological condition that results from a hemisection (partial damage) of the spinal cord, causing a set of characteristic symptoms. The key feature of Brown-Séquard syndrome is that the pain and temperature sensation is lost on the opposite side of the lesion, which occurs due to the decussation (crossing over) of the spinothalamic tract fibers before reaching the brain. These fibers cross over at the level of the spinal cord, meaning that a lesion on one side of the spinal cord causes loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side of the body. Incorrect options: B. Fine touch lost in opposite side of lesion: This is incorrect because fine touch and proprioception (which are carried by the dorsal columns) are lost on the same side as the lesion, not the opposite side. This is due to the fact that the dorsal column fibers do not cross over until they reach the medulla, so damage to one side of the spinal cord affects sensory information on the same side. C. UMN paralysis in opposite side of lesion: This is incorrect because upper motor neuron (UMN) paralysis occurs on the same side as the lesion in Brown-Séquard syndrome. The descending corticospinal tracts (responsible for voluntary motor control) decussate (cross) at the level of the medulla, meaning damage to the corticospinal tract on one side of the spinal cord leads to paralysis on the same side of the body. D. LMN paralysis in opposite side of lesion: This is also incorrect because lower motor neuron (LMN) paralysis occurs on the same side as the lesion at the level of the injury. The LMN paralysis results from damage to the anterior horn cells or their axons, which are on the same side as the lesion. Therefore, motor deficits in Brown-Séquard syndrome are seen on the same side of the lesion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B, E) Temperature and E. Crude sense. Explanation for Correct Answers: B. Temperature: The posterior column (also known as the dorsal column) is primarily involved in transmitting sensations such as vibration, fine touch, and proprioception (position sense). Temperature sensation is carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract, not the posterior column. Therefore, temperature sensation would not be directly affected by a posterior column lesion. E. Crude sense: Crude touch or the general awareness of touch (without the ability to localize or identify it precisely) is mediated by the anterolateral (spinothalamic) system. A lesion in the posterior column would not affect crude touch, as it is not transmitted through this pathway. Therefore, crude sense is not affected by a posterior column lesion. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Vibration: The posterior column is responsible for transmitting vibration sense from the skin and joints to the brain. A lesion in the posterior column would disrupt the ability to perceive vibration, making this function affected in the case of a posterior column lesion. C. Fine touch: Fine touch (also known as discriminative touch) is carried by the posterior column, which transmits precise tactile information, including the ability to discriminate between two points of contact. A lesion in the posterior column would impair the ability to sense fine touch, so this would be affected. D. Position sense: Proprioception, or the sense of body position, is also transmitted via the posterior column. This includes the ability to perceive the position of limbs in space. A posterior column lesion would impair position sense, as it disrupts the proprioceptive pathways. In summary, a posterior column lesion would primarily affect vibration, fine touch, and position sense, while temperature and crude sense would not be affected since they are transmitted via different pathways (lateral spinothalamic tract for temperature and anterolateral system for crude touch).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Feedback inhibition. Renshaw cells are inhibitory interneurons located in the spinal cord. They receive excitatory input from motor neurons and, in turn, send inhibitory signals back to those same motor neurons. This creates a feedback loop that helps regulate and modulate motor activity, preventing excessive firing of motor neurons and ensuring smooth, controlled muscle movements. This process is an example of feedback inhibition, as the output (inhibition) feeds back to the source (the motor neuron). Incorrect options: A. Feedback facilitation: This option is incorrect because Renshaw cell activity does not facilitate motor neuron activity but inhibits it. Feedback facilitation would involve an enhancement of motor neuron activity, which does not describe the function of Renshaw cells. B. Feed forward inhibition: Feed forward inhibition occurs when an inhibitory signal is sent in anticipation of an upcoming action, usually to prevent overexcitation. This is not the role of Renshaw cells, which primarily modulate motor neuron activity after excitation occurs, making feed forward inhibition an incorrect description. C. Feed forward facilitation: This option is also incorrect because Renshaw cells do not facilitate motor neuron activity. Their function is inhibitory, not facilitative, and they do not act in a feed forward manner.",
