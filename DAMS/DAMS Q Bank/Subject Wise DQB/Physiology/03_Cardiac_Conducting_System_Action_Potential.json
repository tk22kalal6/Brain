      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vagus nerve. The parasympathetic nerve supply to the heart is provided by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in regulating heart rate and maintaining cardiac homeostasis. Parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve decrease the heart rate by releasing acetylcholine at the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. This action slows the heart rate and reduces the force of contraction, contributing to the \"rest-and-digest\" response. The vagus nerve is integral to autonomic control, balancing the sympathetic system's stimulating effects on the heart. Incorrect Options: (A) Phrenic nerve: The phrenic nerve primarily provides motor innervation to the diaphragm and sensory innervation to the pericardium and pleura. It does not contribute to the parasympathetic innervation of the heart. While it is associated with structures near the heart, it has no direct role in cardiac autonomic control. (B) Spinal accessory nerve: The spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) is a motor nerve responsible for innervating the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It has no role in autonomic or parasympathetic functions, let alone the innervation of the heart. (D) None of the above: This option is incorrect because the vagus nerve (option C) is the actual source of parasympathetic innervation to the heart. Therefore, this statement contradicts established physiological knowledge.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) No action potential from another part of the heart will re-excite the heart muscle. The absolute refractory period of heart muscle refers to the phase during which cardiac muscle cells are completely unresponsive to any new action potential, regardless of its strength. This occurs because the sodium channels, responsible for initiating depolarization, are inactivated and cannot reopen until the membrane potential returns closer to its resting state. The absolute refractory period ensures that the heart muscle has enough time to contract and relax fully before another contraction occurs, preventing tetanic contractions and maintaining the rhythmic, coordinated pumping action essential for efficient blood circulation. Incorrect Options: (A) Heart is in diastole: While the heart may be in diastole during part of the refractory period, the absolute refractory period is not defined by the cardiac cycle phase (systole or diastole). Instead, it is determined by the state of the cardiac muscle's ion channels during an action potential. (B) Unresponsive to neural stimuli: This statement is partially correct but too broad. The heart muscle during the absolute refractory period is unresponsive not only to neural stimuli but also to any electrical stimuli, including those originating from within the heart itself. The specific focus of this period is on the inability to generate another action potential, which makes (C) the more accurate and specific answer. (D) None of the above: This is incorrect because option (C) accurately describes the absolute refractory period. Therefore, this option contradicts the correct explanation.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Anemia. In anemia, blood turbulence increases primarily due to a significant decrease in blood viscosity. Lower viscosity results from the reduced number of red blood cells (RBCs) in circulation, which normally contribute to the thickening of blood. This leads to a higher velocity of blood flow through the vessels, especially in areas of narrow diameters, causing turbulent blood flow. Turbulence is often heard as murmurs during auscultation, commonly in conditions of anemia. The reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood further amplifies the heart's compensatory mechanisms, including increased cardiac output, which can exacerbate turbulence. Incorrect Options: (A) Multiple myeloma: Multiple myeloma is a condition associated with increased plasma proteins, particularly immunoglobulins, which raise blood viscosity. Increased viscosity decreases the likelihood of turbulence, as the flow becomes slower and more resistant. Therefore, this condition is more likely to reduce turbulence than increase it. (B) Leukemia: Leukemia involves an excessive production of abnormal white blood cells, which can marginally increase blood viscosity. However, this is usually insufficient to significantly affect blood turbulence. The primary effects of leukemia are related to bone marrow suppression and impaired immune function, not turbulence. (C) Polycythemia: Polycythemia, characterized by an increased number of red blood cells, leads to significantly higher blood viscosity. High viscosity slows blood flow, reducing the tendency for turbulence. Instead, polycythemia increases the risk of sluggish circulation and thrombosis rather than turbulent flow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stabilizing resting membrane potential. The vagus nerve inhibits the pacemaker potential of the heart by acting on the sinoatrial (SA) node. Its effect is mediated by the release of acetylcholine, which activates muscarinic receptors. This action leads to an increase in potassium ion (K+) permeability, causing hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. Additionally, the vagus nerve decreases the slope of the pre-potential (phase 4 depolarization) in pacemaker cells, thereby slowing the heart rate. However, the resting membrane potential of pacemaker cells is not \"stabilized\" because these cells do not have a true resting potential. Instead, their membrane potential continuously drifts toward threshold due to automaticity. Thus, this option is incorrect. Incorrect Options: (A) Hyperpolarization: This is correct because vagal stimulation increases K+ efflux via acetylcholine-sensitive K+ channels, hyperpolarizing the pacemaker cells. Hyperpolarization makes it harder for the cells to reach the threshold for depolarization, slowing the heart rate. (B) Decreased slope of pre-potential: This is correct because vagal stimulation reduces the slope of phase 4 depolarization (pre-potential) by inhibiting the inward pacemaker currents (such as If). A reduced slope delays the time taken to reach the threshold potential, decreasing the heart rate. (D) Increase K+ permeability: This is correct because vagal stimulation opens potassium channels, increasing K+ efflux. This increased permeability contributes to hyperpolarization and the inhibition of pacemaker activity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased by parasympathetic activity. The Sinoatrial (SA) node is the heart's natural pacemaker, and it initiates electrical impulses that regulate heart rate. It generates impulses spontaneously and at the fastest rate compared to other pacemaker cells in the heart. The parasympathetic nervous system, through the vagus nerve, decreases the heart rate by releasing acetylcholine, which acts to slow down the pacemaker activity of the SA node. Therefore, parasympathetic activity decreases, not increases, the firing rate of the SA node. Incorrect Options: (A) Initiates the impulse at fastest rate: This is correct. The SA node is the fastest pacemaker in the heart, generating electrical impulses at the highest rate, typically around 60-100 times per minute under normal conditions. This is why it is the primary pacemaker of the heart. (B) Generate the impulse spontaneously: This is correct. The SA node generates electrical impulses spontaneously through a process called automaticity. Pacemaker cells in the SA node reach the threshold potential without requiring external stimuli, allowing them to initiate action potentials on their own. (D) Increased by sympathetic activity: This is correct. Sympathetic activity, via the release of norepinephrine, increases the firing rate of the SA node. This speeds up the heart rate, especially during exercise or times of stress, as part of the \"fight or flight\" response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Carotid sinus pressure receptors. The carotid sinus pressure receptors, also known as baroreceptors, are sensitive to changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, these receptors are stimulated and send signals to the brainstem to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibit the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. This reduces the sympathetic activity and leads to vasodilation, thereby lowering the blood pressure. This reflex action helps to maintain blood pressure homeostasis. So, an increase in the activity of the carotid sinus receptors diminishes sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. Incorrect Options: (A) Carotid body chemoreceptors: Carotid body chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels in the blood, not primarily to blood pressure. When oxygen levels decrease or carbon dioxide levels increase, these chemoreceptors activate the sympathetic nervous system to improve oxygen delivery by increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction. Therefore, they do not diminish sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, making this option incorrect. (C) Plain receptors: This option appears to be a misnomer or an incomplete term. There is no such class of receptors as \"plain receptors\" that directly control sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. The closest related receptors might be stretch receptors or pain receptors, but these are not involved in diminishing sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone as directly as baroreceptors. (D) Medullary chemoreceptors: Medullary chemoreceptors respond to changes in the levels of carbon dioxide and pH in the blood. They influence respiratory drive more significantly than vasoconstriction. Although they can indirectly affect blood pressure by influencing respiration, they do not primarily regulate sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. Their role in diminishing sympathetic tone is less direct than that of carotid sinus pressure receptors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Each of the options listed increases the workload of the left ventricle in different ways: Systemic hypertension: High blood pressure (hypertension) increases the afterload, which is the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to eject blood into the aorta. This added resistance makes the left ventricle work harder, thus increasing its workload. Increased sympathetic tone in heart: Increased sympathetic stimulation leads to a higher heart rate and stronger contractions (positive inotropy). While this can improve cardiac output, it also increases the overall workload of the left ventricle because it must work more intensely and rapidly to pump more blood. Aortic stenosis: Aortic stenosis is the narrowing of the aortic valve, which increases resistance to blood flow out of the left ventricle. This increases the workload on the left ventricle as it has to generate more pressure to push blood through the narrowed valve. Together, these factors all contribute to an increased workload of the left ventricle, which is why all of the above are correct. Incorrect Options: Since the correct answer is (D) All of the above, there are no incorrect options among the listed choices.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Modified muscle fibres. The A-V junction refers to the area between the atria and ventricles, particularly the A-V node and the surrounding conducting tissue. The fibres here are modified muscle fibres, which have adapted to function in the conduction system of the heart. These modified muscle fibres are specialized to conduct electrical impulses, but they do so at a slower rate compared to regular cardiac muscle cells. Their main role is to ensure that the electrical signal from the atria is delayed slightly before it reaches the ventricles, allowing for proper timing of atrial and ventricular contractions. Incorrect Options: (B) Modified nerve fibres: The fibres in the A-V junction are not nerve fibres. While the heart's conduction system does involve nerves (especially in terms of autonomic control), the A-V node and its associated tissue consist of specialized cardiac muscle fibres, not nerve fibres. (C) Highly contractile: The fibres of the A-V junction are not highly contractile. Unlike the regular cardiac muscle fibres that contract forcefully to pump blood, the fibres in the A-V junction are modified for conduction, not for contraction. Their primary function is to conduct electrical signals, not to generate strong mechanical contractions. (D) Conduct impulse rapidly: The fibres of the A-V junction do not conduct impulses rapidly. In fact, one of the distinguishing features of the A-V node and the surrounding fibres is their relatively slower conduction speed compared to other parts of the heart's conduction system, like the Purkinje fibres or bundle of His. The slower conduction here allows for the delay between atrial and ventricular contraction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The PQ interval to increase. The PQ interval (also known as the PR interval) represents the time it takes for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricles through the A-V node. When the velocity of impulse conduction through the A-V node decreases, it takes longer for the electrical signal to pass from the atria to the ventricles, resulting in a longer PQ interval. Therefore, a decrease in conduction velocity through the A-V node will cause the PQ interval to increase. B. The PQ interval to decrease is incorrect. A decrease in the velocity of impulse conduction through the A-V node would result in a longer, not shorter, PQ interval. If conduction velocity were to increase, the PQ interval would decrease, but this is the opposite of the situation described in the question. C. Disappearance of the T-wave is incorrect. The T-wave represents ventricular repolarization, and it is not directly affected by changes in the conduction velocity through the A-V node. A decrease in conduction velocity primarily affects the PQ interval, not the T-wave. D. Increased heart rate is incorrect. Decreased velocity of impulse conduction through the A-V node typically leads to a slower heart rate, as it takes longer for the electrical impulses to reach the ventricles, slowing down the overall conduction. Therefore, a decrease in conduction velocity does not increase heart rate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Begins in epicardium. Repolarization of the ventricular muscle begins at the epicardium, which is the outermost layer of the heart. During repolarization, the myocardial cells restore their resting membrane potential, and this process typically starts at the outer layer of the ventricles and moves inward toward the endocardium. The epicardium has the shortest action potential duration, so it repolarizes first. A. Occurs last at apex is incorrect. While repolarization starts at the epicardium, it does not occur last at the apex. The repolarization process occurs more slowly at the endocardium (the inner layer), but the apex is not specifically where repolarization is delayed. The repolarization process is more influenced by the direction of impulse propagation rather than the specific location of the apex. B. Begins in septum is incorrect. The septum is involved in depolarization first, not repolarization. Repolarization follows the opposite direction to depolarization, starting from the outer layers (epicardium) and moving inward toward the septum and endocardium. Therefore, repolarization does not begin in the septum. D. Begins at AV node is incorrect. The AV node plays a role in delaying the electrical impulse between the atria and the ventricles, but it does not initiate repolarization. Repolarization of the ventricular muscle begins at the epicardium and proceeds inward toward the endocardium, independent of the AV node's location and function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) SA node, AV node. The vagus nerve plays a critical role in parasympathetic control of the heart. The right vagus nerve primarily innervates the sinoatrial (SA) node, helping to regulate the heart rate by slowing it down. The left vagus nerve mainly innervates the atrioventricular (AV) node, where it also exerts a parasympathetic influence, slowing down conduction through the node and helping to coordinate atrial and ventricular activity. Therefore, the right vagus affects the SA node, and the left vagus affects the AV node. B. AV node, SA node is incorrect. The right vagus nerve affects the SA node, not the AV node, and the left vagus nerve primarily influences the AV node, not the SA node. This option reverses the correct roles of the right and left vagus nerves. C. AV node, bundle of His is incorrect. The vagus nerves primarily affect the SA node and AV node, not the bundle of His.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 3.2. The cardiac index is a measure of the cardiac output adjusted for a person’s body surface area, and it is typically around 2.5 to 4.0 L/min/m² in a healthy adult. In this case, a cardiac index of 3.2 L/min/m² is considered normal for a person with an average body size, reflecting a healthy level of heart function relative to body surface area. A. 2.1 is incorrect. A cardiac index of 2.1 L/min/m² would be considered lower than normal, indicating reduced cardiac output in relation to body surface area. This value could be seen in certain medical conditions, but it is not typical for a healthy individual. C. 4.6 is incorrect. While higher than normal, a cardiac index of 4.6 L/min/m² is still within a possible range for some individuals, particularly in physically fit people or athletes. However, it is above the average range and not the typical value for a \"normal\" person. D. 5.9 is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sympathetic system. Baroreceptors, which are located primarily in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, play a key role in regulating blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors detect the change and signal the central nervous system. The response is mainly mediated through the sympathetic nervous system, which adjusts heart rate and vascular tone to bring the blood pressure back to normal levels. This involves inhibiting sympathetic output, which reduces heart rate and dilates blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure. B. Parasympathetic system is incorrect. While the parasympathetic system does play a role in controlling heart rate through the vagus nerve, the primary mechanism by which baroreceptors regulate blood pressure is through the sympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system can help counteract increases in heart rate, but it is not the main system involved in the acute baroreceptor response. C. Cerebral cortex is incorrect. While the cerebral cortex can influence autonomic functions, it is not the primary system involved in the immediate feedback from baroreceptors. The baroreceptor reflex is an autonomic response that primarily involves the brainstem, particularly the medulla, rather than the cerebral cortex. D. Blood volume is incorrect. Blood volume can influence blood pressure, but baroreceptors do not directly monitor or adjust blood volume. Instead, they sense changes in blood pressure and activate the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to help regulate the pressure in response to short-term changes. Blood volume regulation is more directly controlled by mechanisms such as the renin-angiotensin system and kidney function.",

The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is responsible for carrying afferent signals from the aortic arch baroreceptors, not from the carotid sinus. While both the carotid sinus and aortic arch are involved in regulating blood pressure, the vagus nerve does not transmit information from the carotid sinus. C. V nerve is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Decreased sympathetic discharge to heart. Carotid sinus stimulation, particularly in response to an increase in blood pressure, activates the baroreceptor reflex. This reflex results in a decrease in sympathetic discharge to the heart, which helps to lower the heart rate and reduce blood pressure. The body senses the increased pressure through the carotid sinus baroreceptors, leading to the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and a compensatory increase in parasympathetic (vagal) tone to restore normal blood pressure. A. Decreased vagal activity is incorrect. Carotid sinus stimulation actually increases vagal (parasympathetic) activity, not decreases it. The baroreceptor reflex stimulates the vagus nerve to reduce heart rate as part of the process of lowering blood pressure when it is too high. B. Increased heart rate is incorrect. Carotid sinus stimulation, particularly in response to increased blood pressure, typically leads to a decrease in heart rate (bradycardia) due to the activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and the inhibition of sympathetic output. This helps counteract the rise in blood pressure. D. Increased vasomotor tone is incorrect. Carotid sinus stimulation generally reduces vasomotor tone through a decrease in sympathetic tone. This leads to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure, rather than an increase in vasomotor tone. Increased vasomotor tone would be more likely in response to decreased blood pressure, not in response to carotid sinus stimulation in the setting of increased pressure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increase in HR & BP. Occlusion of the common carotid artery on both sides leads to a reduction in blood flow to the brain. This triggers a strong compensatory response from the body through the baroreceptor reflex. The brain perceives the reduced cerebral perfusion, leading to an increase in sympathetic nervous activity and a subsequent rise in both heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) to improve blood flow to vital organs. This response is part of the body's effort to restore adequate cerebral circulation. B. Increase in BP & decrease in HR is incorrect. While occlusion of the carotid arteries increases blood pressure due to sympathetic activation, heart rate typically increases, not decreases, in response to the perceived drop in cerebral perfusion. The body tries to improve blood flow by increasing both HR and BP. C. Decrease in HR & BP is incorrect. A decrease in heart rate and blood pressure would not be expected with bilateral carotid artery occlusion. In fact, the body responds with an increase in sympathetic tone to raise both heart rate and blood pressure in order to compensate for the reduced cerebral blood flow. D. No effect on BP & HR is incorrect. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion does indeed have an effect on both blood pressure and heart rate, leading to an increase in both as part of the compensatory mechanisms.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Rapid shallow breathing. Gamma efferent discharge is primarily involved in regulating muscle spindle sensitivity, which helps in fine motor control and maintaining muscle tone. However, rapid shallow breathing is not typically associated with increased gamma efferent discharge. Rapid shallow breathing is more related to the activation of the respiratory centers in the brainstem and is influenced by factors like anxiety or metabolic changes, rather than direct modulation of gamma motor activity. A. Jendrassik’s maneuver: The Jendrassik maneuver, which involves the reinforcement of a deep tendon reflex by having the patient interlock their fingers and pull them apart while the reflex is tested, increases gamma efferent discharge. This enhances the sensitivity of muscle spindles, making the reflex more pronounced. B. Anxiety: Anxiety can increase gamma efferent discharge as part of the body's stress response. Increased gamma activity contributes to heightened muscle tone and tension, which is commonly seen in anxious states as part of the \"fight or flight\" response. D. Stimulation of skin: Stimulation of the skin, especially in the context of reflex responses or proprioceptive feedback, can lead to increased gamma efferent discharge. This helps to maintain proper muscle tone and posture in response to sensory input.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reflex bradycardia. Carotid sinus massage stimulates the carotid sinus baroreceptors, which are sensitive to changes in blood pressure. When pressure is applied to the carotid sinus, it triggers an increase in vagal (parasympathetic) tone to the heart and a decrease in sympathetic activity, leading to reflex bradycardia—a slowing of the heart rate. This is a normal physiological response intended to reduce blood pressure. A. Hyperapnea is incorrect. Hyperapnea refers to an increased rate and depth of breathing, usually as a response to metabolic demands or low oxygen levels. Carotid sinus massage does not primarily affect the respiratory rate; its primary effect is on heart rate. C. Tachycardia is incorrect. Tachycardia, or an increased heart rate, is not a typical response to carotid sinus massage. Instead, the vagal stimulation caused by the massage typically results in a decrease in heart rate, leading to bradycardia, not tachycardia. D. Dyspnea is incorrect. Dyspnea refers to difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, which is not typically caused by carotid sinus massage.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased refractory period. Explanation: C. Increased refractory period: This option is incorrect because sympathetic stimulation actually decreases the refractory period of the heart. Sympathetic stimulation, primarily mediated by norepinephrine acting on beta-adrenergic receptors, leads to faster depolarization and shortens the refractory period. This makes the heart more responsive and capable of contracting more frequently during times of increased demand, such as exercise or stress. Incorrect responses: A. Increased conduction velocity: This option is correct. Sympathetic stimulation increases the conduction velocity of the heart, particularly through the atrioventricular (AV) node and His-Purkinje system. By enhancing the activity of calcium channels and sodium channels, sympathetic stimulation speeds up the rate at which the action potential travels through the conduction system, facilitating a faster heart rate and more efficient pumping of the heart. B. Increased heart rate: This option is correct. Sympathetic stimulation increases the heart rate by stimulating the sinoatrial (SA) node. The sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, which binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, increasing the rate of depolarization and thus the heart rate (positive chronotropic effect). D. Increased contractility of heart: This option is correct. Sympathetic stimulation increases the contractility of the heart (known as positive inotropic effect). This is achieved through the activation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to increased calcium influx into the heart muscle cells, which results in stronger and more forceful contractions of the heart.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increased VR - increased CO. Explanation: A. Increased VR - increased CO: This option is correct. Starling's Law of the Heart states that the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in venous return (VR). Essentially, the more blood that enters the heart (i.e., the higher the venous return), the greater the stretch of the heart muscle (specifically the ventricles), which leads to a stronger contraction and thus an increase in cardiac output (CO). This relationship is crucial for maintaining balance between the amount of blood returning to the heart and the amount being pumped out. Incorrect responses: B. Increased discharge - increased CO: This option is incorrect. Discharge (in this context, possibly referring to nerve discharge or electrical activity) does not directly describe the principle of Starling's Law. While increased heart rate or sympathetic discharge can affect cardiac output, it is venous return (VR) and the preload (the stretch of the heart muscle) that directly influences the stroke volume in Starling’s Law, not discharge. C. Increased HR - increased CO: This option is incorrect. Increased heart rate (HR) does lead to an increase in cardiac output (CO), but this is not specifically described by Starling’s Law. While heart rate does contribute to cardiac output (CO), Starling's Law focuses on the relationship between venous return and stroke volume, not directly on heart rate. D. Increased BP - increased CO: This option is incorrect. Blood pressure (BP) and cardiac output (CO) are related, but Starling's Law does not directly describe this relationship. Blood pressure is influenced by various factors including total peripheral resistance, whereas Starling's Law pertains to the heart's ability to pump blood in response to the volume it receives (venous return).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Relaxation of LV with mitral & aortic valve closed. Explanation: C. Relaxation of LV with mitral & aortic valve closed: This option is correct. Isometric relaxation refers to the phase in the cardiac cycle when the left ventricle (LV) relaxes, but the volume within the ventricle does not change because both the mitral valve and the aortic valve are closed. This occurs immediately after the left ventricle has contracted and before the mitral valve opens, allowing the ventricle to fill with blood. During this phase, the heart muscle is relaxing without any volume change. Incorrect responses: A. Relaxation of both atria: This option is incorrect. The term isometric relaxation specifically applies to the ventricular phase, not the atrial phase. During atrial relaxation, the atria are not involved in a pressure-volume change related to isometric conditions, as they are not experiencing the same type of contraction and relaxation mechanics as the ventricles. B. Relaxation of both atria with all valves open: This option is incorrect. While atrial relaxation occurs during the cardiac cycle, it does not involve isometric conditions. The atria relax and fill with blood, but this is not the phase where isometric relaxation is described. Additionally, the statement that all valves are open during atrial relaxation is not correct, as the atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid) are usually closed during early diastole, and the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed during isometric relaxation. D. Relaxation of LV with mitral & aortic valve open: This option is incorrect. Isometric relaxation occurs when the mitral and aortic valves are closed. If both valves were open, the ventricle would not undergo isometric relaxation, as it would be allowing blood to flow into or out of the ventricle, which involves changes in volume (thus not being isometric). Isometric conditions are specifically those where volume remains constant, which occurs with closed valves.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased K+ efflux, decreased slope of phase 4. Explanation: C. Increased K+ efflux, decreased slope of phase 4: When vagal tone is increased, it enhances parasympathetic activity via the vagus nerve. This results in an increased efflux of potassium ions (K+) from cardiac cells, especially from pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node. The increased K+ efflux makes the inside of the cell more negative, hyperpolarizing it. This hyperpolarization slows the rate of depolarization, which decreases the slope of phase 4 (the slow depolarization phase) of the action potential, ultimately leading to a slower heart rate. Incorrect responses: A. Increased K+ efflux, increased slope of phase 4: This option is incorrect. While vagal stimulation increases K+ efflux, it does not increase the slope of phase 4. In fact, the opposite occurs—the slope of phase 4 decreases because the increased K+ efflux hyperpolarizes the cell, making it take longer for the membrane potential to reach threshold for firing an action potential. B. Decreased K+ efflux, decreased slope of phase 4: This option is incorrect. During increased vagal tone, K+ efflux is increased, not decreased. As K+ leaves the cell, the hyperpolarization occurs, which slows the depolarization rate and decreases the slope of phase 4, rather than a decrease in K+ efflux. D. Decreased K+ efflux, increased slope of phase 4: This option is incorrect. The vagal effect involves an increase in K+ efflux, not a decrease. If K+ efflux were to decrease, the cell would become less hyperpolarized, and the slope of phase 4 would increase, leading to a faster depolarization. However, this is the opposite of what happens with increased vagal tone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fast sodium channels opening. Explanation: B. Fast sodium channels opening: The prepotential (also known as the pacemaker potential) in the SA node is not primarily driven by the opening of fast sodium channels. Instead, it is mainly due to the gradual influx of calcium ions and the slow depolarization resulting from the closing of potassium channels. Fast sodium channels, which are more important in other parts of the heart like the atria and ventricles for the upstroke of the action potential, do not contribute significantly to the prepotential phase in the SA node. Incorrect responses: A. Ca2+ spark: Calcium sparks are small, localized releases of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These are important in the process of pacemaker cell depolarization because calcium ions contribute to the gradual depolarization seen in the prepotential phase. The slow, inward flow of calcium ions, primarily through T-type calcium channels, is crucial for the initiation of the action potential in the SA node. C. K+ decay: During the prepotential phase, there is a gradual decay of the efflux of K+ (potassium ions) from the cells. This reduction in the outward flow of potassium ions, combined with the slow influx of calcium ions, leads to the gradual depolarization of the SA node membrane potential. This is a key part of the pacemaker potential. D. Transient Ca channel opening: T-type calcium channels (transient calcium channels) open during the prepotential phase. These channels allow calcium ions to enter the cell slowly, contributing to the gradual depolarization that defines the prepotential and ultimately triggers the action potential in the SA node.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Heart rate. Explanation: A. Heart rate: The vagal tone refers to the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart, primarily through the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve slows down the heart rate by releasing acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the heart, leading to a decrease in heart rate. A high vagal tone results in a lower resting heart rate, while a lower vagal tone leads to a higher resting heart rate. Therefore, heart rate is the most direct and reliable indicator of vagal tone. Incorrect responses: B. Stroke volume: Stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle with each contraction) is primarily influenced by factors such as preload, contractility, and afterload, rather than vagal tone. While vagal tone may indirectly affect stroke volume by influencing heart rate and therefore cardiac output, it is not the best indicator of vagal tone itself. C. Ejection fraction: Ejection fraction is the percentage of blood pumped out of the ventricles with each contraction. It is a measure of ventricular function and is influenced by various factors such as heart health and contractility. Vagal tone does not directly impact ejection fraction in a specific or isolated manner, making it an unreliable indicator of vagal tone. D. Diastolic pressure: Diastolic pressure is a measure of the resistance in the blood vessels during the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle. While sympathetic and parasympathetic influences can affect vascular tone and thus influence blood pressure, diastolic pressure is not a direct indicator of vagal tone. Vagal tone predominantly affects heart rate rather than blood pressure directly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased automaticity. Explanation: C. Increased automaticity: The parasympathetic nervous system decreases automaticity, not increases it. Automaticity refers to the ability of the heart to generate spontaneous electrical impulses. The parasympathetic stimulation primarily decreases heart rate and conduction velocity, which results in a reduction of automaticity. Therefore, increased automaticity is not a typical effect of parasympathetic stimulation and is the correct answer here. Incorrect responses: A. Decreased heart rate: Parasympathetic stimulation causes a decrease in heart rate, particularly through the vagus nerve, which acts on the sinoatrial (SA) node to reduce the heart rate. This is a well-known effect of parasympathetic activity, especially during rest or relaxation. B. Decreased conduction: Parasympathetic stimulation slows conduction through the heart, especially at the atrioventricular (AV) node. This effect is part of the overall response to reduce heart rate and delay conduction, allowing more time for ventricular filling. Therefore, decreased conduction is a typical response to parasympathetic activation. D. Increased refractive period: The parasympathetic stimulation increases the refractive period of the heart, which means the heart becomes less excitable and less prone to arrhythmias. This helps to protect the heart from abnormal electrical activity and is another common effect of parasympathetic stimulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 300-400%. Explanation for correct response (D): Cardiac reserve refers to the ability of the heart to increase its output during times of increased demand, such as during exercise. In a healthy adult, cardiac reserve is typically around 300-400% of the resting cardiac output. This means the heart is capable of significantly increasing its output, from a baseline at rest, to meet the demands of the body during intense physical activity or stress. This high level of adaptability is primarily due to increased heart rate and stroke volume during exercise. Explanation for incorrect responses: A. 50-100%: This range is too low for healthy adults in terms of cardiac reserve. While it might reflect minimal increases in cardiac output during moderate activity, it does not capture the full potential of the heart to increase output during exercise, which can be much higher. B. 100-200%: This range still underestimates the heart’s capability. In some well-trained individuals, this may be an acceptable increase in output during exercise, but the true cardiac reserve for a healthy adult is typically much higher. C. 200-250%: Although closer to the actual cardiac reserve, this range still doesn't fully reflect the upper limits of a healthy adult's cardiac reserve. It may apply to individuals with lower physical fitness, but for most healthy adults, cardiac reserve is typically 300-400%.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acts along with the cardiovagal centre (CVC) to maintain blood pressure. Explanation for correct response (C): The vasomotor center (VMC) plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure by controlling the diameter of blood vessels. It works in concert with the cardiovagal center (CVC) in the medulla, which is responsible for regulating heart rate. Together, they help maintain blood pressure by adjusting both the heart rate and the tone of blood vessels. The VMC primarily influences vasoconstriction and vasodilation, while the CVC affects heart rate through parasympathetic control. This coordination is essential for the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure, especially in response to changes in the body’s needs (e.g., during exercise or rest). Explanation for incorrect responses: A. Independent of corticohypothalamic inputs: This statement is incorrect because the vasomotor center is not independent of corticohypothalamic inputs. The VMC receives input from higher brain centers, including the hypothalamus and the cortex, which help modulate its activity in response to emotional or stress-related signals. These inputs are vital for regulating vascular tone and blood pressure under various conditions. B. Influenced by baroreceptor signals but not by chemoreceptors: This is incorrect because the VMC is influenced by both baroreceptor and chemoreceptor signals. Baroreceptors detect changes in blood pressure and help adjust vascular tone, while chemoreceptors sense changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, helping to adjust circulation accordingly. Both signals are crucial for the VMC’s proper function in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis. D. Essentially silent in sleep: This statement is inaccurate because the VMC is not completely silent during sleep. While it may be less active during deep sleep, it is still involved in regulating blood pressure and maintaining vascular tone. Blood pressure regulation continues even during sleep, albeit at a lower level of activity compared to waking states.",

Exercising individuals typically describe their pulse as \"fast\" and \"pounding\". This is due to an increase in HR and SV, respectively. These physiologic changes would be expected to increase BP dramatically. However, only a small increase in BP is typically seen during exercise. This is because exercising muscles release local vasodilatory factors that enable 85% of the total cardiac output to flow to them, providing oxygen and carrying away carbon dioxide.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 16 times Explanation: According to Poiseuille's law, blood flow (Q) through a vessel is directly proportional to the fourth power of the vessel's radius (r) and the pressure difference and inversely proportional to the length (L) and viscosity of the vessel: In this scenario, the left renal artery has a lumen radius reduced by half compared to the right renal artery. Since flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, a 50% reduction in radius results in a flow reduction factor of: 6.25% (0.5^4) * 100=6.25 Therefore, the flow in the left renal artery is reduced to approximately 6.25% of the flow in the right renal artery, indicating a reduction by a factor of about 16 times. Incorrect Options: B. 64 times: This would imply a 75% reduction in radius, which is not the case here. C. 8 times: This would correspond to a 12.5% reduction in radius, which does not align with the given information. D. 5 times: This would suggest a 20% reduction in radius, which is not consistent with the scenario described.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The patient’s neurologic involvement after total thyroidectomy is highly suggestive of primary hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism can result from conditions that alter parathyroid gland function. These include autoimmune conditions, surgical removal, impaired action of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and so on. PTH increases serum calcium and increases phosphate excretion. Inadequate PTH levels lead to hypocalcemia, resulting in neuronal excitability and tetany. Therefore, patients with hypocalcemia may present with Chvostek (facial muscle contraction secondary to facial nerve tapping) and Trousseau’s signs (carpopedal spasms secondary to sphygmomanometer inflation), tetany, paresthesias and even seizures. Cardiac involvement include QT prolongation, thus increased risk of arrhythmias.",
