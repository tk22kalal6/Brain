      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The tetanizing frequency of the muscle, based on the given diagram, is 25 per second. Tetanizing frequency = 1/contraction period. It is the frequency at which individual muscle fibres twitch that fuse and cause sustained muscle contraction, where the contraction period is the time taken from latent period to maximum force of contraction. In this case, the time tracer was taken using a 100Hz tuning fork. Which means the tracer recorded 100 waves per second for one time tracing its 100 -Hz so its duration is 1/100s or 0.01s now contraction period is 4 tracings so CP duration is 0.04s. So tetanizing frequency is 1/contraction period. Hence answer is 1/0.04s=25 Hz.",
