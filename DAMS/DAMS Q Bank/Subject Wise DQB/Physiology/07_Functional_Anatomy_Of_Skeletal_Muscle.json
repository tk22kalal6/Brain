      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) There are two ‘T’ tubules per sarcomere and has well developed sarcoplasmic reticulum. Skeletal muscle is highly excitable because of its specialized structural features that enable rapid transmission of electrical impulses. The T-tubules (transverse tubules) allow the action potential to quickly penetrate deep into the muscle fiber, ensuring that the muscle contracts efficiently and synchronously. The well-developed sarcoplasmic reticulum stores and releases calcium ions, which are essential for muscle contraction. These features together facilitate the rapid transmission of the action potential and the coordinated release of calcium, making skeletal muscle one of the most excitable tissues in the body. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option B (It is supplied by large myelinated nerve fibers): While skeletal muscle is indeed supplied by large myelinated nerve fibers, this alone does not explain its excitability. The myelination of nerve fibers increases the speed of nerve signal transmission, but it is the structural features of the muscle itself (such as T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) that make skeletal muscle excitable. The nerves do transmit signals, but muscle excitability is more related to its internal cellular mechanisms. Option C (It is nerve regulated): While it is true that skeletal muscle is regulated by nerve impulses, the fact that it is nerve regulated does not directly explain its excitability. Excitability refers to how quickly a tissue can respond to a stimulus, which is facilitated by the specialized structures mentioned in Option A (T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum). Nervous control is a factor in skeletal muscle function but not its excitability. Option D (None of the above): This option is incorrect because Option A correctly identifies the key structural features of skeletal muscle that make it highly excitable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Gap junction. In single-unit smooth muscle (also known as visceral smooth muscle), the cells are electrically coupled through gap junctions. Gap junctions are specialized intercellular connections that allow ions and small molecules to pass directly between adjacent cells. This electrical coupling enables coordinated contraction across the muscle, allowing the smooth muscle to function as a syncytium. In single-unit smooth muscle, gap junctions facilitate the spread of electrical signals (action potentials) from one muscle cell to another, ensuring that the muscle contracts as a single functional unit. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option A (Zonula adherens): Zonula adherens are adhesion junctions that help bind cells together but are not directly involved in electrical coupling or the spread of action potentials. These junctions are more commonly found in epithelial tissues and do not play a major role in the electrical communication that is characteristic of single-unit smooth muscle. Option B (Macula adherens): Macula adherens (also known as desmosomes) are specialized structures that anchor cells together, providing mechanical strength. While desmosomes are important in tissues that experience mechanical stress (e.g., heart muscle, skin), they are not involved in the electrical coupling required for coordinated contractions in single-unit smooth muscle. Option C (Tight junction): Tight junctions form barriers between cells to prevent the passage of materials between them. They are essential for maintaining selective permeability and barrier functions, especially in epithelial tissues. However, tight junctions do not allow the direct flow of ions or electrical signals between cells, so they do not contribute to the electrical coupling needed for coordinated contraction in single-unit smooth muscle.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Smooth muscle. Ca2+ channel blockers primarily affect smooth muscle function because smooth muscle contraction is highly dependent on the influx of calcium ions through calcium channels. When calcium enters the smooth muscle cells, it activates the calmodulin pathway, leading to the contraction of the muscle. By blocking calcium channels, calcium entry is reduced, and the ability of smooth muscle to contract is inhibited. This is why Ca2+ channel blockers are commonly used to treat conditions like hypertension or certain types of angina, as they relax the smooth muscle in blood vessels and reduce blood pressure. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option A (Skeletal muscle): This is incorrect. While skeletal muscle also relies on calcium for contraction, it does so through a different mechanism. In skeletal muscle, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (not from the extracellular fluid) upon stimulation, and the release of calcium inside the cell activates the contractile proteins (actin and myosin). Therefore, calcium channel blockers have little to no effect on skeletal muscle contraction, as the calcium required for contraction is primarily intracellular and not dependent on extracellular calcium influx. Option C (Both the above): This is incorrect because while calcium channel blockers do affect smooth muscle significantly, they have minimal to no effect on skeletal muscle function, as explained above. Thus, they do not have a significant effect on both types of muscle. Option D (Neither): This is incorrect. As mentioned, calcium channel blockers have a significant effect on smooth muscle function by inhibiting calcium influx, which disrupts muscle contraction. Therefore, \"neither\" is not a correct choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Both cardiac and skeletal muscles exhibit graded contraction. Cardiac muscle does not exhibit graded contraction in the same way that skeletal muscle does. Cardiac muscle fibers contract in an all-or-nothing manner due to the nature of the action potential and the resulting contraction. The force of contraction in cardiac muscle is primarily determined by the initial length of the muscle fibers (preload), but it does not exhibit the same graded response to stimulus strength as skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, the force of contraction can be varied (graded) by changing the number of motor units recruited or by increasing the frequency of stimulation (tetany). Therefore, graded contraction is not characteristic of cardiac muscle, making option A incorrect. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option B (Excitation-contraction coupling in both depends upon increased intracellular calcium): This is correct. Both cardiac and skeletal muscles rely on increased intracellular calcium for excitation-contraction coupling. In skeletal muscle, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to the action potential, and in cardiac muscle, calcium influx from the extracellular fluid (through L-type calcium channels) and subsequent release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum are essential for contraction. Option C (Excitation-contraction coupling is not dependent on extracellular Ca²? in skeletal muscle): This is correct. In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction coupling mainly depends on calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum rather than extracellular calcium. While extracellular calcium does contribute to action potential generation, the actual contraction is triggered by intracellular calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Option D (Cardiac action potential has a plateau and a longer refractory period): This is correct. Cardiac action potentials have a characteristic plateau phase, where the membrane potential stays depolarized for an extended period due to the influx of calcium ions. This plateau helps prevent the muscle from undergoing tetany (sustained contraction) and ensures that the heart has time to relax between beats. The cardiac refractory period is also longer than in skeletal muscle to allow for proper relaxation and filling of the heart chambers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increase in the strength of action potential increases contraction. In skeletal muscle, the strength of contraction is not dependent on the strength of the action potential. Instead, it is dependent on the frequency of action potentials (tetanus) and the number of motor units recruited. A single action potential results in a single twitch contraction, and the strength of the muscle contraction is modulated by recruiting more muscle fibers (motor units) and increasing the frequency of stimulation, not by increasing the strength of the action potential itself. Therefore, increasing the strength of the action potential does not increase contraction. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option A (Preceded by action potential): This is correct. Skeletal muscle contraction is always preceded by an action potential. The action potential is generated in the motor neuron and propagated along the muscle fiber membrane, leading to the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers the muscle contraction. Option B (Recruitment of more number of fibers produces more contraction): This is correct. The force of skeletal muscle contraction increases with the recruitment of more motor units (fibers). Smaller motor units are recruited first, and as the intensity of the stimulus increases, larger motor units are recruited, leading to a stronger contraction. Option D (Increase in initial length of muscle fiber increases tension generated): This is correct. According to the length-tension relationship, an increase in the initial length of the muscle fiber (within physiological limits) results in an increase in the tension generated by the muscle. This happens because the optimal overlap between actin and myosin filaments is achieved when the muscle is at an optimal length..",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) H The H band disappears during muscular contraction. The H band is the region within the sarcomere where only myosin filaments (thick filaments) are present. During contraction, the actin filaments (thin filaments) slide over the myosin filaments, causing the H band to narrow and eventually disappear as the actin and myosin filaments overlap completely. This overlap is a key characteristic of the contraction process, which shortens the sarcomere. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option B (I band): This is incorrect because the I band does not disappear during muscular contraction. The I band is the region of the sarcomere where only actin filaments are present. During contraction, the I band becomes narrower as the actin filaments slide over the myosin filaments, but it does not disappear completely. Option C (A band): This is incorrect because the A band does not change in length during contraction. The A band represents the full length of the myosin filaments, which do not shorten. As the sarcomere contracts, the A band remains the same length because the thick myosin filaments do not change size, although their relative position changes.

The Z line anchors the thin actin filaments, and it moves closer together as the sarcomere shortens during contraction. However, it does not disappear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Excitability Chronaxie refers to the time required to stimulate a nerve or muscle using a stimulus of twice the threshold strength. It is a measure of the excitability of nerve or muscle tissues. A lower chronaxie indicates that the tissue is more excitable, as it takes less time to trigger a response with a given stimulus intensity. This property is useful in assessing the responsiveness of tissues to electrical stimuli and plays a significant role in understanding neuromuscular function. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Magnitude of the current): This is incorrect because chronaxie does not directly measure the magnitude of the current. Instead, it relates to the time duration needed for a stimulus to evoke a response at a given intensity. While the magnitude of the current affects the threshold and the strength-duration curve, it is not what chronaxie specifically measures. Option B (Rate of discharge): This is incorrect because chronaxie is not related to the rate of nerve or muscle discharge (firing frequency). The rate of discharge refers to how frequently action potentials are generated, whereas chronaxie concerns the time required to achieve an action potential at a fixed current intensity. Option C (Velocity of nerve conduction): This is incorrect because chronaxie does not measure the velocity of nerve conduction. The velocity of conduction is determined by factors such as the axon diameter and myelination, not by the stimulus duration or intensity associated with chronaxie.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increased muscle metabolism by excess of calcium ions In malignant hyperthermia (MH), a mutation in the gene coding for the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) causes an abnormal release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscles. This results in uncontrolled muscle contraction and hypermetabolism. The excess calcium ions in the muscle cells activate pathways that increase ATP consumption, which leads to excessive heat production as a byproduct of muscle metabolism. This hypermetabolic state is a key feature of MH, leading to a dangerous rise in body temperature. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option B (Thermic effect of food): This is incorrect because the thermic effect of food refers to the energy expenditure associated with digestion, absorption, and metabolism of food, which is unrelated to the mechanisms involved in malignant hyperthermia. MH results from a genetic mutation affecting calcium regulation, not from eating or digestion processes. Option C (Increased sympathetic discharge): This is incorrect because while sympathetic discharge can lead to increased metabolic rate and heat production in certain conditions (e.g., stress or fever), it is not the primary cause of the extreme temperature rise seen in malignant hyperthermia. The cause of the increased heat in MH is the dysregulated calcium release in muscle cells, not increased sympathetic activity. Option D (Mitochondrial thermogenesis): This is incorrect because mitochondrial thermogenesis refers to heat production by mitochondria, particularly in brown adipose tissue. While mitochondrial activity contributes to heat generation, it is not the primary mechanism responsible for the excessive heat production in malignant hyperthermia, which is driven by muscle cell metabolism and calcium ion dysregulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nerve Chronaxie is the minimum time required for a stimulus to produce a threshold response when the stimulus is twice the rheobase (the minimal current required to produce a response). Nerve tissue has the least chronaxie, meaning it is the most excitable of the listed tissues. This is because nerves are specialized for rapid transmission of electrical signals and, therefore, require minimal time to generate an action potential in response to a stimulus. This rapid responsiveness is a key feature of nerve fibers, facilitating quick communication between different parts of the body. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Smooth muscle): This is incorrect because smooth muscle has a longer chronaxie compared to nerve tissue. Smooth muscle fibers have a slower contraction response to stimuli, and the duration required for the stimulus to generate a contraction is longer than that of nerve fibers. Option B (Cardiac muscle): This is incorrect because cardiac muscle also has a relatively longer chronaxie compared to nerve tissue. Cardiac muscle cells are designed to contract rhythmically and sustain contractions over a longer period, requiring more time to respond to a given stimulus than nerve fibers. Option C (Skeletal muscle): This is incorrect because skeletal muscle, while relatively quick to respond to stimuli, still has a longer chronaxie than nerve tissue. Skeletal muscle contractions are more powerful and longer-lasting, which requires more time for a stimulus to produce a response when compared to nerve tissue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fibrillation Fibrillation refers to the fine, irregular contraction of individual muscle fibers, often observed in conditions like muscle denervation or certain neuromuscular diseases. Unlike the more coordinated contractions of muscle groups, fibrillations are spontaneous and result from the individual muscle fibers contracting independently due to abnormal electrical activity. This is often seen in electromyography (EMG) readings, where small, involuntary muscle twitches are detected. Fibrillations are often associated with more severe muscle or nerve damage. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Fasciculations): This is incorrect because fasciculations are involuntary contractions of a group of muscle fibers, leading to visible twitching under the skin. They are larger, coordinated contractions compared to fibrillations, which involve individual fibers contracting in isolation. Fasciculations can occur in both normal and pathological conditions. Option C (Tics): This is incorrect because tics refer to repetitive, involuntary, rapid muscle movements or vocalizations that can be controlled to some extent. They are more generalized than the fine, irregular contractions of fibrillation and often affect larger muscle groups or involve vocal cords. Option D (Spasm): This is incorrect because a spasm refers to an abnormal muscle contraction that is often sustained and more generalized, leading to the muscle feeling tight or painful. Unlike fibrillation, spasms involve the whole muscle or large portions of it, not individual fibers contracting independently.",

It is a type of heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is primarily found in the extracellular matrix of various tissues, including muscle, but it is not specifically a sarcolemmal protein. It plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, but it is not directly associated with the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) of muscle cells. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Sarcoglycan): This is incorrect because sarcoglycans are sarcolemmal proteins that are part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. They are integral to maintaining the structural integrity of the muscle cell membrane and are involved in the link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Option B (Dystrophin): This is incorrect because dystrophin is another key sarcolemmal protein. It forms part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which helps stabilize the muscle cell membrane and protect it from damage during contraction. Mutations in dystrophin are linked to Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Option C (Dystroglycan): This is incorrect because dystroglycan is also a sarcolemmal protein that is crucial in linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sarcolemmal proteins Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the sarcolemmal proteins of muscle fibers. The disease is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, which codes for the protein dystrophin, a sarcolemmal protein that connects the cytoskeleton of muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix. Without dystrophin, muscle fibers become unstable and more prone to damage, leading to progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Neuromuscular junction): This is incorrect because Duchenne muscular dystrophy does not primarily affect the neuromuscular junction. The issue in DMD lies in the structural integrity of the muscle cell membrane due to defective dystrophin, not in the transmission of signals at the neuromuscular junction. Option C (Muscle contractile protein): This is incorrect because Duchenne muscular dystrophy is not a disorder of the muscle contractile proteins (actin and myosin). The defect in DMD lies in the dystrophin protein, which does not directly affect the muscle contractile proteins but rather impacts the integrity of the muscle membrane. Option D (Disuse atrophy due to muscle weakness): This is incorrect because disuse atrophy refers to muscle wasting due to lack of use, whereas Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that leads to muscle degeneration and weakness due to structural problems within the muscle fibers, specifically due to the absence or dysfunction of dystrophin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Increased isoenzyme ATPase activity Type 2 muscle fibers, also known as fast-twitch fibers, are characterized by an increased isoenzyme ATPase activity. This allows them to generate rapid, powerful contractions as they can quickly break down ATP to release energy. Type 2 fibers are adapted for short bursts of intense activity, and the high ATPase activity supports fast muscle contraction. These fibers tend to fatigue faster than Type 1 fibers but are more efficient at generating short, explosive forces. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Increased myoglobin): Myoglobin is a protein that binds oxygen, and it is more prevalent in Type 1 fibers (slow-twitch fibers), which are designed for endurance and oxidative metabolism. Type 2 fibers, especially Type 2b, have lower myoglobin content and rely more on anaerobic pathways for energy production. Therefore, increased myoglobin is not a characteristic of Type 2 fibers. Option B (It is slower, oxidative, and red): This description applies to Type 1 fibers (slow-twitch fibers), not Type 2 fibers. Type 1 fibers are slow to contract, more oxidative (relying on oxygen for energy), and are red due to the high myoglobin content. In contrast, Type 2 fibers are fast-twitch, can be glycolytic (relying more on anaerobic metabolism), and are typically white in color due to lower myoglobin. Option D (Glycolytic capacity - moderate): Type 2 muscle fibers, particularly Type 2b, have a high glycolytic capacity, as they predominantly rely on anaerobic metabolism to generate energy quickly for short bursts of activity. They are adapted for explosive movements like sprinting or weightlifting. The term \"moderate\" would not accurately describe their glycolytic capacity, as it is usually considered high in these fibers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Actin The thin filament in muscle fibers is primarily composed of actin. Actin is a globular protein that polymerizes to form long, thin helical filaments, which are the primary structural components of the thin filament. Actin interacts with myosin during muscle contraction, forming cross-bridges that generate force. This process is a key part of the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. Actin is also associated with other regulatory proteins, but it forms the backbone of the thin filament structure. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option B (Myosin): Myosin is the primary component of the thick filament in muscle fibers, not the thin filament. Myosin filaments are responsible for generating force during contraction by interacting with the actin filaments. While myosin does interact with actin, it is not part of the thin filament itself. Option C (Tropomyosin): Tropomyosin is a regulatory protein that binds to actin filaments in muscle fibers. It plays a role in regulating muscle contraction by blocking the binding sites on actin for myosin when the muscle is at rest. While tropomyosin is associated with the thin filament, it is not the main component. Tropomyosin acts in conjunction with other regulatory proteins like troponin, but actin is the primary structural protein in the thin filament. Option D (Dystrophin): Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein that helps link the muscle's contractile proteins (actin) to the extracellular matrix. It plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers. However, it is not part of the thin filament itself, and mutations in the dystrophin gene lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin is important for the stability of muscle fibers but does not directly contribute to the structure of the thin filament.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Calcium binds to tropomyosin to initiate muscle contraction The statement \"Calcium binds to tropomyosin to initiate muscle contraction\" is incorrect. In fact, calcium does not bind directly to tropomyosin. Instead, calcium ions bind to troponin, which causes a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex. This change moves tropomyosin away from the binding sites on actin, allowing the interaction between actin and myosin, which is the key event in muscle contraction. Explanation of the Correct Statements: Option A (Acetylcholine is released at the nerve terminal): This statement is correct. Acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the nerve terminal at the neuromuscular junction in response to an action potential. ACh then binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle cell membrane, leading to the depolarization of the muscle fiber and initiating the excitation-contraction coupling process. Option B (Calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during relaxation): This statement is also correct. After muscle contraction, calcium is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the Ca²?-ATPase pump (also called the SERCA pump). This decreases the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm, leading to muscle relaxation. Option C (Calcium is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum during contraction): This statement is correct. Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in response to the action potential that travels along the muscle membrane and down the T-tubules. The release of calcium into the cytoplasm enables the interaction between actin and myosin, leading to contraction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Terminal cistern In skeletal muscles, calcium ions are primarily stored in the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The terminal cisternae are specialized regions of the SR that are adjacent to the transverse tubules (T-tubules) and store calcium ions in a high concentration. When a muscle is stimulated by an action potential, calcium is released from the terminal cisternae into the cytoplasm, triggering the contraction process by binding to troponin, which allows the interaction of actin and myosin filaments. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Transverse tubule): The transverse (T) tubules are invaginations of the sarcolemma (cell membrane) that help conduct the action potential into the interior of the muscle fiber. While T-tubules are important for transmitting electrical signals, they do not store calcium ions. Instead, calcium is released from the terminal cisternae when the T-tubules carry the action potential. Option B (Longitudinal part): The longitudinal part of the sarcoplasmic reticulum refers to the sections of the SR that run parallel to the length of the muscle fiber. While the SR as a whole is involved in calcium storage, it is the terminal cisternae, specifically, that are responsible for the release of calcium during muscle contraction. The longitudinal parts play a role in calcium reuptake, but not in its release. Option D (Sarcolemma): The sarcolemma is the muscle cell membrane, and while it is involved in the transmission of the action potential (via the T-tubules), it is not the storage site for calcium. Calcium ions are released from the terminal cisternae of the SR, not directly from the sarcolemma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) GLUT-4 Transporter In resting skeletal muscles, glucose uptake primarily occurs through the GLUT-4 transporter. GLUT-4 is an insulin-sensitive glucose transporter found in muscle cells, adipocytes, and the heart. When insulin binds to its receptor, it triggers the translocation of GLUT-4 transporters to the cell membrane, allowing glucose to enter the muscle cells. This process is especially important after meals, when blood glucose levels are elevated. In resting muscles, glucose is taken up and used either for energy or stored as glycogen. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (GLUT-1 Transporter): The GLUT-1 transporter is primarily involved in the basal glucose uptake that occurs in tissues with a constant need for glucose, such as the brain and red blood cells. It is responsible for maintaining basal glucose levels and is not primarily involved in skeletal muscle glucose uptake, which is more reliant on insulin and the GLUT-4 transporter. Option B (GLUT-2 Transporter): The GLUT-2 transporter is found in the liver, pancreas, kidney, and intestines. It facilitates bidirectional glucose transport, meaning it can transport glucose both into and out of cells depending on the concentration gradient. It is involved in glucose sensing and regulation, particularly in the pancreas, but it is not the primary transporter used by resting skeletal muscle. Option C (GLUT-3 Transporter): The GLUT-3 transporter is mainly expressed in neurons and has a high affinity for glucose. It is important in tissues that require a constant and high uptake of glucose, like the brain, but it is not involved in glucose uptake in skeletal muscles during rest. Skeletal muscles predominantly use GLUT-4 for this purpose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Myosin Myosin is the protein responsible for generating the force required for muscle contraction. Myosin has ATPase activity, which means it can hydrolyze ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) during the muscle contraction cycle. This ATPase activity is crucial for the power stroke of myosin heads in both skeletal and smooth muscles. When myosin binds to actin and hydrolyzes ATP, it changes shape, pulling the actin filament and generating muscle contraction. The ATP hydrolysis provides the energy needed for this process, which is essential for muscle contraction. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Actin): Actin is a structural protein that forms the thin filaments of muscle fibers and is involved in the sliding filament model of contraction. While actin plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by interacting with myosin, it does not have ATPase activity. Actin's primary function is to serve as a track for myosin's movement, not to hydrolyze ATP. Option C (Troponin): Troponin is a regulatory protein complex associated with actin filaments. It plays a key role in muscle contraction by regulating the interaction between actin and myosin in response to calcium levels. However, troponin does not have ATPase activity. It is involved in binding calcium ions and facilitating muscle contraction but does not directly hydrolyze ATP. Option D (None): This option is incorrect because myosin does have ATPase activity, which is the primary role in muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Accumulation of Calcium The increased contraction after a tetanizing stimulus is primarily due to the accumulation of calcium ions in the muscle fibers. When a muscle is stimulated at a high frequency (tetanic stimulation), there is insufficient time for calcium ions to be pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum between individual stimulations. As a result, calcium accumulates in the cytoplasm, leading to prolonged activation of the contractile proteins (actin and myosin) and causing a sustained contraction. This phenomenon is essential for achieving the tetanic contraction, where the muscle generates a maximal force without relaxation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Recruitment phenomenon): The recruitment phenomenon refers to the process of increasing the number of active motor units to increase muscle force. While recruitment does contribute to increased muscle force, it is not the primary cause of the increased contraction during tetanic stimulation. In tetanus, the contraction is due to the increased frequency of stimulation rather than the recruitment of additional motor units. Option C (Contraction of different muscle fibers at different places): This option is not correct because tetanus involves the sustained contraction of the muscle fibers due to the high-frequency stimulation rather than varying contraction of fibers at different locations. While individual muscle fibers may contract at different times during normal muscle activity, during tetanus, all fibers within a motor unit contract in unison. Option D (All of the above): This option is incorrect because not all the listed phenomena contribute to the increased contraction in tetanic stimulation. While recruitment and variation in fiber contraction may play a role in normal muscle function, the accumulation of calcium is the primary mechanism responsible for the sustained contraction in response to tetanizing stimuli.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 25 Hz To calculate the tetanizing frequency (the frequency required to achieve a sustained contraction), we need to understand the relationship between the different phases of muscle contraction. The muscle twitch cycle consists of three main phases: • Latent period: The delay between the stimulus and the start of contraction (10 ms). • Contraction time: The period during which the muscle fibers shorten (40 ms). • Relaxation time: The period during which the muscle returns to its resting length (50 ms). The total twitch cycle time is the sum of the latent period, contraction time, and relaxation time: Total cycle time=10ms+40ms+50ms=100ms Now, to determine the tetanizing frequency, we take the reciprocal of the total cycle time. The frequency of stimulation required for tetanus is the inverse of the twitch cycle time: Tetanizing frequency = 1/Total cycle time = 1/100ms = 1/0.1seconds =10Hz However, tetanus typically occurs at higher frequencies, around twice the frequency of the individual twitch cycle. Hence, we double the calculated frequency to achieve the sustained tetanic contraction. In this case: Tetanizing frequency=2×10?Hz=25?Hz Therefore, the correct tetanizing frequency for this muscle is 25 Hz. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B (50 Hz): This frequency is too high for the given twitch characteristics. For tetanus, we typically look for a frequency that allows the muscle fibers to be stimulated enough times to maintain a continuous contraction, but 50 Hz would be an overestimate, as the twitch cycle time (100 ms) suggests a tetanizing frequency of 25 Hz. Option C (100 Hz): A frequency of 100 Hz would be too rapid and might not allow for optimal contraction, as this would exceed the threshold where individual twitches merge into a sustained contraction. This could result in a \"fused\" tetanus, but it is still higher than required for a muscle with this given twitch cycle. Option D (75 Hz): Similar to 50 Hz, 75 Hz would be too high. While higher frequencies can cause sustained contraction, they can also lead to excessive fatigue or inefficient force production. For the given twitch parameters, the correct tetanizing frequency is closer to 25 Hz, not 75 Hz.",

It includes both the overlap between thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments as well as the region where the thick filaments do not overlap with the thin filaments. In an electron micrograph of a sarcomere, the A-band appears as a dark band due to the overlapping thick and thin filaments, which scatter electrons more effectively. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B (I-Band): The I-band is the region that contains only thin (actin) filaments and appears light on an electron micrograph. It is the area that does not contain thick myosin filaments. It lies between two A-bands, and there is a Z-line running through the center of the I-band, which helps define the boundary of each sarcomere. Therefore, the area labeled \"A\" cannot be the I-band. Option C (M-Band): The M-band is located at the center of the A-band and consists of proteins that help anchor the thick myosin filaments. The M-band is not visible as a distinct band in standard electron micrographs; it is a narrow region within the A-band. Since the question is referring to a larger structure, the M-band is not the correct answer. Option D (H-zone): The H-zone is the portion of the A-band where only myosin filaments are present without overlapping actin filaments. The H-zone is visible as a lighter region in the middle of the A-band. It is the area where there is no overlap between thick and thin filaments.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phosphocreatine The rapid source of energy for exercising muscles is phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy phosphate compound stored in muscles. During short bursts of intense activity, phosphocreatine donates its phosphate group to ADP to quickly regenerate ATP, which is crucial for muscle contraction. This process happens rapidly and is a key energy source during the initial stages of exercise or during activities that require sudden, explosive strength. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Glycolysis): Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate to produce ATP. While glycolysis provides energy, it is not as immediate or as fast as phosphocreatine. It takes longer to initiate compared to the direct ATP regeneration from phosphocreatine. Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, but it requires a bit more time to generate ATP than phosphocreatine, which is why it is not the most rapid energy source. Option B (Glycogenolysis): Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose to provide energy. While glycogenolysis provides fuel for ATP production through glycolysis, it is a slower process than the utilization of phosphocreatine. Glycogenolysis provides energy for longer-term or sustained exercise but not the immediate burst of energy required for high-intensity activities. Option C (TCA cycle): The TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle or Krebs cycle) is part of aerobic respiration and produces ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. However, it is a slower process compared to the immediate energy provided by phosphocreatine. The TCA cycle is crucial for sustained, long-duration energy production, but it is not the rapid source of ATP required for short, intense bursts of exercise.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Zona Occludens Zona occludens are tight junctions that help to seal adjacent cells together and regulate the passage of molecules between them. They are typically found in epithelial tissues and not in cardiac muscle, where the intercalated discs are located. In the region of the intercalated disc, tight junctions like zona occludens are not present. Instead, intercalated discs consist of desmosomes and gap junctions, which play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and communication in cardiac muscle cells. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Macula Adherens): Macula adherens, also known as desmosomes, are part of the intercalated discs. These junctions help to anchor cardiac muscle cells together and provide mechanical stability during contraction. They are present in the region marked in the image, contributing to the mechanical integrity of cardiac muscle tissue. Option B (Intercalated Disc): Intercalated discs are specialized junctions that connect cardiac muscle cells to one another. They contain both desmosomes (macula adherens) and gap junctions (connexons), which facilitate mechanical and electrical coupling between the cells. This ensures coordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle. Intercalated discs are present in the region marked in the image.

They are present in the intercalated discs of cardiac muscle, facilitating the rapid transmission of electrical signals between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. This allows for coordinated contraction of the heart. Connexons are part of the functional proteins seen in the marked region.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) +80 Correct Answer: (B) +80 pA At the resting state, the total net current across the cell membrane must be zero to maintain a stable membrane potential. This follows the principle of electroneutrality, meaning that the sum of all individual ion currents should be zero: IX+IY+IZ=0 Given: IX=?30 pA IY?=?50 pA Iz=? Substituting values into the equation: ?30+(?50)+IZ=0 ?80+IZ=0 IZ=+80 pA Incorrect Options (A) +40 pA: If Z carried +40 pA, the total current would be: ?30+(?50)+40=?40/=0 Since this does not satisfy the condition of net zero current, this answer is incorrect. (C) -10 pA: If Z had -10 pA, the total current would be: ?30+(?50)+(?10)=?90/=0 Since the sum is not zero, this choice is also incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Innervated by larger nerve fibers. Explanation: Muscle A exhibits a rapid, single isometric twitch contraction in response to a depolarizing stimulus. This characteristic suggests that Muscle A is composed of fast-twitch fibers, which are typically innervated by larger, myelinated nerve fibers. These larger nerve fibers, classified as Type A? fibers, have a larger diameter and faster conduction velocity, enabling rapid transmission of action potentials to the muscle fibers. This rapid transmission is essential for the quick contraction observed in fast-twitch muscle fibers. Incorrect options: A. Adapted for slow and sustained contraction: This describes slow-twitch fibers, which are adapted for endurance and sustained contractions. They are typically innervated by smaller, slower-conducting nerve fibers. B. Composed of smaller muscle fibers: Fast-twitch fibers are generally larger in diameter compared to slow-twitch fibers. Therefore, Muscle A is more likely composed of larger muscle fibers. C. More mitochondrion: Slow-twitch fibers have a higher number of mitochondria to support sustained aerobic activity. Fast-twitch fibers, on the other hand, rely more on anaerobic metabolism and have fewer mitochondria.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Power stroke. Explanation: In the myosin-actin cross-bridge cycle, the power stroke is the step where the myosin head pivots, pulling the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere, resulting in muscle contraction. This movement is driven by the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the myosin head. If a drug selectively inhibits Pi release, the power stroke cannot occur, as Pi release is essential for this step. PUBMED Incorrect options: A. Myosin head release from actin: This step involves the binding of ATP to the myosin head, causing it to detach from actin. Inhibition of Pi release does not directly affect this detachment process. B. Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin: This step is regulated by the binding of calcium ions to troponin, which shifts tropomyosin to expose myosin-binding sites on actin. Inhibition of Pi release does not interfere with this calcium-mediated process. C. Myosin head binding to actin: This step occurs after the myosin head has detached from actin and is re-energized by ATP hydrolysis. Inhibition of Pi release does not prevent the myosin head from binding to actin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) They are in parallel with extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers. Explanation: Muscle spindles are specialized sensory receptors located within the belly of skeletal muscles. They are arranged in parallel with the extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the primary contractile fibers responsible for generating muscle force. This parallel arrangement allows muscle spindles to detect changes in muscle length and contribute to the regulation of muscle contraction through the stretch reflex. WIKIPEDIA Incorrect options: A. They activate inhibitory interneurons: While muscle spindle afferent neurons can synapse with inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, this is not a defining characteristic of muscle spindles themselves. B. They are in series with extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers: This describes the arrangement of Golgi tendon organs, not muscle spindles. Golgi tendon organs are located in series with muscle fibers and are involved in detecting changes in muscle tension. D. They are innervated by group Ib afferent neurons: Group Ib afferent neurons primarily innervate Golgi tendon organs. Muscle spindles are primarily innervated by group Ia and II afferent neurons.",
