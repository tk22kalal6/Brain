      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid). GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). It functions by binding to GABA receptors (GABA-A and GABA-B), leading to hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. This hyperpolarization occurs due to an influx of chloride ions (through GABA-A receptors) or efflux of potassium ions (through GABA-B receptors), which makes it less likely for the neuron to fire an action potential. GABA plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain, preventing overexcitation and regulating neuronal activity. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Glutamate: This is incorrect because glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, not inhibitory. It binds to receptors such as AMPA, NMDA, and kainate, leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane and an increased likelihood of action potential generation. While essential for learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity, it is not inhibitory. B. Aspartate: This is incorrect because aspartate is another excitatory neurotransmitter, similar to glutamate. It activates NMDA receptors and promotes depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. It does not have an inhibitory function in the CNS. D. Somatostatin: This is incorrect because somatostatin is a peptide neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, not an amino acid. While somatostatin can have inhibitory effects on the release of other hormones and neurotransmitters, it is not considered a primary inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter like GABA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine). Noradrenaline is the primary neurotransmitter released at the end organ effectors of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), except in a few specific cases like sweat glands, where acetylcholine is released. Noradrenaline binds to adrenergic receptors (alpha and beta receptors) on the target tissues, mediating the effects of sympathetic activation. These effects include increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, and energy mobilization, which prepare the body for \"fight or flight\" responses. The release of noradrenaline from postganglionic sympathetic neurons ensures that the effector organs respond appropriately to stress or emergencies. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Adrenaline: This is incorrect because adrenaline (epinephrine) is primarily released by the adrenal medulla into the bloodstream as a hormone, not a neurotransmitter at synaptic junctions. While adrenaline works alongside noradrenaline in the \"fight or flight\" response, it is not the primary neurotransmitter released by sympathetic nerve endings. C. Dopamine: This is incorrect because dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in specific pathways in the central nervous system, such as the reward pathway and motor control, but it is not the major neurotransmitter at end organ effectors of the sympathetic nervous system. Dopamine plays a minor role in the sympathetic nervous system, primarily in renal vasculature where it causes vasodilation. D. Acetylcholine: This is incorrect because acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by preganglionic sympathetic neurons and at certain specialized postganglionic synapses, such as sweat glands. However, it is not the primary neurotransmitter at most sympathetic end organ effectors, where noradrenaline predominates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cholinergic. Synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia is predominantly cholinergic, meaning it involves the release of acetylcholine (ACh) as the neurotransmitter. In both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system, the preganglionic neurons release ACh at the synapse in the ganglia, which then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the postganglionic neurons. This binding generates an excitatory postsynaptic potential, leading to the activation of the postganglionic neuron, which subsequently releases its neurotransmitter at the target organ. This mechanism ensures efficient communication within the autonomic nervous system. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Adrenergic: This is incorrect because adrenergic transmission, which involves the release of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), occurs at the postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals in most target organs, not in the autonomic ganglia. Adrenergic transmission is not involved in the pre-to-postganglionic synapse. B. Peptidergic: This is incorrect because peptidergic transmission, involving neuropeptides as neurotransmitters, is not the primary mechanism in autonomic ganglia. While neuropeptides may act as co-transmitters in some cases to modulate synaptic activity, they do not play the primary role in ganglionic transmission. D. Mediated by substance P: This is incorrect because substance P, a neuropeptide, is not the main neurotransmitter involved in autonomic ganglia. Substance P is more commonly associated with pain transmission in sensory pathways and certain modulatory functions, not as the principal mediator of ganglionic transmission.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Contraction of Skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine (ACh) acts through nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction to cause the contraction of skeletal muscles. When ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on the muscle fibers, it triggers a depolarization of the muscle cell membrane, leading to muscle contraction. This mechanism is key in voluntary muscle movement. B. Decrease of heart rate: The decrease in heart rate is mediated by acetylcholine through muscarinic receptors, not nicotinic receptors. When ACh binds to muscarinic receptors in the heart, it reduces the heart rate by inhibiting the action of the sinoatrial node. C. Secretion of Saliva: Salivary secretion is also mediated by muscarinic receptors, specifically M3 receptors, in the salivary glands. While acetylcholine plays a role in stimulating saliva production, this occurs through muscarinic receptors, not nicotinic receptors. D. Contraction of pupils: The contraction of pupils (miosis) is mediated by acetylcholine through muscarinic receptors in the iris sphincter muscle. Again, this is a muscarinic, not a nicotinic, receptor action.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) CO2. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a selective barrier that restricts the movement of certain substances from the bloodstream into the brain. It is maximally permeable to gases like CO2 and oxygen, which can freely diffuse across the barrier due to their small size and lipophilic properties. This allows CO2 to easily enter the brain, where it can participate in regulating blood flow and pH balance. A. Na+: Sodium ions (Na+) are not freely permeable through the blood-brain barrier. The BBB restricts the passage of most ions, including sodium, to maintain the brain's precise ionic environment. Sodium transport across the BBB is tightly regulated through specialized transporters, not simple diffusion. B. K+: Potassium ions (K+) also do not freely diffuse through the blood-brain barrier. Like sodium, potassium is subject to active transport mechanisms that help maintain the brain's homeostasis. This regulation ensures that potassium levels in the brain are carefully controlled, preventing excessive accumulation or depletion. C. Chloride: Chloride ions (Cl-) are similarly restricted in their ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier. The permeability to chloride is low compared to gases like CO2, and the transport of chloride across the barrier is regulated through specific ion channels and transporters.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Olfactory. The olfactory receptors are specialized sensory neurons, and the receptor itself is actually the dendrite of the olfactory nerve. These dendrites extend into the olfactory epithelium, where they interact with odor molecules. When the olfactory receptors detect an odor, they generate an action potential that travels along the olfactory nerve directly to the brain, specifically the olfactory bulb. Therefore, in the case of olfaction, the receptor is the nerve itself. B. Gustatory: The gustatory receptors (taste receptors) are specialized cells located in taste buds. These receptors are not dendrites of sensory neurons, but rather cells that activate sensory neurons when they detect chemicals in food. The sensory neurons then send the information to the brain. Therefore, taste receptors are not dendrites themselves. C. Visual: The visual receptors are located in the retina of the eye, specifically in the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones). These cells convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The visual receptors are not dendrites; they are specialized cells that detect light, and the signals they generate are transmitted by the axons of retinal ganglion cells. D. Hearing: The hearing receptors, known as hair cells, are located in the cochlea of the inner ear. These cells detect sound vibrations and convert them into electrical signals. However, like visual and gustatory receptors, the hair cells themselves are not dendrites. They are specialized cells, and the signals they generate are transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cl- influx. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) are typically caused by the influx of chloride ions (Cl-) into the postsynaptic neuron. When a neurotransmitter (such as GABA) binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, it opens chloride channels, allowing chloride ions to flow into the neuron. This influx of negatively charged chloride ions makes the inside of the neuron more negative, hyperpolarizing the membrane and making it less likely to fire an action potential. This inhibitory effect is what constitutes the IPSP. B. K+ influx: The influx of potassium ions (K+) would generally lead to depolarization, not hyperpolarization. While potassium efflux (outflow) can contribute to the hyperpolarization that generates IPSPs, the influx of potassium itself would make the inside of the cell less negative and more likely to trigger an action potential. C. Na+ influx: The influx of sodium ions (Na+) leads to depolarization, which is associated with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), not IPSPs. Depolarization brings the membrane potential closer to the threshold for firing an action potential, whereas an IPSP makes the neuron less likely to fire by hyperpolarizing the membrane. D. Ca++ influx: The influx of calcium ions (Ca++) is typically involved in excitatory synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter release, particularly at synaptic terminals. While calcium plays a crucial role in activating neurotransmitter release and other cellular processes, it does not directly cause an IPSP. Instead, it is often associated with excitatory events in the neuron.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C, D) Na+ influx and D. Ca++ influx. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are primarily caused by the influx of sodium ions (Na+) and calcium ions (Ca++) into the postsynaptic neuron. When an excitatory neurotransmitter (such as glutamate) binds to its receptor, it opens ion channels that allow Na+ and Ca++ to flow into the cell. This influx of positively charged ions depolarizes the membrane, making the inside of the neuron less negative and closer to the threshold for firing an action potential. This depolarization is what constitutes an EPSP, increasing the likelihood that the neuron will generate an action potential. A. K+ influx: The influx of potassium ions (K+) is not typically associated with EPSPs. In fact, potassium efflux (outflow) would lead to hyperpolarization, making the neuron less likely to fire an action potential. Thus, K+ influx would not contribute to an EPSP. B. Na+ efflux: Sodium ion (Na+) efflux would have the opposite effect of an EPSP. The movement of Na+ out of the cell would cause hyperpolarization, not depolarization, making it less likely for the neuron to fire. Therefore, Na+ efflux does not contribute to EPSPs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dopamine. The nigrostriatal pathway is one of the major dopaminergic pathways in the brain. It originates in the substantia nigra (a region in the midbrain) and projects to the striatum, which is a key part of the basal ganglia involved in motor control. Dopamine plays a crucial role in regulating movement and coordination. Dysfunction of this pathway is associated with Parkinson's disease, where there is a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leading to motor deficits like tremors and rigidity. A. Serotonin: While serotonin is an important neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, sleep, and other functions, it is not the primary neurotransmitter in the nigrostriatal pathway. Serotonergic pathways are involved in other brain regions, particularly those regulating mood, arousal, and appetite, but not in motor control via the nigrostriatal pathway. C. Cholinergic: Cholinergic pathways involve the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These pathways are important in functions such as memory and muscle activation, but the nigrostriatal pathway primarily uses dopamine, not acetylcholine. There is, however, an interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in the basal ganglia, but acetylcholine is not the primary neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal pathway. D. Adrenergic: Adrenergic pathways use the neurotransmitters norepinephrine or epinephrine and are primarily involved in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, including responses to stress and arousal. These pathways do not play a major role in the nigrostriatal pathway, which is mainly dopaminergic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It occurs due to hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. Presynaptic inhibition involves a decrease in the neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. This phenomenon occurs when the presynaptic membrane undergoes hyperpolarization, making it less likely to reach the threshold potential needed to generate an action potential. As a result, less calcium influx occurs, and consequently, less neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft. This mechanism reduces the effectiveness of the synapse in transmitting the signal to the postsynaptic neuron. Incorrect options: A. It results due to failure of the action potential to reach the synapse: This is incorrect because presynaptic inhibition does not result from the failure of the action potential to reach the synapse. The action potential still reaches the presynaptic terminal, but the inhibition occurs because of a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane, which decreases the calcium influx required for neurotransmitter release. C. It occurs due to inhibition of release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal: This is partially true, but the mechanism behind it is not fully explained here. Presynaptic inhibition does involve a reduction in neurotransmitter release, but it specifically occurs due to the hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane, not just an inhibition of release. The option misses the underlying mechanism. D. It occurs due to blockade of neurotransmitter receptors: This option is incorrect because presynaptic inhibition is related to the presynaptic terminal's membrane potential, not the blockade of neurotransmitter receptors. Blockade of receptors would affect postsynaptic signaling, not presynaptic inhibition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Sweat gland secretion is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, but it is one of the few instances where acetylcholine, typically associated with parasympathetic signaling, is released by sympathetic fibers. In addition to acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is co-released to promote sweating. VIP acts as a vasodilator and helps increase blood flow to the sweat glands, thereby enhancing sweat secretion. Incorrect options: A. Neuro peptide Y: Neuropeptide Y is involved in various physiological processes, including regulating food intake and stress responses. It does not play a direct role in sweat gland secretion, making it an incorrect answer for this question. B. Enkephalin: Enkephalins are endogenous opioids involved in pain modulation and stress response. While they have various effects in the nervous system, they are not involved in the secretion of sweat from sweat glands. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Slow adapting. The receptors in the joint capsule and ligaments, such as Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles, are typically slow-adapting. These receptors are designed to provide continuous information about the position and movement of joints over time, which is important for proprioception and maintaining posture and balance. Their slow adaptation allows them to maintain a constant response to sustained joint position, providing ongoing feedback to the central nervous system about joint angle and tension. Incorrect options: B. Fast adapting: Fast-adapting receptors, such as Meissner’s corpuscles or Pacinian corpuscles, respond to changes in stimuli and are best suited for detecting dynamic or rapid changes in the environment, such as vibrations or light touch. Joint capsule and ligament receptors, however, are focused on the sustained position of joints and are not fast-adapting. C. Can be both slow and fast adapting: While some receptors can have both properties, joint capsule and ligament receptors are generally slow-adapting, as they provide continuous feedback about joint position rather than responding to rapid changes. Thus, they are not typically both slow and fast adapting. D. Non adapting: Non-adapting receptors do not change their firing rate over time, regardless of the stimulus. This is not characteristic of joint capsule and ligament receptors, which adapt to sustained stimuli but still provide ongoing feedback over time, making them slow-adapting rather than non-adapting.",

While it is involved in the synthesis of other important molecules like phospholipids and neurotransmitters, it does not directly act as a neurotransmitter in the same way as aspartate or glutamate. B. Glutathione: Glutathione is an antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress, rather than functioning as a neurotransmitter. It is involved in cellular detoxification processes but does not transmit signals across synapses. C.

It works by binding to glycine receptors, leading to an influx of chloride ions into the postsynaptic cell, which hyperpolarizes the cell and inhibits further action potential propagation. This inhibition is essential for regulating motor activity and preventing excessive excitation in the spinal cord. Incorrect options: A. Glutamic acid: Glutamic acid (or glutamate) is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It increases neuronal firing by binding to glutamate receptors, making it involved in excitatory, not inhibitory, signaling. Therefore, it is not responsible for inhibiting spinal cord activity. B. Aspartic acid: Similar to glutamic acid, aspartic acid (or aspartate) is also an excitatory neurotransmitter. It works in a similar manner as glutamate, enhancing neuronal activity rather than inhibiting it. Therefore, it is not responsible for inhibition in the spinal cord. D. Strychnine: Strychnine is a potent toxin that works by blocking glycine receptors, leading to a reduction in inhibition in the spinal cord. This causes excessive stimulation of motor neurons and can result in muscle spasms and convulsions. Thus, strychnine causes excitation rather than inhibition in the spinal cord.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Decrease in amplitude of Motor End Plate Potential. Rakesh's symptoms—difficulty reading newspapers, chewing his favorite food, and improvement with rest—suggest a neuromuscular disorder characterized by fatigable weakness. This pattern is indicative of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune condition where antibodies target acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to a decreased amplitude of the motor end plate potential (MEPP). A reduced MEPP amplitude means that the postsynaptic muscle membrane is less likely to reach the threshold for action potential generation, resulting in muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. Incorrect options: A. Increase in duration of absolute refractory period: An increased refractory period would impair the ability of neurons to fire action potentials rapidly, potentially leading to muscle weakness. However, this is not the primary mechanism in myasthenia gravis. B. Reduced Ca²+ release at the axonal ending: While calcium release is crucial for neurotransmitter release, a reduction in calcium release at the axonal ending is not the main cause of the symptoms described. C. Impaired excitation-contraction coupling: This refers to a failure in the process that links muscle excitation to contraction. While it can cause muscle weakness, it is not the primary mechanism in myasthenia gravis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 10L. Explanation: To determine the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, we can use the following steps: Calculate the total amount of mannitol distributed in the ECF: Initial amount injected: 10 grams Amount excreted in urine: 10% of 10 grams = 1 gram Amount remaining in ECF: 10 grams - 1 gram = 9 grams Convert the remaining mannitol to milligrams: 9 grams = 9,000 milligrams Determine the concentration of mannitol in the ECF: Given concentration: 90 mg per 100 mL Convert to mg per liter: 90 mg/100 mL = 900 mg/L Calculate the ECF volume: Volume (L) = Amount (mg) / Concentration (mg/L) Volume = 9,000 mg / 900 mg/L = 10 liters Incorrect options: B. 15L: This volume would correspond to a lower concentration of mannitol in the ECF, which does not match the given concentration of 90 mg/100 mL. C. 20L: Similarly, this volume would imply an even lower concentration of mannitol, inconsistent with the observed concentration. D. 12L: This volume would also suggest a concentration different from the measured 90 mg/100 mL, making it an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Projection of the fibers from neighboring sensory areas into the right hand area of his left S1. Explanation: Phantom limb pain occurs when the brain continues to perceive sensations in a limb that has been amputated. This phenomenon is associated with cortical reorganization, where the brain's sensory cortex (S1) undergoes changes in response to the loss of sensory input from the missing limb. In the case of a right-hand amputation, the area of S1 corresponding to the right hand may become responsive to sensory inputs from neighboring body parts, such as the face or upper arm. This reorganization can lead to sensations perceived in the missing limb, contributing to phantom limb pain. PUBMED Incorrect Options: A. Expansion of his right hand area in his right somatic sensory area (S1): This option suggests that the area of S1 corresponding to the right hand would expand within the same hemisphere. However, cortical reorganization typically involves changes in the contralateral hemisphere, not the ipsilateral one. B. Expansion of his right hand area in his left somatic sensory area: While cortical reorganization does involve the contralateral hemisphere, the expansion refers to the recruitment of neighboring sensory areas, not the expansion of the existing representation of the missing limb. D. Projection of the fibers from neighboring sensory areas into the right hand area of his right S1: This option implies that sensory inputs from neighboring areas would project into the right hand area of the same hemisphere's S1. However, cortical reorganization related to phantom limb pain primarily involves the contralateral hemisphere.",
