      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Titin. Titin is a large protein that is attached to the Z line in cardiac muscle (and skeletal muscle) and plays a key role in maintaining the elasticity of the muscle fibers. It extends from the Z disc to the M line of the sarcomere, and its elastic properties help the muscle return to its resting length after contraction, contributing to the muscle's ability to stretch and recoil. Titin is also known to maintain the structural integrity of the sarcomere and prevent overstretching, acting as a molecular spring. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option A (Troponin): Troponin is a regulatory protein that is part of the thin filament in muscle fibers. It plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by binding to calcium ions, which allows tropomyosin to move and expose binding sites for myosin on actin. However, it is not involved in elasticity or in anchoring the muscle fibers to the Z line. Option B (Tropomyosin): Tropomyosin is also a regulatory protein that wraps around the actin filaments in muscle fibers. It works together with troponin to regulate muscle contraction. Like troponin, tropomyosin is not involved in providing elasticity to the muscle or in the attachment of muscle proteins to the Z line. Option D (Actin): Actin is the thin filament in muscle fibers, responsible for forming cross-bridges with myosin during muscle contraction. While it plays a central role in contraction, it does not contribute to the elasticity of the muscle nor is it responsible for the protein attachment at the Z line related to elasticity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Resting membrane potential becomes less negative. When extracellular potassium (K+) increases, as in hyperkalemia, the concentration gradient for K+ across the cell membrane is reduced. Normally, potassium ions tend to move out of the cell due to the concentration gradient, creating a negative resting membrane potential inside the cell. However, with increased extracellular potassium, this gradient is diminished, meaning less potassium will leave the cell. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes less negative, and the resting membrane potential becomes less negative or depolarized. This is a hallmark feature of hyperkalemia, which can lead to disturbances in cell excitability and function. Analysis of Incorrect Options: Option A (Resting membrane potential becomes more negative): This is incorrect because increasing extracellular potassium reduces the concentration gradient for K+ , making the inside of the cell less negative. If extracellular potassium were to decrease, the concentration gradient would increase, and the resting membrane potential would become more negative (hyperpolarized), but this is the opposite of what happens in hyperkalemia. Option C (Increase in conductance of sodium): This is incorrect. Although hyperkalemia can affect the membrane potential and make the cell more excitable, it does not directly increase the conductance of sodium. The conductance of sodium is primarily influenced by the opening of sodium channels, not by the extracellular potassium concentration. In fact, depolarization from hyperkalemia can cause sodium channels to remain in an inactive state, thereby reducing sodium influx during action potentials. Option D (Increase in conduction of potassium): This is incorrect. The increased extracellular potassium will reduce the concentration gradient for potassium, which would likely reduce the net movement of potassium out of the cell. Potassium conductance itself does not increase in hyperkalemia; rather, the reduced gradient decreases the driving force for potassium to exit the cell. Therefore, the movement (or conduction) of potassium out of the cell is not enhanced by hyperkalemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) It can sustain a contraction for prolonged periods Smooth muscle has a unique characteristic where it can sustain a contraction for prolonged periods without using large amounts of energy. This ability is called \"latch mechanism\" or tonic contraction, which allows smooth muscle to remain contracted for extended periods with minimal ATP consumption. This feature is crucial in muscles such as those in the blood vessels and the digestive tract, where prolonged contraction is required for maintaining certain functions (e.g., maintaining blood pressure or controlling the movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract). Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option B (Calcium is not required for contraction): This is incorrect because calcium is essential for smooth muscle contraction. Similar to skeletal and cardiac muscles, smooth muscle contraction is regulated by the binding of calcium ions to calmodulin, which activates the enzyme myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). This enzyme then facilitates the phosphorylation of myosin light chains, enabling cross-bridge formation and contraction. Therefore, calcium is indeed required for smooth muscle contraction, just as it is in other muscle types. Option C (Repetitive contractions are not possible): This is incorrect because smooth muscle is capable of repetitive contractions. While smooth muscle can sustain long contractions, it is also capable of undergoing rhythmic or repeated contractions. For example, smooth muscle in the intestines performs peristalsis, a rhythmic contraction pattern that helps move food through the digestive tract. Therefore, repetitive contractions are definitely possible in smooth muscle. Option D (Myosin filaments are not required): This is incorrect because myosin filaments are indeed required for smooth muscle contraction. Like all muscle types, smooth muscle relies on the interaction between actin and myosin filaments to produce contraction. The myosin filaments are critical for forming cross-bridges with actin filaments and generating the force necessary for contraction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Calmodulin The specific protein for smooth muscle contraction is calmodulin. In smooth muscle, contraction is regulated by calcium ions, but instead of the troponin-tropomyosin complex found in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle contraction relies on calmodulin. When calcium ions bind to calmodulin, it activates the enzyme myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). This, in turn, phosphorylates myosin, enabling it to interact with actin and generate contraction. This mechanism is central to smooth muscle function. Explanation of Incorrect Answers: Option A (Troponin): Troponin is a protein complex found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, not smooth muscle. It is involved in regulating contraction by binding calcium ions, which allows the interaction between actin and myosin. However, smooth muscle contraction does not utilize troponin, making it unsuitable for this question. Option B (Tropomyosin): Tropomyosin is a regulatory protein that is present in both smooth and striated muscles. In skeletal muscle, it blocks the binding sites on actin until calcium binds to troponin, but in smooth muscle, tropomyosin's role is not as crucial in the regulation of contraction. The key regulatory protein for smooth muscle is calmodulin, not tropomyosin. Option C (Myosin): Myosin is the motor protein responsible for muscle contraction in both smooth and striated muscles, but it does not directly regulate contraction. The activation of myosin in smooth muscle requires the phosphorylation of the myosin light chains, a process regulated by calmodulin. Thus, while myosin is involved in contraction, it is not the specific protein responsible for smooth muscle contraction regulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase Calmodulin is a calcium-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating smooth muscle contraction. Upon calcium binding, calmodulin activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which then phosphorylates the light chains of myosin. This phosphorylation allows myosin to interact with actin filaments, leading to contraction. Calmodulin acts as a key mediator in the excitation-contraction coupling process in smooth muscle, where calcium influx triggers the contraction process. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Opening of Na+ channels): Calmodulin does not directly open sodium channels. The opening of Na+ channels is typically regulated by voltage changes (in neurons) or by ligand-gated mechanisms (in other excitable cells), not by calmodulin. Calmodulin's role is more closely related to calcium signaling rather than sodium channel regulation. Option C (Activation of Na+-K+ pump): While the Na+/K+ pump is critical for maintaining the resting membrane potential and ionic gradients, it is not activated by calmodulin. The Na+/K+ pump is primarily regulated by the availability of ATP and the concentration gradients of sodium and potassium, not by calmodulin. Option D (Dephosphorylation by protein kinase): Calmodulin does not mediate dephosphorylation by protein kinase. In fact, its main action is to activate MLCK, which phosphorylates myosin light chains, not to dephosphorylate them. Dephosphorylation of myosin light chains is typically carried out by myosin light chain phosphatase, not through a protein kinase-mediated process.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glycolytic metabolism Red muscle fibers, also known as slow-twitch fibers, are specialized for endurance and sustained activity. They have a high oxidative capacity, meaning they rely primarily on aerobic metabolism for energy production, which is fueled by mitochondria and myoglobin. Glycolytic metabolism, which is primarily anaerobic, is more characteristic of white muscle fibers (fast-twitch fibers) that are designed for short bursts of intense activity, not prolonged endurance. Therefore, red muscle fibers do not primarily rely on glycolytic metabolism, which makes option B the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (More mitochondria): Red muscle fibers are rich in mitochondria, which are the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for generating ATP through aerobic respiration. These mitochondria allow for efficient energy production over prolonged periods of activity. This is consistent with the characteristics of red muscle fibers, which are designed for endurance and continuous contraction. Option C (More myoglobin): Red muscle fibers also have more myoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen and helps facilitate its transport to the muscle cells. Myoglobin is crucial for sustained aerobic activity because it stores oxygen for use during muscle contraction, particularly in endurance activities. This characteristic is typical of red muscle fibers. Option D (More oxidative capacity): Red muscle fibers have a higher oxidative capacity compared to white muscle fibers, meaning they can generate ATP through aerobic processes more efficiently. This is one of the defining features of red muscle fibers, allowing them to support prolonged, sustained activities like long-distance running or swimming.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Last Fast fatiguable motor units are typically recruited last during muscle contraction. These motor units consist of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which generate high force but tire quickly due to their reliance on anaerobic metabolism. The recruitment of motor units follows the size principle: small, fatigue-resistant motor units are recruited first, followed by larger, more powerful motor units that are capable of generating greater force but at the cost of rapid fatigue. Fast fatiguable motor units are recruited during intense or high-force contractions, such as those requiring maximum effort. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (First): Fast fatiguable motor units are not recruited first. The first motor units recruited are typically slow-twitch fibers, which are more resistant to fatigue and are ideal for sustained, low-force activities. The body recruits motor units based on the demands of the task, starting with those that are more fatigue-resistant before moving to those that are faster but more easily fatigued. Option C (During active part of contraction): Although fast fatiguable motor units are recruited during the active part of a contraction, they are recruited later in the process, not first. The active part of the contraction involves the muscles working, but fast fatiguable motor units are only activated when the force required surpasses what can be sustained by the slower, more fatigue-resistant motor units. Option D (During relaxation): Motor units are typically not recruited during relaxation. Relaxation refers to the process of muscle fibers returning to a resting state after contraction. Fast fatiguable motor units are primarily involved in the active contraction phase, not relaxation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 5 In the extraocular muscles, which control eye movement, the number of muscle fibers in a single motor unit is typically small, often around 5 muscle fibers per motor unit. This allows for very fine control and precision in the movement of the eyes. Small motor units are necessary for the rapid and delicate adjustments required for tasks like tracking and focusing. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (15): While 15 muscle fibers per motor unit is within the range seen in some muscles, it is larger than the typical motor unit size for extraocular muscles. These muscles generally require a smaller number of muscle fibers to achieve finer control. Option B (30): A motor unit of 30 muscle fibers would be relatively large compared to the motor units in the extraocular muscles. Larger motor units are typically found in muscles responsible for stronger, less precise movements, such as in limb muscles. The fine control needed in the eyes does not require as many fibers. Option D (50): A motor unit size of 50 muscle fibers is much too large for the extraocular muscles. Such motor units are more commonly seen in larger, bulkier muscles that perform less precise, more forceful contractions. The eye muscles require much smaller motor units for delicate control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A A fibers are the most sensitive to local anesthetics (LAs) because they are myelinated and have a large diameter, which means they conduct nerve impulses quickly. The larger diameter and myelination make A fibers more susceptible to the effects of LAs, as these drugs primarily work by inhibiting sodium channels, which are necessary for the propagation of action potentials. Due to the high conduction velocity of A fibers, they are typically the first to be blocked by LAs. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B (B): B fibers are smaller than A fibers and are myelinated, but they are less sensitive to LAs compared to A fibers. B fibers are involved in autonomic functions, and although they are myelinated, their smaller size makes them less prone to being blocked by LAs than the larger A fibers. Option C (C): C fibers are unmyelinated and have a small diameter, which makes them less sensitive to local anesthetics compared to A fibers. However, they are still susceptible to LAs, especially for functions involving pain transmission. C fibers are typically the last to be affected by local anesthetics. Option D (None of the above): This option is incorrect because A fibers are indeed the most sensitive to local anesthetics, making Option A the correct choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Type C Type C fibers are responsible for transmitting pain signals, particularly dull, throbbing, or aching pain. These fibers are unmyelinated, which means they have slower conduction velocities compared to myelinated fibers. Their lack of myelination makes them slower but effective in transmitting chronic pain sensations over long distances. Type C fibers also transmit other types of sensory information like temperature and itch, but their role in pain transmission, especially for nociceptive (pain-causing) stimuli, is key. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Type A Alpha): Type A Alpha fibers are myelinated and are responsible for transmitting motor signals to skeletal muscles as well as sensory signals related to proprioception (sense of body position). They are not involved in pain transmission. Due to their myelinated nature, they have a high conduction velocity, but they are not specialized for pain transmission. Option B (Type A Beta): Type A Beta fibers are also myelinated and primarily involved in the transmission of touch and pressure sensations. They are faster than Type C fibers but are not responsible for transmitting pain signals, especially the ones associated with nociception. Option C (Type B): Type B fibers are myelinated but are much smaller than A fibers. They are primarily involved in autonomic functions (such as transmitting information from the brain to smooth muscles and glands) rather than in pain transmission. Their role is not related to pain sensation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 40% The motor nerves primarily carry signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to muscles for voluntary movement. A significant proportion of the fibers in motor nerves, about 40%, originate from the sensory cortex (which includes the primary motor cortex). These fibers are part of the corticospinal tract, which is crucial for voluntary motor control. The sensory cortex sends its signals down through the brainstem to the spinal cord, from where motor neurons send signals to muscles. This 40% is involved in the precise control and execution of voluntary movements. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (0%): This answer is incorrect because motor fibers indeed originate from the sensory cortex (more specifically, the motor cortex). Thus, saying that 0% of the fibers arise from the sensory cortex is inaccurate. Option B (10%): Although 10% might seem like a possibility, it is too low compared to the actual proportion. Around 40% of the motor fibers arise from the motor cortex in the brain, specifically from the primary motor area. Option C (2%): This answer is also incorrect. While the exact percentage may vary slightly based on different studies, 2% is too small a figure to represent the actual proportion of fibers that arise from the sensory cortex in the motor nerve. Option E (25%): While 25% is closer than some of the other options, the correct figure is 40%. Thus, this answer is slightly underestimated compared to the actual proportion of motor fibers that arise from the sensory cortex.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Action potential in the muscle membrane; depolarization of the T tubules; release of Ca²+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Explanation: Excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle involves a precise sequence of events: Action Potential Initiation: An action potential is generated in the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) following neural stimulation. T Tubule Depolarization: This action potential propagates along the sarcolemma and into the transverse tubules (T tubules), which are extensions of the sarcolemma that penetrate into the muscle fiber. Calcium Release: Depolarization of the T tubules activates voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptors, which are mechanically coupled to ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This interaction leads to the opening of the ryanodine receptors and the release of Ca²+ from the SR into the cytoplasm. Muscle Contraction: The increased intracellular Ca²+ concentration binds to troponin C on the actin filaments, initiating the cross-bridge cycle and resulting in muscle contraction. This sequence ensures that the electrical signal (action potential) is effectively translated into a mechanical response (muscle contraction). Incorrect options: A. Increased intracellular Ca²+, action potential in the muscle membrane; cross-bridge formation: This sequence is incorrect because the action potential must precede the increase in intracellular Ca²+. The action potential triggers the release of Ca²+ from the SR, which then leads to cross-bridge formation. C. Action potential in the muscle membrane; splitting of adenosine triphosphate (ATP); binding of Ca²+ to troponin C: While ATP splitting is essential for the cross-bridge cycle, it is not a direct consequence of the action potential. The action potential leads to Ca²+ release, which then facilitates ATP hydrolysis and cross-bridge formation. D. Release of Ca²+ from the SR; depolarization of the T tubules; binding of Ca²+ to troponin C: This sequence is incorrect because T tubule depolarization occurs before Ca²+ release from the SR. The action potential first depolarizes the T tubules, which then triggers Ca²+ release from the SR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Na+ channels are closed by depolarization. Explanation: Elevated serum potassium (K+) levels, a condition known as hyperkalemia, can lead to muscle weakness. In hyperkalemia, the increased extracellular K+ concentration reduces the electrochemical gradient for K+ across the muscle cell membrane, causing partial depolarization. This partial depolarization inactivates voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels, impairing action potential propagation and leading to muscle weakness. Incorrect options: A. The resting membrane potential is hyperpolarized: Hyperkalemia causes partial depolarization, not hyperpolarization, of the resting membrane potential. B. Na+ equilibrium potential is hyperpolarized: The Na+ equilibrium potential remains relatively constant; hyperkalemia affects the muscle cell membrane potential, not the Na+ equilibrium potential. C. K+ channels are closed by depolarization: Depolarization typically opens K+ channels, allowing K+ to exit the cell. In hyperkalemia, K+ channels remain open, but the driving force for K+ efflux is reduced due to the elevated extracellular K+ concentration.",
