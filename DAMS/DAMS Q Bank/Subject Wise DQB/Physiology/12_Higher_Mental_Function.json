      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Magnitude of stimulus strength perceived is approximately proportionate to the log of the intensity of stimulus strength. The Weber-Fechner Law describes the relationship between the physical intensity of a stimulus and its perceived magnitude. According to this law, the perceived strength of a stimulus increases logarithmically as the actual intensity of the stimulus increases. This means that as the stimulus becomes stronger, the ability to detect incremental changes decreases. For example, if a quiet sound becomes slightly louder, it is easier to detect the change compared to when a loud sound becomes slightly louder. This logarithmic relationship reflects the diminishing sensitivity of sensory systems to changes in stimulus intensity as the intensity increases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Magnitude of stimulus strength perceived is directly proportional to the intensity of stimulus strength: This is incorrect because the relationship between stimulus intensity and perception is not linear. If perception were directly proportional to stimulus intensity, then doubling the stimulus intensity would result in doubling the perceived magnitude. However, the Weber-Fechner Law shows that perception grows logarithmically, not linearly. C. Threshold of receptor is directly proportional to stimulus strength: This is incorrect because the threshold of a receptor does not change in proportion to stimulus strength. The receptor threshold is a fixed value that determines the minimum intensity of a stimulus required to activate the receptor. The Weber-Fechner Law does not relate to receptor thresholds but rather to the perception of stimulus intensity. D. Threshold of receptor is inversely proportional to stimulus strength: This is incorrect because receptor thresholds are not inversely proportional to stimulus strength. A receptor's threshold is a constant property and does not vary based on the strength of the stimulus. This option does not align with the principles of the Weber-Fechner Law.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Performing all voluntary movements. The motor area in the cerebrum, particularly the primary motor cortex (located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe), is primarily responsible for initiating and controlling all voluntary movements of the body. It contains a somatotopic map, also known as the motor homunculus, where different regions correspond to different parts of the body. This area sends signals through descending motor pathways, such as the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, to activate the muscles required for voluntary actions like walking, writing, or speaking. The motor cortex ensures precise and coordinated control of voluntary movements. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Performing involuntary movements: This is incorrect because involuntary movements are not controlled by the motor area in the cerebrum. Instead, they are regulated by other parts of the nervous system, such as the brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Reflex actions and automatic responses, which are involuntary, do not require motor cortex involvement. C. Executing fine movements: This is incorrect because, while the motor cortex plays a role in executing fine movements, it is not limited to this function. It controls all voluntary movements, whether fine (e.g., writing) or gross (e.g., walking or jumping). Fine movements are a subset of voluntary actions controlled by the motor cortex. D. Controlling all motor activity: This is incorrect because not all motor activity is controlled by the motor cortex. Many motor activities, such as reflexes and involuntary movements, are mediated by other regions, including the brainstem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord. The motor cortex specifically governs voluntary motor actions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Decreased sexual activity. Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a rare neurological disorder caused by bilateral damage to the temporal lobes, particularly the amygdala. It is characterized by a specific set of behavioral and emotional changes. The defining symptoms include hyperorality (the compulsion to explore objects by mouth), hypermetamorphosis (the tendency to touch every object in sight), placidity or tameness (a loss of fear and aggression), visual agnosia (the inability to recognize objects or people), and hypersexuality (a dramatic increase in sexual activity and inappropriate sexual behavior). Therefore, a decrease in sexual activity is not a characteristic of this syndrome; in fact, the opposite is true. While Korsakoff amnesia and a lack of emotional response like apathy or placidity can be seen, sham rage is also not a feature of Kluver-Bucy syndrome. Sham rage, a display of uninhibited rage to non-threatening stimuli, is the result of lesions that disconnect the cerebral cortex from the hypothalamus. In contrast, Kluver-Bucy syndrome is characterized by a profound reduction in aggression and a lack of emotional response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Muscles of mastication. The muscles of mastication, responsible for the movement of the jaw, have the largest representation in the cortical area. This is due to the high precision and fine control needed for functions such as chewing and speaking. The motor cortex devoted to this area is relatively large because the muscles of mastication, like the masseter and temporalis, require intricate coordination and detailed motor planning, which is reflected in the cortical representation. A. Trunk muscle: The trunk muscles, although important for posture and support, do not require the fine motor control that the muscles of mastication do. As a result, their cortical representation is smaller compared to that of more intricate muscles, like those involved in facial movements. B. Muscles of forearm: The muscles of the forearm, while crucial for many movements like grasping and lifting, do not require as much precision and fine control as the muscles of mastication. Therefore, the cortical representation of the forearm muscles is less than that of the facial and masticatory muscles. D. Muscles of thumb: While the thumb muscles are involved in fine motor skills such as gripping, their cortical representation is smaller compared to the muscles involved in mastication. This is because although thumb movement is critical for fine motor tasks, it does not require the same complex coordination as chewing and speaking.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Genitalia. The genitalia have the lowest representation in the sensory cortex because, while sensations in this region are important, they are not as critical for everyday survival and complex functions as other body parts. The sensory cortex, especially the areas related to touch and sensation, devotes larger portions to regions that require more fine-tuned sensory input for regular activities, such as the hands, face, and tongue. A. Thumb: The thumb, being essential for precise movements and tactile feedback during activities like grasping, has a relatively large representation in the sensory cortex. This enables fine motor control and sensory feedback, especially during activities that involve detailed hand movements. C. Tongue: The tongue has a significant representation in the sensory cortex, as it is vital for taste, speech, and the manipulation of food. The sensitivity of the tongue, especially in relation to taste and texture, necessitates a large area in the sensory cortex to process the complex sensory input it receives. D. Face: The face also has a large representation in the sensory cortex, particularly because of its role in sensory input such as touch, pain, and temperature sensations, as well as for functions like speaking and facial expression. These highly sensory tasks require substantial cortical attention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Loss of tactile and two-point discrimination. Sensory area 1, located in the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex, is primarily responsible for processing sensory input from the body, including touch, pressure, and proprioception. Damage to this area leads to a loss of tactile sensation and the ability to distinguish between two points on the skin (two-point discrimination), which are essential for fine touch and sensory perception. A. Loss of perception of pain: Pain perception is primarily processed by the lateral spinothalamic tract, which relays pain and temperature sensations to the brain. Sensory area 1 does not solely process pain, and damage to it would not result in a loss of pain perception. C. Loss of perception of touch: While sensory area 1 does process tactile information, the loss of perception of touch would typically involve more extensive damage to the sensory pathways, such as the posterior columns or parts of the thalamus. Damage to sensory area 1 primarily affects the ability to discriminate touch and not the basic sensation of touch itself. D. Loss of only tactile discrimination: While tactile discrimination (such as two-point discrimination) is impaired with damage to sensory area 1, this option is incomplete. The loss of both tactile sensation and two-point discrimination occurs due to damage in this area, so the response should account for both impairments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hearing. The medial geniculate body (MGB) is a part of the thalamus and serves as the primary relay station for auditory information. It receives signals from the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and sends these signals to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe for processing. Therefore, the MGB is crucial for the perception of sound. B. Vision: Vision is processed by the lateral geniculate body (LGB), which is another thalamic structure. The LGB receives visual information from the optic tract and relays it to the visual cortex, not the MGB. C. Smell: The olfactory system is unique in that it bypasses the thalamus entirely. Olfactory signals are processed directly in the olfactory bulb and then sent to the olfactory cortex, not involving the medial geniculate body. D. Taste: Taste is processed in the gustatory cortex, which receives input from the brainstem via the nucleus of the solitary tract. This pathway is separate from the auditory system, so the medial geniculate body is not involved in taste perception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Inter collicular transection. A decerebrate posture results from a transection of the brainstem between the superior and inferior colliculi, which is known as an intercollicular transection. This section disconnects the brain's higher centers (such as the cerebral cortex) from the spinal cord and results in rigid extension of the limbs and body (decerebrate rigidity). The loss of descending inhibitory control from the brainstem, particularly from the red nucleus, leads to uncontrolled activation of the extensor muscles. A. Removal of the cerebrum: Removal of the cerebrum (cerebral hemispherectomy) would result in a decorticate posture, not a decerebrate posture. Decorticate posturing is characterized by flexion of the arms and extension of the legs, which occurs when the cerebrum is disconnected from the brainstem. B. Transection at the upper border of the midbrain: A transection at the upper border of the midbrain (just above the red nucleus) typically causes decerebrate rigidity, as it disconnects higher brain centers, but does not specifically result from this exact level of transection. The intercollicular transection at a slightly lower level is more definitive for producing the classic decerebrate posture. D. Section above the thalamus: Sectioning above the thalamus would affect higher brain functions and can result in a coma or profound loss of sensory and motor functions, but not the specific decerebrate posture. The thalamus relays sensory signals and is essential for consciousness, and cutting above it wouldn't directly result in decerebrate rigidity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Decorticate rigidity is greater than decerebrate rigidity. This statement is not true because decerebrate rigidity is typically considered more severe than decorticate rigidity. In decerebrate rigidity, there is an exaggerated extension of the limbs due to a loss of inhibition from the brainstem, which results in more profound muscle rigidity. In contrast, decorticate rigidity involves flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs, indicating that the brainstem and spinal cord are more intact in this state, making it less severe than decerebrate rigidity. B. Righting reflexes are absent in the decerebrate animal: This is true. In decerebrate animals, the higher centers of the brain are disconnected from the spinal cord, which abolishes righting reflexes — the reflexes that allow an animal to maintain or return to a normal upright posture. C. In decortication, upper limb is flexed and lower limb is extended: This is true. In decorticate rigidity (which occurs when the cerebral cortex is damaged but the brainstem is still intact), the upper limbs are flexed, and the lower limbs are extended. This is due to the loss of descending inhibitory control from the cerebral cortex over the brainstem, leading to an exaggerated flexion posture in the arms and extension in the legs. D. Decorticate rigidity is seen only when the animal is at rest: This is true. Decorticate rigidity is usually more pronounced when the animal is at rest. When the animal is moving or engaged in activity, the reflexes can change, but the rigid posture is most evident in a resting state due to the loss of cortical control over the brainstem.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Failure of comprehension of spoken or written words. Wernicke's area, located in the dominant hemisphere (typically the left hemisphere) of the brain, is primarily responsible for the comprehension of speech and written language. A lesion in Wernicke's area disrupts the ability to understand language, leading to a condition known as Wernicke's aphasia. Individuals with this condition can speak fluently and with normal grammar but have significant difficulty understanding spoken or written language. Their speech may be nonsensical or contain made-up words, as they lack the ability to correctly process and comprehend what others are saying. A. Global aphasia: Global aphasia refers to a severe form of aphasia that results from extensive damage to both Broca's area (which governs speech production) and Wernicke's area (which governs comprehension). It leads to both impaired speech production and comprehension, which is not specifically linked to lesions in Wernicke's area alone. B. Non-fluent aphasia: Non-fluent aphasia, also known as Broca's aphasia, occurs when there is damage to Broca's area, which affects speech production but not comprehension. This type of aphasia is characterized by slow, labored speech and difficulty forming grammatically correct sentences, but individuals can usually understand language relatively well. Lesions in Wernicke's area do not cause non-fluent aphasia. C. Conduction aphasia: Conduction aphasia occurs when there is damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a neural pathway connecting Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Individuals with conduction aphasia have difficulty repeating words or sentences and may make errors in speech, but their comprehension and fluent speech production are relatively intact. This is different from the effects of a lesion in Wernicke's area, where comprehension is specifically impaired.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Law of projection. The phantom limb phenomenon occurs when a person experiences sensations, including pain or itch, in a limb that has been amputated. This happens due to the law of projection, which states that the sensation experienced in a particular area of the body is projected to that area, even if the limb is no longer physically present. The sensory pathways that once carried information from the amputated limb to the brain are still active and can produce the sensation of the missing limb. Essentially, the brain continues to \"map\" sensations to the area where the limb once was, causing the illusion that the limb is still there. B. Weber's law: Weber's law relates to the just noticeable difference (JND) in the intensity of stimuli, stating that the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli is proportional to the intensity of the initial stimulus. This law does not explain the phantom limb phenomenon, which is more about sensory perception and the brain's interpretation of sensory signals, rather than the ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity. C. Fechner’s law of degeneration: Fechner's law deals with the relationship between the physical intensity of a stimulus and the psychological sensation it produces. It suggests that the perceived sensation increases logarithmically with the increase in physical stimulus intensity. However, this law does not explain the phantom limb phenomenon, as it focuses on the scaling of sensory perception, not the sensation of a limb that no longer exists. D. Pascal's law: Pascal’s law is related to fluid dynamics and pressure in confined fluids. It states that pressure applied to a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions. This law is irrelevant to the phantom limb phenomenon, which involves sensory perception in the brain rather than fluid pressure or mechanical forces.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Alpha waves. When a person is fully awake with eyes closed, especially in a relaxed state, the EEG recorded from the occipital position will typically show alpha waves. Alpha waves are brain waves that have a frequency of 8–13 Hz and are most prominent when the individual is awake but relaxed and not engaging in intense mental activity. These waves are most commonly seen in the posterior areas of the brain, such as the occipital lobe, when the eyes are closed and the person is calm or relaxed. Incorrect options: B. Beta waves: Beta waves have a higher frequency (14–30 Hz) compared to alpha waves. They are usually recorded when a person is alert, actively thinking, or concentrating, and they are typically seen in the frontal regions of the brain. Beta waves are not predominant when the person is relaxed with eyes closed. C. Theta waves: Theta waves (4–7 Hz) are usually associated with lighter stages of sleep or deep relaxation. They can sometimes be seen in children or in adults who are drowsy, but they are not the characteristic pattern for someone who is fully awake with eyes closed. D. Delta waves: Delta waves (0.5–4 Hz) are the slowest brain waves and are typically seen during deep sleep (especially in stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Head. The Monroe-Kellie doctrine is a principle in neurophysiology that explains the relationship between the volumes of the three compartments inside the skull: brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood. According to this doctrine, the skull is a rigid, non-expandable structure, so an increase in the volume of one compartment (e.g., brain swelling due to injury) must be compensated by a decrease in the volume of one or both of the other compartments (CSF or blood) to maintain normal intracranial pressure. This doctrine is important in understanding the effects of brain injury, such as traumatic brain injury or conditions that cause increased intracranial pressure. Incorrect options: B. Abdomen: The Monroe-Kellie doctrine does not apply to the abdomen. The abdomen is not a rigid, closed compartment like the skull, and it does not have the same volume constraints that are central to the Monroe-Kellie principle. C. Chest: Similarly, the chest does not have the same rigid, non-expandable nature that the skull does, and therefore the Monroe-Kellie doctrine does not apply to chest injuries. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Non-dominant parietal lobe. Spatial distortion is commonly associated with lesions or disorders of the non-dominant parietal lobe. The non-dominant parietal lobe is crucial for processing spatial and visuospatial information, such as the awareness of one's own body in space, the ability to recognize objects and their positions, and the ability to navigate the environment. Damage to this area can result in disorders like hemispatial neglect, where patients fail to perceive or attend to one side of their visual field, leading to spatial distortion. Incorrect options: A. Dominant parietal lobe: The dominant parietal lobe (usually the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals) is primarily involved in functions such as language processing, calculation, and fine motor skills. While it contributes to spatial awareness, its primary role is not related to spatial distortion, which is more closely linked to the non-dominant parietal lobe. C. Dominant temporal lobe: The dominant temporal lobe is mainly involved in auditory processing and language comprehension. Damage to this area can lead to deficits in language and memory, but it is not typically associated with spatial distortions. D. Non-dominant temporal lobe: The non-dominant temporal lobe is involved in processing auditory information and is also linked to some aspects of memory and object recognition.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 70-180 mm of H2O. The normal range of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in the lying down (supine) position is typically between 70 and 180 mm of H2O. This pressure reflects the balance of CSF production, absorption, and the resistance to flow in the subarachnoid space, and it can be measured during a lumbar puncture. Incorrect options: A. 20-80 mm of H2O: This range is lower than the normal CSF pressure. While CSF pressure can vary, 20-80 mm of H2O is too low to be considered normal in a typical clinical context. C. 180-200 mm of H2O: This range is elevated and may indicate abnormal conditions, such as increased intracranial pressure or a blockage in the CSF pathways. Normal CSF pressure does not typically exceed 180 mm of H2O. D. 200-300 mm of H2O: This is significantly higher than the normal range and suggests a serious abnormality, such as increased intracranial pressure, which requires immediate medical attention. CSF pressure in this range is not considered normal for the supine position.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is the primary site of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion. It is a network of blood vessels located in the ventricles of the brain, where the blood plasma is filtered and modified to form CSF. The choroid plexus plays a crucial role in maintaining the volume and composition of CSF, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, providing cushioning and removing waste. Incorrect options: B. Arachnoid granulation: Arachnoid granulations are structures in the arachnoid membrane that are involved in the absorption of CSF into the venous system. While they help regulate CSF volume, they do not secrete it. C. Floor of fourth ventricle: The floor of the fourth ventricle does not secrete CSF. Instead, CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, located in the ventricles, including the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth ventricle is more involved in other functions related to brainstem control. D. Periaqueductal grey: The periaqueductal grey is involved in processing pain and controlling certain reflexes. It does not play a role in the secretion of CSF. The production of CSF occurs primarily in the choroid plexus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 400 ml. The normal rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production is approximately 400 to 500 milliliters per day. The majority of this fluid is secreted by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain. The CSF is constantly being produced, circulated, and absorbed to maintain a stable environment around the brain and spinal cord. Incorrect options: A. 100 ml: This is much lower than the typical daily CSF production. While CSF volume at any given moment in the central nervous system may be around 150 ml, production per day is much higher. B. 200 ml: This is still below the normal daily production rate of CSF. While some variation can exist between individuals, normal production is usually closer to 400 ml per day. C. 300 ml: This is also lower than the typical range for CSF production. While the CSF turnover rate may vary slightly, 300 ml per day is less than the typical 400 ml production.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) K+. Potassium (K+) levels are lower in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to plasma. CSF has a relatively low concentration of potassium because it is actively transported out of the CSF and into the surrounding tissues to maintain the proper ionic balance and to avoid hyperexcitability in neurons. Incorrect options: A. Mg: Magnesium (Mg) levels in CSF are similar to or slightly lower than those in plasma, but not as drastically different as potassium. Magnesium is involved in maintaining neuronal stability, and its concentration is regulated closely between plasma and CSF. B. Cl: Chloride (Cl-) concentration in CSF is similar to or slightly higher than in plasma. It plays a key role in maintaining the electrochemical gradients required for neural function and is not lower in CSF compared to plasma. C. HCO3: Bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels are actually higher in CSF compared to plasma. This is due to the buffering role of CSF in maintaining pH and the fact that bicarbonate is actively involved in pH regulation in the central nervous system.",

The Cushing reflex is a triad of hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression that occurs in patients with increased intracranial pressure. The physiologic changes seen in this reflex are due to a combination of cerebral chemoreceptor-mediated maintenance of cerebral blood flow and baroreceptor-mediated reflex bradycardia.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Decreased cerebral blood flow. Explanation: During a panic attack, the body's \"fight or flight\" response is activated, leading to rapid breathing (hyperventilation) and increased heart rate. Hyperventilation causes a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in the blood, resulting in vasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels. This vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to the brain, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, and blurred vision. Incorrect Options: A. Oxygen toxicity: Oxygen toxicity occurs when oxygen levels are too high, leading to symptoms like dizziness and visual disturbances. However, this is not typically associated with panic attacks. C. Decreased respiratory rate: A decreased respiratory rate would lead to increased carbon dioxide levels, causing vasodilation and increased cerebral blood flow, which is not consistent with the symptoms described. D. Carotid artery obstruction: While carotid artery obstruction can reduce cerebral blood flow, it is a chronic condition and would not typically present with the acute symptoms described during a panic attack.",
