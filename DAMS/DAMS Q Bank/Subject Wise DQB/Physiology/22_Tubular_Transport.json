      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mesangium. The mesangium consists of mesangial cells and the extracellular matrix. These cells support the glomerular capillaries but are not directly involved in the filtration process. The mesangium helps maintain the structure of the glomerulus and has a role in regulating blood flow by contracting, but it does not form part of the filtration barrier. Incorrect options: A. Endothelial cells: Endothelial cells of the glomerular capillaries are a crucial part of the filtration barrier. These cells are fenestrated, allowing the passage of small molecules, while restricting larger proteins and cells. B. Basement membrane: The glomerular basement membrane is an important component of the filtration barrier. It provides a physical barrier that selectively filters molecules based on size and charge. C. Podocytes: Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that cover the glomerular capillaries. Their foot processes form the slit diaphragm, which is an essential part of the filtration barrier. They contribute to the size-selectivity of the filtration process.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inulin clearance. Inulin is a substance that is freely filtered by the glomerulus, not reabsorbed, and not secreted by the kidneys, making it an ideal marker for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). By measuring the clearance of inulin, we can accurately determine the GFR because the amount of inulin filtered is directly proportional to the GFR. Incorrect options: A. Creatinine clearance: While creatinine is often used to estimate GFR because it is freely filtered and only minimally secreted, it is not as accurate as inulin clearance. Creatinine clearance can overestimate GFR due to slight tubular secretion of creatinine. C. PAH (para-aminohippuric acid) clearance: PAH clearance is used to estimate renal plasma flow (RPF), not GFR. PAH is actively secreted by the renal tubules, so its clearance measures how much plasma is cleared of PAH by the kidneys, not the glomerular filtration rate. D. Creatine clearance: This seems to be a typo or confusion with creatinine. \"Creatine\" is not typically used in renal function tests. Creatinine clearance (not creatine) is used in clinical practice to estimate GFR, but it's not as accurate as inulin clearance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Freely Filtered and Secreted. The substance is present at a concentration of 2 mg% in the afferent arteriole and 0 mg% in the efferent arteriole, suggesting that it is freely filtered by the glomerulus and then secreted into the nephron. If the substance is completely removed from the efferent arteriole (i.e., the concentration drops to 0 mg%), this indicates that it has been secreted into the tubular fluid after filtration, likely in the proximal convoluted tubule or the distal segments of the nephron. Incorrect options: A. It is free filtered in the glomerulus: While it is true that the substance is freely filtered in the glomerulus, the complete absence of the substance in the efferent arteriole suggests that it has been secreted, not just filtered. Hence, this option does not fully explain the situation. B. Absorbed in PCT: If the substance were absorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), its concentration would decrease as it passes through the PCT, but it would still be detectable in the efferent arteriole. Since its concentration is 0 mg% in the efferent arteriole, this suggests that the substance is not absorbed but rather secreted. D. Impermeable in loop of Henle: The information given does not directly suggest that the substance is impermeable in the loop of Henle. The complete removal of the substance from the efferent arteriole is more likely due to secretion rather than a lack of permeability in the loop of Henle.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Falsely low. PAH (Para-aminohippuric acid) is commonly used to estimate renal plasma flow (RPF) because it is almost entirely cleared from the blood by the kidneys. The relationship between PAH and RPF is such that if the dose is too high, the kidneys may not be able to clear all of it, leading to saturation of the secretory transport mechanisms. This results in less PAH being secreted per unit of plasma, causing a falsely low estimate of RPF. When the PAH dose exceeds the recommended level, it exceeds the renal threshold, leading to inaccurate measurements. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Normal: This is incorrect because an excessive dose of PAH would lead to saturation of the transporters, and as a result, RPF cannot be accurately measured, leading to a falsely low reading, not a normal one. B. Falsely high: This is incorrect because giving too much PAH results in a reduced ability to clear the substance, which means the PAH will not be fully secreted. This would not artificially increase the renal plasma flow, making the RPF measurement falsely high. D. None of the above: This is incorrect because, as explained, the correct response is \"falsely low,\" and the other options do not describe this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Osmosis. In the PCT, water reabsorption occurs primarily via osmosis. As sodium, glucose, and other solutes are actively reabsorbed into the blood, the osmolarity of the filtrate decreases, and water follows passively through the epithelial cells by osmosis. The osmotic gradient created by the active transport of solutes (like sodium) drives the movement of water from the lumen of the nephron into the interstitial space and eventually into the bloodstream. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. Passive transport: This is incorrect because while water reabsorption does occur passively (in the sense that it moves along its concentration gradient), it is specifically driven by osmosis, not a general passive transport process. B. Active transport: This is incorrect because water reabsorption in the PCT is not an active process; it doesn't require energy. It is driven by the osmotic gradient created by active reabsorption of solutes like sodium. D. Facilitated diffusion: This is incorrect because facilitated diffusion involves the movement of substances across a membrane through specific transporters or channels, but water reabsorption in the PCT occurs through osmosis, not facilitated diffusion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aquaporin-1. The PCT (Proximal Convoluted Tubule) has Aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) channels on both the apical and basolateral membranes. These channels facilitate the movement of water by osmosis, allowing for efficient reabsorption of water from the filtrate back into the bloodstream. Aquaporin-1 is a key protein for water reabsorption in the PCT, where a significant amount of the filtrate's water is reabsorbed. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Aquaporin-2: This is incorrect because Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) is primarily found in the collecting ducts, where it plays a critical role in regulating water reabsorption in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It is not the primary aquaporin involved in water reabsorption in the PCT. B. Aquaporin-4: This is incorrect because Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) is mainly found in the basolateral membranes of the collecting ducts and the brain, not in the PCT. It is involved in water transport in the brain and other tissues, but not in the PCT. C. Aquaporin-3: This is incorrect because Aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) is located in the basolateral membrane of the PCT and other nephron segments, but it does not play the primary role in water reabsorption at the apical membrane, where AQP-1 is crucial. AQP-3 helps transport water from the cytoplasm to the interstitial space, but the main water transport occurs through AQP-1.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The bulk of water reabsorption occurs secondary to Na reabsorption. Most water reabsorption in the kidneys occurs secondary to sodium reabsorption, primarily in the PCT (proximal convoluted tubule) and loop of Henle. Sodium is actively reabsorbed, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water passively through osmosis. This is the obligatory water reabsorption, and it accounts for the majority of water reabsorption in the nephron. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect: B. Facultative water reabsorption occurs in PCT: This is incorrect because facultative water reabsorption is ADH (antidiuretic hormone)-regulated and primarily occurs in the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubule (DCT), not in the PCT. The PCT mainly handles obligatory reabsorption, which is not dependent on ADH. C. Obligatory reabsorption is ADH dependent: This is incorrect because obligatory reabsorption occurs in the PCT and the loop of Henle, and it is not ADH-dependent. It is driven by the osmotic gradient created by sodium reabsorption, whereas facultative reabsorption is ADH-dependent and occurs in the collecting ducts. D. 20% water is always reabsorbed irrespective of water balance: This is incorrect because 20% of water is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, not irrespective of water balance. The amount of water reabsorbed is influenced by the body’s hydration status, with ADH regulating the amount of water reabsorbed in the collecting ducts (facultative reabsorption).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) PCT (Proximal Convoluted Tubule). The majority of bicarbonate (HCO??) reabsorption occurs in the PCT. About 80-90% of the filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed here. In the PCT, bicarbonate combines with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid, which is then broken down by carbonic anhydrase to produce carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide diffuses back into the cells, where it is converted back into bicarbonate and reabsorbed into the bloodstream. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining the acid-base balance of the body. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: B. DCT (Distal Convoluted Tubule): This is incorrect because bicarbonate reabsorption in the DCT is much less compared to the PCT. The DCT is involved in the fine-tuning of the body's acid-base balance, but the bulk of bicarbonate reabsorption occurs earlier in the nephron. C. TAL (Thick Ascending Limb): This is incorrect because the TAL is primarily responsible for the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride, not for bicarbonate. It does not play a significant role in bicarbonate reabsorption. D. Collecting duct: This is incorrect because while the collecting duct plays a role in acid-base balance, particularly through the secretion of hydrogen ions and the reabsorption of bicarbonate under the influence of aldosterone, it does not absorb bicarbonate to the extent that the PCT does. The reabsorption in the collecting duct is more limited and regulated compared to the PCT.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sensing of NaCl conc. by macula densa. Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) is a mechanism that helps regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on the sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration sensed by the macula densa, a group of cells in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). When the NaCl concentration in the DCT increases (indicating increased GFR), the macula densa signals the afferent arteriole to constrict, reducing blood flow to the glomerulus and lowering the GFR. Conversely, if the NaCl concentration decreases, the macula densa signals vasodilation of the afferent arteriole, increasing blood flow and GFR. This feedback system helps to stabilize GFR and maintain homeostasis. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. Sensing of Na concentration by macula densa: This is incorrect because the macula densa does not directly sense Na+ concentration alone. It specifically senses NaCl concentration (which includes both Na+ and Cl-), as the reabsorption of sodium is closely linked to chloride ions. This is why NaCl concentration is more relevant for triggering the feedback response, rather than Na+ concentration alone. B. Sensing of Cl concentration by macula densa: This is incorrect because while chloride ions are part of the feedback mechanism, the macula densa primarily senses NaCl, not just chloride ions. The macula densa senses the combined concentration of sodium and chloride to regulate GFR properly. D. Opening of voltage-gated Na channels in afferent arteriole: This is incorrect because voltage-gated sodium channels are not directly involved in tubuloglomerular feedback. The mechanism is based on the sensing of NaCl concentration by the macula densa and subsequent signaling to adjust the tone of the afferent arteriole, not by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Na+ cotransport. Glucose is reabsorbed in the renal tubules through a Na+ cotransport system. Specifically, in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), glucose is transported into renal tubular cells by sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). These transporters couple the movement of sodium ions (Na+) down their electrochemical gradient with the uptake of glucose. This process is secondary active transport, as the energy required for glucose reabsorption is derived from the sodium gradient, which is maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral side of the tubular cells. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect: A. K+ symport: This is incorrect because glucose is not transported with potassium (K+). The transport of glucose is coupled with sodium (Na+), not potassium. B. K+ antiport: This is incorrect because the transport of glucose is not coupled with the exchange of potassium (K+) across the membrane. The term \"antiport\" refers to the exchange of two different ions in opposite directions, but glucose transport involves Na+ and glucose moving in the same direction, not an antiport mechanism. D. Na antiport: This is incorrect because glucose is not transported via an antiport mechanism with sodium. The correct mechanism is Na+ cotransport, where sodium and glucose are transported in the same direction, not exchanged.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Aldosterone in collecting ducts. Aldosterone is a hormone that acts primarily on the collecting ducts of the kidney, where it stimulates the reabsorption of sodium (Na+) and the secretion of potassium (K+). This action helps increase the sodium and water retention in the body, raising blood volume and blood pressure. Aldosterone also contributes to the regulation of potassium balance, helping to maintain homeostasis. Now, let's look at why the other options are incorrect: A. Angiotensin distal tubule: This is incorrect because angiotensin does not primarily act on the distal tubule. Angiotensin II mainly acts on the efferent arteriole (constricting it to increase glomerular filtration pressure) and also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands. While it has some indirect effects on tubular reabsorption, its direct action is not at the distal tubule. C. ADH in proximal tubule: This is incorrect because antidiuretic hormone (ADH) primarily acts on the collecting ducts and the distal convoluted tubule to increase water reabsorption by promoting the insertion of aquaporin channels in the tubular cells. ADH has a minimal direct effect on the proximal tubule. D. ANP in LOH: This is incorrect because atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) primarily acts on the glomerulus and the collecting ducts, not the loop of Henle (LOH). ANP promotes natriuresis (sodium excretion) and inhibits sodium reabsorption in the collecting ducts, which helps lower blood pressure. It does not have a significant role in the loop of Henle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 125 mg/min. The excretion rate of glucose is determined by the filtered load minus the reabsorbed amount. The filtered load of glucose can be calculated by multiplying the plasma glucose concentration by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Filtered load of glucose = Plasma glucose × GFR = (400 mg/dL) × (125 mL/min) = 50000 mg/min The tubular maximum (Tm) for glucose is the maximum rate at which glucose can be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. If the filtered load exceeds the Tm, then the excess glucose will be excreted in the urine. Here, the Tm for glucose is 375 mg/min, so the amount of glucose that will be reabsorbed is 375 mg/min. Thus, the excretion rate of glucose = Filtered load - Tm = 50000 mg/min – 375 mg/min = 125 mg/min. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. 25 mg/min: This is incorrect because it underestimates the excretion rate. The excretion rate is determined by the amount of glucose that exceeds the Tm, and given the high filtered load (50000 mg/min) and the Tm of 375 mg/min, the excretion rate is significantly higher. B. 425 mg/min: This is incorrect because the excretion rate should not exceed the filtered load of glucose. The excretion rate cannot be more than the amount of glucose filtered by the glomerulus. The correct excretion rate is the difference between the filtered load and the Tm, which gives 125 mg/min, not 425 mg/min. C. 325 mg/min: This is incorrect for the same reason as option B. It does not account for the fact that the Tm for glucose limits the amount reabsorbed, and the excretion rate is the difference between the filtered load and the Tm. The correct value is 125 mg/min, not 325 mg/min.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phosphate. In the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), the most important buffer system is the phosphate buffer system. This is due to the phosphate ions (HPO4²-) present in the filtrate, which can act as a weak acid or base depending on the pH. Phosphate buffers are particularly effective in the acidic environment of the DCT, where they help to neutralize excess hydrogen ions (H+) that are secreted into the tubule. The phosphate buffer works by accepting hydrogen ions, forming H2PO4-, thus preventing large changes in pH and aiding in the regulation of acid-base balance. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. Bicarbonate: This is incorrect because although bicarbonate (HCO3-) plays a major role in buffering in other parts of the kidney, such as the proximal tubule and the blood, it is less active in the DCT compared to the phosphate buffer system. The kidneys use bicarbonate to balance the pH, but in the DCT, phosphate is the predominant buffer. C. Ammonia: This is incorrect because while ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in acid-base regulation in the kidneys, especially in the collecting ducts, it is not the primary buffer in the DCT. Ammonia helps with the excretion of hydrogen ions by forming ammonium (NH4+), but phosphate buffering is more directly involved in the DCT. D. Protein: This is incorrect because while proteins do contribute to buffering capacity due to their amino acid side chains (especially in the blood), they are not the primary buffer in the DCT.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Glucose. Glucose has the highest tubular maximum (Tm) compared to the other options. The kidneys reabsorb glucose in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) using Na?-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). Under normal circumstances, the kidneys can efficiently reabsorb glucose from the filtrate until the plasma glucose concentration exceeds the renal threshold (Tm), at which point glucose begins to appear in the urine. The Tm for glucose is relatively high, which allows the kidneys to reabsorb a large amount of glucose in healthy individuals. However, when the Tm is exceeded (as in diabetes mellitus), glucose will be excreted in the urine. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. Plasma protein: This is incorrect because plasma proteins such as albumin are typically not filtered in large quantities through the glomerulus under normal conditions due to their large size. Only small amounts of plasma proteins are filtered, and they are generally reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Plasma proteins do not have a high Tm, as they do not normally appear in significant amounts in the filtrate. B. Hb (Hemoglobin): This is incorrect because hemoglobin (Hb) is not normally found in the filtrate. When hemoglobin is present in the urine (hemoglobinuria), it is usually due to pathological conditions like hemolysis or trauma. Hemoglobin does not have a tubular maximum since it is not normally filtered in large quantities and is not actively reabsorbed by the renal tubules. D. Sodium: This is incorrect because sodium (Na?) has a relatively low Tm compared to glucose. Sodium is actively reabsorbed throughout the nephron, especially in the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. Since sodium is so efficiently reabsorbed, it doesn't have a high Tm, and its reabsorption is tightly regulated through mechanisms like aldosterone and ANP. Sodium reabsorption continues effectively even when plasma sodium concentrations are quite high.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) H+. Hydrogen ions (H?) are not actively absorbed from the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). Instead, H? is secreted into the PCT as part of the body's mechanism for maintaining acid-base balance. This process is not a simple absorption but a secretion where H? ions are exchanged for sodium ions (Na?) through a sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE). The primary role of the PCT is to reabsorb bicarbonate (HCO??) and other solutes, but it does not reabsorb H?. The secretion of H? contributes to the acidification of the urine. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. Na+: This is incorrect because sodium (Na?) is actively reabsorbed in the PCT through sodium transporters, such as the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE) and sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs).

Phosphate: This is incorrect because phosphate is reabsorbed in the PCT, but its reabsorption is regulated by the renal threshold for phosphate.

This means that the PCT plays a crucial role in the conservation of potassium, helping to maintain its levels within the body. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A.

The DCT is more involved in fine-tuning potassium balance and is regulated by hormones like aldosterone, which increases potassium secretion when necessary. B. LOH (Loop of Henle): This is incorrect because the loop of Henle primarily handles water and sodium reabsorption, with only a small amount of potassium being reabsorbed. The thick ascending limb (TAL) is impermeable to water, and the reabsorption of potassium in the TAL is largely coupled with sodium transport. D. CD (Collecting Duct): This is incorrect because while the collecting duct plays a role in the final regulation of potassium balance, particularly in response to aldosterone, it does not account for the maximal reabsorption of potassium. The collecting duct is involved in both potassium secretion and reabsorption depending on the body’s needs, but most potassium reabsorption occurs earlier in the nephron, particularly in the PCT.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Proximal tubule. The proximal tubule (PCT) is responsible for the majority of water reabsorption, around 65-70% of the filtered water, regardless of the presence or absence of vasopressin (ADH). This occurs through osmotic reabsorption, where water follows the reabsorbed solutes (like sodium) through aquaporins. Even in the presence of vasopressin, the greatest fraction of water reabsorption occurs in the PCT, as its reabsorption is not regulated by vasopressin but is passive and proportional to solute reabsorption. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: B. Loop of Henle: This is incorrect because although the Loop of Henle contributes to water reabsorption (particularly in the descending limb, where water is reabsorbed passively), the volume reabsorbed in this segment is still less than in the proximal tubule. In the descending limb, water reabsorption is passive, while in the ascending limb, water is impermeable, and solute reabsorption occurs. C. Distal tubule: This is incorrect because the distal tubule is responsible for only a small fraction of water reabsorption, even in the presence of vasopressin. Although water permeability in the distal tubule can be regulated by vasopressin, it does not account for the largest portion of water reabsorption. D. Cortical collecting duct: This is incorrect because while the cortical collecting duct is involved in water reabsorption and is vasopressin-regulated, it is not the site of the greatest fraction of water reabsorption. In the presence of vasopressin, water reabsorption in the collecting duct increases, but the majority of filtered water is still reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The collecting duct contributes to fine-tuning water balance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 50 mOsm/L. The minimum urine osmolality that can be achieved by the human kidney is 50 mOsm/L. This happens when the kidney is under conditions of maximal dilution, meaning it is trying to excrete as much water as possible while maintaining the minimum solute concentration. The ability to dilute urine to 50 mOsm/L is a result of the kidney's countercurrent mechanism in the Loop of Henle and the absence of ADH (antidiuretic hormone), which allows the collecting ducts to remain impermeable to water. Now, let's explore why the other options are incorrect: A. 100 mOsm/L: This is incorrect because the kidney can achieve a lower osmolality than 100 mOsm/L under conditions of maximal dilution. While 100 mOsm/L is possible, it is not the minimum osmolality that the human kidney can produce. B. 80 mOsm/L: This is incorrect for the same reason as 100 mOsm/L. The kidney is capable of achieving an osmolality lower than 80 mOsm/L when conditions favor maximal urine dilution. D. 20 mOsm/L: This is incorrect because the human kidney cannot achieve urine osmolality as low as 20 mOsm/L. The minimum limit of urine osmolality is typically around 50 mOsm/L, and the kidney's ability to further dilute urine beyond that is limited by physiological constraints.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inner medulla. The maximum osmotic gradient in the kidney is found in the inner medulla. This gradient is primarily established and maintained by the countercurrent multiplier system in the Loop of Henle and the countercurrent exchanger system in the vasa recta. The high osmolarity in the inner medulla (up to 1200-1400 mOsm/L) is created by the accumulation of solutes, such as sodium, chloride, and urea, which are crucial for the concentration of urine. This gradient allows for water reabsorption in the collecting ducts under the influence of ADH (antidiuretic hormone), aiding in the production of concentrated urine when necessary. Incorrect options: A. Outer medulla: This is incorrect because while the outer medulla contributes to the osmotic gradient, the osmolarity here is lower compared to the inner medulla. The outer medulla primarily houses the ascending and descending limbs of shorter nephrons, which do not penetrate deeply enough to contribute significantly to the maximal gradient. C. Outer cortex: This is incorrect because the osmotic gradient in the cortex is much smaller compared to the medulla. The cortical interstitium has an osmolality close to that of plasma (around 300 mOsm/L), as it primarily functions in the filtration and initial reabsorption processes. D. Inner cortex: This is incorrect because the osmotic gradient in the cortex (both outer and inner) is lower than in the medulla. The cortex primarily serves as the site of glomerular filtration and early tubular processing, and the steep osmotic gradients required for concentrating urine are not present here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Renin-angiotensin system. Correct Answer Explanation: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in sodium and water retention, primarily through the actions of angiotensin II and aldosterone. When blood pressure or blood volume decreases, renin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is further converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II has several effects: Stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, promoting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. Water follows sodium, leading to increased water retention. Promotes vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure and reduces renal perfusion, further stimulating sodium and water reabsorption. Stimulates thirst and ADH secretion, contributing to water retention and volume expansion. RAS is the most critical mechanism in regulating sodium and water homeostasis, especially during hypovolemia or hypotension. Incorrect Options: B. ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide): ANP is a counter-regulatory hormone that promotes sodium excretion (natriuresis) and water loss (diuresis) to reduce blood volume and pressure. While it plays a role in volume regulation, it opposes the effects of RAS and does not promote sodium and water retention. C. BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide): Like ANP, BNP also promotes natriuresis and diuresis. It is secreted by the ventricles of the heart in response to excessive stretching due to increased blood volume. Its role is to counteract fluid overload rather than retain sodium and water. D. ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): ADH contributes to water retention by increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidneys via aquaporin channels. However, it does not directly influence sodium retention, making it less significant than RAS in sodium and water balance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Urea. Explanation: In central diabetes insipidus, there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urine output and dilute urine. When ADH is administered, it increases the permeability of the collecting ducts to water, promoting water reabsorption and resulting in more concentrated urine. Urea contributes significantly to the osmolarity of the renal medulla, and its reabsorption is enhanced by ADH. This increased reabsorption of urea reduces its concentration in the urine, thereby decreasing its clearance. Incorrect options: B. Glucose: Glucose is freely filtered by the glomerulus and is typically reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. In the absence of ADH, glucose reabsorption is not significantly affected. Therefore, its clearance would not be notably altered by ADH administration. C. Potassium: Potassium is filtered by the glomerulus and undergoes both reabsorption and secretion along the nephron. ADH primarily affects water permeability and does not directly influence potassium handling. Thus, potassium clearance would not be significantly altered by ADH administration. D. PAH (Para-aminohippuric acid): PAH is filtered and actively secreted by the renal tubules. ADH does not affect the secretion of PAH.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inulin. Explanation: Inulin is a substance that is freely filtered by the glomerulus and neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules. This unique property makes inulin clearance an accurate measure of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the provided data, the filtered and excreted amounts of substance Z are equal at each concentration, indicating that it is neither reabsorbed nor secreted, similar to inulin. Incorrect options: A. PAH (Para-aminohippuric acid): PAH is filtered by the glomerulus and actively secreted by the renal tubules. This secretion results in a clearance of PAH that is higher than the GFR, as it is both filtered and secreted. Therefore, the clearance of PAH does not match the data provided for substance Z. C. Glucose: Glucose is filtered by the glomerulus and is typically reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. In a healthy individual, all filtered glucose is reabsorbed, resulting in a clearance of zero. However, in the provided data, the excreted amount of substance Z increases with its filtered amount, indicating that it is not reabsorbed, which is not characteristic of glucose. D. Sodium: Sodium is filtered by the glomerulus and is extensively reabsorbed in the renal tubules. The clearance of sodium is typically much lower than the GFR due to this reabsorption. The data provided for substance Z, where excretion equals filtration, does not align with the expected handling of sodium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Curve C. Explanation: Inulin is a substance that is freely filtered by the glomerulus and neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules. This means that the concentration of inulin in the tubular fluid remains constant along the nephron, and its excretion rate is directly proportional to the filtration rate. Therefore, the profile of inulin along the nephron would be represented by a curve that shows a constant concentration of inulin in the tubular fluid, indicating no reabsorption or secretion. Incorrect options: A. Curve A: This curve likely represents a substance that is reabsorbed along the nephron, leading to a decrease in its concentration in the tubular fluid as it moves along the nephron. This is not characteristic of inulin. B. Curve B: This curve may depict a substance that is secreted into the tubular fluid, resulting in an increase in its concentration as it moves along the nephron. Inulin does not undergo secretion, so this curve does not represent its profile. D. Curve D: This curve could represent a substance that is both reabsorbed and secreted, leading to a more complex profile of its concentration along the nephron. Inulin's profile is simpler, with a constant concentration, so this curve does not match its behavior.",
