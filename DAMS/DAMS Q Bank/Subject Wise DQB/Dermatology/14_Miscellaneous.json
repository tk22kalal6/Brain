      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). The \"Carpet Tack sign\" is a classic finding in discoid lupus erythematosus, which is a chronic, cutaneous form of lupus. It refers to the appearance of the scalp or affected areas where the hair follicles are surrounded by keratotic plugs, resembling the heads of carpet tacks. This sign is associated with the scarring and follicular hyperkeratosis that occurs in DLE lesions, particularly when there is significant follicular involvement. Incorrect Responses: A. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) generally presents with a butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks and nose, but does not have the Carpet Tack sign. SLE can involve various organs and is a systemic disease, so its dermatologic findings are different from DLE. C. Rosacea is a chronic skin condition characterized by facial redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes pustules. While it may involve the face, it does not present with the Carpet Tack sign, as it lacks the follicular keratinization and scarring seen in DLE. D. Morphea is a localized form of scleroderma that causes hardened, thickened areas of skin. It does not present with follicular changes like the Carpet Tack sign, and the skin changes are typically smooth and indurated, not keratotic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is a febrile illness that primarily affects children under the age of 5 and is characterized by a combination of symptoms, including fever lasting for at least 5 days, cracked lips, conjunctival injection (red eyes), an erythematous exanthem (rash), and cervical lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). This disease can lead to serious cardiovascular complications if left untreated, such as coronary artery aneurysms. The combination of these specific features strongly points to Kawasaki disease. Incorrect Responses: A. Rubeola (Measles) is characterized by a high fever, cough, coryza (runny nose), conjunctivitis, and a characteristic red, blotchy rash that usually begins on the face and spreads downward. However, rubeola does not typically cause cervical lymphadenopathy or cracked lips, which are more suggestive of Kawasaki disease. C. Erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease) is caused by parvovirus B19 and typically presents with a \"slapped cheek\" rash, followed by a lacy red rash on the body. While it may cause fever and a rash, it does not present with conjunctival injection, cracked lips, or cervical lymphadenopathy as seen in Kawasaki disease. D. Rubella presents with a rash that begins on the face and spreads down the body, along with mild fever and swollen lymph nodes. However, rubella does not typically cause cracked lips or conjunctival injection, which are key features of Kawasaki disease. Additionally, rubella is usually less severe than Kawasaki disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Slit lamp examination of eye. The description of irregular hyperpigmented patches on the trunk and multiple small hyperpigmented macules in the axillae and groins since childhood suggests Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease. One of the common ocular manifestations of NF1 is Lisch nodules, which are pigmented hamartomas of the iris. The slit lamp examination of the eye is the most appropriate investigation to detect these Lisch nodules, which are a diagnostic feature of NF1. Incorrect Responses: A. Retinal artery angiography is typically used to evaluate the blood vessels of the retina and detect conditions like retinal vascular diseases, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal artery occlusion. It is not useful in diagnosing neurofibromatosis or identifying Lisch nodules. B. Examination of fundus involves examining the back of the eye (fundus) to assess for various eye conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy or optic nerve diseases. Although NF1 can affect the optic nerve, fundus examination is not specifically helpful for diagnosing the typical ocular manifestations of NF1, like Lisch nodules. C. Measurement of intraocular tension is used to assess for glaucoma, a condition characterized by elevated intraocular pressure. While individuals with NF1 can have an increased risk of certain ocular problems, measuring intraocular pressure is not a diagnostic tool for identifying Lisch nodules or NF1.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rash is itchy. Erythema marginatum is a type of rash often associated with rheumatic fever. It is not typically itchy. The rash is characterized by erythematous, serpiginous (snake-like) lesions with a well-defined border, and it tends to resolve without causing significant discomfort or pruritus (itchiness). The absence of itching is a distinguishing feature of erythema marginatum compared to other rashes that may present with pruritus. Incorrect Responses: A. Lesions are serpiginous is true. Erythema marginatum presents with serpiginous (wavy, snake-like) lesions that have well-defined borders. These lesions may enlarge and form a ring-like pattern as they progress. B. Characteristically it is evanescent is true. Erythema marginatum is known for its evanescent (fleeting) nature, meaning the rash often appears and fades quickly. The lesions may last for a few hours to a couple of days, and their appearance can be transient. C. Rash worsens on application of heat is true. The rash of erythema marginatum often worsens with heat or friction. Heat can cause the blood vessels to dilate, making the redness of the rash more pronounced. This feature is commonly seen in the erythema marginatum rash and can help differentiate it from other skin conditions.",

Erythema infectiosum, also known as Fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19 and typically presents with a \"slapped cheek\" rash, followed by a lacy erythematous rash on the body. It does not cause significant desquamation (skin peeling) as seen in the other conditions listed. While the rash may evolve over time, desquamation is not a characteristic feature of erythema infectiosum. Incorrect Responses: B. Kawasaki disease is characterized by fever, conjunctival injection, changes in the lips and mouth, and a polymorphous rash, followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the fingers and toes, in the later stages of the disease. This is a hallmark feature of Kawasaki disease. C. Scarlet fever is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and presents with a distinctive \"sandpaper-like\" rash that often leads to desquamation, particularly on the palms and soles, as the illness resolves. This shedding of the skin typically occurs in the recovery phase of scarlet fever. D. Toxic shock syndrome is caused by toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. One of the major features of this condition is widespread erythema followed by desquamation, especially on the palms and soles, once the acute illness subsides.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ollendorf sign - tertiary syphilis: This statement is considered incorrect because the Ollendorf sign is primarily and most characteristically associated with lesions of secondary syphilis, not tertiary syphilis. The Ollendorf sign describes exquisite tenderness upon deep palpation over active syphilitic lesions, such as papules or nodules. This tenderness is a hallmark of the acute inflammatory stage seen in secondary syphilis. While a painful gumma (a lesion of tertiary syphilis) might exhibit some tenderness, the Ollendorf sign is classically taught and observed as a more consistent and prominent finding in the widespread, inflammatory lesions of secondary syphilis. Therefore, linking it predominantly or exclusively to tertiary syphilis makes the statement inaccurate in the context of its primary clinical significance",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tinea capitis. Wood's lamp is commonly used in dermatology for the diagnosis of various fungal infections, particularly tinea capitis. Under Wood's lamp (which emits ultraviolet light), some fungal infections, such as Microsporum species (a common cause of tinea capitis), fluoresce a characteristic greenish-yellow color. This helps differentiate tinea capitis from other scalp conditions and aids in the diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: B. Candida albicans typically does not fluoresce under Wood's lamp. While Candida infections are common, especially in mucocutaneous areas, they do not show a distinct fluorescence under ultraviolet light like tinea capitis. C. Histoplasma infections do not usually demonstrate fluorescence under Wood's lamp. Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, and its diagnosis is primarily based on cultures, serologic tests, or histopathology, not Wood's lamp examination. D. Cryptococcus is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs and central nervous system, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus infections do not typically show fluorescence under Wood's lamp, and its diagnosis relies on other methods, such as antigen detection, cultures, or microscopy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Erythema Nodosum. Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis (inflammation of the fat layer beneath the skin) that typically presents as erythematous, tender, subcutaneous nodules, most commonly on the shins (pretibial area). The condition is often associated with systemic symptoms like fever and arthralgia (joint pain). Erythema nodosum can be triggered by various conditions, including infections such as a sore throat (often caused by Streptococcus), and it is characterized by the sudden onset of tender, red nodules. The patient’s presentation with sore throat and these specific nodules makes erythema nodosum the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Erythema induratum refers to a similar condition of subcutaneous nodules, but it is typically associated with tuberculosis or other chronic infections. The nodules in erythema induratum tend to be deeper and more indurated (firm), and it is less likely to be triggered by an acute sore throat or associated with arthralgia. B. Sarcoidosis can present with skin involvement in the form of erythema nodosum; however, it usually presents with other systemic symptoms such as lung involvement, hilar lymphadenopathy, and granulomas in various organs. The acute presentation following a sore throat is more suggestive of erythema nodosum due to infection rather than sarcoidosis. C. Syphilis can cause a variety of skin manifestations, such as rashes in the secondary stage, but it does not typically present with erythematous, tender nodules on the shins. Syphilis rashes are more generalized and often do not have the specific characteristics seen in erythema nodosum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) They are usually non-tender. This statement is false because erythema nodosum lesions are typically tender to the touch. These subcutaneous nodules, which appear on the shins and other areas, are known for being very painful, especially when pressure is applied. The tenderness is a hallmark feature of erythema nodosum and helps distinguish it from other skin conditions. Incorrect Responses: A. They are considered as hypersensitivity reaction is true. Erythema nodosum is a type of hypersensitivity reaction, often triggered by various factors such as infections (e.g., streptococcal throat infection), medications, and systemic diseases. It is a response of the immune system causing inflammation in the fat layer beneath the skin. B. The skin overlying the lesion is red, smooth and shiny is true. The skin over erythema nodosum lesions is typically red, smooth, and shiny. The nodules are often raised, and the skin above them can have a characteristic appearance that is erythematous and inflamed. D. They can be associated with tuberculosis is true. Erythema nodosum can indeed be associated with tuberculosis, among other conditions like sarcoidosis, streptococcal throat infection, and inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of erythema nodosum in the context of tuberculosis is a known clinical association.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum is a condition characterized by tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, often found on the shins (pretibial area). It is commonly associated with systemic symptoms like fever, malaise, and arthralgia (joint pain), particularly in the ankles, as described in the patient. This condition is a hypersensitivity reaction and can be triggered by infections, including streptococcal throat infections, or other systemic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. The combination of tender erythematous nodules, joint pain, and fever strongly points to erythema nodosum. Incorrect Responses: B. Hansen’s disease (Leprosy) is incorrect. Hansen's disease can present with skin lesions, nerve involvement, and other systemic signs, but the description of erythematous, tender nodules on the shins is more characteristic of erythema nodosum. Leprosy typically involves sensory loss and more chronic skin lesions, such as hypopigmented patches or nodules, which are not tender like in erythema nodosum. C. Weber-Christian disease is incorrect. Weber-Christian disease (also known as recurrent migratory panniculitis) is a rare inflammatory disorder involving recurrent episodes of painful subcutaneous nodules. However, it is less commonly associated with the same triggers as erythema nodosum, and its presentation tends to be more chronic and recurrent, unlike the acute onset described in this case. D. Nodular vasculitis is incorrect. Nodular vasculitis can present with erythematous nodules, but it is typically associated with a more chronic course and different underlying causes such as vasculitis. The acute fever, malaise, and joint pain along with tender nodules over the shin are more suggestive of erythema nodosum, which is often a self-limiting condition and is more commonly seen in the setting described here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum is an extrarenal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is closely associated with disease severity. It often occurs during active flare-ups of IBD, particularly in conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The presence of erythema nodosum is considered a sign of systemic inflammation and can indicate that the IBD is active or severe. Therefore, its occurrence can correlate with the severity of IBD. Incorrect Responses: A. Uveitis is incorrect. While uveitis is an extrarenal manifestation of IBD, it does not correlate as strongly with the severity of the disease as erythema nodosum does. Uveitis is an inflammatory eye condition that may occur in IBD patients, but it can occur at any stage of the disease, not necessarily during flare-ups or with more severe disease. B. Arthritis is incorrect. Arthritis is a common extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, but it does not necessarily correlate directly with the severity of the IBD itself. While joint involvement can occur in both mild and severe cases of IBD, it is typically a peripheral arthritis and often resolves independently of disease activity. D. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is incorrect. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune liver disease that can be associated with IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis. However, PSC does not directly correlate with the severity of IBD. In fact, PSC is more commonly seen in long-standing, chronic cases of ulcerative colitis and may not necessarily reflect the current activity or severity of the IBD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Erythema chronicum: Lyme’s disease. Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) is the characteristic skin lesion of Lyme disease, which is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted through tick bites. The lesion typically appears as a red, expanding erythematous rash with a central clearing, often referred to as a \"bull's-eye\" appearance. This is a hallmark sign of early-stage Lyme disease, making this the correct combination. Incorrect Responses: A. Erythema infectiosum: TB is incorrect. Erythema infectiosum, also known as \"fifth disease,\" is caused by parvovirus B19, not tuberculosis (TB). TB can cause other skin manifestations, but it does not cause erythema infectiosum, which is characterized by a \"slapped cheek\" rash, particularly in children. B. Erythema marginatum: Parvovirus is incorrect. Erythema marginatum is a type of skin rash that is more commonly associated with rheumatic fever, which occurs after a streptococcal throat infection, not parvovirus. The rash of erythema marginatum is erythematous, well-defined, and often has a serpiginous or \"marginal\" appearance. C. Erythema multiforme: Sarcoidosis is incorrect. Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity reaction most often triggered by infections (e.g., herpes simplex virus) or drugs. It does not have a strong association with sarcoidosis, which is a granulomatous disease that can cause a variety of skin lesions, but erythema multiforme is not typically one of them",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acrodermatitis enteropathica. This is a rare congenital disorder caused by a zinc deficiency, often due to mutations in the SLC39A4 gene that impairs zinc absorption in the intestines. The classic presentation includes erythematous, scaly, and sometimes crusted lesions around the face, hands, and feet, along with diarrhea and alopecia. Zinc is essential for skin integrity, immune function, and cellular growth, and a deficiency leads to these characteristic skin findings. Incorrect Responses: A. Scurvy is incorrect. Scurvy is caused by a deficiency in vitamin C (ascorbic acid), not zinc. It is characterized by symptoms like bleeding gums, bruising, joint pain, and poor wound healing, rather than the skin lesions seen in acrodermatitis enteropathica. B. Kwashiorkor is incorrect. Kwashiorkor is a form of severe protein malnutrition, not a zinc deficiency. It is characterized by edema, fatty liver, skin changes, and delayed growth, but zinc deficiency is not the primary cause. It’s more related to protein-energy malnutrition and lacks the distinctive features of acrodermatitis enteropathica. D. Pellagra is incorrect. Pellagra is caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3), and it manifests with the \"3 Ds\" — dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. The skin lesions in pellagra are typically photosensitive and do not resemble those seen in acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is specific to zinc deficiency.",

These freckles are small, light brown spots that appear in the armpit area, which is a characteristic finding in NF1, not in tuberous sclerosis. Therefore, this is the exception in the list. Incorrect Responses: A. Hypomelanotic macules is correct. Hypomelanotic macules, also called \"ash-leaf spots,\" are common in tuberous sclerosis and are considered one of the diagnostic criteria for the condition. These spots are pale, oval-shaped areas with a smooth surface and are often seen on the trunk and limbs. B. Shagreen patch is correct. Shagreen patches are another characteristic skin finding in tuberous sclerosis. These are rough, raised, leathery patches of skin, usually found on the lower back, and are diagnostic for tuberous sclerosis. C. Koenen’s tumors is correct. Koenen’s tumors are fibromas that appear under the nails and are a hallmark of tuberous sclerosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Nicotinic acid. The symptoms described — diarrhea, scaly rash (often on the neck, hands, and feet), and alcohol use — are characteristic of pellagra, which is caused by niacin (nicotinic acid) deficiency. Pellagra is common in chronic alcoholics who have poor nutrition. Niacin deficiency leads to the \"3 D's\" of pellagra: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. Treating with nicotinic acid (niacin) will correct the deficiency and improve the symptoms. Incorrect Responses: B. Thiamine is incorrect. Thiamine deficiency causes beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can be seen in alcoholics. Symptoms of thiamine deficiency include neurologic symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and memory issues, not the diarrhea and scaly rash associated with pellagra. C. Vitamin A is incorrect. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness, xerophthalmia (dry eyes), and skin changes like hyperkeratosis. However, it does not cause the characteristic symptoms of diarrhea and scaly rash seen in pellagra. D. Folic Acid is incorrect. Folic acid deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia and can be seen in alcoholics as well, but it does not cause the characteristic skin changes (scaly rash) and diarrhea seen in pellagra.

They are often seen in older adults and are typically characterized by their waxy, raised appearance with a well-defined border. These lesions are non-cancerous and do not pose a risk for malignant transformation. While they may be removed for cosmetic reasons or if they become irritated, they are not considered precancerous. Incorrect Responses: A. Seborrheic keratoses are superficial benign skin tumors is correct. Seborrheic keratoses are indeed benign and are generally considered superficial tumors. They are composed of proliferating basal cells and typically do not invade deeper layers of the skin. B. They can be removed by curettage is correct. Seborrheic keratoses can be removed by curettage (scraping), as well as other methods like cryotherapy (freezing), laser therapy, or excision. Curettage is a common method for removal when necessary. C. Seborrheic keratoses if appear suddenly in an eruptive fashion may indicate internal malignancy is correct. While seborrheic keratoses are usually benign, a sudden onset of numerous lesions, known as Leser-Trelat sign, can sometimes be associated with internal malignancy, particularly gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Rosacea. PUVA (Psoralen + UVA) therapy is not typically used in the treatment of rosacea. Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the face, causing redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes pustules. While PUVA therapy is effective for certain skin conditions, it is not a standard treatment for rosacea. Incorrect Responses: A. Psoriasis is correct. PUVA therapy is a well-established treatment for psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune condition that leads to the rapid growth of skin cells, forming thick, scaly patches. PUVA helps reduce inflammation and control the abnormal skin cell turnover by combining a photosensitizing drug (psoralen) with UVA light. B. Vitiligo is correct. Vitiligo, a condition characterized by depigmentation of the skin, can also be treated with PUVA therapy. The combination of psoralen and UVA light stimulates melanocyte function and helps repigment the skin. D. Mycosis Fungoides is correct. Mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is another condition treated with PUVA therapy. PUVA can help to reduce the symptoms and manage the disease by targeting the malignant T-cells in the sk",

These are characteristic skin findings seen in tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder that leads to the development of benign tumors in various organs. Shagreen patches are thick, leathery, raised, and usually found in the lower back (lumbosacral region) and are one of the diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Face is incorrect. Shagreen patches are not commonly found on the face. While tuberous sclerosis can involve facial features (e.g., adenoma sebaceum), shagreen patches are more commonly seen in the lumbosacral region, not on the face. B. Cervical region is incorrect. Shagreen patches are not typically located in the cervical (neck) region. Although skin changes in tuberous sclerosis can occur in various locations, the lumbosacral region is where shagreen patches are more commonly seen. C. Limbs is incorrect. Shagreen patches are not typically found on the limbs. The condition is more localized to the lumbosacral region, although other cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis can appear on the limbs, such as fibromas or hypomelanotic macules.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Axillary freckling. Axillary freckling, also known as Crowe's sign, is considered a pathognomonic sign for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This sign refers to the presence of small, dark freckles in the axillary (armpit) area and is an important diagnostic criterion for neurofibromatosis. The presence of axillary freckling, in addition to other findings, helps to confirm the diagnosis of NF1. Incorrect Responses: A. Café-au-lait macules is incorrect. While café-au-lait macules (light brown spots on the skin) are a common feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), they are not pathognomonic for the condition. These macules can be found in various other conditions and are not exclusive to NF1. Typically, multiple café-au-lait macules are seen in NF1, and their presence can be used as a diagnostic clue, but axillary freckling is more definitive for this diagnosis. C. Shagreen patch is incorrect. Shagreen patches are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, not neurofibromatosis. They are thick, leathery skin patches that usually appear in the lumbosacral region and are not associated with neurofibromatosis. D. None of the above is incorrect because axillary freckling is indeed a pathognomonic sign of neurofibromatosis. Therefore, this option does not apply.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color, is primarily formed from the amino acid tyrosine. This complex biochemical process, known as melanogenesis, occurs within specialized cells called melanocytes. The initial and rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis is the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), and then the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone. Both these steps are catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. Subsequent reactions, involving various intermediates, lead to the formation of different types of melanin, primarily eumelanin (black/brown pigment) and pheomelanin (red/yellow pigment). Therefore, tyrosine is the fundamental precursor for all melanin production. Why other options are incorrect: B. Tryptophan: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor for several important biomolecules, including serotonin, melatonin, and niacin (Vitamin B3). However, it is not involved in the synthesis of melanin. C. Leucine: Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) crucial for protein synthesis, muscle repair, and energy production. It plays no role in melanin formation. D. Valine: Valine is also an essential branched-chain amino acid involved in muscle metabolism and tissue repair. Like leucine, it is not a precursor for melanin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The patch test is the gold standard test used to detect type IV reaction (delayed hypersensitivity),done for allergic contact dermatitis. Lupus vulgaris is persistent and progressive form of cutaneous TB. Small sharply defined reddish-brown papules merge into plaques with a gelatinous consistency (called apple-jelly nodules). Lesions persist for years, leading to disfigurement and sometimes skin cancer. Skin biopsy is diagnostic. Tinea capitis is diagnosed by clinical appearance and by potassium hydroxide wet mount of plucked hairs or of hairs and scale obtained by scraping or brushing. The Split skin smear consists of a microbiological examination through Ziehl-Neelsen staining in smears of dermal scrapings from the earlobes, elbows, and knees as well as skin lesions to detect M. leprae.",
