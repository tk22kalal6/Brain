      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Crush tissue preparation stained with Giemsa The patient presents with hypopigmented macules, a history of prolonged fever, and no evidence of enlarged nerves, which are consistent with a clinical suspicion of leprosy, particularly borderline or tuberculoid leprosy. Given that the slit smear did not show acid-fast bacilli (AFB), the next step in diagnosing leprosy would be crush tissue preparation stained with Giemsa. This technique involves crushing a small piece of tissue from the macules, which allows for better visualization of leprosy bacilli (Mycobacterium leprae) in the tissue. Giemsa stain is useful for demonstrating the bacilli, which can often be difficult to detect in standard slit smears. This method is helpful in cases with a negative slit smear, especially when AFB are sparse or not readily seen. Incorrect Options: (B) PCR for lepra bacilli: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for Mycobacterium leprae DNA can be a sensitive diagnostic tool, but it is not typically the next immediate step in diagnosing leprosy when clinical features and negative slit smear results suggest leprosy. PCR is more often used for confirmation in unclear or complicated cases or for research purposes. It is not the first-line diagnostic method after a negative slit smear and typical clinical presentation. (C) Skin biopsy: A skin biopsy can be helpful in diagnosing leprosy, particularly in atypical cases or when the clinical diagnosis is unclear. However, it is more invasive than a crush tissue preparation and does not offer the same direct insight into the presence of bacilli as the crush technique stained with Giemsa. A skin biopsy could be considered later if other methods fail to confirm the diagnosis. (D) Repeat slit smear including nasal septum and earlobes: While repeat slit smears are sometimes performed, the initial negative result does not strongly suggest the presence of active M. leprae infection, especially in the absence of nerve enlargement. Leprosy bacilli are often difficult to detect, and a negative slit smear does not rule out the disease. The next step after a negative slit smear in this case would be a more sensitive method, such as crush tissue preparation, to better assess the tissue for bacilli. Smearing other areas like the nasal septum and earlobes might be considered in some cases but is not as definitive as a Giemsa-stained tissue preparation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Scalp hair Phthirus pubis, commonly known as the pubic louse, is a parasitic insect that typically infests coarse body hair, particularly in the pubic region. It is adapted to attach to hair follicles in areas with thick, coarse hair, such as the pubic hair, axillary hair, and eyelashes, but it does not infest scalp hair. The scalp is not a preferred site for Phthirus pubis as the hair is finer and longer, making it less suitable for the louse to thrive. Incorrect Options: (A) Axillary hair: Phthirus pubis can infest axillary hair (underarm hair) as it prefers coarse body hair. The axilla, being a region of dense, coarse hair, provides a suitable environment for the louse to attach to the hair follicles, making this an appropriate site of infestation. (B) Pubic hair: Pubic hair is the most common site of infestation by Phthirus pubis, which is why the louse is commonly referred to as the \"pubic louse.\" The coarse and dense hair in the pubic region provides an ideal environment for the lice to cling to and thrive, making this a typical location for infestation. (D) Eyelashes: Phthirus pubis can also infest eyelashes, although this is less common than in the pubic or axillary regions. The louse is adapted to attach to hair follicles in these areas, including eyelashes, which have a coarse texture. Infestation of the eyelashes can result in symptoms like itching and irritation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Disinfection of clothing Vagabond's disease, also known as pediculosis corporis (body lice infestation), is caused by Pediculus humanus corporis. The most effective treatment for this condition is disinfection of clothing and bedding, as body lice primarily reside in clothing and the seams of garments. The lice lay eggs (nits) in the clothing fibers, so washing or treating clothes and bedding with hot water and soap, and sometimes drying at high heat, is crucial in eradicating the infestation. This approach helps eliminate both adult lice and their eggs, preventing re-infestation. Treating the environment and personal items is essential to fully manage the condition. Incorrect Options: (B) Permethrin: Permethrin is an effective treatment for head lice and pubic lice (crabs) but is generally not the first-line treatment for body lice (Vagabond’s disease). While permethrin can be used in cases of pediculosis corporis, it does not address the root cause—lice living in the clothing. It may help treat the lice present on the skin, but it is insufficient without the disinfection of clothing and bedding. (C) Malathion: Malathion is an insecticide that can be used to treat head lice and sometimes body lice. However, like permethrin, it is not as effective when used alone for Vagabond's disease. Malathion may help kill lice on the body, but the primary source of re-infestation (the clothing) needs to be addressed through disinfection, making malathion less effective as a stand-alone treatment. (D) Cotrimoxazole: Cotrimoxazole (a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) is an antibiotic and is not used to treat body lice or Vagabond's disease. This medication is effective against bacterial infections but does not target lice, making it irrelevant for treating pediculosis corporis. It may be used in secondary bacterial infections caused by scratching but does not address the lice infestation itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Insect bite hypersensitivity The most likely diagnosis for Rakesh is insect bite hypersensitivity, commonly seen in children who develop a hypersensitive reaction to insect bites, especially from mosquitoes or other biting insects. The presentation of itchy, excoriated papules that worsen during the rainy season and improve in winter is consistent with this condition, as insect populations tend to be more active in the rainy season. The seasonal variation in severity, along with the pattern of involvement (exposed body parts such as the forehead, arms, and legs), further supports this diagnosis. Insect bite hypersensitivity typically causes localized, itchy papules or hives at the site of bites, which can become excoriated from scratching. Incorrect Options: (A) Urticaria: Urticaria (hives) is characterized by transient, raised, and often itchy wheals that come and go. While it causes itching, it does not typically present as excoriated papules, and it doesn't follow a seasonal pattern related to insect bites. Urticaria can be triggered by various factors, but its episodic nature and lack of a chronic, localized pattern like that of insect bite hypersensitivity make it less likely in this case. (B) Scabies: Scabies is a parasitic skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. While it causes intense itching and can present with papules, burrows, and excoriations, scabies tends to affect areas where skin-to-skin contact occurs (such as the webs of fingers, wrists, and groin) rather than the exposed areas of the body. Scabies also does not have the seasonal pattern seen in insect bite hypersensitivity. (D) Atopic dermatitis: Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes itching and excoriated patches. While it can be seasonal, its involvement is typically more diffuse, with flexural areas (such as the elbows, knees, and neck) being more commonly affected. The seasonal variation seen in Rakesh's case is more indicative of an insect bite hypersensitivity response than atopic dermatitis, which usually has more persistent skin lesions that do not improve so completely with season change.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Leishmania donovani Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is caused by Leishmania donovani, the same parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar). PKDL typically occurs as a sequel to untreated or inadequately treated kala-azar and is characterized by the development of dermal lesions, including macules, papules, and nodules, usually on the face and trunk. It is more common in certain regions, including parts of India, Sudan, and Bangladesh, where visceral leishmaniasis is endemic. The parasitic infection can remain dormant in the body and reactivate years after the primary infection, leading to PKDL. Incorrect Options: (B) Leishmania mexicana: Leishmania mexicana is responsible for causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), particularly in Central and South America. It is not the cause of PKDL, which is specifically associated with Leishmania donovani and its visceral form. Leishmania mexicana causes ulcerative skin lesions but does not lead to PKDL. (C) Leishmania aethiopica: Leishmania aethiopica causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in parts of Africa, particularly in Ethiopia. While it can lead to skin lesions, it is not associated with PKDL, which is caused by Leishmania donovani. This species does not lead to the dermal manifestations characteristic of PKDL after kala-azar. (D) Leishmania brasiliensis: Leishmania brasiliensis is a causative agent of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), primarily in South and Central America. MCL involves the destruction of mucosal tissues and is not related to PKDL, which is caused by Leishmania donovani. The lesions in MCL are different from those seen in PKDL, which are typically dermal rather than mucosal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Nodular Scabies Topical or intradermal steroids are indicated in nodular scabies, which is a rare and persistent form of scabies. Nodular scabies is characterized by the presence of itchy, firm nodules that may persist even after the scabies infestation is treated. These nodules are often localized to areas where the skin is thick, such as the groin or genital region. Steroids are used to manage the inflammatory response and to reduce the size and discomfort associated with these nodules. They help to control the ongoing immune reaction after the mites have been eradicated, as the body continues to react to the dead mites or their products. Incorrect Options: (A) Animal Scabies: Animal scabies, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei variants affecting animals (such as dogs), is not typically treated with steroids. This form of scabies usually does not involve humans directly, and its treatment focuses on the management of animal-related infestations. Steroids are not indicated for treating animal scabies in humans. (C) Infantile Scabies: Infantile scabies, which affects young children, requires treatment with scabicidal agents such as permethrin or oral ivermectin. While steroids may be used to treat secondary inflammatory reactions or eczema-like rashes, they are not the primary treatment for scabies in infants. The primary focus remains on eliminating the scabies infestation itself with appropriate anti-scabietic medications. (D) Norwegian Scabies: Norwegian scabies (also called crusted scabies) is a severe form of scabies that typically affects immunocompromised individuals. It is characterized by thick crusts with a high mite burden. Steroids are generally contraindicated in Norwegian scabies because they can exacerbate the infestation by suppressing the immune system's response. The focus of treatment for Norwegian scabies is on aggressive scabicidal therapy and addressing the underlying immune deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Disinfection of clothes only The treatment of choice for pediculosis corporis (body lice infestation) is disinfection of clothes only. Pediculosis corporis is caused by Pediculus humanus corporis, which resides in clothing and bedding, rather than directly on the skin. The primary method of treatment involves thoroughly washing and disinfecting clothes, bedding, and other personal items to eliminate lice and their eggs. This may include washing in hot water and drying at high temperatures. Addressing the source of the infestation by decontaminating clothing is crucial, as the lice live and breed in the seams of garments. While topical treatments for lice on the skin may be used, clothing disinfection is the most effective and essential step in treating this condition. Incorrect Options: (A) Benzene hexachloride for 3 applications: Benzene hexachloride (also known as lindane) was once used to treat lice infestations, including pediculosis corporis. However, it is now rarely used due to concerns about toxicity and the development of resistance. It can cause neurotoxic effects and is not the first-line treatment for body lice. Disinfection of clothing is preferred, and other safer alternatives like permethrin are considered more effective for treating lice directly on the skin. (B) Benzyl benzoate for three applications: Benzyl benzoate is a topical treatment used for scabies, not for body lice. While it may have some efficacy in treating scabies infestations, it is not used for treating pediculosis corporis. Disinfecting clothing and addressing the infestation's source is the primary treatment for body lice. (D) Permethrin 1% application: Permethrin 1% is an effective treatment for head lice and pubic lice, but it is not the primary treatment for body lice (pediculosis corporis). Although it can be applied to the skin in body lice cases, disinfection of clothing and bedding remains the most critical aspect of treatment, as the lice primarily live in the fabric. Permethrin is more commonly used for treating lice that reside on the body, but clothing disinfection should still be a key part of the approach.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pediculosis pubis Maculae cerulae, or blue spots, are characteristic of pediculosis pubis, also known as pubic lice. These blue-gray marks appear on the skin as a result of bites from Pthirus pubis, the parasite that causes pediculosis pubis. The bites cause localized hemorrhage under the skin, resulting in these characteristic maculae cerulae. These spots are most commonly found in areas like the pubic region, but can also occur on other coarse body hair such as in the axillary region, chest, and even eyelashes. Incorrect Options: (A) Pediculosis capitis: Pediculosis capitis (head lice) does not typically cause maculae cerulae. Instead, the hallmark signs of head lice infestation are itching, visible nits (eggs) on the hair shafts, and the presence of adult lice. Head lice bites may lead to secondary infections or dermatitis, but they do not usually produce the characteristic blue spots associated with pubic lice. (C) Scabies: Scabies, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, leads to intense itching and skin lesions such as papules, burrows, and excoriations. However, scabies does not produce maculae cerulae. The typical scabies lesions are a result of allergic reactions to the mite and its feces, rather than the localized hemorrhage seen in pediculosis pubis. (D) Larva migrans: Larva migrans is caused by the migration of parasitic larvae under the skin, typically from hookworms or roundworms. It is characterized by winding, serpentine tracks under the skin as the larvae move. While it causes distinctive lesions, it does not produce maculae cerulae. The presentation of larva migrans is quite different from the blue spots seen in pediculosis pubis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Scrotum Nodular scabies is a variant of scabies characterized by the presence of firm, pruritic nodules that can persist even after the mites have been treated. These nodules are typically found in areas with thicker skin or where there is friction. The scrotum is a common site for these nodules due to its sensitive and thick skin, which provides a favorable environment for the formation of these persistent inflammatory reactions. The nodules in scrotal areas often remain after the infestation has been cleared, requiring additional management to reduce inflammation. Incorrect Options: (A) Web space of fingers: The web space of fingers is one of the classic sites affected by scabies, especially in typical scabies infestations. However, this area is more likely to show the classic burrows, papules, and excoriations rather than the nodules characteristic of nodular scabies. Nodular scabies typically involves areas with thicker skin, such as the scrotum, and the fingers are not common sites for these nodules. (C) Axilla: The axilla (underarm area) can be involved in scabies, but it is not a primary site for nodular scabies. The axilla is more commonly affected by classic scabies lesions, such as papules, burrows, and vesicles, rather than persistent nodules. The skin in this area tends to be more elastic and less likely to form the firm, long-lasting nodules seen in nodular scabies. (D) Trunk: The trunk is generally not a common site for nodular scabies either. The trunk may be affected by the classic forms of scabies, such as papules and excoriations, but it is not typically involved in nodular scabies, which tends to affect areas like the scrotum, groin, or areas of friction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Scabies The presentation of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, soles, face, and trunk in an infant is most consistent with scabies. Scabies in infants often presents with intense itching and papulovesicular rashes in characteristic areas such as the palms, soles, face, and sometimes the scalp. The rash is caused by an allergic reaction to the Sarcoptes scabiei mites that burrow into the skin. In infants, the condition can be more widespread and may appear as papules, vesicles, or even pustules. The distribution and appearance of the lesions, along with pruritus (itching), point strongly to scabies as the likely diagnosis. Incorrect Options: (B) Atopic dermatitis: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) can cause rashes in infants, but the rash typically appears as red, itchy, dry patches and is more common in flexural areas such as the elbows, knees, and neck. While it can also affect the face and trunk, it is less likely to present with papulovesicular lesions specifically on the palms and soles, which is a more characteristic finding in scabies. Atopic dermatitis usually lacks the vesicular lesions seen in scabies. (C) Urticaria: Urticaria (hives) is characterized by raised, itchy, red or skin-colored welts or wheals that come and go quickly. Urticaria is not associated with vesicular or papular lesions. The rash usually resolves within hours to a day and is not typically seen on the palms and soles in a distribution that would be seen with scabies. Additionally, hives do not present in a vesicular pattern like scabies does. (D) Seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that typically affects areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face (especially around the nose and eyebrows), and chest. It does not usually cause papulovesicular lesions, and it is not common on the palms or soles. Instead, seborrheic dermatitis presents as greasy, yellowish scales on red patches. The vesicular nature of the rash in this case is inconsistent with seborrheic dermatitis.",
