      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atopic dermatitis The most likely diagnosis for this 1-year-old child is atopic dermatitis. This condition is a chronic, pruritic (itchy) inflammatory skin disorder that often starts in infancy and is characterized by erythematous, itchy lesions on the cheeks and extensor surfaces of the extremities. Family history of allergic conditions, such as asthma, is a key risk factor for atopic dermatitis, and the presence of eczema (as seen here) is commonly associated with a history of asthma or other allergic conditions. The distribution and appearance of the lesions also support this diagnosis, with extensor involvement being typical in infants. Incorrect Options: (A) Neurodermatitis: Neurodermatitis (also known as lichen simplex chronicus) typically presents with thickened, scaly patches resulting from habitual scratching or rubbing of the skin. While it is an itchy condition, the lesions are usually confined to areas that are repeatedly scratched or rubbed (like the neck, wrists, or ankles). This is not the case for this child, whose rash is more typical of atopic dermatitis. (B) Contact dermatitis: Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction caused by exposure to an irritant or allergen. Although it can cause erythematous lesions, the distribution is often more localized to the area that came in contact with the offending substance (e.g., diaper area for irritant contact dermatitis or hands for allergic contact dermatitis). This child’s widespread rash, along with a family history of asthma, points more to atopic dermatitis rather than contact dermatitis. (D) Seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis is another common skin condition in infants, characterized by greasy, yellowish scales that typically affect the scalp, face (around the eyebrows), and diaper area. However, the rash in seborrheic dermatitis is usually less itchy and is characterized by yellowish, oily scales rather than erythematous, pruritic lesions. The presence of itching and the distribution on the extensor surfaces make atopic dermatitis a more likely diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Atopic Dermatitis Dennie-Morgan’s fold is a characteristic feature seen in atopic dermatitis. It refers to a prominent crease or fold under the lower eyelids, which results from chronic skin inflammation and edema. It is commonly seen in individuals with atopic dermatitis or those with a history of other allergic conditions (like asthma or hay fever). The presence of Dennie-Morgan’s fold is associated with exaggerated skin folds, which often become more pronounced in children who have atopic eczema. Incorrect Options: (A) Mastocytosis: Mastocytosis is a disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin and other organs. It typically manifests with urticaria (hives), cutaneous lesions, and flushing. While urticaria pigmentosa (a type of mastocytosis) can cause skin changes, it does not present with Dennie-Morgan's fold, which is specific to atopic dermatitis. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. (C) Contact allergic dermatitis: Contact allergic dermatitis is caused by an allergic reaction to substances that come into direct contact with the skin, such as certain metals, fragrances, or plants. While this condition can cause itchy, inflamed rashes, it does not lead to the development of Dennie-Morgan’s fold. Dennie-Morgan’s fold is more specific to atopic dermatitis and its associated chronic skin changes, rather than a response to a localized allergen. (D) Seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, and chest. It presents with yellowish, greasy scales and erythema. While seborrheic dermatitis can cause a rash in the facial area, it does not typically cause Dennie-Morgan's fold, which is primarily associated with atopic dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Atopic Dermatitis White dermographism is seen in atopic dermatitis. It is a phenomenon where the skin blanches or turns white when stroked with a blunt object, such as a finger or a tongue depressor. This occurs due to hypersensitivity of the skin and is commonly observed in individuals with atopic dermatitis, a condition characterized by chronic inflammation and increased skin reactivity. The response is a transient whitening of the skin, which gradually returns to normal. White dermographism is often considered a cutaneous marker of atopy, reflecting an increased tendency for skin reactivity. Incorrect Options: (A) Chronic Urticaria: While chronic urticaria involves hives or raised, red, itchy welts on the skin, it does not typically present with white dermographism. In chronic urticaria, the response to skin stroking is more likely to result in wheal and flare reactions rather than blanching of the skin. White dermographism is more specifically seen in conditions like atopic dermatitis rather than in urticaria. (C) Angioedema: Angioedema refers to deep swelling of the skin and mucous membranes, typically around the eyes, lips, and throat. It is often associated with hives (urticaria), but it does not involve the same skin reactivity that leads to white dermographism. Angioedema presents with swelling rather than the blanching or whitening effect seen in white dermographism. (D) Pressure Dermatitis: Pressure dermatitis results from prolonged pressure on the skin, commonly over bony prominences (such as the heels, sacrum, or elbows). While pressure can cause redness, irritation, or breakdown of the skin, it does not typically result in white dermographism, which is more closely associated with atopic dermatitis and skin hyperreactivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Parthenium In India, airborne contact dermatitis is most commonly caused by Parthenium. This plant, often called \"Congress grass\", is highly allergenic and is known to cause allergic contact dermatitis in individuals exposed to its pollen or crushed leaves. The plant's pollen is easily dispersed through the air, making it a significant cause of airborne contact dermatitis, especially during the monsoon and late summer months when the plant is in bloom. People working in agricultural fields or those living in areas where Parthenium is abundant are particularly at risk. Symptoms include erythema, itching, and vesicular eruptions on exposed skin. Incorrect Options: (B) Nickel: Nickel is a well-known cause of contact dermatitis, but it is typically associated with direct skin contact, such as from jewelry, watches, or metal fittings in clothing. Nickel allergy is not typically caused by airborne exposure, making it an unlikely cause of airborne contact dermatitis. It is more common in individuals who come into direct contact with nickel-containing items rather than in those exposed to the air. (C) Cement: While cement can cause contact dermatitis, especially in individuals working in construction or handling cement directly, it is not typically an airborne irritant. Cement-related dermatitis results from direct skin contact with cement or wet concrete, leading to irritant contact dermatitis rather than an airborne allergic reaction. It is more common among workers exposed to cement dust but does not cause airborne dermatitis in the general population. (D) Poison Ivy: Poison ivy is a well-known cause of contact dermatitis, but it is mainly found in certain regions of North America and is not common in India. Poison ivy produces an oil called urushiol, which can cause allergic contact dermatitis on direct skin contact, leading to itching, redness, and blisters. However, it is not a significant cause of airborne contact dermatitis in India due to its geographical limitation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atopic dermatitis Anterior subcapsular cataracts are most commonly seen in atopic dermatitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis, especially those with long-standing or severe cases, are at a higher risk of developing cataracts as part of their systemic complications. The anterior subcapsular type of cataract typically forms in the front part of the lens and is associated with the use of topical steroids, which are often used in the management of atopic dermatitis. These steroids, especially with long-term use, can contribute to the development of cataracts in individuals with atopic dermatitis. The anterior subcapsular cataracts may cause blurred vision and can be diagnosed through ocular examination. Incorrect Options: (A) Mastocytosis: Mastocytosis is a condition characterized by the proliferation of mast cells in the skin and other organs. While it can present with various skin manifestations like urticaria pigmentosa, it is not commonly associated with the development of anterior subcapsular cataracts. Cataracts in mastocytosis are not a typical finding, and thus, this condition does not fit the description for anterior subcapsular cataracts. (B) Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, skin, eyes, and others. Although sarcoidosis can lead to various eye problems, including uveitis, it is not commonly associated with the formation of anterior subcapsular cataracts. Cataracts in sarcoidosis are more typically of the posterior subcapsular variety, rather than the anterior form. (D) Juvenile diabetes mellitus: While juvenile diabetes mellitus (Type 1 diabetes) can lead to an increased risk of developing cataracts, it is not typically associated with the anterior subcapsular variety. Cataracts in diabetes are more commonly of the cortical or nuclear type, rather than the anterior subcapsular form. Additionally, diabetic cataracts are often linked to long-standing hyperglycemia and metabolic changes rather than the use of steroids or the other mechanisms that lead to anterior subcapsular cataracts in atopic dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Clinical examination Atopic dermatitis (AD) is primarily diagnosed through clinical examination. The diagnosis is based on the patient's medical history, characteristic clinical features (such as itchy, erythematous, scaly rashes typically located on the face, flexural areas, and hands), and the patient's age. In infants and children, it is often diagnosed based on the presence of chronic eczema with a history of pruritus and flexural involvement. The diagnostic criteria may also include a family history of allergic diseases (as atopic dermatitis is often associated with conditions such as asthma, hay fever, and food allergies). Therefore, clinical evaluation is sufficient for diagnosing atopic dermatitis in most cases. Incorrect Options: (B) Biopsy: A skin biopsy is generally not required for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis because the condition can typically be diagnosed based on clinical features alone. A biopsy may be done in rare cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or to rule out other conditions with similar appearances (like fungal infections or contact dermatitis), but it is not the first-line diagnostic tool. (C) Patch test: Patch testing is primarily used to identify contact allergens in cases of contact dermatitis, not for diagnosing atopic dermatitis. While individuals with atopic dermatitis may have allergic sensitivities, patch testing is not used routinely for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis itself. It may be used to investigate potential triggers (such as irritants or allergens) in some cases, but it is not a primary diagnostic tool for this condition. (D) Blood indices: Blood tests, including blood indices (like complete blood count or eosinophil count), may show an elevated eosinophil count or IgE levels, but these are not specific to atopic dermatitis. They may help support the diagnosis or reveal an underlying allergic tendency, but they are not used to definitively diagnose atopic dermatitis. These tests can sometimes be elevated in individuals with allergic conditions in general, but they do not provide enough information on their own to diagnose atopic dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pompholyx Pompholyx, also known as dyshidrotic eczema, is the most likely diagnosis based on the described symptoms: recurrent eruption of deep-seated vesicles on bilateral hands and sides of fingers. This condition is characterized by the sudden appearance of itchy, vesicular eruptions, which are often seen on the palms and sides of the fingers. The vesicles can be deep and sometimes develop into larger blisters, and the condition tends to occur in episodes, often triggered by stress, sweating, or exposure to irritants. The bilateral nature of the eruptions and the presence of deep vesicles strongly suggest pompholyx. Incorrect Options: (B) Nummular eczema: Nummular eczema (or discoid eczema) typically presents as well-defined, round or oval patches of eczema that are usually found on the extremities, particularly the legs and arms, though they can appear anywhere on the body. These patches are often dry, itchy, and have a scaly surface. The presence of vesicles is less characteristic of nummular eczema compared to pompholyx. Additionally, nummular eczema does not present with the recurrent vesicular outbreaks seen in pompholyx. (C) Irritant contact dermatitis: Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by direct contact with irritants, such as chemicals or abrasive substances, and leads to erythema, dryness, and cracking of the skin. While this condition can involve the hands, it usually presents with inflammation, dryness, and scaling rather than deep-seated vesicles. The vesicular eruptions described in the case are more typical of pompholyx than irritant contact dermatitis. (D) Circumscribed neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus): Circumscribed neurodermatitis, or lichen simplex chronicus, is a type of chronic eczema characterized by thickened, lichenified skin due to scratching or rubbing. It typically affects areas like the nape of the neck, arms, or ankles and presents with plaques that are itchy and rough in texture. The characteristic deep vesicles seen in this patient are not a hallmark of neurodermatitis. Additionally, the presentation of bilateral hand involvement and vesicular eruptions does not match neurodermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Requires a period of sensitization Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a type of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which means that it requires an initial sensitization period. During this period, the skin is exposed to the allergen, and the immune system develops a response, specifically the activation of memory T cells. These T cells remain in the body and respond upon subsequent exposure to the allergen. The initial exposure does not cause symptoms, but after repeated contact, the memory T cells trigger the inflammatory reaction, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of ACD, such as redness, itching, and swelling. Incorrect Options: (B) Detergent is the most common allergen: While detergents may cause irritant or allergic reactions in some individuals, they are not the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis. The most common allergens for ACD include nickel, fragrances, latex, poison ivy, and cosmetic ingredients, among others. Detergents are more likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis due to their drying and irritating properties, rather than true allergic reactions. (C) Can be induced in any person if applied in sufficient strength for a certain distribution: This statement is incorrect because allergic contact dermatitis is not simply induced in anyone if the allergen is applied in sufficient strength. It only affects individuals who have been sensitized to the allergen. For someone to develop ACD, they must have undergone prior exposure to the allergen that led to the activation of memory T cells. A person who has never been sensitized to the allergen will not develop a reaction, even if it is applied in large amounts. (D) Memory T cells are not involved in the pathogenesis: This statement is incorrect. Memory T cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic contact dermatitis. Upon initial sensitization to an allergen, T cells are activated and become memory cells, which remain in the body. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, these memory T cells trigger an inflammatory response, leading to the symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 4 days In patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), the test is typically read after 48 hours (2 days), which is why 4 days is often considered the best time frame to check for reactions. This time allows for the full development of the allergic reaction, as the immune system's response to the allergen reaches its peak. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction responsible for allergic contact dermatitis typically takes 48 to 72 hours to become fully evident. Therefore, waiting 4 days allows for the identification of reactions that may not appear immediately. Incorrect Options: (A) 4 hours: Reading the patch test after 4 hours is too early to detect the reaction to the allergen. The allergic response in patch testing is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, meaning it takes several hours or even days to fully develop. At 4 hours, the skin might not have shown any signs of reaction yet, making it an unreliable time frame for assessing results. (C) 4 weeks: While reactions from patch testing may sometimes persist for weeks, 4 weeks is too long to wait before reading the test. By then, the reaction may be less intense or harder to interpret. 48-72 hours (2-3 days) is the recommended window for interpreting the results of a patch test. Reading the test after 4 weeks would not allow for accurate results, as the reaction would likely have already dissipated or significantly diminished by that time. (D) 4 months: Similar to 4 weeks, 4 months is far too long to wait for reading a patch test. The allergic reaction would be resolved long before 4 months have passed, and the results would no longer be relevant. Patch tests are typically read within 72 hours, and waiting 4 months would render the test meaningless, as the delayed hypersensitivity response would have completely subsided.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Allergic contact dermatitis Patch testing is primarily used to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). This condition is caused by an immune system reaction to an allergen that comes into contact with the skin. The test involves applying small amounts of various allergens to the skin to see if a localized allergic reaction develops, which is characteristic of delayed hypersensitivity. The primary purpose of patch testing is to identify the specific allergens that trigger the allergic response in the individual, making it an essential tool for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis. Incorrect Options: (A) Atopic dermatitis: Atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is primarily driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is not typically diagnosed using patch testing. While individuals with atopic dermatitis may also have sensitivities to allergens, patch testing is not routinely performed to diagnose atopic dermatitis itself. Atopic dermatitis is diagnosed clinically based on a patient's history and symptoms. (B) Irritant contact dermatitis: Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by direct damage to the skin from irritants like chemicals or physical agents, rather than from an allergic reaction. It does not involve an immune response, and therefore, patch testing is not helpful in diagnosing irritant contact dermatitis. Instead, a thorough history and assessment of exposure to irritants are used for diagnosis. (D) Seborrheic dermatitis: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition typically affecting areas with high sebaceous gland activity, such as the scalp, face, and upper chest. It is caused by an overgrowth of Malassezia yeast and is not an allergic condition, so patch testing is not indicated for seborrheic dermatitis. Diagnosis is usually clinical and based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Photopatch test Photopatch testing is the best method for diagnosing airborne contact dermatitis, especially when the condition is suspected to be triggered by photoreactive allergens (i.e., substances that cause allergic reactions when exposed to both light and an allergen). The photopatch test is a variation of the patch test, where patches containing allergens are applied to the skin and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. This test helps identify allergens that cause a reaction only when combined with sunlight, which is characteristic of airborne contact dermatitis triggered by substances like plants or fragrances. Incorrect Options: (A) Skin biopsy: A skin biopsy involves taking a sample of skin tissue for examination under a microscope to diagnose various skin conditions. While a biopsy can provide information about the type of inflammation or skin damage, it does not directly help in identifying allergens or confirming airborne contact dermatitis. It is more commonly used for diagnosing conditions such as skin cancer or other inflammatory skin diseases but is not specific for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis triggered by airborne allergens. (C) Prick test: The prick test is used for diagnosing immediate hypersensitivity (Type I allergic reactions), such as those caused by pollen, foods, or insect stings. It is not suitable for diagnosing airborne contact dermatitis, which typically involves delayed-type hypersensitivity (Type IV). The prick test does not assess reactions to contact allergens that require skin contact and may be triggered by airborne allergens. (D) Estimation of serum IgE levels: Estimating serum IgE levels is helpful for diagnosing Type I hypersensitivity conditions, such as allergic rhinitis or asthma, where elevated IgE levels indicate an allergic reaction. However, in airborne contact dermatitis, the immune response involves delayed-type hypersensitivity, not an IgE-mediated response. Therefore, measuring IgE levels is not a diagnostic tool for airborne contact dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Delayed type hypersensitivity The patch test is specifically used to diagnose delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), also known as Type IV hypersensitivity. This type of immune response is mediated by T cells rather than antibodies. The patch test involves applying small amounts of potential allergens to the skin under an adhesive patch. The reaction is observed after 48–72 hours, which is characteristic of a delayed hypersensitivity response. It is primarily used to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis caused by allergens such as nickel, fragrances, or poison ivy, which require a delayed immune response. Incorrect Options: (A) Type I hypersensitivity: Type I hypersensitivity involves IgE-mediated allergic reactions, such as those seen in asthma, hay fever, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. These reactions occur immediately (within minutes) after exposure to an allergen. The skin prick test or RAST (radioallergosorbent test) is typically used to assess Type I hypersensitivity. Since the patch test is focused on the delayed reaction, it is not used for Type I hypersensitivity. (C) Autoimmune disease: While autoimmune diseases involve the immune system attacking the body's own tissues, the patch test is not typically used to diagnose these conditions. Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis, require other diagnostic tests, including serological markers, autoantibody tests, or biopsy. The patch test is more specific to contact allergies rather than autoimmune diseases. (D) Immune-complex deposition: Immune-complex deposition is a key feature in Type III hypersensitivity reactions, such as those seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and certain types of vasculitis. The presence of immune complexes can cause tissue damage and inflammation. Diagnosing immune-complex-mediated diseases typically involves tests such as complement levels, antibody tests (e.g., ANA, anti-dsDNA), or tissue biopsy, but the patch test is not used to diagnose this type of hypersensitivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Parthenium The plant Parthenium hysterophorus is an invasive weed in India, where it is colloquially known as \"Congress grass\" or the \"scourge of India.\" This weed is a major cause of allergic contact dermatitis in the country, especially among farmers and outdoor workers. The word \"courge\" is likely a phonetic misspelling or a regional variation of \"scourge,\" which accurately describes the widespread, difficult-to-manage dermatitis caused by this plant. Parthenium is known as the \"curse of India\" due to its association with allergic contact dermatitis. It is a highly allergenic plant that causes widespread airborne contact dermatitis in people exposed to its pollen, particularly in India. The plant releases fine, airborne particles that can trigger an allergic reaction when they come into contact with the skin. This condition is most commonly seen during the rainy season, especially in agricultural regions where Parthenium is widespread. The dermatitis is characterized by itchy, erythematous lesions that are commonly seen on areas exposed to the air, such as the face, neck, and arms. Incorrect Options: (A) Detergents: Detergents can indeed cause irritant contact dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals, especially with repeated exposure. However, detergents are not referred to as the \"curse of India\" in the same way that Parthenium is. Detergents primarily cause reactions due to their chemical composition, but they are less likely to cause widespread allergic reactions in a specific population or region. (C) Nickel: Nickel is a common cause of contact dermatitis, especially allergic contact dermatitis caused by metal jewelry, watches, or belt buckles. However, nickel-induced dermatitis is not referred to as the \"curse of India.\" Nickel sensitivity is a global issue, but it does not have the same regional significance in India as Parthenium, which is much more prominent in causing airborne contact dermatitis. (D) Ragweed: Ragweed is a significant allergen, especially in regions such as the United States, where it is known to cause hay fever and allergic rhinitis. While ragweed pollen can cause respiratory issues, it is not a common cause of contact dermatitis in India and is not considered a \"curse of India.\" In India, the primary plant associated with airborne allergic contact dermatitis is Parthenium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute eczema Spongiosis is a histopathological feature commonly seen in acute eczema. It refers to the intercellular edema or fluid accumulation in the epidermis, leading to the separation of keratinocytes. This is a characteristic finding in acute inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema. The spongiosis typically results in the formation of vesicles or blisters in the skin, and it is a hallmark of the acute inflammatory phase of eczema. This condition is associated with intense pruritus, erythema, and scaling, and spongiosis contributes to the clinical manifestations observed. Incorrect Options: (B) Lichen planus: Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by purple, flat-topped papules. The histological features of lichen planus typically include hyperkeratosis, basal cell degeneration, and a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction. Spongiosis is not a characteristic feature of lichen planus. While lichen planus does involve inflammation, spongiosis is more commonly associated with acute inflammatory skin diseases rather than chronic conditions like lichen planus. (C) Psoriasis: Psoriasis is another chronic inflammatory skin disease, but it typically presents with well-demarcated, scaly plaques. The histopathological features of psoriasis include hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and dermal papillary elongation, but spongiosis is not a prominent feature. Psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, leading to thickened skin, rather than the intercellular edema seen in spongiosis. (D) Pemphigus: Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering disorders characterized by acantholysis, which is the loss of cohesion between keratinocytes, resulting in the formation of blisters. The primary histological feature of pemphigus is intraepidermal blistering, often accompanied by tzanck cells (keratinocytes that have lost adhesion). While spongiosis may be seen in some cases, it is not the primary feature of pemphigus. Pemphigus is mainly defined by acantholysis, not spongiosis.",

The macules often have a fine scale and are most noticeable after the skin heals from an inflammatory or eczema flare-up. The condition is benign, self-limited, and does not require specific treatment, though emollients or mild topical steroids can help alleviate the dryness. Incorrect Options: (B) Leprosy: Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, is a chronic infectious disease that can present with hypopigmented patches, but it is typically associated with nerve involvement (e.g., loss of sensation) and peripheral neuropathy. The macules in leprosy are often larger, anaesthetic (lacking sensation), and can be found on the extremities. Leprosy would also not present with recurrent scaly lesions and would usually have a more progressive course if left untreated. Given the recurrent nature of the macules and the absence of sensory loss or other systemic signs, leprosy is less likely. (C) Tinea versicolor: Tinea versicolor, caused by Malassezia spp., is a fungal infection that leads to hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules, primarily on the trunk, neck, and upper arms. While it can cause hypopigmented lesions, it is typically associated with fine scaling that can be easily scraped off. It would not typically present as recurrent hypopigmented macules on the face without other areas being affected, and the lesions in tinea versicolor tend to be more well-defined compared to the ill-defined lesions of pityriasis alba. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a Wood's lamp, which may show a yellow-green fluorescence, and KOH examination showing spaghetti and meatball appearance. (D) Pityriasis rosea: Pityriasis rosea is a self-limited condition often presenting with a herald patch followed by smaller oval lesions on the trunk and proximal extremities in a Christmas tree pattern. The lesions are usually pink or salmon-colored with a fine scale, not hypopigmented. This condition is typically not recurrent, and while it may start on the face, it is more likely to affect the trunk and extremities. The hypopigmentation seen in pityriasis alba is distinctly different from the typical appearance of pityriasis rosea.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Generalised anxiety disorder - avoidance The incorrect match is Generalised anxiety disorder - avoidance. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of different things, such as work, health, social interactions, or everyday routine life circumstances. However, avoidance is not a core feature of GAD. People with GAD often experience anxiety about potential problems but may not necessarily avoid situations. Avoidance is more commonly associated with other anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias or social anxiety disorder, where individuals go to great lengths to avoid specific feared situations or interactions. Incorrect Options: (A) Generalised anxiety disorder - excessive worries: This is correctly matched. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and persistent worries about a variety of topics, even when there is little or no reason for concern. People with GAD often worry about everyday issues such as health, work, or social interactions, and this worry is difficult to control. The level of anxiety is typically disproportionate to the actual event or circumstance. This is a defining feature of GAD. (C) Phobia - Fear of situations: This is also correctly matched. Phobias involve a persistent, excessive, and irrational fear of specific objects, situations, or activities. This fear often leads individuals to avoid situations that trigger the phobic response. For example, social phobia involves a fear of social situations, while agoraphobia involves a fear of being in open or crowded places. Phobias can cause significant distress and impact daily functioning. (D) Panic attack - Fear of symptoms: This is correctly matched as well. A panic attack is an episode of intense fear or discomfort that is accompanied by physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or a feeling of choking. Individuals who experience panic attacks may develop a fear of the physical symptoms themselves (such as fear of fainting or having a heart attack) or a fear of experiencing future panic attacks, which can lead to avoidance of situations where they previously had panic attacks. This fear of symptoms is a hallmark feature of panic disorder.",

Hair dyes such as PPD have the potential to cause contact dermatitis. A patch test is recommended 24-48 hours before its usage either on the forearm or behind the ear. The appearance of any redness, blistering or swelling implies allergy.",
