      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Psoriasis. Explanation for Correct Answer: Irregular pitting is most commonly associated with psoriasis, particularly nail psoriasis. In this condition, the nail plate shows irregular, shallow depressions or pits that vary in size and shape. This occurs due to the abnormal turnover of keratinocytes in the nail matrix. The pitting seen in psoriasis is often irregular and is one of the hallmark signs of nail involvement in psoriasis. Explanation for Incorrect Options: B. Alopecia areata is incorrect because alopecia areata typically does not cause pitting of the nails. It is characterized by smooth, round, non-scarring hair loss. However, in some cases, nail changes in alopecia areata may include pitting, but these are usually uniform, not irregular, and are not as characteristic as in psoriasis. C. Lichen planus is incorrect because lichen planus can cause nail changes such as longitudinal ridging, thinning, and onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed), but it does not typically cause irregular pitting. The nail involvement in lichen planus is often more striated or split rather than pitted. D. Eczema is incorrect because eczema (atopic dermatitis) usually affects the skin and can cause changes like thickening, cracking, and fissuring of the skin, but nail pitting is not a common feature. Nail changes in eczema are more likely to involve discoloration or nail bed inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Melanin deposition Melanin deposition is the reason for the brownish-red distal color of half and half nails in CRF. Parakeratosis of nail bed causes nail pitting. Muehrcke lines described narrow white transverse bands occurring in pairs as a sign of chronic hypoalbuminemia. The lines may resolve when serum albumin is raised to or near normal. Unlike Mees’ lines (arsenic poisoning), the disturbance appears to be in the nailbed, not in the nail plate. Half and half nails are also called as Lindsay's nail.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/WhatsApp Image 2023-06-09 at 9_14_36 PM.png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pemphigus. Explanation for Correct Answer: Twenty nail dystrophy is characterized by various nail abnormalities such as pitting, thinning, splitting, or ridging of the nails. This condition is typically associated with autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and other mucocutaneous structures. However, pemphigus is not commonly associated with twenty nail dystrophy. Pemphigus is a blistering disorder primarily affecting the skin and mucous membranes but does not commonly involve nail abnormalities like those seen in twenty nail dystrophy. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Lichen planus is correct because lichen planus is one of the most common conditions associated with twenty nail dystrophy. Patients with lichen planus may experience characteristic nail changes, including nail thinning, longitudinal ridging, and pitting, which are consistent with the features of twenty nail dystrophy. B. Psoriasis is correct because psoriasis, particularly nail psoriasis, is frequently associated with twenty nail dystrophy. Psoriasis can cause a variety of nail changes, including pitting, onycholysis, and subungual hyperkeratosis, which can result in the characteristic appearance of twenty nail dystrophy. C. Alopecia areata is correct because alopecia areata is another autoimmune condition commonly associated with twenty nail dystrophy. Patients with alopecia areata often experience nail pitting, ridging, or other dystrophic changes, including the features seen in twenty nail dystrophy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Psoriasis is a persistent (chronic) skin condition which tends to flare up from time to time. About half of the people who have psoriasis also have changes affecting their nails. Psoriatic nail disease is very variable in appearance and severity. Psoriasis affecting the nails can be mild and not need any treatment. Changes in nails: Color:Your nails may turn green, yellow, or brown. They may also have small red or white spots underneath. Nail psoriasis Surface appearance. You may get ridges or grooves in your nails, or pitting (small pinprick holes) on the nail surface. Debris build up: Chalky white material can gather under your nail, causing it to lift away from the skin. This can be painful. Thickening: About a third of people with nail psoriasis can also get a fungal infection that can cause your nails to get thick. They may also get brittle and break. Separation: Your nail may loosen or separate from the nail bed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Alopecia areata and irregular pitting. Explanation for Correct Answer: Alopecia areata is typically associated with smooth, non-scarring hair loss but is not commonly associated with irregular pitting of the nails. In contrast, nail pitting is more commonly seen in conditions like psoriasis or lichen planus. While nail changes are seen in alopecia areata, irregular pitting is not a hallmark feature of this condition. Therefore, Alopecia areata and irregular pitting are not correctly matched. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Lichen planus and dorsal pterygium is correct because lichen planus can cause characteristic dorsal pterygium, which is the fusion of the proximal nail fold to the nail plate. This can lead to nail dystrophy and changes like pterygium formation. B. Systemic sclerosis and ventral pterygium is correct because systemic sclerosis (or scleroderma) often causes ventral pterygium, where the nail bed adheres to the ventral side of the nail plate, resulting in nail deformities and contractures. This is a typical finding in systemic sclerosis. C. Psoriasis and irregular pitting is correct because psoriasis is commonly associated with irregular pitting of the nails. This is one of the most distinctive nail changes in psoriasis, where the nail plate shows shallow pits, often in irregular patterns.",
