      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Exclamation mark hair. Explanation for Correct Answer: Exclamation mark hair is a characteristic feature of alopecia areata, a condition often associated with patchy hair loss and nail changes, such as pitting. Exclamation mark hairs are short hairs that taper at the base, resembling an exclamation mark, and are seen at the periphery of alopecic patches. This occurs due to damage at the hair bulb, a hallmark of the autoimmune attack in alopecia areata. The combination of patchy hair loss, nail pitting, and exclamation mark hair strongly suggests alopecia areata. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Auspitz sign is incorrect because this is a feature of psoriasis, where pinpoint bleeding is seen after scraping off scales from a plaque. While nail pitting can be seen in psoriasis, patchy hair loss and exclamation mark hairs are not associated with it. B. Orentreich sign is incorrect because this refers to the \"plucking sign,\" seen in certain types of alopecia (e.g., telogen effluvium), where hair is easily pulled out. It is not a specific finding in alopecia areata, and exclamation mark hairs are more definitive. C. Friar-tuck appearance is incorrect because it describes a pattern of hair loss seen in male-pattern baldness, where the central scalp is bald with surrounding hair resembling a monk’s tonsure. This is unrelated to alopecia areata, which causes patchy, non-scarring hair loss.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tinea capitis. Explanation for Correct Answer: Tinea capitis is a superficial fungal infection of the scalp, commonly caused by dermatophytes such as Trichophyton and Microsporum species. It predominantly affects children and presents as localized, non-scarring alopecia with itching, scaling, and sometimes erythema or pustules. The fungus invades hair shafts and follicles, leading to hair breakage and visible alopecia. The presence of itching and scales further supports the diagnosis of tinea capitis. Diagnostic confirmation can be achieved through a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of scales or fungal culture, which reveals fungal hyphae or spores. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Alopecia areata is incorrect because it causes non-scarring hair loss, but it typically presents as smooth, round, hairless patches without itching or scaling. It is an autoimmune condition and does not involve fungal infection. B. Tinea barbae is incorrect because it is a fungal infection of the beard area, not the scalp. It typically affects adult males rather than children and involves similar symptoms of scaling and inflammation but localized to facial hair regions. D. Lichen planus is incorrect because it is an autoimmune condition that can cause scarring alopecia in its follicular form (lichen planopilaris). It usually presents with erythematous or violaceous papules and plaques, often associated with Wickham striae, rather than scaling and itching.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Alopecia areata. Explanation for Correct Answer: Alopecia areata causes non-scarring alopecia, characterized by smooth, round patches of hair loss without evidence of scarring or destruction of hair follicles. It is an autoimmune condition where the hair follicle remains intact, allowing for potential regrowth. Unlike cicatrizing alopecia, there is no fibrosis, inflammation, or permanent damage to the follicular structure. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Lichen planus is incorrect because lichen planopilaris, a variant of lichen planus, causes cicatrizing alopecia. It is an inflammatory condition leading to permanent hair loss due to destruction of hair follicles and replacement by fibrous tissue. B. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is incorrect because it is a well-known cause of cicatrizing alopecia. DLE involves chronic inflammation, leading to follicular destruction and scarring in the affected areas, often associated with erythema and scaling. D. Lupus vulgaris is incorrect because it is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can lead to cicatrizing alopecia when it affects the scalp. The chronic granulomatous inflammation destroys hair follicles, resulting in scarring.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Telogen effluvium. Explanation for Correct Answer: Telogen effluvium is a condition of diffuse hair loss that occurs due to a stressful event, such as illness, surgery, or significant emotional distress. In this case, the patient had typhoid fever three months ago, which is a known trigger for telogen effluvium. During telogen effluvium, a larger proportion of hair follicles enter the telogen (resting) phase prematurely, leading to noticeable shedding of hair. The hair loss typically occurs 3-6 months after the triggering event, which fits the timing in this scenario. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Androgenetic alopecia is incorrect because it is a genetic condition leading to progressive hair thinning, primarily affecting the crown and frontal scalp in both men and women. It is usually not triggered by a recent illness or event like typhoid fever. C. Anagen effluvium is incorrect because it involves rapid hair loss during the anagen (growth) phase and is most commonly associated with chemotherapy or other toxic agents. Typhoid fever does not typically cause anagen effluvium. D. Alopecia areata is incorrect because it is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to patchy hair loss. It does not typically present as diffuse hair loss after an illness like typhoid fever.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Associated with CVS anomalies. Explanation for Correct Answer: Hutchinson’s syphilitic triad refers to a classic set of signs seen in congenital syphilis and includes the following: Notched incisor teeth (Hutchinson's teeth) - These are characteristic of congenital syphilis, where the incisors have a distinct peg-shaped or notched appearance. Nerve deafness - This typically results from damage to the eighth cranial nerve due to congenital syphilis. Interstitial keratitis - This involves inflammation of the cornea, leading to vision problems. However, CVS (cardiovascular system) anomalies are not part of Hutchinson's syphilitic triad, which makes option D the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Associated with congenital syphilis is incorrect because Hutchinson’s syphilitic triad is a well-known set of clinical signs that specifically occur in congenital syphilis, which is caused by the transmission of Treponema pallidum from mother to fetus. B. Notched incisor teeth is incorrect because Hutchinson's teeth are one of the classic signs of congenital syphilis. These malformed teeth are often widely spaced and have a distinctive notched appearance. C. Nerve deafness is incorrect because nerve deafness is another key feature of the Hutchinson's syphilitic triad. The damage to the cochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve) is associated with congenital syphilis and results in sensorineural hearing loss.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Intensely pruritic. Explanation for Correct Answer: Early eruptions of secondary syphilis typically do not present with intense pruritus (itching). The lesions in secondary syphilis are usually not very itchy. Instead, they tend to be asymptomatic or mildly pruritic. Secondary syphilis presents with a rash that is often non-pruritic or only mildly itchy, making intense pruritus uncommon in the early stages. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Options: B. Papular is incorrect because papular lesions are one of the common forms of skin lesions seen in secondary syphilis. The papules may appear as red or brown raised spots that may evolve into scaly lesions. C. Symmetrical is incorrect because the rash in secondary syphilis is often symmetrical, appearing on both sides of the body, typically affecting the trunk, palms, and soles. D. Pleomorphic is incorrect because pleomorphic means the presence of multiple types of lesions, and this is characteristic of secondary syphilis. The lesions in secondary syphilis may present as maculopapular, pustular, or scaly lesions, making them pleomorphic.",
