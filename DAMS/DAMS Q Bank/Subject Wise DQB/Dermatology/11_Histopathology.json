      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Granuloma pyogenicum. Granuloma pyogenicum, also known as pyogenic granuloma, is a benign vascular lesion that typically appears as a red, raised bump on the skin or mucous membranes. It is not associated with a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate. Instead, it is characterized by a proliferative vascular response with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, including neutrophils and capillaries, rather than the organized granulomas seen in conditions like lupus vulgaris, sarcoidosis, or leprosy. Incorrect Responses: B. Lupus vulgaris is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis that exhibits granulomatous inflammation. It presents with chronic, progressive skin lesions that contain granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, making it a classic example of a condition with a granulomatous infiltrate. C. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by non-caseating granulomas, most commonly affecting the lungs, skin, and lymph nodes. Granulomas are the hallmark of this disease, and they can be seen in various organs, including the skin. D. Satellite lesion of leprosy refers to small lesions found in proximity to a larger primary lesion of leprosy. Leprosy is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, particularly in the skin and nerves, where granulomas form around the bacteria causing the disease, Mycobacterium leprae.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the epidermis. It is not characterized by interface dermatitis, which is an inflammation at the junction of the epidermis and dermis. Instead, psoriasis typically involves hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and thickening of the epidermis, with a distinct pattern of scaling and erythema, but no prominent interface dermatitis. The inflammation in psoriasis tends to be more localized to the epidermis rather than at the epidermal-dermal junction. Incorrect Responses: A. Lichen planus is a condition that involves interface dermatitis, where there is inflammation at the epidermal-dermal junction. The hallmark feature of lichen planus is the presence of band-like lymphocytic infiltration at this interface, which causes damage to the basal layer of the epidermis. C. Erythema multiforme is an acute, hypersensitivity reaction that also shows interface dermatitis. The condition typically presents with target lesions, and the histopathology shows lymphocytic infiltration at the epidermal-dermal junction, which is characteristic of interface dermatitis. D. Graft vs Host disease is a condition that can occur after an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, where the donor's immune cells attack the recipient's tissues. It commonly presents with interface dermatitis, with lymphocytic infiltration at the epidermal-dermal junction, leading to epidermal apoptosis and subsequent skin changes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lichen planus. Lichen planus does not typically present with microabscesses. Instead, it is characterized by band-like lymphocytic infiltration at the dermoepidermal junction and interface dermatitis. The inflammatory cells target the basal keratinocytes, leading to the formation of hyperkeratotic, violaceous, flat-topped papules. Microabscesses, which are collections of neutrophils within the epidermis, are not a typical feature of lichen planus. Incorrect Responses: A. Psoriasis is characterized by the presence of microabscesses, known as Munro microabscesses. These are collections of neutrophils that accumulate within the stratum corneum, contributing to the characteristic scale and inflammation seen in psoriatic lesions. B. Mycosis fungoides is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present with microabscesses, particularly in more advanced stages. These microabscesses are often seen in the epidermis as part of the inflammatory response to the malignant T-cells. C. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic blistering skin condition associated with celiac disease, characterized by microabscesses at the tips of the dermal papillae. These neutrophilic abscesses are a key histopathological finding in dermatitis herpetiformis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Actinic keratosis. Parakeratosis, which is the presence of nuclei in the stratum corneum, is a hallmark feature of actinic keratosis. Actinic keratosis (AK) is a pre-cancerous lesion often caused by chronic sun exposure, and parakeratosis reflects the abnormal maturation of keratinocytes due to UV damage. This abnormality leads to incomplete keratinization, where the cells retain their nuclei in the superficial layer of the epidermis. Incorrect Responses: B. Seborrheic keratosis typically presents with well-keratinized, hyperkeratotic lesions but does not typically feature parakeratosis. Instead, seborrheic keratosis is characterized by acanthosis and a well-formed stratum corneum with no prominent parakeratosis. C. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that leads to the formation of umbilicated papules. The lesion’s histopathological feature involves epidermal hyperplasia and ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes but does not typically present with parakeratosis. D. Basal cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the basal epidermal layer and does not typically present with parakeratosis. The main features of basal cell carcinoma include basophilic palisading of tumor cells at the dermoepidermal junction, not parakeratosis.",
