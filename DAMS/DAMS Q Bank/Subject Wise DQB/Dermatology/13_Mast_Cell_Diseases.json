      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Urticaria Pigmentosa The most likely diagnosis for the child in question is urticaria pigmentosa, which is a form of mastocytosis. In urticaria pigmentosa, there are hyperpigmented macules or papules that are typically brownish-red and are often seen on the trunk and limbs. These lesions are made up of mast cells. When these lesions are rubbed or scratched (a phenomenon known as Darier's sign), they trigger the release of histamine and other mediators from the mast cells, leading to the formation of urticaria (hives) confined to the borders of the lesion. This is a distinctive and diagnostic feature of urticaria pigmentosa. Incorrect Options: (A) Fixed Drug Reaction: A fixed drug reaction (FDR) is characterized by the development of well-defined, erythematous patches or plaques that recur at the same site every time the triggering drug is used. The lesions typically appear after drug intake and do not develop a localized wheal on rubbing or scratching. The patient in the question does not have the typical history of a drug exposure and the response described (urticaria localized to the lesion border) is not consistent with a fixed drug reaction. (B) Lichen Planus: Lichen planus is characterized by violaceous, flat-topped papules that may be itchy and have Wickham's striae (fine white lines). The lesions in lichen planus are not typically hyperpigmented or capable of inducing a localized wheal response upon rubbing. The absence of these classic features, as well as the typical findings of lichen planus (such as polygonal papules), rules it out in this case. (D) Urticaria Vasculitis: Urticaria vasculitis presents with raised, red or purple lesions that are often painful rather than itchy, and they do not cause localized urticarial wheals upon rubbing. The lesions typically last longer than the usual urticaria, and they are often associated with systemic symptoms or underlying vasculitis. In contrast, the child described in the question has isolated urticarial wheals confined to the lesion's borders, which is not typical for urticaria vasculitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cholinergic Urticaria The most likely diagnosis for this 22-year-old woman is cholinergic urticaria. This type of urticaria is triggered by increased body temperature and typically manifests as small itchy wheals after physical exertion, exposure to heat (such as walking in the sun), or eating spicy foods, all of which can cause sweating. Cholinergic urticaria is associated with the activation of the cholinergic system (responsible for the body's sweating response), leading to the release of histamine and the development of hives. The wheals are usually small, itchy, and appear on the upper body. This condition is often aggravated by exercise, hot showers, or stress. Incorrect Options: (A) Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: Chronic idiopathic urticaria is characterized by spontaneous urticaria (hives) that can appear without an obvious trigger. The hives in chronic idiopathic urticaria are often larger and not related to physical exertion or specific triggers like heat or food. The cause is usually unknown, but it does not typically involve specific physical triggers like exercise, heat, or spicy foods, which makes it less likely in this case. (C) Solar Urticaria: Solar urticaria is a rare condition where hives develop upon exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light. Although the patient mentioned walking in the sun, the characteristic feature of solar urticaria is the immediate onset of hives in response to direct sunlight exposure, rather than a response to heat, exertion, or spicy food. The wheals in solar urticaria are often larger and more localized to areas exposed to the sun, which differs from the patient's description. (D) Adrenergic Urticaria: Adrenergic urticaria is a form of hives triggered by stress or emotional stimuli, which leads to the release of adrenaline and subsequently causes the formation of hives. This condition is less likely because the patient’s triggers are related to physical exertion, heat, and food, rather than stress or emotions. Adrenergic urticaria typically produces larger wheals in response to emotional stress or physical exertion due to an adrenaline surge, which is not consistent with the small wheals seen in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Males and females present with frontoparietal hair loss The statement in Option A is incorrect. While males with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) typically experience hair loss in the frontotemporal (temples) and vertex (crown) regions, females with AGA generally experience diffuse thinning across the crown of the scalp, but not typically in the frontoparietal (front and top of the head) region. Therefore, the pattern of hair loss in females is usually different from males, being more diffuse rather than focusing on a specific area like the frontotemporal regions seen in males. Incorrect Options: (B) Finasteride is used to treat androgenetic alopecia in males: This statement is correct. Finasteride is an oral medication commonly used to treat androgenetic alopecia in males. It works by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is thought to play a role in hair loss. Finasteride helps reduce the levels of DHT, thus slowing or reversing hair loss in many men with AGA. (C) Minoxidil is a useful topical agent: This statement is correct. Minoxidil is an over-the-counter topical solution widely used to treat androgenetic alopecia. It works by stimulating hair follicles and promoting hair growth. It is effective in both males and females and is typically applied directly to the scalp where hair thinning is occurring. Minoxidil is often recommended as a first-line treatment for AGA. (D) Histology shows miniaturization of hairs: This statement is correct. Histological examination of scalp biopsies in patients with androgenetic alopecia typically reveals miniaturization of hair follicles. This means that the terminal hairs become thinner and shorter, eventually leading to the predominance of vellus (fine) hairs. This miniaturization process is a hallmark feature of AGA and contributes to the progressive hair thinning characteristic of the condition.",
