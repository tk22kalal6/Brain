      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lichen Planus The correct answer is Lichen Planus. Wickham’s striae are fine, white, lace-like streaks or lines that are seen on the surface of the papules in lichen planus. These striae are considered a characteristic feature of the disease and are most visible when the lesions are viewed under magnification or in areas with thinner skin, such as the flexor aspects of the wrists, ankles, or the oral mucosa. Wickham’s striae result from the underlying changes in the epidermis caused by lymphocytic infiltration and hyperkeratosis. Their presence is a key diagnostic feature of lichen planus. Incorrect Options: (A) Lichen Nitidus: Lichen nitidus is a rare, chronic inflammatory skin condition that typically presents as small, shiny, skin-colored papules. These papules are usually seen on the trunk, limbs, or genitalia, and are not associated with Wickham’s striae. The lesions in lichen nitidus do not show the characteristic white lacy streaks seen in lichen planus. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (C) Lichen Striatus: Lichen striatus is a condition that typically presents as a linear eruption of small, shiny, flat-topped papules that follow a Blaschkoid distribution (a pattern along the lines of skin growth). Unlike lichen planus, Wickham's striae are not a feature of lichen striatus, so this option is incorrect. (D) Lichenoid Eruptions: Lichenoid eruptions refer to a variety of skin conditions that show a lichenoid reaction pattern, characterized by band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction. While these eruptions share some histological features with lichen planus, they do not typically exhibit Wickham’s striae on their surface. Lichenoid eruptions are a broader category, and the presence of Wickham's striae is more specific to lichen planus, not to all lichenoid conditions. Thus, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Thickening of nail The correct answer is Thickening of nail. Thickening of the nail is not a typical feature of lichen planus. In fact, in lichen planus, the nails may show thinning, ridging, or even loss of nail substance, but thickening is not a characteristic sign. In some cases, nail involvement in lichen planus can lead to conditions like onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed), pterygium (scarring that leads to nail deformity), and splitting, but thickening is more commonly associated with other nail disorders or systemic conditions. Incorrect Options: (A) Pterygium: Pterygium is a common sign of nail involvement in lichen planus. It is characterized by scarring that leads to the nail plate adhering to the nail bed. This results in nail deformities such as nail dystrophy and is a common feature of lichen planus when the nails are affected. Therefore, this option is incorrect as pterygium is a known sign of lichen planus. (B) Trachyonychia: Trachyonychia (often called twenty-nail dystrophy) refers to the condition where all 20 nails are affected by thinning, ridging, and fragility. This condition can occur as part of lichen planus, and it is considered a typical sign of the disease when there is nail involvement. Therefore, this option is incorrect, as trachyonychia is a sign of lichen planus. (D) Tented nail: A tenting or \"tent-shaped\" appearance of the nails is another nail deformity commonly seen in lichen planus. This is caused by scarring and loss of the nail bed structure, leading to the characteristic shape of the nail. Thus, this option is incorrect, as tenting is also a recognized sign of lichen planus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Max Joseph space The correct answer is Max Joseph space. The Max Joseph space refers to a space between the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum, and it is considered a feature of eczema or contact dermatitis, not psoriasis. In psoriasis, the histological features typically involve hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and parakeratosis, but Max Joseph space is not a characteristic feature of psoriasis. Incorrect Options: (B) Munro Microabscess: Munro microabscesses are collections of neutrophils in the stratum corneum and are a classic histological feature of psoriasis. They are often seen in psoriatic plaques, and their presence helps confirm the diagnosis of psoriasis. Thus, this option is incorrect, as Munro microabscesses are a known feature of psoriasis. (C) Parakeratosis: Parakeratosis refers to the presence of nucleated cells in the stratum corneum, which is typically seen in psoriasis due to the rapid turnover of epidermal cells. In psoriasis, the normal maturation of keratinocytes is disrupted, leading to parakeratosis. Therefore, this option is incorrect, as parakeratosis is a hallmark feature of psoriasis. (D) Suprapapillary thinning: Suprapapillary thinning refers to the thinning of the epidermis directly above the dermal papillae, which is commonly seen in psoriasis. This thinning is due to the rapid turnover of skin cells in psoriatic plaques, which causes the epidermis to thin in these areas. Thus, this option is incorrect, as suprapapillary thinning is a well-known histological feature of psoriasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Excoriation marks The correct answer is Excoriation marks. Lichen planus does not typically present with excoriation marks, which are signs of scratching or mechanical injury to the skin. Excoriation marks are more commonly seen in conditions where pruritus (itching) leads to physical scratching, such as eczema or chronic pruritic disorders. In lichen planus, the lesions are often intensely itchy, but the characteristic findings are papules, plaques, and distinctive oral lesions, not excoriation marks. Incorrect Options: (B) Purplish papules: Purplish papules are a classic clinical feature of lichen planus. The lesions are typically purple or violaceous, flat-topped, polygonal papules, and they are often seen on the flexural surfaces, wrists, and lower back. The color and shape of the papules are key diagnostic features of lichen planus, making this option incorrect. (C) Lacy white lines in buccal mucosa: The presence of lacy white lines on the buccal mucosa is a hallmark feature of lichen planus. These white lines, known as Wickham's striae, are often seen in the mucous membranes (such as the inside of the cheeks) and are characteristic of lichen planus. This option is incorrect, as Wickham's striae are a diagnostic sign of lichen planus. (D) Koebnerization: Koebnerization, or the development of new lesions at sites of trauma or injury, is a known phenomenon in lichen planus. People with lichen planus can develop new lesions in areas of the skin that have been scratched, rubbed, or injured. This phenomenon is well-documented in lichen planus and supports its diagnosis. Hence, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Prednisolone The correct answer is Prednisolone. Prednisolone, a corticosteroid, is not a standard systemic treatment option for extensive psoriasis vulgaris. While corticosteroids, including prednisolone, can be effective in controlling acute flare-ups of psoriasis, long-term use of systemic steroids is generally avoided in the treatment of psoriasis because they can lead to potential adverse effects like rebound flaring when stopped, tachyphylaxis (reduced effectiveness over time), and other complications such as immunosuppression and osteoporosis. Therefore, prednisolone is not commonly used as a first-line or standard systemic treatment for extensive psoriasis vulgaris. Incorrect Options: (A) Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a well-established systemic treatment for extensive psoriasis vulgaris. It is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that works by suppressing the immune system and slowing down the rapid skin cell turnover seen in psoriasis. Methotrexate is considered one of the standard systemic treatments, especially for moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. (B) Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine is another systemic treatment used in the management of extensive psoriasis vulgaris. It is an immunosuppressive drug that works by inhibiting the activity of T cells, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Cyclosporine is typically used for short-term control in severe cases or during flares, as it is highly effective in reducing inflammation. (C) Acitretin: Acitretin is an oral retinoid used in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. It works by normalizing the growth of skin cells and is often used for severe, pustular, or erythrodermic psoriasis. It is also used when other systemic therapies fail or when there is a contraindication to other treatments. Acitretin is a standard systemic treatment for extensive psoriasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Systemic steroids The correct treatment for acute widespread generalized lichen planus is systemic steroids. Systemic corticosteroids such as prednisolone are the first-line treatment for severe or generalized lichen planus that involves extensive areas of the body. Systemic steroids work by reducing inflammation and modulating the immune response, which is critical in controlling the symptoms of lichenoid eruptions. For acute flare-ups or severe cases that don't respond to topical treatments, systemic steroids are effective in providing rapid control and improving symptoms. However, long-term use is avoided due to potential side effects, so systemic steroids are typically used for short-term management of widespread or severe cases. Incorrect Options: (A) Topical salicylic acid: Topical salicylic acid is commonly used to treat psoriasis and other hyperkeratotic skin conditions. While salicylic acid can be helpful for reducing thickened skin or scales, it is not the treatment of choice for generalized lichen planus, especially in acute cases. Lichen planus involves a more complex immune-mediated process, and topical salicylic acid would not address the underlying inflammation effectively. (B) Ultraviolet rays (UV therapy): Ultraviolet (UV) therapy, such as narrowband UVB or PUVA therapy, can be used in chronic or localized lichen planus cases, particularly for patients who do not respond to topical treatments. However, for acute widespread generalized lichen planus, systemic steroids are preferred for faster and more robust control. UV therapy might be considered in some chronic cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute flares. (D) Erythromycin: Erythromycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, but it has no role in the management of lichen planus, which is a non-infectious, inflammatory skin condition. Erythromycin would not address the immune response or inflammation involved in lichen planus and is not appropriate for the acute treatment of the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pustular psoriasis with pregnancy The only definite indication for giving systemic corticosteroids in pustular psoriasis is pustular psoriasis during pregnancy. Systemic corticosteroids are generally avoided in psoriasis treatment due to their potential side effects, including the risk of immunosuppression and other systemic complications. However, pustular psoriasis in pregnancy can be a medical emergency, and systemic corticosteroids may be used under medical supervision to reduce inflammation and control symptoms, especially in severe cases where other treatments might pose risks to both the mother and the fetus. The benefits of systemic corticosteroids in these cases outweigh the risks, and they can help prevent serious complications for both the pregnant woman and her baby. Incorrect Options: (B) Psoriasis in a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis: Although alcoholic cirrhosis is a serious condition, systemic corticosteroids are not typically indicated for psoriasis in these patients. The use of corticosteroids in individuals with liver disease such as cirrhosis can lead to worsened liver function, fluid retention, and other complications. Psoriasis in these cases is usually managed with topical treatments or other non-systemic therapies that are safer for the liver. Systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided or used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction. (C) Moderate arthritis: Psoriatic arthritis (including moderate arthritis) is often treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate or biologics. Systemic corticosteroids may be used for short-term flare management, but they are not considered the first-line treatment for psoriatic arthritis. Chronic use of corticosteroids is generally avoided in arthritis due to potential side effects such as osteoporosis and joint damage, especially when other more effective treatments are available. Corticosteroids are not the primary treatment for moderate psoriatic arthritis and should only be used sparingly. (D) Extensive lesions: Extensive psoriasis may require systemic treatments, but systemic corticosteroids are not typically used as the first-line treatment in these cases. Biologics, methotrexate, and retinoids are preferred for extensive or severe psoriasis, as they directly target the immune response. Systemic corticosteroids can worsen psoriasis upon discontinuation, potentially triggering a rebound effect (or pustular psoriasis) in certain patients. Therefore, corticosteroids are used cautiously in extensive psoriasis, and alternative therapies are usually preferred for long-term management.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lichen scrofulosorum Lichen scrofulosorum is not a type of lichen planus. It is a cutaneous manifestation of tuberculosis and is characterized by the development of small, firm papules or nodules that typically appear on the upper trunk and neck. This condition is distinct from lichen planus, which is an inflammatory skin disorder with characteristic features like purple, flat-topped papules often associated with Wickham's striae (lacy white lines) and commonly affecting the wrists, ankles, and lower back. Lichen scrofulosorum is linked to mycobacterial infection, specifically tuberculosis, rather than the immune-mediated processes seen in lichen planus. Incorrect Options: (B) Lichen planopilaris: Lichen planopilaris is a variant of lichen planus that specifically affects the hair follicles, leading to scarring alopecia (permanent hair loss). It is a well-known form of lichen planus that causes inflammation around the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss and scarring. This condition typically affects the scalp, but it can also involve other areas with hair. It is a true type of lichen planus, involving the follicular form of the disease. (C) Lichen hypertrophica: Lichen hypertrophica, also known as hypertrophic lichen planus, is a form of lichen planus characterized by thickened, hyperkeratotic plaques. This type of lichen planus is more commonly seen on the lower legs, and it involves pronounced thickening of the skin, making the lesions more raised and more prominent compared to the typical flat papules seen in regular lichen planus. Lichen hypertrophica is a recognized type of lichen planus. (D) Lichen pigmentosa: Lichen pigmentosa is a rare form of lichen planus that presents with brownish pigmentary changes in the skin. It is characterized by hyperpigmented macules or patches resulting from the depigmentation of the affected areas of the skin. Though uncommon, lichen pigmentosa is a known variant of lichen planus, which emphasizes the variable presentation of this disorder, including changes in pigmentation rather than just inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Well defined scaly plaques The most common association with irregular pitting of nails and onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed) is psoriasis, which presents as well-defined scaly plaques. These characteristic psoriatic plaques often appear on areas such as the elbows, knees, and scalp. Nail involvement in psoriasis can lead to changes such as pitting (small depressions in the nail surface) and onycholysis, which are considered hallmark signs of this condition. These changes are seen in approximately 50% of patients with psoriasis and are directly associated with the underlying psoriatic skin plaques. Incorrect Options: (A) Violaceous papules: Violaceous papules are a clinical feature seen in lichen planus, a condition characterized by pruritic, polygonal, flat-topped purple papules often found on the wrists, ankles, and lower back. While lichen planus can cause nail changes like pitting, it is more typically associated with other nail changes such as longitudinal ridging and splitting, rather than the more commonly seen onycholysis and irregular pitting that are characteristic of psoriasis. (C) Cicatricial alopecia: Cicatricial alopecia refers to scarring hair loss, which can occur in conditions like lichen planopilaris and discoid lupus erythematosus. This type of alopecia leads to permanent damage to the hair follicles and often presents with scalp redness, scarring, and hair loss. While cicatricial alopecia can be associated with nail changes in conditions like lichen planus, it is not commonly linked to irregular pitting and onycholysis, which are more specifically seen in psoriasis. (D) Polygonal papules: Polygonal papules are a hallmark feature of lichen planus. These purple, flat-topped papules are often seen on the skin, and while they can cause nail changes like pitting, lichen planus is less commonly associated with the characteristic pitting and onycholysis seen in psoriasis. The nail changes in lichen planus tend to be more associated with longitudinal ridges, splitting, and nail bed changes, rather than pitting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Guttate Guttate psoriasis is the type of psoriasis most commonly seen in children and is often triggered by an upper respiratory infection, such as a streptococcal sore throat. This form of psoriasis presents as small, drop-shaped red lesions covered with fine scales. It often develops suddenly after an infection, especially in children or adolescents, and is typically characterized by its widespread, scattered spots. The relationship between streptococcal infections and the development of guttate psoriasis is well-documented, as the immune response triggered by the infection can lead to the onset of psoriasis. Incorrect Options: (B) Stable plaque: Stable plaque psoriasis (also called chronic plaque psoriasis) is the most common form of psoriasis in adults and tends to present as well-defined, scaly plaques, often on the elbows, knees, and scalp. This form of psoriasis is not typically associated with a trigger like a strep infection, and it is not as common in children as guttate psoriasis. It is characterized by persistent, stable plaques rather than the acute, drop-shaped lesions seen in guttate psoriasis. (C) Pustular: Pustular psoriasis is a less common and more severe form of psoriasis that presents with pus-filled blisters on the skin, often accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and chills. It is not typically triggered by streptococcal infections or associated with children, making it an unlikely choice for the scenario described in the question. Pustular psoriasis is more likely to affect adults and may require systemic treatment. (D) Arthropathic: Arthropathic psoriasis, also known as psoriatic arthritis, refers to the form of psoriasis where the skin lesions are associated with joint involvement, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. This type of psoriasis can affect both children and adults, but it is not typically triggered by streptococcal infections. It is also more likely to develop over time as psoriasis progresses, rather than appearing suddenly in the way guttate psoriasis does.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) High dose steroids High dose steroids are not recommended for the long-term management of psoriasis due to the potential for worsening of the disease upon discontinuation (a phenomenon known as steroid withdrawal flare). Steroids may initially help control symptoms, but they can cause adverse effects, including thinning of the skin, striae, and systemic side effects like weight gain, osteoporosis, and hypertension. Furthermore, topical steroids may be used in limited cases for localized plaques, but oral or systemic steroids are generally avoided for long-term management because they can trigger a flare-up of psoriasis when tapered or stopped. Incorrect Options: (A) Methotrexate: Methotrexate is one of the most commonly used systemic treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis. It works by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which reduces the proliferation of skin cells. Methotrexate is effective for psoriatic arthritis and generalized plaque psoriasis and is considered a mainstay of treatment when topical treatments and phototherapy are ineffective or impractical. (B) Hydroxyurea: Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy drug that inhibits DNA synthesis. While it is primarily used in the treatment of certain cancers and sickle cell anemia, it can also be used off-label in severe cases of psoriasis that do not respond to other treatments. Its ability to slow down cell proliferation makes it a potential treatment for psoriasis, though it is less commonly used than methotrexate or biologics. (D) Infliximab: Infliximab is a biologic agent that targets tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine involved in inflammation. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. By inhibiting TNF-alpha, infliximab helps reduce the inflammation that drives the skin cell turnover seen in psoriasis. It is a highly effective treatment for those with resistant or widespread psoriasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cyclosporine In a pregnant diabetic patient with lakes of pus on the skin, the most appropriate treatment option would be Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent that can be used to manage severe skin infections and psoriasis, especially in cases where other treatment options are ineffective. It is sometimes used during pregnancy under careful supervision, particularly if the benefits outweigh the risks. Although it is typically not the first-line treatment for skin infections, it can be considered for managing certain severe skin conditions in a pregnant patient, especially if systemic therapy is required to control the disease. Incorrect Options: (B) Azathioprine: Azathioprine is another immunosuppressive agent, but it is contraindicated in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. It can potentially cause teratogenic effects, including fetal harm, and is not recommended for pregnant women unless there is no other viable alternative. Azathioprine can also pose a risk to the developing fetus and should be avoided, particularly in conditions where other safer treatments are available. (C) Retinoids: Retinoids, such as oral isotretinoin, are teratogenic and can cause severe birth defects if used during pregnancy. Because they interfere with the development of the fetus, retinoids are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy, especially for skin conditions like acne or psoriasis. The risks of severe fetal harm far outweigh any potential benefits, so retinoids are not a suitable option in this case. (D) Methotrexate: Methotrexate is also contraindicated during pregnancy because it is teratogenic and can cause birth defects, especially in the first trimester. Methotrexate works as an immunosuppressive agent, but it disrupts cell division and fetal development, leading to serious consequences if used during pregnancy. As such, methotrexate should be avoided in pregnant women.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hypopigmentation in residual disease The statement \"Hypopigmentation in residual disease\" is incorrect in the context of Lichen Planus. In lichen planus, hyperpigmentation is more commonly seen in residual or healing lesions. As the lesions heal, they can leave behind dark spots, especially in individuals with darker skin tones. Hypopigmentation can occur, but it is not the typical residual feature of lichen planus. Incorrect Options: (B) Lymphatic infiltration in epidermis: Lymphatic infiltration in the epidermis is a hallmark feature of lichen planus. The disease involves an immune-mediated process, where T lymphocytes are recruited to the site of the lesion, causing inflammation. This results in the characteristic lymphocytic infiltrates that are seen in the epidermis and the dermal-epidermal junction in histopathological examination. This is one of the defining features of lichen planus. (C) Itchy, polygonal, purple, papule: The description of itchy, polygonal, purple papules is a classic presentation of lichen planus. The lesions of lichen planus are typically characterized by their polygonal shape, purple color, and itchiness. These papules are often found on the wrists, ankles, lower back, and oral mucosa. The pruritus (itching) associated with lichen planus is a prominent symptom, and the lesions may also exhibit a shiny appearance due to their characteristic glossy surface. (D) Skin, Hair & oral mucosa commonly involved: Lichen planus commonly involves the skin, hair, and oral mucosa. Skin lesions are the most common presentation, but oral lichen planus is a significant variant, affecting the buccal mucosa, tongue, and sometimes gums. Scalp involvement may lead to lichen planopilaris, which can result in scarring alopecia. This multisystem involvement is typical of lichen planus, with the oral and scalp lesions being particularly common.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lichen Planus Basal cell degeneration is a hallmark feature of lichen planus. This refers to the apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the basal cells in the epidermis. Histologically, lichen planus shows basal cell vacuolization and degeneration of the basal layer, which leads to the formation of the characteristic lymphocytic infiltrates in the epidermis and at the dermal-epidermal junction. This process is key to the pathogenesis of lichen planus, and it results in the typical hyperkeratotic and lichenoid features seen on skin and mucosal surfaces. Incorrect Options: (A) Pemphigus: In pemphigus, the primary histopathological feature is acantholysis, which involves the loss of cell-cell adhesion between keratinocytes due to autoantibodies targeting desmosomal proteins. This leads to the formation of intracellular clefts or blisters. Basal cell degeneration is not characteristic of pemphigus. Instead, pemphigus primarily involves suprabasal acantholysis, leading to blister formation, rather than degeneration of basal cells. (C) Pemphigoid: Pemphigoid refers to a group of autoimmune blistering disorders, such as bullous pemphigoid, where autoantibodies target the hemidesmosomes in the basal layer of the epidermis. Histologically, pemphigoid shows subepidermal blistering with eosinophils in the blister cavity. There is no basal cell degeneration seen in pemphigoid; instead, the damage occurs at the basement membrane zone, leading to the separation of the epidermis from the dermis. (D) Psoriasis: In psoriasis, the main histological feature is hyperkeratosis, with parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum) and elongation of the dermal papillae. Basal cell degeneration is not a feature of psoriasis. Instead, psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the epidermis) due to rapid keratinocyte turnover. Psoriasis primarily involves acanthosis (epidermal thickening) rather than basal cell degeneration.",
