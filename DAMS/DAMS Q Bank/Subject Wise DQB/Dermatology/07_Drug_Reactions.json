      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). The description of a 3-month-old infant developing a furuncle (a skin abscess), followed by blisters and peeling of the skin, with no mucosal lesions, is highly suggestive of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). SSSS is caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which target desmoglein 1 (a protein in the skin that helps maintain the integrity of the epidermis). This leads to the separation of the epidermis, causing blisters and skin peeling, which are characteristic features of the condition. SSSS commonly affects neonates and young children, and it typically presents without mucosal involvement. The presence of a preceding furuncle points to the source of infection. A. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is incorrect because TEN is usually caused by drug reactions and typically presents with widespread epidermal detachment, including mucosal involvement (such as in the mouth, eyes, and genitalia). TEN usually affects older children or adults, and the absence of mucosal lesions in this case makes TEN less likely. C. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is incorrect because SJS also involves mucosal lesions and is typically triggered by medications or infections. It presents with a similar skin detachment process as TEN but tends to be less severe. The absence of mucosal involvement and the infant's age make SJS less likely. D. Infantile pemphigus is incorrect because pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disorder, characterized by flaccid blisters that typically affect adults (not infants). Pemphigus involves mucosal and cutaneous lesions, whereas this infant's condition is more consistent with toxin-mediated blistering, such as in SSSS, and lacks mucosal involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) No vesicle. Erythema multiforme is characterized by the presence of vesicles or blisters, which are typically seen in the target lesions. The vesicle forms at the center of the target lesion, surrounded by a pale or erythematous ring. Therefore, the statement \"No vesicle\" is incorrect because vesicles are a key feature of erythema multiforme, especially in its more severe forms. These vesicles are usually small and can become erosive or form bullae in more severe cases. A. Associated with Herpes simplex is correct. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, particularly HSV type 1, is one of the most common triggers of erythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme can occur as a reaction to an HSV outbreak, especially when it involves the lips or mucous membranes. B. Involves distal parts of extremities is correct. Erythema multiforme often presents with lesions that involve the distal extremities, particularly the palms and soles, as well as the hands and feet. The lesions may be symmetrically distributed and can affect the extensor surfaces of the extremities. D. Target lesions is correct. The hallmark of erythema multiforme is the appearance of target lesions. These lesions have a characteristic appearance with a central dusky area, a surrounding pale ring, and an outer erythematous border, resembling a target. This feature is key to diagnosing erythema multiforme.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Erythema multiforme. The presentation of bullous lesions surrounded by an erythematous halo, along with the presence of target lesions and oral erosions, is highly suggestive of erythema multiforme (EM). EM is a hypersensitivity reaction, often triggered by infections (like Herpes simplex virus) or drugs. The characteristic target lesions have a central dusky area, a surrounding pale ring, and an outer erythematous border. The presence of oral erosions further supports this diagnosis, as EM commonly involves mucosal surfaces (oral, ocular, or genital). The bullous nature of some of the lesions, along with the erythematous halo, is also consistent with more severe forms of EM. A. Chicken pox is incorrect because while chicken pox (caused by Varicella-zoster virus) presents with blister-like lesions, these lesions tend to appear in crops at different stages of development (macules, papules, vesicles, crusts) rather than simultaneously as bullae with target lesions. Chickenpox also typically does not present with oral erosions and is more commonly seen in children rather than in adults. B. Herpes simplex is incorrect because Herpes simplex typically causes vesicles or blisters primarily around the oral or genital areas, and these lesions are more localized rather than widespread. While herpes simplex infections can trigger erythema multiforme, the appearance described (with target lesions and widespread bullous lesions) is more characteristic of EM rather than primary herpes simplex infection. C. Herpes zoster is incorrect because Herpes zoster (shingles) involves unilateral, dermatomal distribution of vesicles, which do not form target lesions. Zoster also typically causes pain (due to nerve involvement), and while oral mucosal lesions can occur, they are not the hallmark of the disease. The widespread nature of the lesions and target appearance described in the question points to erythema multiforme rather than herpes zoster.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) EM minor has mucosal involvement. Erythema multiforme (EM) minor does not typically involve mucosal surfaces. EM minor is a milder form of erythema multiforme, which presents with skin lesions (primarily target lesions) and generally no mucosal involvement. In contrast, erythema multiforme major (also called EM major) is more severe and commonly includes mucosal involvement (oral, ocular, or genital erosions). Therefore, the statement that \"EM minor has mucosal involvement\" is incorrect. A. Due to herpes simplex is correct. Herpes simplex virus (HSV), particularly HSV type 1, is one of the most common triggers for erythema multiforme, especially in cases where the disease is triggered by infection. The lesions in EM often appear following a herpes simplex outbreak, especially in the oral or genital areas. B. Due to sulphonamide is correct. Sulfonamide drugs (such as sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine) are known to be triggers for erythema multiforme. Drug-induced EM is a well-established phenomenon, and sulfonamides are among the medications most commonly associated with it. C. Lesions are symmetrical is correct. In erythema multiforme, the lesions, especially the target lesions, tend to appear symmetrically on extensor surfaces such as the arms and legs. This symmetry is a characteristic feature of EM and helps in its diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fixed drug eruption. Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is the most likely diagnosis for a 23-year-old male who presents with recurrent lesions on the glans penis, always occurring at the same site and healing with hyperpigmentation. FDE is a type of drug-induced reaction where lesions recur at the same location each time the triggering drug is taken. These lesions are typically well-defined, round, and may be associated with erythema, edema, and vesicles. After healing, they leave behind post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which is a common feature. The glans penis is a known site for FDE, particularly if the triggering drug is used repeatedly. B. Herpes is incorrect because herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections on the glans penis typically present with painful blisters or ulcers, not with the recurrent, same-site lesions described here. Herpes lesions tend to be vesicular and can be associated with pain, burning, and tingling, which is not mentioned in the description. Herpes lesions also tend to heal without significant hyperpigmentation, and they may recur at various sites, not necessarily at the same site each time. C. Candida balanoposthitis is incorrect because candida infections on the glans penis usually cause erythema, edema, and sometimes white patches or a cottage cheese-like discharge. The lesions often appear in moist areas and are associated with itching and discomfort. The recurrent nature of the lesions at the same site and the presence of hyperpigmentation after healing makes candida balanoposthitis less likely in this case. D. Behcet’s disease is incorrect because Behcet’s disease involves recurrent oral and genital ulcers, but these ulcers are typically painful and not restricted to a single location, nor do they generally heal with hyperpigmentation. The description of lesions always occurring at the same site on the glans penis makes Behcet's disease less likely. Additionally, Behcet’s disease is associated with other systemic manifestations such as ocular involvement, arthritis, and skin lesions like erythema nodosum, which are not mentioned here.",
