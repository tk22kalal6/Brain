      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rosacea is characterized by a persistent erythema of the convex surfaces of the face, with the cheeks and nose most frequently affected, followed by involvement of the brow and chin. There is a tendency to spare the periocular skin. Rosacea occurs most often in light skinned women between the ages of 30 and 50; however, the severe type with phymatous changes occurs almost exclusively in men. Additional features commonly manifested include telangiectasia, fl fl ushing, erythematous papules and pustules. Photosensitivity is common. Comedones are never seen",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acne vulgaris is exclusively a follicular disease, with the principle abnormality being comedo formation. It is produced by the impaction and distension of the follicles with a keratinous plug in the lower infundibulum. Androgens, alterations in lipid composition, and an abnormal response to local cytokines, Insulin growth factor-1 are all hypothesized to be important. Androgen stimulation of the sebaceous glands is critical. Acne begins after sebum secretion increases and women with hyperandrogenic states often manifest acne, along with hirsutism and menstrual abnormalities. As the retained cells block the follicular opening, the lower ortion of the follicle is dilated by entrapped sebum. Disruption of the follicular epithelium permits discharge of the follicular contents into the dermis. The combination of keratin, sebum, and microorganisms, particularly Propionibacterium acnes, leads to the release of proinfl ammatory mediators and inflammation",

Often seen in long standing cases of Acne Rosacea. Rosacea is a chronic disease that affects the skin. The disease is characterized by redness, pimples, and, in advanced stages, thickened skin.

Sweat ducts Miliaria, the retention of sweat as a result of occlusion of eccrine sweat ducts, produces an eruption that is common in hot, humid climates, such as in the tropics and during the hot summer months in temperate climates. Staphylococcus epidermidis, which produces an extracellular polysaccharide substance, induces miliaria in an experimental setting. This polysaccharide substance may obstruct the delivery of sweat to the skin surface. The occlusion prevents normal secretion from the sweat glands, and eventually pressure causes rupture of the sweat gland or duct at different levels. The escape of sweat into the adjacent tissue produces miliaria. Depending on the level of the injury to the sweat gland or duct, several different forms are recognized. Miliaria crystallina is characterized by small, clear, superficial vesicles with no in?ammatory reaction. It appears in bedridden patients in whom fever produces increased perspiration or in situations in which clothing prevents dissipation of heat and moisture, as in bundled children. The lesions are generally asymptomatic and their duration is shortlived because they tend to rupture at the slightest trauma.",

When the skin is involved, the blue-black pigmentation develops most frequently on the shins, ankles and arms. Other patterns of skin involvement include pigmentation that is either generalised and symmetrical, or that develops at sites of inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Apocrine miliaria is Fox-Fordyce disease. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa, is a long-term skin disease characterized by the occurrence of inflamed and swollen lumps. These are typically painful and break open, releasing fluid or pus. The areas most commonly affected are the underarms, under the breasts, and groin. Scar tissue remains after healing. The exact cause is usually unclear but believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. About a third of people with the disease have an affected family member. Other risk factors include obesity and smoking. The condition is not infectious, related to hygiene, or the use of deodorant. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve either a dysfunction of apocrine sweat glands or hair follicles. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms.",
