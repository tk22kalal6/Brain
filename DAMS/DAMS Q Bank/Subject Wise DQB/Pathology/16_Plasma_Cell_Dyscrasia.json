      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Plasma cells Russell bodies are eosinophilic, round inclusions found in the cytoplasm of plasma cells. These structures are composed of immunoglobulin that accumulates when the plasma cell is actively producing antibodies but cannot efficiently secrete them. They are commonly observed in conditions associated with chronic inflammation, infections, or plasma cell dyscrasias, such as multiple myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Incorrect Responses: A. Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes do not produce immunoglobulins directly; B-cells differentiate into plasma cells to secrete antibodies. Russell bodies are not seen in lymphocytes. B. Neutrophils: Neutrophils are primarily involved in phagocytosis and inflammation. They do not produce antibodies or contain Russell bodies. C. Macrophages: Macrophages are involved in antigen presentation and phagocytosis. They may contain phagocytosed material or lipids (e.g., in foamy macrophages) but not Russell bodies, as they do not produce antibodies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypercalcemia Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is a B-cell neoplasm of older adults that usually presents in the sixth or seventh decade of life. Although bearing a superficial resemblance to CLL/SLL, it differs in that a substantial fraction of the tumor cells undergo terminal differentiation to plasma cells. Most commonly, the plasma cell component secretes monoclonal IgM, often in amounts sufficient to cause a hyperviscosity syndrome known as Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Unlike multiple myeloma, complications stemming from the secretion of free light chains (e.g., renal failure and amyloidosis) are relatively rare and bone destruction does not occur. Recent deep sequencing studies have shown that virtually all cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma are associated with acquired mutations in MYD88. The MYD88 gene encodes an adaptor protein that participates in signaling events that activate NF-κB and also augment signals downstream of the B-cell receptor (Ig) complex, both of which may promote the growth and survival of the tumor cells",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hyperviscosity syndromes may develop depending on the physical properties of the M component (most common with IgM, IgG3, and IgA paraproteins). Hyperviscosity is defined based on the relative viscosity of serum as compared with water. Normal relative serum viscosity is 1.8 (i.e., serum is normally almost twice as viscous as water). Symptoms of hyperviscosity occur at a level greater than 4 centipoise (cP), which is usually reached at paraprotein concentrations of ~40 g/L (4 g/dL) for IgM, 50 g/L (5 g/dL) for IgG3, and 70 g/L (7 g/dL) for IgA; however, depending on chemical and physical properties of the paraprotein molecule, it can occasionally be observed at lower levels",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) t(11;14) The most common cytogenetic abnormality in multiple myeloma (MM) is the translocation t(11;14), which involves the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) on chromosome 14 and the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene on chromosome 11. This translocation results in the overexpression of cyclin D1, which plays a role in cell cycle regulation and contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. t(11;14) is detected in approximately 15–20% of MM patients and is associated with a specific molecular subtype of the disease. While t(11;14) is not always linked to a poor prognosis, it can influence treatment decisions and is relevant for targeted therapies. Why the other options are incorrect: (A) Deletion 13q: Deletion of 13q is a common cytogenetic abnormality in multiple myeloma but is not the most common. It occurs in approximately 50% of cases and is often associated with a poor prognosis. However, it is a deletion and not a translocation, making it incorrect in this context where the question specifically asks for the most common translocation. (C) t(8;14): The translocation t(8;14) is characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, not multiple myeloma. It involves the MYC gene on chromosome 8 and the IGH gene on chromosome 14, leading to MYC overexpression. This translocation is not seen in MM, making it irrelevant here. (D) t(8;22): The translocation t(8;22) is also associated with Burkitt lymphoma and involves the MYC gene, but with the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus instead of the IGH gene. This is unrelated to multiple myeloma and is not a common cytogenetic abnormality in this condition.",
