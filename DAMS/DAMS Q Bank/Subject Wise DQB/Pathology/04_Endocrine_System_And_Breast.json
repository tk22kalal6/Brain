      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) RET. RET is a proto-oncogene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in the development of neural crest cells and the enteric nervous system. Loss-of-function mutations in RET disrupt the signaling pathways necessary for the migration, proliferation, and survival of neural crest-derived cells, leading to an absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel. This results in Hirschsprung disease (HD), a congenital disorder characterized by intestinal obstruction due to the lack of peristalsis in the affected bowel segment. RET mutations are the most common genetic cause of Hirschsprung disease, found in both familial and sporadic cases. Incorrect Options: A. MET MET is a proto-oncogene encoding the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR). While MET is involved in cell growth, migration, and differentiation, it is not directly associated with the development of the enteric nervous system or Hirschsprung disease. Loss-of-function mutations in MET have not been implicated in this condition. B. RAS RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) encode small GTPase proteins involved in cell signaling pathways regulating growth and differentiation. While RAS mutations are associated with various cancers and developmental syndromes, they are not implicated in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. Additionally, RAS mutations typically result in gain-of-function effects rather than the loss-of-function mutations seen in RET-related Hirschsprung disease. C. Rb (Retinoblastoma protein) The Rb protein is a tumor suppressor involved in regulating the cell cycle. Loss-of-function mutations in Rb are linked to retinoblastoma and other cancers but have no known role in the development of the enteric nervous system or Hirschsprung disease. Rb dysfunction is unrelated to the neural crest cell migration defects characteristic of Hirschsprung disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lobular. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common type of breast cancer after invasive ductal carcinoma and is unique in its tendency to be bilateral and multicentric. This bilateral nature is due to the diffuse growth pattern of lobular carcinoma cells, which often lack E-cadherin, a protein responsible for cell adhesion. The absence of E-cadherin allows the cancer cells to spread in a more diffuse, less cohesive manner, increasing the likelihood of affecting both breasts. This characteristic makes routine imaging and monitoring for contralateral disease critical in patients with ILC. Incorrect Options: A. Medullary Medullary carcinoma is a rare subtype of breast cancer known for its well-circumscribed masses and favorable prognosis compared to other types. It typically presents as unilateral and does not have a strong predilection for bilaterality. Its distinctive histological features, such as a lymphocytic infiltrate, are not associated with multicentric or bilateral disease. C. Mucinous Mucinous (or colloid) carcinoma is another rare subtype of breast cancer characterized by abundant extracellular mucin production. While it has a favorable prognosis and typically affects older women, it is usually unilateral and localized, with no particular tendency to involve both breasts. D. Apocrine Apocrine carcinoma is an uncommon subtype of breast cancer with histological features resembling apocrine sweat glands. It is generally unilateral and does not exhibit the diffuse or multicentric growth pattern that predisposes lobular carcinoma to bilaterality.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Medullary carcinoma is of great interest due to the findingthat many tumors of this type have features that are characteristic of BRCA1associated carcinomas. Among cancers arising in BRCA1 carriers, 13% are of medullary type, and up to 60% have a subset of medullary features. Although the majority of medullary carcinomas are not associated with germline BRCA1 mutations, hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter leading to downregulation of BRCA1 expression is observed in 67% of these tumors. The basis for the relatively good prognosis of this subtype compared to other poorly differentiated carcinomas is not known, but it has been noted that the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates within the tumors is associated with higher survival rates and a greater response to chemotherapy, suggesting that improved outcomes may be related to a host immune response to tumor antigens. Medullary carcinoma is softer than other carcinomas (medulla is Latin for \"marrow\") due to minimal desmoplasia, and often presents as a well-circumscribed mass. It is characterized by (1) solid, syncytium-like sheets of large cells with leomorphic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, which compose more than 75% of the tumor mass; (2) frequent mitotic figures; (3) a moderate to marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate surrounding and within the tumor; and (4) a pushing (noninfiltrative) border.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Approximately 12% of breast cancers occur due to inheritance of an identifiable susceptibility gene or genes. The probability of a hereditary etiology increases when there are multiple affected first degree relatives, early onset cancers, multiple cancers, or family members with other specific cancers. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for80% to 90% of \"single gene\" familial breast cancers and about 3% of all breast cancers. Penetrance (the percentage of carriers who develop breast cancer) varies from 30% to 90?pending on the specific mutation present. Mutations in BRCA1 also markedly increase the risk of developing ovarian carcinoma, which occurs in as many as 20% to 40% of carriers. BRCA2 confers a smaller risk for ovarian carcinoma (10% to 20%) but is associated more frequently with male breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers are also athigher risk for other epithelial cancers, such as prostatic and pancreatic carcinomas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) ER positive Her2 neu negative. Breast cancers associated with BRCA2 mutations are most commonly estrogen receptor (ER) positive and Her2 neu negative. BRCA2-associated cancers tend to exhibit features of luminal-type breast cancers, which are driven by hormone receptor signaling pathways. This profile reflects the frequent expression of ER in these tumors, allowing for targeted therapies like selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or aromatase inhibitors. These tumors generally do not overexpress Her2 neu, which aligns with their molecular classification as luminal-type rather than HER2-enriched or triple-negative. Incorrect Options: A. ER positive Her2 neu positive Although ER positivity is characteristic of BRCA2-related cancers, Her2 neu overexpression is uncommon. Her2 neu amplification typically defines a separate molecular subtype of breast cancer and is not associated with BRCA2 mutations. This combination does not represent the usual molecular profile seen in BRCA2-associated cancers. C. ER negative Her2 neu positive ER negativity combined with Her2 neu positivity defines the HER2-enriched subtype of breast cancer, which is not typically associated with BRCA2 mutations. This profile is more likely in sporadic breast cancers or in cases with specific amplifications in the HER2 gene, unrelated to BRCA2 mutation status. D. ER negative Her2 neu negative ER negative and Her2 neu negative breast cancers are referred to as triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) if they are also progesterone receptor (PR) negative. This profile is more commonly associated with BRCA1 mutations, not BRCA2. BRCA1-related cancers often lack hormone receptor expression and Her2 neu amplification, which distinguishes them from BRCA2-associated tumors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mainly grade I. Basal-like breast cancers are typically high-grade tumors (grade III) rather than low-grade (grade I). These cancers are characterized by aggressive clinical behavior, including rapid proliferation, poor differentiation, and a high likelihood of early relapse. The high-grade histology reflects their poor prognosis compared to other molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Basal-like tumors often overlap with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but are defined by gene expression profiling showing basal cell markers (e.g., cytokeratin 5/6 and EGFR). Incorrect Options: A. BRCA1 mutation associated Basal-like breast cancers are strongly associated with BRCA1 mutations. Tumors in individuals with BRCA1 mutations often exhibit basal-like molecular characteristics, including triple-negative immunohistochemical profiles (ER-negative, PR-negative, Her2-negative). This association is well-documented and contributes to the unique biology and aggressiveness of these cancers. C. Early relapse Basal-like breast cancers have a propensity for early relapse, usually within the first 3-5 years after diagnosis. This is in contrast to hormone receptor-positive cancers, which tend to have a longer period of disease dormancy. The aggressive nature and rapid progression of basal-like cancers account for this pattern of early recurrence. D. Most common site of metastasis is bone While basal-like breast cancers frequently metastasize to visceral organs such as the lungs and brain, bone metastases are still a common site of spread. However, their metastatic pattern is broader compared to luminal subtypes, which predominantly metastasize to bone. This option is not entirely incorrect, but it does not exclusively define the metastatic behavior of basal-like cancers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Usually low grade. Her2 neu positive breast cancers are generally high-grade (grade II or III) tumors. They are characterized by poorly differentiated histology, high mitotic activity, and aggressive clinical behavior. Their high-grade nature contributes to their rapid progression, shorter relapse-free survival, and poor prognosis in the absence of HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab. Thus, the claim that these tumors are “usually low grade” is false. Incorrect Options: B. Short timing of relapse Her2 neu positive breast cancers are aggressive and often associated with shorter relapse-free intervals compared to hormone receptor-positive subtypes. Before the development of HER2-targeted therapies, patients with Her2 neu positive tumors frequently experienced early recurrences. This aligns with the aggressive biology of these cancers. C. Can be apocrine or micropapillary in histology Her2 neu positive cancers can display various histological patterns, including apocrine and micropapillary features. The apocrine subtype is characterized by cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, while the micropapillary subtype exhibits small, cohesive clusters of tumor cells within clear spaces resembling lymphovascular invasion. Both patterns are consistent with the molecular and morphological diversity of Her2 neu positive breast cancers. D. P53 germline mutations associated Her2 neu positive breast cancers are frequently associated with TP53 mutations, which are a hallmark of aggressive tumor biology. Germline mutations in TP53 are found in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a genetic condition that predisposes to multiple cancers, including breast cancer, particularly Her2 neu positive subtypes. This association reflects the role of p53 in tumor suppression and the aggressive nature of Her2 neu positive cancers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lymph node status. Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in breast cancer without metastasis (non-metastatic breast cancer). The presence or absence of axillary lymph node involvement is a strong predictor of recurrence and overall survival. Patients with lymph node-negative disease generally have a better prognosis compared to those with node-positive disease. Additionally, the number of affected lymph nodes provides critical prognostic information, with increasing nodal involvement correlating with worse outcomes. This information helps guide treatment decisions, such as the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. Incorrect Options: A. Tumor size While tumor size is an important prognostic factor, it is not as critical as lymph node status. Larger tumors (T2 or greater) are associated with a higher risk of recurrence and metastasis, but their prognostic significance is heavily influenced by whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. In cases with lymph node involvement, the impact of tumor size becomes secondary. C. ER/PR status ER/PR status is a predictive factor rather than the most significant prognostic factor. Hormone receptor-positive tumors generally have a better prognosis and are more likely to respond to endocrine therapy, but the presence or absence of lymph node involvement remains a stronger determinant of overall prognosis in non-metastatic breast cancer. D. Her2 neu status Her2 neu status is both a prognostic and predictive factor. HER2-positive tumors are aggressive and associated with poorer outcomes in the absence of targeted therapy. However, with HER2-targeted therapies (e.g., trastuzumab), the prognosis of HER2-positive patients has improved significantly. Despite its importance, HER2 status does not surpass lymph node status as the primary prognostic factor in non-metastatic breast cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atypical ductal hyperplasia. Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a benign breast lesion that significantly increases the risk of malignant transformation to invasive ductal carcinoma. ADH shares morphological and molecular features with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and is considered a precursor lesion in the spectrum of breast cancer development. Women diagnosed with ADH have a 4-5 times higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to the general population. This risk underscores the importance of close monitoring, risk-reduction strategies, and, in some cases, surgical excision to ensure no associated malignancy is present. Incorrect Options: A. Epithelial hyperplasia Epithelial hyperplasia, particularly usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH), is associated with a mildly increased risk of breast cancer, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the general population. However, this risk is significantly lower than that associated with atypical hyperplasia. UDH lacks the architectural and cytological atypia that are hallmarks of ADH, making its malignant potential less concerning. B. Fibrocystic disease Fibrocystic changes (or fibrocystic disease) encompass a variety of benign breast changes, including cysts, fibrosis, and mild epithelial hyperplasia. While some forms of fibrocystic disease can slightly increase breast cancer risk, the majority do not confer a significant risk of malignant transformation. It is a common and largely benign condition. D. Sclerosing adenosis Sclerosing adenosis is a benign breast lesion characterized by the proliferation of glandular and stromal tissue with fibrosis. While it is associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (1.5-2 times), the risk is less than that associated with atypical hyperplasia. The architectural distortion seen in sclerosing adenosis can mimic malignancy on imaging, but its malignant potential is relatively low.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Carcinoma Prostate. Migratory thrombophlebitis (also known as Trousseau's syndrome) is a paraneoplastic phenomenon often associated with adenocarcinomas, particularly those of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, lung, and breast. This condition occurs due to a hypercoagulable state induced by malignancies, wherein tumors produce procoagulant factors like tissue factor and cancer procoagulant. Prostate cancer, while associated with other complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), is not commonly linked to migratory thrombophlebitis. Incorrect Options: A. Carcinoma Breast Breast cancer, especially adenocarcinomas, can cause migratory thrombophlebitis. The production of tumor-derived procoagulants, as well as the systemic inflammatory response associated with cancer, contributes to the development of a hypercoagulable state. Though less common than in pancreatic or gastrointestinal cancers, this association is well-documented. B. Carcinoma Colon Adenocarcinoma of the colon is strongly associated with migratory thrombophlebitis. Colon cancers, like other gastrointestinal malignancies, frequently produce procoagulant substances that predispose patients to venous thromboembolism, including migratory thrombophlebitis. This is particularly evident in advanced or metastatic disease. D. Carcinoma Lung Lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma and other non-small cell lung cancers, is a known cause of migratory thrombophlebitis. These cancers, like other malignancies, induce a hypercoagulable state by releasing procoagulant factors and stimulating systemic inflammation. The association with Trousseau's syndrome is a recognized clinical phenomenon.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Luminal A subtype. Familial breast cancers with BRCA1 mutations are not typically classified as Luminal A subtype. Luminal A breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, and HER2-negative, and are generally less aggressive. However, BRCA1-associated breast cancers are more commonly triple-negative (ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative), which means they do not fit into the Luminal A classification. BRCA1 mutations typically lead to a more aggressive phenotype, often classified as basal-like or \"triple-negative\" breast cancers, which have a worse prognosis compared to Luminal A cancers. Incorrect Options: B. Poorly differentiated Breast cancers associated with BRCA1 mutations are often poorly differentiated (high grade), with marked nuclear atypia and high mitotic activity. These features are typical of aggressive tumors and contribute to the poor prognosis observed in patients with BRCA1-related breast cancer. Thus, poorly differentiated tumors are a common feature of BRCA1-associated breast cancer. C. Medullary features Medullary carcinoma is a subtype of breast cancer that can occur more frequently in patients with BRCA1 mutations. Medullary carcinomas are typically high-grade tumors that present with a circumscribed border, and they often have a high lymphocytic infiltrate. This histological subtype is seen more frequently in BRCA1-associated breast cancers than in sporadic cases. D. Seen in younger women BRCA1-associated breast cancers are commonly seen in younger women, often diagnosed before the age of 50. This is one of the hallmark features of familial breast cancer syndromes caused by BRCA1 mutations. The earlier onset is due to the inherited mutation, which predisposes individuals to develop breast cancer at a younger age compared to the general population.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Familial. The rule of \"10's\" is a mnemonic used to describe the general characteristics of phaeochromocytomas, which are tumors arising from the adrenal medulla that produce catecholamines. The rule states that approximately 10% of these tumors are: Extra-adrenal (outside of the adrenal glands) Bilateral (present in both adrenal glands) Malignant (capable of metastasizing) Familial (part of hereditary syndromes) However, familial is not a strict component of the \"10’s\" rule. While about 10% of phaeochromocytomas are familial, this characteristic is not as universally consistent as the others, which is why it is the exception in this context. Incorrect Options: A. Extra adrenal Approximately 10% of phaeochromocytomas are located extra-adrenal, meaning they occur outside the adrenal glands, typically in the sympathetic ganglia (paragangliomas). This is part of the classic \"rule of 10’s.\" B. Bilateral About 10% of phaeochromocytomas are bilateral, meaning they occur in both adrenal glands. Bilateral tumors are more common in familial cases and in syndromes like von Hippel-Lindau and MEN2. C. Malignant The \"10’s\" rule also states that around 10% of phaeochromocytomas are malignant, which means they have the potential to metastasize to other organs. This is a significant and somewhat rare aspect of phaeochromocytomas, as most are benign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lactotroph. In Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN-1), the most common type of pituitary adenoma is a lactotroph adenoma, which secretes prolactin. MEN-1 is caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene, and it is characterized by the development of tumors in multiple endocrine organs, including the pituitary, pancreas, and parathyroids. Pituitary adenomas in MEN-1 tend to be prolactin-secreting lactotroph adenomas, leading to hyperprolactinemia. These tumors are the most commonly observed in MEN-1-related pituitary dysfunction. Incorrect Options: B. Somatotroph Somatotroph adenomas, which secrete growth hormone (GH), are less common in MEN-1 compared to lactotroph adenomas. While growth hormone-secreting adenomas can occur in MEN-1 and may cause acromegaly, they are not the most common pituitary tumors in this condition. Somatotroph adenomas are more commonly seen in other syndromes like MEN-4. C. Corticotroph Corticotroph adenomas, which secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cause Cushing's disease, are rare in MEN-1. MEN-1 patients more often develop prolactin-secreting tumors rather than ACTH-secreting tumors. Thus, corticotroph adenomas are not the most common in MEN-1. D. Gonadotroph Gonadotroph adenomas, which secrete gonadotropins (FSH and LH), are also less common in MEN-1. These tumors are typically associated with non-functioning pituitary adenomas and are generally not associated with the clinical features seen in MEN-1, making them less likely to be the most common pituitary adenoma in this syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Multiple immunologic mechanisms that may contribute to thyroid cell damagehave been identified including the following: • CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell–mediated killing of thyroid epithelial cells. • Cytokine-mediated cell death. T-cell activation leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-? in the thyroid gland, with resultant recruitment and activation of macrophages and damage to follicles. • Binding of anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies), followed by antibody-dependent cell–mediated cytotoxicity In the usual clinical course, hypothyroidism develops gradually. In some cases, however, it may be preceded by transient thyrotoxicosis caused by disruption of thyroid follicles, with secondary release of thyroid hormones (hashitoxicosis). During this phase, free T4 and T3 concentrations are elevated, TSH is and T3 diminished, and radioactive iodine uptake is decreased. As hypothyroidism supervenes, T4 levels progressively fall, accompanied by a compensatory increase in TSH.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Maximum desmoplasia. Medullary carcinoma of the breast is a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma that is characterized by a relatively good prognosis compared to other poorly differentiated tumors. One of its distinctive features is the absence of maximum desmoplasia, which is typically seen in other types of breast cancers, such as invasive ductal carcinoma. Desmoplasia, or the growth of fibrous tissue around the tumor, is relatively minimal in medullary carcinoma, which instead features a soft, fleshy appearance with a significant presence of lymphocytic infiltrates. Therefore, the statement about maximum desmoplasia is incorrect in the context of medullary carcinoma. Incorrect Options: A. Relatively good prognosis as compared to other poorly differentiated tumors Medullary carcinoma has a relatively good prognosis compared to other poorly differentiated breast tumors. Although medullary carcinoma is considered high grade, its lymphocytic infiltrates and the absence of extensive desmoplasia often lead to a better response to treatment, making it more favorable compared to other poorly differentiated types of breast cancer. This contributes to its better prognosis. B. Rich lymphocytic infiltrates A key feature of medullary carcinoma is the presence of rich lymphocytic infiltrates in the tumor. This lymphocytic infiltration contributes to the tumor's distinct histological appearance and is thought to be a marker of the body's immune response to the cancer. It is one of the reasons why medullary carcinoma tends to have a better prognosis than other high-grade breast cancers. C. BRCA1 mutations Medullary carcinoma is strongly associated with BRCA1 mutations, particularly in young women with a family history of breast cancer. Individuals with BRCA1 mutations have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, and medullary carcinoma is one of the subtypes that is more commonly seen in those with this genetic predisposition. This association is an important aspect of medullary carcinoma, especially in the context of familial breast cancer syndromes",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Apocrine metaplasia. Apocrine metaplasia is considered a non-proliferative benign breast lesion. It refers to a type of epithelial change where the normal ductal epithelium is replaced by apocrine cells, which are characterized by abundant cytoplasm and larger nuclei. Apocrine metaplasia is not associated with an increase in cell proliferation or the development of atypical features. It is generally considered benign and is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Therefore, it is classified as non-proliferative. Incorrect Options: A. Ductal papilloma Ductal papillomas are considered proliferative benign lesions. These are growths within the ducts of the breast, typically involving a central fibrovascular core with epithelial and myoepithelial cell layers. While ductal papillomas are benign, they are proliferative because they involve the growth and expansion of epithelial cells. In some cases, these lesions may have associated atypia, which can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. B. DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) DCIS is a proliferative lesion and is a precursor to invasive breast cancer. It involves the growth of malignant epithelial cells within the milk ducts, but the cells have not invaded the surrounding tissues. Although it is considered a non-invasive cancer, DCIS is proliferative and has a risk of progression to invasive cancer if left untreated, making it much more significant in terms of cancer risk. C. Sclerosing adenosis Sclerosing adenosis is a proliferative benign lesion of the breast. It involves the proliferation of glandular tissue with fibrosis, often resulting in a dense, firm mass. While it is benign, sclerosing adenosis involves significant cellular proliferation and fibrosis, making it a proliferative lesion. It can sometimes mimic malignancy on imaging and may be associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Papillary. In a thyroglossal duct cyst, papillary carcinoma is the most common type of carcinoma that can arise. The thyroglossal duct cyst is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct, a structure that connects the developing thyroid gland to the base of the tongue during fetal development. Over time, this duct normally regresses, but remnants can persist and form a cyst. Rarely, papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, can develop within this cyst. The risk of malignancy is low, but when it occurs, papillary carcinoma is the most commonly observed type. Incorrect Options: A. Follicular Follicular carcinoma can occur in the thyroid, but it is not the typical carcinoma arising from a thyroglossal duct cyst. Follicular carcinoma tends to be more common in the thyroid gland itself, especially in areas where iodine deficiency is prevalent. It is a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, but it is not typically associated with the thyroglossal duct cyst. B. Medullary Medullary thyroid carcinoma arises from the C cells of the thyroid gland and is not typically associated with thyroglossal duct cysts.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Medullary. MEN-2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2) is a genetic syndrome caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. It is associated with an increased risk of developing medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which arises from the C cells of the thyroid gland. Medullary carcinoma is the hallmark malignancy of MEN-2 and can occur at a young age in affected individuals. There are two main subtypes of MEN-2: MEN-2A and MEN-2B, both of which have a high incidence of medullary thyroid cancer. Early diagnosis and prophylactic thyroidectomy are often recommended to prevent cancer in individuals with MEN-2 mutations. Incorrect Options: A. Papillary Ca of thyroid While papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer in the general population, it is not specifically associated with MEN-2. Papillary carcinoma arises from the thyroid follicular cells and is unrelated to the RET gene mutations that cause MEN-2. Therefore, papillary carcinoma is not increased in MEN-2 syndrome. C. Follicular Follicular thyroid carcinoma is another common type of thyroid cancer, but it is not associated with MEN-2. It arises from the follicular cells of the thyroid and is generally seen in non-syndromic individuals. MEN-2 is more strongly linked with medullary thyroid carcinoma, not follicular carcinoma. D. Anaplastic Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare and highly aggressive form of thyroid cancer that is typically not associated with MEN-2. It tends to develop in older individuals, often from pre-existing differentiated thyroid cancers such as papillary or follicular carcinoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bouin's solution. Bouin's solution is commonly used for preserving testicular biopsies. It is a fixative that contains a mixture of picric acid, formaldehyde, and acetic acid, which provides excellent preservation of tissue structure and cellular detail. This solution is especially useful for preserving testicular tissue and is recommended for both histological evaluation and sperm analysis. It helps in maintaining the integrity of testicular architecture, making it an ideal choice for testicular biopsy specimens. Incorrect Options: A. 95% Ethanol While ethanol is commonly used as a fixative for some types of tissue samples, it is not the best choice for preserving testicular tissue. Ethanol can cause tissue dehydration and may lead to poor preservation of cellular structure, which can hinder the pathologist's ability to evaluate the biopsy. It is more commonly used for preserving specimens for molecular analysis, rather than for histopathological examination of testicular tissue. B. 10% Formalin 10% Formalin is a widely used fixative for most tissue types, but it is not the preferred choice for testicular biopsies. Formalin works well for many types of tissue, but it may not preserve testicular tissue as optimally as Bouin's solution, especially for structures like spermatozoa. Bouin's solution is considered superior for preserving testicular tissue for histopathological evaluation. D. Zenker’s solution Zenker's solution is a fixative that contains mercury, potassium dichromate, and acetic acid, but it is not commonly used for testicular tissue. While it is effective for preserving some types of tissue, especially muscle and other organs, its use is limited due to the toxicity of mercury and the fact that it does not provide the best preservation for testicular tissue. Therefore, it is not the ideal fixative for a testicular biopsy specimen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Annular pancreas is a congenital anomaly in which a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the second part of the duodenum, leading to partial or complete duodenal obstruction. In adults, it can present with symptoms such as postprandial vomiting, especially of bile-stained (greenish) material, since the obstruction typically occurs after the ampulla of Vater, where bile enters the duodenum. In this patient, the vomiting occurs about one hour after eating, is greenish, and there is no pain or jaundice, all of which point toward a chronic, partial duodenal obstruction. This constellation of findings is most consistent with annular pancreas in an adult. Incorrect Options: B. Esophageal atresia: This condition is a congenital malformation that presents in neonates, not adults. It is characterized by the discontinuity of the esophagus, causing immediate regurgitation of feeds and non-bilious vomiting in newborns. Adults do not present with this condition unless there is an uncorrected and extremely rare variant, which is incompatible with normal swallowing and survival into adulthood. C. Gallstones: Gallstones typically cause right upper quadrant abdominal pain, sometimes with jaundice or fever if complicated by cholecystitis or cholangitis. They do not cause green vomiting unless there is a gallstone ileus causing bowel obstruction, which would be associated with significant pain and systemic symptoms. The absence of pain and jaundice in this patient makes gallstones an unlikely cause. D. Meckel’s diverticulum: This is a congenital remnant of the vitelline duct, often asymptomatic but may cause painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal obstruction. It is usually located in the distal ileum, far from the duodenum, and would not typically result in bile-stained vomiting after meals. Therefore, it does not fit the clinical picture described. E. Pyloric stenosis: Pyloric stenosis leads to non-bilious projectile vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction before bile enters the GI tract. It usually presents in infants between 2–8 weeks of age. Since this patient is an adult and has greenish (bile-stained) vomiting, pyloric stenosis is an incorrect choice. Clarification on Annular Pancreas as a Congenital Condition: Although annular pancreas is a congenital anomaly (present from birth), it does not always cause symptoms in infancy. In some individuals, the ring of pancreatic tissue may only partially compress the duodenum, allowing them to remain asymptomatic for years. Symptoms may emerge later in childhood or adulthood, depending on the degree of obstruction and other contributing factors. Therefore, while the anatomical defect is present from birth, clinical presentation can be delayed, which explains why this 35-year-old woman is only now showing symptoms.",

The photomicrograph shows an example of cribriform morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is characterized by cribriform, solid, and spindled growth of follicular epithelium interspersed with squamous islands (morules) and follicular spaces lacking colloid. The epithelium often has optically clear nuclei with varying nuclear grooves or pseudoinclusions. This rare variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma is highly associated with FAP.",

Tumor cells with “Orphan Annie” nuclei and the presence of psammoma bodies are seen in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Infiltrates of lymphocytes with germinal center formation are seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis.
