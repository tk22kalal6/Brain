      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lymphocyte predominant The lymphohistiocytic variant of Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells is a characteristic feature of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL). This variant is characterized by large, atypical RS cells that resemble normal lymphocytes or histiocytes and are typically surrounded by a reactive background of small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. LPHL is a rare subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma, and its hallmark is the presence of these lymphohistiocytic RS cells, which are different from the more classical RS cells seen in other subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma. Incorrect Responses: A. Nodular sclerosis: Nodular sclerosis is the most common subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma, characterized by the presence of classical Reed-Sternberg cells, which have a more typical appearance. The lymphohistiocytic variant of RS cells is not seen in this subtype. B. Lymphocyte rich: Lymphocyte-rich Hodgkin lymphoma is another subtype where classical Reed-Sternberg cells are present, but it is not characterized by the lymphohistiocytic variant of RS cells. Instead, it has a predominant background of small lymphocytes. D. Lymphocyte depleted: Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma is a more aggressive form of Hodgkin lymphoma with very few lymphocytes and many Reed-Sternberg cells.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) NLPHL (Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma) The key findings in this case—Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells with vague nodule formation, a background of reactive T lymphocytes, and a specific immunophenotype (positive for CD20, LCA, EMA and negative for CD15 and CD30)—are characteristic of Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (NLPHL). In NLPHL, the RS cells are typically of the lymphocyte predominant variant, and they often express CD20 (a B-cell marker) but not CD15 or CD30, which distinguishes them from classical Reed-Sternberg cells seen in other subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma. The background lymphocytes are predominantly T cells, which is another feature of NLPHL. Incorrect Responses: B. T cell rich B cell lymphoma: This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but it does not typically present with the RS cells seen in NLPHL. T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma features a predominance of T-cells in the background with B-cell lymphoma cells, but the immunophenotypic profile (CD20, LCA, EMA positive, CD15 and CD30 negative) fits more with NLPHL than with T cell-rich B cell lymphoma. C. Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin: Nodular sclerosis is a subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and its Reed-Sternberg cells typically express CD15 and CD30, which is inconsistent with the negative staining for these markers in this case. Also, nodular sclerosis usually does not show the background of reactive T-cells as seen in NLPHL. D. CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia): CLL is a type of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which typically involves small, mature B-cells, not the larger Reed-Sternberg cells seen in NLPHL. Additionally, the immunophenotype for CLL typically includes CD5, CD19, and CD23, which is not seen in this case. Therefore, CLL is not consistent with the presented findings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Disease (HD) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is generally associated with many types of lymphoproliferative diseases, including Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease (LPHD) is the one subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma that is least commonly associated with EBV. In LPHD, the Reed-Sternberg cells are typically of the lymphocyte-predominant variant, which do not frequently harbor EBV, making this subtype less commonly linked to the virus. Incorrect Responses: B. Plasmablastic lymphoma: Plasmablastic lymphoma, a type of aggressive B-cell lymphoma, is associated with EBV infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with HIV/AIDS. C. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is strongly associated with EBV infection. The virus plays a critical role in the development of NPC, especially in endemic areas. D. Mixed cellularity Hodgkin Disease: Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the classical subtypes of Hodgkin lymphoma, and EBV is frequently associated with it. The Reed-Sternberg cells in mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma often contain EBV genome sequences.",

SOX11 is a transcription factor that is expressed in a significant proportion of mantle cell lymphomas, especially those that are negative for Cyclin D1. Incorrect Responses: B. ITRA1: ITRA1 is a marker associated with certain types of T-cell lymphomas, but it is not used for diagnosing mantle cell lymphoma, particularly in the context of Cyclin D1 negativity. It is not specific to mantle cell lymphoma. C. MYD88: MYD88 is a marker associated with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and some other B-cell lymphomas, but it is not typically used to diagnose mantle cell lymphoma, particularly when Cyclin D1 is negative.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mantle Cell Lymphoma Cyclin D1 is a key protein involved in regulating the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. It is expressed in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), which is associated with a characteristic t(11;14) translocation. This translocation results in the overexpression of Cyclin D1 by placing the CCND1 gene (which encodes Cyclin D1) under the control of the IgH (Immunoglobulin heavy chain) promoter. This abnormal expression of Cyclin D1 is a hallmark of MCL and is often used as a diagnostic marker. Incorrect Responses: A. Follicular lymphoma: Follicular lymphoma typically involves the overexpression of BCL2, not Cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 is not a characteristic marker for follicular lymphoma, which is associated with t(14;18) translocation leading to BCL2 overexpression. B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) does not exhibit Cyclin D1 overexpression. CLL is characterized by the presence of small mature B-cells and is diagnosed by markers like CD5, CD19, and CD23, but not Cyclin D1. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Abundant fibrosis The presence of a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (which includes dacrocytes, or tear-drop shaped red blood cells) is a significant finding. This picture often suggests a myeloproliferative disorder or marrow infiltration with fibrosis or other pathologic changes. In this case, abundant fibrosis in the bone marrow is a key finding. Myelofibrosis can lead to a leukoerythroblastic blood picture with dacrocytes due to extramedullary hematopoiesis and marrow fibrosis. The marrow becomes increasingly fibrotic over time, leading to ineffective hematopoiesis and the characteristic tear-drop cells in the peripheral blood. Incorrect Responses: A. Fatty degeneration with erythroid cell hyperplasia with megakaryocytes: This could be seen in various hematological disorders, particularly in states of hypocellularity or chronic anemia, but it is not typical in myelofibrosis. The presence of fatty degeneration is more suggestive of a hypocellular marrow, not fibrotic changes. C. Focal cellular marrow with hypocellular areas and atypical megakaryocytes: This finding can be seen in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or other conditions, but it is less specific than marrow fibrosis. Myelofibrosis typically presents with diffuse fibrosis and an overall reduction in cellularity, rather than areas of focal hypocellularity with atypical megakaryocytes. D. Hypercellular marrow with prominent blasts: This would be seen in acute leukemia, but the blood picture of dacrocytes and leukoerythroblastic changes is not typical of leukemia. In leukemia, you would expect to see blasts in the peripheral blood but not the dacrocytes associated with marrow fibrosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) c-kit point mutation Systemic mastocytosis is a disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in various tissues. The hallmark genetic mutation seen in systemic mastocytosis is a point mutation in the c-kit gene, specifically c-kit D816V. This mutation results in the activation of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, which is crucial for the survival and proliferation of mast cells. The mutation leads to the uncontrolled growth of mast cells, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the disease, such as skin lesions, gastrointestinal symptoms, and systemic involvement. Incorrect Responses: A. FGFR1 fusion genes: Fusion genes involving FGFR1 are typically associated with myeloproliferative disorders such as Chronic eosinophilic leukemia or temporal bone tumors, but not with systemic mastocytosis. The c-kit mutation is more specific for mastocytosis. B. BCR-ABL fusion gene: The BCR-ABL fusion gene is characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias, but it is not associated with systemic mastocytosis. C. JAK2 point mutation: JAK2 V617F mutations are seen in various myeloproliferative disorders like polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, but not typically in systemic mastocytosis.

This chromosomal abnormality results in the BCL2 gene being translocated from chromosome 18 to chromosome 14, placing it under the control of the IGH (Immunoglobulin heavy chain) promoter. This translocation leads to the overexpression of the BCL2 protein, which is an anti-apoptotic protein that helps lymphoma cells evade programmed cell death (apoptosis), contributing to the development and progression of follicular lymphoma. Incorrect Responses: A. t(8;14): This translocation is characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, not follicular lymphoma. It involves the MYC gene on chromosome 8 being translocated to the IGH locus on chromosome 14. This results in MYC overexpression, which drives uncontrolled cell growth in Burkitt lymphoma. C. t(15;17): This translocation is seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

These cells are typically seen in certain conditions such as multiple myeloma and some other plasma cell dyscrasias. The term \"flame-shaped\" refers to the cytoplasm having a characteristic appearance that resembles flames or a streaked, fiery pattern due to the presence of abundant immunoglobulin in the cytoplasm. Incorrect Responses: B. Plasma cells with ground glass cytoplasm: This description is more commonly associated with plasma cells seen in conditions such as Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or in some lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cases. Ground-glass cytoplasm refers to a homogeneous, lightly granular appearance in the cytoplasm, which is distinct from the flame-shaped cytoplasm of thesaurocytes. C. Plasma cells with intra-nuclear inclusion: This would be a description of Plasmacytoid cells with intranuclear inclusions. Such cells are often seen in viral infections, such as herpesvirus infections, rather than in the context of thesaurocytes. D. Binucleated plasma cells: While binucleated plasma cells can be seen in various plasma cell disorders, this feature is not characteristic of thesaurocytes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hodgkin’s lymphoma Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a malignancy that is known for its characteristic stepwise progression and spread. The disease often spreads in a predictable manner, starting from a single lymph node or a localized region, and then spreading in a contiguous fashion to adjacent lymph node groups. As a result, the staging of Hodgkin’s lymphoma is crucial for determining the prognosis and treatment strategy. The Ann Arbor staging system is used to classify the disease, which takes into account the number of involved lymph node regions and whether the disease has spread beyond the lymph nodes (i.e., to extranodal sites). Incorrect Responses: B. Multiple myeloma: Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells and typically does not spread in a stepwise fashion. Instead, it tends to present with bone lesions, renal involvement, and hypercalcemia. While staging is important in multiple myeloma, it is not based on stepwise progression. It is typically staged using the International Staging System (ISS), which considers factors like serum albumin and beta-2 microglobulin levels. C. Mature T cell NHL: Mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) can be aggressive, but it does not necessarily spread in a stepwise fashion. The spread pattern is more variable and can be unpredictable. The staging in T-cell NHL is important, but the spread is not as consistently stepwise as seen in Hodgkin's lymphoma. D. Mature B cell NHL: Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) includes a variety of lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma, and the spread of these lymphomas is also not characteristically stepwise. They can spread in an unpredictable manner, either to distant sites or extranodal sites, and staging is important but does not follow the predictable, contiguous spread seen in Hodgkin’s lymphoma.",

The IPI takes into account the following prognostic factors: Stage of disease (A or B): Whether the lymphoma is localized (early stage) or widespread (advanced stage). Number of extranodal sites involved: How many sites outside the lymph nodes (e.g., liver, bone marrow) are involved. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels: Elevated LDH indicates high tumor burden and poor prognosis. Age: Patients older than 60 years have a worse prognosis. Performance status: The patient’s overall health and ability to carry out daily activities (often assessed using the ECOG performance status). Incorrect Responses: A. Stage of disease: The stage of the disease is a key factor in the IPI and reflects how much the lymphoma has spread. B. Number of extralymphatic sites involved: This is another important factor in the IPI, as more widespread disease is associated with a worse prognosis. C. LDH: LDH is an important prognostic factor because elevated levels often correlate with high tumor burden, which is a poor prognostic sign. D. Hemoglobin and albumin are not included in the IPI. While low hemoglobin (anemia) and low albumin can be associated with poorer outcomes in some cancers, they are not part of the IPI for NHL.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) B cell Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a condition that can occur after organ transplantation, typically due to immunosuppressive therapy which weakens the immune system and allows for the uncontrolled proliferation of B cells. The majority of PTLD cases are associated with EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) infection, which can lead to the transformation and proliferation of B cells, resulting in lymphoma. This condition can present as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, often involving the CNS or gastrointestinal tract, and may sometimes appear as a monoclonal B-cell lymphoma. Incorrect Responses: A. T cell: T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders can occur but are less common in post-transplantation settings compared to B-cell lymphomas, which are more closely associated with EBV and PTLD. C. NK cell: Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system, but they do not typically proliferate in post-transplant lymphomas. NK cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that does not commonly arise as a post-transplant complication. D. Monocyte: Monocytes do not generally proliferate into lymphoma in post-transplantation settings. Monocytic leukemia and lymphoma are distinct from the B-cell driven PTLD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) T-cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It is a malignancy of CD4+ T-cells that primarily affects the skin, causing patches, plaques, or tumors. The disease progresses through stages, starting with localized skin involvement and potentially spreading to lymph nodes and internal organs in advanced cases. It is characterized by atypical lymphocytes (Sezary cells) that infiltrate the skin. Incorrect Responses: B. B-cell lymphoma: B-cell lymphomas arise from B lymphocytes and typically involve the lymph nodes, spleen, or bone marrow. Examples include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma, but they do not resemble the presentation of mycosis fungoides, which is a T-cell malignancy. C. Mixed: Mixed lymphomas involve both B-cells and T-cells, but mycosis fungoides is exclusively a T-cell malignancy. D.

This malignancy is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection and has an aggressive clinical course. It is characterized by extensive tissue necrosis and destruction. Incorrect Responses: A. T cells: While T-cell lymphomas can occur, lethal midline granuloma is specifically associated with NK cells, not conventional T-cell lymphomas. However, NK cells share some phenotypic overlap with T cells. B. B cells: B-cell lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), do not typically present with the necrotic midline lesions seen in lethal midline granuloma. D.

Older adults (>55 years) - This second peak is usually seen in patients with mixed cellularity or lymphocyte-depleted subtypes. This unique pattern is a hallmark of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and distinguishes it from many other hematological malignancies. Explanation of Other Options: B. Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL): DLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and can occur at any age but does not show a bimodal distribution. It primarily affects older adults, typically in their 60s or later. C. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): ALL is most common in children and has a single peak in childhood (ages 2–5 years). A smaller incidence is also observed in older adults, but it does not display a clear bimodal pattern. D. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): CML primarily affects middle-aged and older adults.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Primary Myelofibrosis Explanation for the Correct Answer: The triad of leukoerythroblastosis, tear drop erythrocytes, and large platelets is characteristic of Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). In PMF, the bone marrow fibrosis impairs normal hematopoiesis, leading to extramedullary hematopoiesis in organs like the spleen and liver. This causes the following findings in the peripheral blood: Leukoerythroblastosis: Presence of immature white blood cells (blasts) and nucleated red blood cells, indicating stress on the bone marrow. Tear drop erythrocytes: Red blood cells that are abnormally shaped due to the constriction of the marrow spaces and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Large platelets: Megakaryocytes often produce abnormally large platelets due to dysplasia in the megakaryocytic lineage. Explanation of Other Options: A. Essential Thrombocytosis: This is characterized by a significant increase in platelet count. While large platelets may be seen, leukoerythroblastosis and tear drop erythrocytes are not typical features of essential thrombocytosis. C. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and dysplastic changes in blood cells, but it does not typically present with tear drop cells or leukoerythroblastosis. Instead, it may show dysplastic changes in multiple cell lines and sometimes an increased risk of developing AML. D. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: This is a disease of abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells and does not typically involve peripheral blood findings like leukoerythroblastosis or tear drop erythrocytes.

In IMF, there is progressive fibrosis of the bone marrow, which replaces normal hematopoietic tissue with fibrous tissue. As a result, when attempting to aspirate the bone marrow, it becomes difficult to obtain a sample because the marrow is no longer cellular enough for a successful aspiration. This condition leads to the classic \"dry tap\" appearance, where little or no marrow is aspirated. Explanation of Other Options: A. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): In ALL, there is usually a high white blood cell count in the bone marrow, but the marrow itself is typically not fibrotic. Therefore, aspiration would not usually result in a dry tap. B. Multiple Myeloma: Multiple myeloma often presents with plasma cell proliferation in the marrow, which can make the marrow hypercellular but not fibrotic. Aspiration in multiple myeloma is typically possible and does not usually result in a dry tap. C. Megaloblastic Anemia: In megaloblastic anemia, there is hypercellularity in the bone marrow with abnormal maturation of red blood cells. It is not associated with fibrosis, so bone marrow aspiration is typically successful, and a dry tap is not expected.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Polycythemia vera The highest incidence of JAK2 mutation is seen in Polycythemia Vera (PV). The vast majority of patients with PV (about 95%) carry a mutation in the JAK2 V617F gene, which is a gain-of-function mutation that leads to the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, resulting in the uncontrolled proliferation of hematopoietic cells, especially erythrocytes. This mutation is a hallmark of PV and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Incorrect Answers: B. Primary myelofibrosis: While JAK2 mutations are also present in Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), they are less common compared to PV. About 50% of PMF patients have the JAK2 V617F mutation, with a smaller percentage having mutations in CALR (calreticulin) or MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene). Therefore, PMF has a lower incidence of JAK2 mutations than PV. C. Essential thrombocythemia: In Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), JAK2 V617F mutations are found in about 50-60% of patients, though other mutations such as those in CALR can also be present. JAK2 mutations are common in ET, but the incidence is lower than in PV. D. Chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, resulting from the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation. JAK2 mutations are not a hallmark of CML. Therefore, CML is not associated with a high incidence of JAK2 mutations.",

These markers are often used in immunohistochemistry to aid in the diagnosis: CD10: This is a germinal center marker and is commonly expressed in follicular lymphoma, as the tumor cells often resemble the cells of the germinal center. CD10 positivity is a key feature for identifying follicular lymphoma. Bcl6: Bcl6 is also a marker of the germinal center and is frequently expressed in follicular lymphoma. It plays a critical role in the regulation of B cell development and function, particularly in the germinal center. Bcl2: Bcl2 is an anti-apoptotic protein and is overexpressed in follicular lymphoma due to the translocation (t(14;18)), which places the Bcl2 gene under the control of the IgH promoter. This overexpression of Bcl2 helps the lymphoma cells avoid apoptosis, which is a key feature of follicular lymphoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Most patients at presentation have fever and weight loss Explanation: A. CLL/SLL is the most common leukemia in Western countries: This statement is true. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is indeed the most common form of leukemia in Western countries, especially among older adults. It typically affects individuals over the age of 50, with a higher prevalence in men. B. Radiation exposure does not increase the risk of developing CLL/SLL: This statement is also true. Unlike some other cancers, radiation exposure has not been consistently linked to an increased risk of developing CLL/SLL. The etiology of CLL/SLL is more often associated with genetic factors and immune dysfunction rather than environmental exposures like radiation. C. Most patients at presentation have fever and weight loss: This statement is false. CLL/SLL is typically asymptomatic in its early stages. When symptoms do occur, they are usually related to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and fatigue rather than fever and weight loss. Fever and weight loss are more characteristic of acute leukemia or other aggressive hematologic malignancies. Therefore, fever and weight loss are not typical presenting features of CLL/SLL. D. CLL/SLL patients are typically over 50 years of age: This statement is true. The median age at diagnosis for CLL/SLL is around 70 years, and most patients are over the age of 50. It is a disease that primarily affects older adults.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CD38 negativity A. CD38 negativity: This is the correct answer. CD38 negativity is associated with a better prognosis in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). CD38 is a surface marker that, when expressed, can indicate more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes. Patients with CD38-negative CLL tend to have a more indolent (slow-progressing) disease course, which translates to a better overall prognosis. B. ZAP-70 positivity: This is incorrect. ZAP-70 positivity is a poor prognostic marker in CLL/SLL. ZAP-70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) is a signaling protein that is typically expressed in activated T-cells but is also found in some B-cells. ZAP-70 positivity in CLL/SLL is associated with more aggressive disease and shorter survival, as it indicates a higher likelihood of early progression. C. Presence of Trisomy 12: This is incorrect. Trisomy 12 is a cytogenetic abnormality that can be found in some CLL/SLL patients. However, it is typically associated with an intermediate prognosis. Trisomy 12 does not impart a better prognosis, and it is often seen in patients who have a relatively worse prognosis compared to those without this abnormality. Therefore, it is not indicative of a better prognosis. D. Lymphocyte doubling time of 8 months: This is incorrect. A lymphocyte doubling time of 8 months indicates indolent disease, which could be considered a better prognosis than rapid progression. However, the prognosis is typically considered better with longer doubling times, meaning a longer time for lymphocyte count to double. A doubling time of 8 months still indicates disease progression, though it is slower compared to more aggressive forms of the disease. Nonetheless, CD38 negativity is a more direct and well-established marker of better prognosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CD 10 A. Cyclin D1: This is correct. Cyclin D1 is a characteristic marker of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). MCL is defined by the overexpression of Cyclin D1, which is caused by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation that leads to the dysregulation of the CCND1 gene. Cyclin D1 regulates the cell cycle, and its overexpression allows for uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of MCL. B. CD 20: This is correct. CD20 is a common marker of B-cell lymphomas, including MCL. MCL is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and the malignant cells express CD20. This marker is widely used in diagnostic immunophenotyping and is positive in most B-cell lymphomas. C. CD 10: This is the correct answer because CD10 is not typically expressed in Mantle Cell Lymphoma. CD10, also known as CALLA (Common Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Antigen), is usually found on follicular lymphoma and germinal center B-cells. MCL cells do not typically express CD10, which helps distinguish it from other B-cell lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma. D. CD 5: This is correct. CD5 is often expressed in Mantle Cell Lymphoma. CD5 is a T-cell antigen that is aberrantly expressed in some B-cell lymphomas, including MCL. This feature can help differentiate MCL from other types of B-cell lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma, which typically do not express CD5.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pernicious anemia Pernicious anemia is not a recognized risk factor for extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MALT lymphoma). MALT lymphoma is most commonly associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, particularly those involving autoimmune diseases and chronic infections, where continuous antigenic stimulation can lead to the development of lymphoma. Pernicious anemia, while associated with autoimmune gastritis, does not directly result in MALT lymphoma. This makes B the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A. Sjogren’s syndrome: This is incorrect. Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth due to lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. Chronic autoimmune inflammation in Sjogren’s syndrome increases the risk of developing MALT lymphoma. In fact, MALT lymphoma is one of the most common lymphomas associated with Sjogren’s syndrome, making it a known risk factor. C. Helicobacter pylori infection: This is incorrect. Helicobacter pylori infection is a significant risk factor for the development of gastric MALT lymphoma. H. pylori infection leads to chronic gastric mucosal inflammation, which can result in the development of MALT lymphoma in the stomach. Eradication of the infection often leads to regression of the lymphoma, highlighting the important role of H. pylori in this condition. D. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: This is incorrect. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroid disease, is a well-known risk factor for thyroid MALT lymphoma. Chronic inflammation caused by autoimmune thyroiditis can increase the risk of developing lymphoma in the thyroid gland. This association has been widely documented in medical literature, making it a valid risk factor for MALT lymphoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Large cells with inconspicuous nucleoli Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is characterized by medium-sized cells with a high mitotic rate and closely packed round nuclei. The nucleoli in Burkitt lymphoma are usually prominent and inconspicuous nucleoli would be more characteristic of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which presents with larger cells and less pronounced mitotic activity compared to Burkitt lymphoma. The characteristic histological features of Burkitt lymphoma include a starry sky appearance, a high mitotic rate, and a diffuse growth pattern with medium-sized cells that have prominent nucleoli. Hence, Option C is the incorrect description for Burkitt lymphoma. Incorrect Responses: A. Diffuse growth pattern: This is correct. Burkitt lymphoma typically exhibits a diffuse growth pattern in which there is an even spread of lymphoma cells throughout the tissue. The cells are not organized into follicles or nodules, as seen in some other lymphoma subtypes. B. Starry sky appearance: This is correct. The starry sky appearance is a classic feature of Burkitt lymphoma. It is due to the presence of macrophages that ingest apoptotic tumor cells, creating a sky-like effect with bright, clear spaces scattered among dark, dense areas of the tumor cells. D. High mitotic rate: This is correct. Burkitt lymphoma is known for its extremely high mitotic rate. The high turnover rate of cells is characteristic of this highly aggressive lymphoma, contributing to its rapid progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bcl2 positivity In Burkitt lymphoma (BL), the malignant cells typically show Bcl-2 negativity because of their rapid turnover and high mitotic rate, which indicates a lack of survival signals that would be supported by Bcl-2 expression. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, and its positive expression is typically associated with indolent lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where there is a greater emphasis on cell survival. Therefore, the presence of Bcl-2 positivity should make you reconsider a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma and may suggest a different diagnosis, such as follicular lymphoma or DLBCL. Incorrect Responses: A. CD10 positivity: This is correct. CD10 is a positive marker in Burkitt lymphoma. In fact, CD10 is frequently used as a diagnostic marker for Burkitt lymphoma as it is commonly expressed on B cells of the germinal center. It is also expressed in other B-cell lymphomas like follicular lymphoma, but it is not an unusual finding in Burkitt lymphoma. C. Bcl6 positivity: This is correct. Bcl6 is often expressed in Burkitt lymphoma. It is a transcription factor involved in germinal center formation and is typically positive in Burkitt lymphoma cells, as the disease originates from germinal center B cells. Thus, Bcl6 positivity is not a red flag against Burkitt lymphoma. D. CD20 positivity: This is correct. CD20 is a positive marker in Burkitt lymphoma. It is a common marker for B-cell lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma. Its expression does not contradict the diagnosis and is generally used to confirm the B-cell lineage of the lymphoma cells.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above Burkitt lymphoma is most commonly associated with translocations involving the MYC gene on chromosome 8, which leads to its overexpression and contributes to the uncontrolled cell growth seen in the disease. The most frequent translocations observed in Burkitt lymphoma include: t(8;14)(q24;q32): This is the most common translocation in Burkitt lymphoma. It involves the translocation of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This results in MYC overexpression, driven by the highly active IGH promoter, which leads to lymphoma formation. t(8;22)(q24;q11): This translocation involves the MYC gene on chromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin light chain locus on chromosome 22. Although it is less common than the t(8;14) translocation, it still results in MYC overexpression and is seen in a subset of Burkitt lymphoma cases. t(2;8)(p12;q24): This translocation is a less frequent variant, involving the MYC gene on chromosome 8 and the immunoglobulin light chain locus on chromosome 2. Like the other translocations, it leads to MYC overexpression and contributes to the development of Burkitt lymphoma.",

Unlike other variants of DLBCL, IVLBCL is not commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The exact pathogenesis of IVLBCL is not completely understood, and while EBV can be detected in some cases of IVLBCL, it is not considered a defining feature, and its role in the disease is still under investigation. Thus, B is the correct answer because this variant of DLBCL is not strongly associated with EBV infection compared to other variants. Incorrect Responses: A. DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation: This variant of DLBCL is associated with EBV infection, especially in cases arising in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV or after organ transplantation. EBV can drive the pathogenesis of this lymphoma by promoting the proliferation of B-cells in the context of chronic inflammatory states, making A incorrect. C. Primary effusion lymphoma: Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is strongly associated with EBV infection. This lymphoma typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, and is frequently linked to HHV-8 (Human Herpesvirus 8). The presence of EBV is a characteristic feature of PEL, making C incorrect. D. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: This variant of DLBCL is also associated with EBV infection. It is a rare, EBV-driven lymphoma that often involves extranodal sites, such as the lungs, skin, and kidneys. It is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, making D incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is strongly associated with HIV, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). It is a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma typically found in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. HIV infection plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PEL because HIV weakens the immune system, increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PEL. EBV is almost always detected in PEL cases, contributing to its oncogenic process. The virus infects B-cells, and in the context of PEL, the virus helps in the uncontrolled proliferation of these cells. HHV-8, also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the most direct cause of PEL. It is present in the tumor cells and is considered essential for the development of PEL. The virus promotes the growth of B-cells and is typically co-infected with EBV in PEL cases. Therefore, D is the correct answer as all three infections—HIV, EBV, and HHV-8—are associated with PEL. Incorrect Responses: A. HIV: While HIV infection is a strong risk factor for PEL, it is only one of the contributing factors. In PEL, the role of HIV in immunosuppression facilitates the development of the lymphoma, but HIV alone is not the sole cause. Therefore, A is not the best answer on its own because it does not encompass the role of the other viruses involved. B. EBV: EBV is indeed strongly associated with PEL but not exclusively responsible for the disease. EBV contributes to the oncogenesis of PEL, but it typically occurs in combination with HHV-8 in the context of HIV infection. Thus, while EBV is necessary, it alone does not account for all of the associations seen in PEL, making B an incomplete answer. C. HHV-8: Similarly, HHV-8 is crucial for the pathogenesis of PEL, but like EBV, it does not act alone. It works in conjunction with HIV and EBV in the development of PEL. So, while HHV-8 is essential, it is not the sole factor responsible for the condition, which makes C an incomplete response.",

L&H cells are a characteristic feature of NLPHL, a variant of Hodgkin lymphoma that differs from classical Hodgkin lymphoma in its histologic features and clinical presentation. In CHL, the predominant neoplastic cells are typically Reed-Sternberg cells or variants thereof. Incorrect Responses: A. Reed-Sternberg cell: Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells are the hallmark neoplastic cells of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma. These large, binucleated or multinucleated cells have prominent nucleoli and are a key diagnostic feature of CHL.

The presence of eosinophils can be seen in Hodgkin lymphoma, but it is not a distinct or defining feature of any subtype of CHL. Therefore, B is the correct answer. The main subtypes of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma are categorized based on histologic features and immune cell composition, not specifically by the number of eosinophils present. Incorrect Responses: A. Nodular sclerosis: Nodular sclerosis is one of the most common and well-established subtypes of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma. It is characterized by the presence of lacunar cells (a variant of Reed-Sternberg cells) and fibrous bands that divide the lymph node into nodules. It is a hallmark of CHL, making A incorrect. C. Lymphocyte depleted: Lymphocyte depleted is another recognized subtype of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma. This subtype is typically associated with more aggressive disease and a poor prognosis. It is characterized by a lack of reactive lymphocytes and a predominance of Reed-Sternberg cells. Therefore, C is incorrect. D. Lymphocyte rich: Lymphocyte rich is also a subtype of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, characterized by an abundance of reactive lymphocytes and fewer Reed-Sternberg cells compared to other subtypes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CD15 and CD30 The classical markers for Hodgkin's disease are CD15 and CD30. These markers are typically expressed on Reed-Sternberg cells, which are the neoplastic cells in Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). CD30 is a cell membrane protein that is commonly found on Reed-Sternberg cells, and CD15 is another glycoprotein that is expressed on these cells. The presence of both markers helps in the diagnosis of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, making A the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: B. CD15 and CD22: While CD15 is a classical marker for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, CD22 is a marker for B-cells and is typically not seen on Reed-Sternberg cells. CD22 is more associated with B-cell lymphomas or leukemias, rather than Hodgkin lymphoma, making B incorrect. C. CD15 and CD20: Again, CD15 is a classical marker for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but CD20 is a B-cell marker typically associated with B-cell lymphomas such as Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are usually negative for CD20, making C incorrect. D. CD20 and CD30: While CD30 is indeed a classical marker for Hodgkin lymphoma, CD20 is not typically expressed on Reed-Sternberg cells. CD20 is more associated with B-cell lymphomas, and its presence would suggest a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma rather than Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, making D incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lymphocyte predominant Popcorn cells are characteristic of the Lymphocyte predominant subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). These cells are a variant of Reed-Sternberg cells with an irregular shape and abundant cytoplasm, resembling a \"popcorn\" appearance due to their lobulated nuclei. This subtype typically has a better prognosis compared to other forms of Hodgkin lymphoma and is distinguished by the presence of these popcorn cells. Therefore, C is the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A. Nodular sclerosis: Nodular sclerosis is the most common subtype of Classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and it is characterized by lacunar cells, not popcorn cells. These lacunar cells are Reed-Sternberg cells surrounded by a clear space due to cytoplasm collapse, which distinguishes it from the popcorn cell morphology seen in the Lymphocyte predominant subtype. Hence, A is incorrect. B. Mixed cellularity: The Mixed cellularity subtype is characterized by a variety of cell types, including Reed-Sternberg cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells, but it does not feature the characteristic popcorn cells. The presence of these other cell types, rather than popcorn cells, defines this subtype. Therefore, B is incorrect. D. Lymphocyte depletion: Lymphocyte depletion is an uncommon and more aggressive subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with a low number of lymphocytes and numerous atypical Reed-Sternberg cells. Popcorn cells are not associated with this subtype. This subtype has a poorer prognosis, and the characteristic cells are not the popcorn variety. Thus, D is incorrect.",

CD20 is a marker typically found on B-cells, but Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma is primarily characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells that are CD15+ and CD30+. The Reed-Sternberg cells in this subtype are usually CD20 negative, which is why C is the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mantle cell lymphoma The patient's presentation with massive splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and a total leukocyte count of 17,000 per mm³ suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The flow cytometry results showing CD23-negative, CD5-positive, monoclonal B cells with bright kappa positivity in the peripheral blood are characteristic of Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In MCL, CD5 is expressed, but CD23 is negative, which helps differentiate it from other B-cell lymphomas like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The bright kappa positivity indicates monoclonality, confirming the diagnosis of lymphoma. Splenic involvement and lymphadenopathy further support this diagnosis, making A the most likely diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: B. Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes: This condition, also known as Hairy cell leukemia, is characterized by villous (hairy) cells that can be seen on peripheral blood smears, along with splenomegaly. However, the flow cytometry results in this case are more consistent with Mantle cell lymphoma, as CD5 is positive and CD23 is negative, which is not typical for Hairy cell leukemia. Additionally, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes typically involves CD11c, CD25, and CD103 positivity, none of which are mentioned here. C. Follicular lymphoma: Follicular lymphoma is typically CD10-positive and CD20-positive with CD23-positive B-cells. The CD23-negative result in this case does not align with follicular lymphoma, which is usually CD23-positive. Also, mantle cell lymphoma is more likely in an older patient with splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, especially when the flow cytometry results indicate CD5-positive and CD23-negative B-cells. D. Hairy cell leukemia: Hairy cell leukemia typically presents with pancytopenia and splenomegaly, but the flow cytometry pattern is distinct from what is seen in this case. Hairy cell leukemia usually shows CD11c, CD25, and CD103 positivity, which were not mentioned here. Furthermore, the CD5-positive finding is not characteristic of Hairy cell leukemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Burkitt’s lymphoma The starry sky appearance is a characteristic histological feature seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. This appearance is due to the presence of highly proliferative tumor cells (the \"stars\") interspersed with macrophages that have engulfed apoptotic tumor cells (the \"sky\"). The arrangement creates a pattern that resembles a starry night sky. This pattern is highly suggestive of Burkitt's lymphoma, which is known for its high mitotic rate and rapid cell turnover. Incorrect Responses: B. CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia): CLL typically presents with a monoclonal population of small lymphocytes, but does not exhibit the starry sky appearance. The histology of CLL generally shows small, round lymphocytes without the large number of macrophages seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. C. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL): While DLBCL can show a variety of patterns, including areas of necrosis and apoptosis, it does not typically exhibit the starry sky appearance. DLBCL is characterized by large pleomorphic cells and areas of necrosis, but the pattern is different from the starry sky seen in Burkitt's lymphoma, which is specifically due to the interaction between rapidly dividing tumor cells and macrophages. D. ALCL (Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma): ALCL is a type of T-cell lymphoma that presents with large, pleomorphic cells but does not exhibit the starry sky appearance. The starry sky pattern is not a feature of ALCL, which can have a more varied appearance, often showing hallmark cells and sinusoidal involvement, but no specific histologic pattern resembling stars in the background.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CD43 MALT lymphoma (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue lymphoma) is a type of B-cell lymphoma that typically arises in mucosal sites, such as the stomach, and is associated with chronic inflammation, often due to infections like Helicobacter pylori. It is characterized by CD43 positivity, which is a pan-leukocyte marker commonly expressed on B-cells in MALT lymphoma. The presence of CD43 helps differentiate MALT lymphoma from other types of lymphoma. Incorrect Responses: A. CD3: CD3 is a T-cell marker, and MALT lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma. CD3 would typically be positive in T-cell lymphomas and not in MALT lymphoma, which primarily involves B-cells. B. CD10: CD10 is a marker often seen in follicular lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is not typically expressed in MALT lymphoma. While CD10 can be expressed in some B-cell lymphomas, it is not a characteristic feature of MALT lymphoma, where the focus is more on markers like CD43. D. CD5: CD5 is typically expressed in T-cells and is also seen in mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is not commonly found in MALT lymphoma, which is predominantly CD5-negative. The presence of CD5 would more likely point to a T-cell lymphoma or other B-cell lymphomas such as mantle cell lymphoma, rather than MALT lymphoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Burkitt’s lymphoma The t(2;8) translocation is a characteristic genetic abnormality seen in Burkitt's lymphoma. This translocation involves the MYC gene on chromosome 8 being translocated to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus on chromosome 2. The MYC gene is a potent oncogene, and this translocation leads to its overexpression, driving the rapid growth and proliferation of lymphoid cells, a hallmark of Burkitt's lymphoma. This is a key molecular feature that distinguishes Burkitt's lymphoma from other lymphomas and is a hallmark of this disease. Incorrect Responses: A. Pre B cell lymphoma: Pre B cell lymphoma typically does not involve the t(2;8) translocation. Instead, it may involve different genetic abnormalities, such as t(9;22) in some cases or other chromosomal alterations. Therefore, the t(2;8) translocation is not a characteristic feature of pre-B cell lymphoma. B. Pre T cell lymphoma: Pre T cell lymphoma, like pre-B cell lymphoma, does not typically involve the t(2;8) translocation. Instead, this type of lymphoma is characterized by alterations in other T-cell specific markers and might involve chromosomal rearrangements specific to T-cell development, but not the MYC-related translocation seen in Burkitt’s lymphoma. D. Mantle cell lymphoma: Mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by the t(11;14) translocation, which involves the Cyclin D1 gene. This is a distinct translocation and is not related to the t(2;8) translocation seen in Burkitt’s lymphoma. Therefore, mantle cell lymphoma does not exhibit the t(2;8) translocation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Stomach The most common extranodal site for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the stomach. This is especially true for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, a type of lymphoma that commonly affects the stomach. Helicobacter pylori infection has been identified as a significant risk factor for gastric MALT lymphoma. This type of lymphoma is frequently diagnosed in the stomach because of the presence of lymphoid tissue in the gastric mucosa, which can become involved in the lymphoma process. In fact, MALT lymphoma of the stomach is one of the most common extranodal lymphomas, and the stomach remains the most frequent extranodal site for NHL overall. Incorrect Responses: B. Brain: While the brain can be involved in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), this is not as common as gastric lymphoma in NHL. PCNSL is a relatively rare extranodal manifestation, usually seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients. Therefore, the brain is not the most common extranodal site for NHL. C. Intestines: The intestines can indeed be affected by NHL, particularly in forms like primary intestinal lymphoma, but this is not as common as gastric lymphoma. Although intestinal lymphomas are a significant part of extranodal NHL, they are generally less frequent compared to gastric involvement, particularly for MALT lymphoma. D. Tonsils: Tonsils can be affected by NHL, particularly in cases of extranodal lymphoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. However, tonsillar involvement is far less common as an extranodal site compared to the stomach, where MALT lymphoma predominates. The tonsils are generally more involved in Hodgkin’s lymphoma or throat lymphomas but not as frequently in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma compared to the stomach.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) t(14;18) The hallmark genetic abnormality in follicular lymphoma is the translocation t(14;18), which involves the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) on chromosome 14 and the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18. This translocation leads to the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, which prevents programmed cell death and contributes to the survival of malignant B-cells. The t(14;18) translocation is found in approximately 85% of follicular lymphoma cases, making it a key diagnostic and prognostic feature. Its detection is important in confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment. Why the other options are incorrect: (A) t(8;14): The translocation t(8;14) is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, not follicular lymphoma. It involves the MYC gene on chromosome 8 and the IGH gene on chromosome 14, leading to MYC overexpression and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. While significant in Burkitt lymphoma, it is not seen in follicular lymphoma. (B) t(8;12): This translocation is not associated with any major lymphoma subtype. It does not have clinical relevance to follicular lymphoma or any other common hematologic malignancies, making this option incorrect. (D) t(14;22): The translocation t(14;22) is not characteristic of follicular lymphoma. While some translocations involving chromosome 14 are seen in other lymphomas (e.g., mantle cell lymphoma), this specific one is not relevant to follicular lymphoma",

Atypical lymphocytes are usually found in the peripheral blood, and these same cells, which are reactive T immunoblasts cause enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. In contrast to reactive T-cell processes, reactive B lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid follicles and germinal centers (follicular hyperplasia). Examples of diseases that are associated with follicular hyperplasia include chronic inflammation caused by organisms, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS. Lymph nodes from patients with AIDS undergo characteristic changes that begin with follicular hyperplasia with loss of mantle zones, intrafollicular hemorrhage (“follicle lysis”), and monocytoid B-cell proliferation.
