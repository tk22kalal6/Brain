      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The progression of the dementia in CJD is usually so rapid that there is little if any grossly evident brain atrophy. The pathognomonic finding is a spongiform transformation of the cerebral cortexand, often, deep gray matter structures (caudate, putamen); this multifocal process results in the uneven formation of small, apparently empty, microscopic vacuoles of varying sizes within the neuropil and sometimes in the perikaryon of neurons",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schwannomas are well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses that abut the associated nerve without invading it, a feature that simplifies surgical excision. Grossly, these tumors form firm, gray comprised of an admixture of dense and loose areas referred to as Antoni A and Antoni B areas, respectively. The dense eosinophilic Antoni A areas often contain spindle cells arranged into cellular intersecting fascicles. Palisading of nuclei is common and “nuclear-free zones” that lie between the regions of nuclear palisading are termed Verocay bodies. In the loose, hypocellular Antoni B areas the spindle cells are spread apart by a prominent myxoid extracellular matrix that may be associated with microcyst formation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Astrocytoma Astrocytomas, particularly pilocytic astrocytomas, are the most common brain tumors in children. These tumors are classified as low-grade gliomas (WHO Grade I) and primarily occur in the cerebellum, although they can also arise in other areas such as the hypothalamus or brainstem. Pilocytic astrocytomas are generally slow-growing and have a favorable prognosis, especially when they can be fully resected surgically. Their high prevalence, especially in pediatric populations, makes astrocytomas the most common brain tumor in children. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Medulloblastoma: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, arising in the cerebellum. It is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and often spreads through the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite its significant prevalence and importance, medulloblastomas are less common overall compared to low-grade astrocytomas. Hence, it is not the most common pediatric brain tumor. (C) Ependymoma: Ependymomas are tumors that arise from the ependymal cells lining the ventricles of the brain or the central canal of the spinal cord. In children, they frequently occur in the posterior fossa, particularly near the fourth ventricle. While ependymomas are an important cause of pediatric brain tumors, they are less common than astrocytomas. (D) PNET (Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor): PNETs are a group of aggressive tumors derived from embryonal cells and include medulloblastomas. While PNETs (including medulloblastomas) are significant in pediatric oncology, their overall incidence is lower than that of astrocytomas. They also typically carry a worse prognosis compared to low-grade astrocytomas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Prostate carcinoma Prostate carcinoma has the least chance of metastasizing to the brain compared to other cancers listed. Prostate cancer tends to metastasize predominantly to the bones, especially the axial skeleton (e.g., vertebrae, pelvis), and less frequently to soft tissues and distant organs like the brain. Brain metastases from prostate carcinoma are exceedingly rare and generally occur only in advanced, widespread disease. This low predilection for brain involvement makes prostate carcinoma the least likely among the options to metastasize to the brain. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Lung carcinoma: Lung carcinoma is the most common primary cancer to metastasize to the brain. This includes both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. The high rate of brain metastases is due to the rich vascular supply of the lungs and their proximity to the systemic circulation, making this cancer a major contributor to secondary brain tumors. (B) Melanoma: Melanoma has a high propensity for brain metastases because of its aggressive nature and its ability to spread hematogenously. Brain metastases are common in advanced stages of melanoma, and they often present as multiple lesions. Melanoma's strong predilection for distant spread, including to the brain, makes it one of the cancers most associated with brain metastases. (C) Breast carcinoma: Breast carcinoma, particularly certain subtypes like HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, frequently metastasizes to the brain in advanced stages. While not as common as lung cancer or melanoma, brain metastases are a well-recognized complication of breast cancer, particularly in younger patients and those with aggressive disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bone invasion upgrades the tumor Bone invasion in tumors, particularly in endometrial stromal sarcomas or similar tumors, does not necessarily upgrade the tumor's grade. Tumor grading is primarily determined by histological features such as cellular atypia, mitotic activity, and specific morphological patterns. Bone invasion is a factor used to assess the tumor's stage rather than its grade. Staging reflects the extent of the tumor's spread, while grading evaluates the tumor's aggressiveness based on cellular characteristics. Therefore, this statement is incorrect, making C the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Can express progesterone receptor: Many tumors, especially endometrial stromal tumors and certain other gynecological malignancies, can express progesterone receptors (PR). PR expression is often associated with hormone-responsive tumors, influencing treatment options like hormone therapy. This statement is correct. (B) Rhabdoid morphology is grade III: The presence of rhabdoid morphology, characterized by cells with eccentric nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic inclusions, is associated with high-grade (Grade III) tumors. Rhabdoid features are indicative of aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, supporting this statement as correct. (D) EMA positivity is seen: Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positivity is commonly observed in a variety of tumors, including epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms. EMA staining helps in tumor diagnosis and classification, making this statement correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) S-100 is negative Explanation of the Correct Answer: S-100 is positive in cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors such as schwannomas. Schwannomas are derived from Schwann cells, which are neural crest derivatives. S-100 protein is a marker for Schwann cells, and its positivity is a diagnostic feature of schwannomas. Therefore, the statement that \"S-100 is negative\" is incorrect, making it the correct choice for the \"exception.\" Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Well circumscribed mass: Schwannomas, particularly those arising in the CPA, such as vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas), are well-circumscribed and encapsulated masses. This feature helps distinguish them from other tumors that may invade surrounding tissues. This statement is correct. (C) Associated with neurofibromatosis type 2: Schwannomas, especially bilateral vestibular schwannomas, are strongly associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The genetic mutation in the NF2 gene, which encodes merlin (schwannomin), is a hallmark of this condition. This association is well-documented, making this statement correct. (D) Areas of nuclear palisading are seen: Nuclear palisading, also known as Verocay bodies, is a histological hallmark of schwannomas. These structures consist of rows of aligned nuclei separated by anuclear zones, reflecting the organized growth pattern of Schwann cells. This feature is characteristic of schwannomas, making this statement correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 19 Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and linked to mutations on chromosome 19. The most common form, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), is caused by an expansion of the CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK (dystrophia myotonica protein kinase) gene located on chromosome 19q13. This expansion leads to defective RNA processing, resulting in the multisystemic manifestations of the disease, including muscle weakness, myotonia, cardiac abnormalities, cataracts, and endocrine disturbances. The chromosomal location of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19 makes this the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) 21: Chromosome 21 is associated with several genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and certain types of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it is not involved in myotonic dystrophy. No significant link exists between chromosome 21 and the mutations responsible for this condition, making this option incorrect. (B) 20: Chromosome 20 is associated with various genetic conditions, including Alagille syndrome and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). It does not play a role in the inheritance or pathology of myotonic dystrophy. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) 24: Humans have only 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes). Chromosome 24 does not exist in the human genome, making this option entirely invalid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is not typically associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. It is, however, more commonly linked to Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Lewy body dementia. In these conditions, alpha-synuclein accumulates abnormally, forming inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease is most often related to genetic mutations involved in amyloid processing or regulation, which are not related to alpha-synuclein. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. Amyloid precursor protein (APP): Mutations in the APP gene can lead to the early development of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in familial forms. These mutations result in an increased production of amyloid-beta plaques, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. APP mutations are one of the most well-established genetic causes of early-onset Alzheimer's. C. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE): While the ApoE ?4 allele is more commonly associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the ApoE ?2 allele is associated with a reduced risk. ApoE is involved in lipid metabolism and has a key role in the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques from the brain. However, ApoE is generally not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's as strongly as other genes like APP or presenilin, but it still plays a role in disease progression. D. Presenilin-1: Mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1) are one of the most common causes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which results in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.",
