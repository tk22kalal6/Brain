      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cholesterol Atherosclerotic plaques have three principal components: (1) smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T cells; (2) extracellular matrix, including collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycans; and (3) intracellular and extracellular lipid. These components occur in varying proportions and configurations in different lesions. Typically, there is a superficial fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells and relatively dense collagen. Beneath and to the side of the cap (the “shoulder”) is a more cellular area containing macrophages, T cells, and smooth muscle cells. Deep to the fibrous cap is a necrotic core, containing lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, foam cells (lipidladen macrophages and smooth muscle cells), fibrin, variably organized thrombus, and other plasma proteins; the cholesterol content is frequently present as crystalline aggregates that are washed out during routine tissue processing and leave behind only empty “clefts.”",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Calcifications cause significant narrowing of vessel lumen Monckeberg medial sclerosis is characterized by calcification of the tunica media (the middle layer) of muscular arteries. However, despite the presence of calcifications, these do not usually cause significant narrowing of the vessel lumen. The calcification in Monckeberg medial sclerosis typically results in stiffening of the vessel wall but does not obstruct the blood flow significantly. The vessels retain their patency despite the calcification, meaning that, while the walls may be calcified, the lumen is usually not narrowed to a clinically significant degree. Therefore, calcifications do not cause significant narrowing of the vessel lumen in Monckeberg sclerosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Calcification of the walls of muscular arteries: This statement is true. In Monckeberg medial sclerosis, calcification of the walls of muscular arteries occurs, primarily in the tunica media (the middle layer of the artery). This is the hallmark of the disease, distinguishing it from other forms of arteriosclerosis such as atherosclerosis, which primarily affects the intima. B. Typically affecting the tunica media: This statement is also true. Monckeberg medial sclerosis typically involves the tunica media of muscular arteries, where calcification occurs. The disease affects the middle layer of the artery rather than the intima, which is commonly involved in atherosclerosis. C. Persons older than age 50 are most commonly affected: This is true as well. Monckeberg medial sclerosis typically occurs in older individuals, often affecting those over 50 years old. It is commonly seen in elderly individuals, especially those with underlying metabolic conditions such as diabetes or chronic kidney disease.",

These changes reflect both plasma protein leakage across injured endothelial cells, as well as increased smooth muscle cell matrix synthesis in response to the chronic hemodynamic stresses of hyper tension. Although the vessels of older patients (either nor motensive or hypertensive) also frequently exhibit hyaline arteriosclerosis, it is more generalized and severe in patients with hypertension. The same lesions are also a common feature of diabetic microangiography; in that case, the underlying etiology is hyperglycemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Involves large vessels Wegener's granulomatosis (now called granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is a small to medium vessel vasculitis. It primarily involves small and medium-sized vessels rather than large vessels. The hallmark of the disease is the formation of granulomas, which predominantly affect the respiratory tract and kidneys. The disease is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis, primarily in small and medium arteries, and not in large vessels. Therefore, the involvement of large vessels is not a characteristic feature of Wegener's granulomatosis. Incorrect Responses: A. Granuloma in vessel wall: This is true. Wegener's granulomatosis is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of inflammatory cells, in small and medium-sized vessel walls. Granulomas may also form in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, which is a characteristic feature of the disease. B. Focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis: This is also true. One of the most significant features of Wegener's granulomatosis is the involvement of the kidneys, where it leads to focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis. This is a type of glomerular inflammation that can result in renal failure if not treated promptly. C. Positive for cANCA: This is true. Wegener's granulomatosis is typically associated with cANCA (cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies). These antibodies are directed against proteinase 3 (PR3), an enzyme found in neutrophils, and their presence is a useful diagnostic marker for the disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Always associated with HIV Kaposi sarcoma is not always associated with HIV. While HIV infection, especially in patients with AIDS, is a well-known risk factor for Kaposi sarcoma, the condition can also occur in individuals without HIV infection. Kaposi sarcoma can be seen in other contexts, such as in immunocompromised patients, organ transplant recipients, or in individuals with herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection, even in the absence of HIV. Thus, the association with HIV is strong but not universal. Incorrect Responses: A. Causative agent HHV 8: This is true. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). The virus is an essential factor in the development of this malignancy, and it is found in almost all cases of Kaposi sarcoma. B. Can be seen in depressed cell-mediated immunity: This is true. Kaposi sarcoma is strongly associated with immunocompromised states, particularly those involving depressed cell-mediated immunity. This is why Kaposi sarcoma is frequently seen in HIV/AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients, and other individuals with suppressed immune systems. D. Vascular tumor: This is true. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor, meaning that it arises from the blood vessels. It is characterized by the proliferation of endothelial cells and the formation of blood vessel-like structures in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. The tumor typically presents as purple, red, or brown lesions due to the presence of blood-filled vessels.",

CD 31 is a cell surface marker expressed on endothelial cells, and its presence is highly characteristic of angiosarcoma and other vascular tumors. The expression of CD 31 helps to identify the vascular origin of these tumors and aids in their diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: A. CD 10: This is incorrect. CD 10 is a marker of renal cell carcinoma and some other tumors, such as follicular lymphoma. It is not specific to angiosarcoma and is not used for the diagnosis of vascular tumors. B. CD 19: This is incorrect. CD 19 is a B-cell marker, expressed on B lymphocytes and B-cell lymphomas. It is not associated with vascular tumors like angiosarcoma. C. CD 25: This is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increased LV cavity size: Increased LV cavity size is not a typical aging change in the heart. With aging, the left ventricular (LV) cavity size may actually decrease due to fibrosis and myocyte loss, which can lead to a decline in myocardial function and contractility. The heart may also undergo increased wall thickness rather than an increase in cavity size. Therefore, increased LV cavity size is not a normal change associated with aging, but it can be seen in certain pathologic conditions like hypertension or valvular heart disease. Incorrect Responses: A. Increased LA cavity size: This is correct. Left atrial (LA) enlargement is a common aging change in the heart. As the left ventricle becomes less compliant with age, it leads to increased pressure in the left atrium, which causes left atrial dilation. LA enlargement is associated with the stiffening of the left ventricle and diastolic dysfunction. C. Sigmoid-shaped ventricular septum: This is correct. The ventricular septum may become sigmoid-shaped (i.e., curved) in older individuals, which is a result of the loss of normal ventricular function and the changes in the structure of the heart muscle. This change is part of the normal aging process and can contribute to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. D. Lambl excrescences: This is correct. Lambl excrescences are fibrous or thrombotic outgrowths on the aortic valve or mitral valve and are commonly seen in aging individuals. They are typically asymptomatic but may be a source of embolism in some cases. Their presence increases with age and is a known aging change in the heart.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Left atrium The Mac Callum patch is a characteristic finding in rheumatic carditis and is typically seen in the subendocardial layer of the left atrium. These patches are irregular, raised, and pale areas of fibrosis and inflammation that form as a result of autoimmune damage caused by rheumatic fever. This damage primarily affects the endocardium (inner layer of the heart), with the left atrium being the most common site for the Mac Callum patch, especially in the auricular appendage. Incorrect Responses: A. Right atrium: The right atrium can be affected in rheumatic heart disease, but Mac Callum patches are more commonly seen in the left atrium, rather than the right. The inflammation and fibrosis associated with rheumatic carditis tend to preferentially affect the left side of the heart, particularly the left atrium, rather than the right. B. Right ventricle: The right ventricle is generally not the site where Mac Callum patches are observed. Rheumatic carditis predominantly affects the endocardium of the left side of the heart, which includes the left atrium and mitral valve. While the right ventricle can be involved in rheumatic heart disease, Mac Callum patches are not typically found in this location. D. Left ventricle: The left ventricle is not the typical location for Mac Callum patches. Although rheumatic heart disease can affect the left ventricle, the characteristic Mac Callum patches are most often seen in the left atrium, not the ventricle. The ventricle is more likely to show fibrosis and scarring of the valve apparatus rather than the characteristic patches of inflammation seen in the atrium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fatty change in heart The \"tigered effect\" in the myocardium refers to a striated appearance of the heart muscle that is due to fatty infiltration within the myocardium. This appearance is characterized by alternating bands of pale and dark areas on histological examination, resembling tiger stripes, and is commonly seen in conditions where fatty infiltration or degeneration of myocardial cells occurs. This can happen due to metabolic changes, such as in conditions like diabetes or obesity, or as part of nutritional deficiencies (e.g., Vitamin C deficiency leading to scurvy) or excessive alcohol consumption. It is typically not related to malignancy or active inflammation but is an alteration in myocardial tissue. Incorrect Responses: A. Malignant change: The \"tigered effect\" is not associated with malignant change. Malignant tumors in the heart, such as cardiac myxoma or sarcoma, do not typically produce the distinctive striated pattern seen in fatty infiltration. Instead, malignancies may cause mass effect or structural changes in the heart rather than the striation pattern caused by fat deposition. C. Seen in rheumatic fever: Rheumatic fever typically causes inflammatory changes in the heart, leading to conditions like rheumatic valvulitis, endocarditis, or myocarditis. While myocarditis can occur in rheumatic fever, it does not usually result in the \"tigered effect\" of fatty infiltration. The pathologic changes in rheumatic fever are more likely to involve granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis, not the fat accumulation seen in the tigered effect. D. Associated with myocarditis: While myocarditis can cause inflammation in the heart muscle, it does not typically result in the \"tigered effect\" seen in fatty infiltration. Myocarditis is usually characterized by inflammatory cells (e.g., lymphocytes, macrophages) and myocyte damage, rather than fat deposition within the myocardium. The tigered effect specifically refers to the fatty change in the heart muscle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Associated with Carney triad: The most common primary cardiac tumor in adults is the myxoma, which is usually located in the left atrium. Myxomas are typically benign tumors, and while they are not specifically associated with Carney triad, they can occur in certain familial syndromes, such as Carney complex (not Carney triad). Carney triad is a distinct syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), paragangliomas, and pulmonary chondromas, and not myxomas. Therefore, myxomas are associated with Carney complex, but not Carney triad. Incorrect Responses: A. Most common site is left atrium: This is true. The left atrium is the most common site for cardiac myxomas, with these tumors most frequently arising in the atrium's interatrial septum. The tumor can be pedunculated (attached by a stalk) and may interfere with blood flow, causing obstructive symptoms such as syncope, dyspnea, or even stroke. C. Activating mutations in GNAS: This is true. Activating mutations in GNAS have been found in some cases of myxomas, particularly in familial forms of the tumor. GNAS encodes a protein that is involved in signal transduction, and mutations can lead to increased signaling that contributes to tumor growth. These mutations are one of the molecular alterations found in familial cardiac myxomas. D. Wrecking ball effect: This is true. The \"wrecking ball effect\" refers to the mobility of the tumor mass in the heart, often seen in myxomas, which can swing freely within the atrium. This movement can cause mechanical obstruction to the mitral valve or atrial septum, resulting in syncope, arrhythmias, or embolism due to the potential for the tumor to break off and travel to other parts of the body.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Proteinase 3 In Wegener's granulomatosis (now more commonly referred to as granulomatosis with polyangiitis), the cytoplasmic anti-neutrophilic antibodies are directed against proteinase 3 (PR3). PR3 is an enzyme found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and is involved in the degradation of proteins during the immune response. Anti-PR3 antibodies (known as c-ANCA) are highly specific for Wegener's granulomatosis and are commonly used as a diagnostic marker for the disease. The presence of these antibodies is associated with vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and organ involvement, particularly affecting the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. Incorrect Responses: A. Proteinase 1: Proteinase 1 is not a correct answer because anti-proteinase 1 antibodies (associated with p-ANCA) are more commonly seen in diseases such as microscopic polyangiitis or Churg-Strauss syndrome, but not in Wegener's granulomatosis. The anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies are the hallmark of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's). B. Proteinase 2: There is no known association of proteinase 2 with granulomatosis with polyangiitis or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. The commonly implicated enzymes are proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, but proteinase 2 is not relevant in this context. D. Proteinase 4: Proteinase 4 is not involved in Wegener's granulomatosis or the typical c-ANCA formation. The main antigen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis is proteinase 3 (PR3), while proteinase 4 does not have a significant role in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IgA Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis commonly affecting children, and it is characterized by the deposition of IgA immune complexes. The disease is primarily associated with IgA deposition in the affected blood vessels, which is a key diagnostic feature. In HSP, IgA deposits in the skin, kidneys, joints, and gastrointestinal tract, leading to symptoms like purpura (skin rash), abdominal pain, joint swelling, and sometimes kidney involvement, including glomerulonephritis. The IgA immune complex deposition plays a central role in the pathophysiology of this disease. Incorrect Responses: B. IgM: IgM is typically associated with acute infections, particularly bacterial ones, and is not a characteristic feature of HSP. Although IgM can be involved in certain immune reactions, its deposition is not a hallmark in Henoch-Schönlein purpura, where IgA plays a central role. C. IgG: IgG is commonly involved in many autoimmune diseases, but it is not the primary immunoglobulin involved in HSP. In diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IgG can form immune complexes, but in HSP, it is IgA that deposits in the blood vessels. D. IgE: IgE is primarily involved in allergic reactions and conditions like asthma and hay fever. While IgE can play a role in some immune responses, it is not typically associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura. HSP is linked to IgA rather than IgE.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Temporal Arteritis The described findings of fragmentation of elastic lamina, lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of giant cells are classic features of temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis). This condition is a type of large vessel vasculitis that typically affects the temporal arteries in older adults. It is characterized by inflammation of the arterial walls with the formation of giant cells in the affected vessels. Elastic lamina fragmentation and lymphocyte infiltration are common pathological findings in temporal arteritis. It often presents with symptoms such as headache, scalp tenderness, and visual disturbances. A biopsy showing these histopathological features helps confirm the diagnosis. Incorrect Responses: B. Takayasu Disease: Takayasu arteritis is another type of large vessel vasculitis, but it predominantly affects younger individuals, typically under the age of 40. It primarily involves the aortic arch and its major branches, leading to symptoms like weak or absent pulses, blood pressure discrepancies, and claudication. The histological findings in Takayasu arteritis may include thickening of the vessel wall and inflammation, but it is not characterized by giant cells and elastic lamina fragmentation in the same way as temporal arteritis. C. Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN): Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium-sized vessel vasculitis that typically affects organs like the kidneys, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by necrotizing inflammation of blood vessels, leading to aneurysms and thrombosis. Histologically, PAN often shows fibrinoid necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates, but giant cells and elastic lamina fragmentation are not typical features. D. Kawasaki Disease: Kawasaki disease primarily affects children and is characterized by inflammation of medium-sized vessels, including the coronary arteries. It often presents with fever, rash, and conjunctivitis, and may lead to coronary artery aneurysms. The pathological findings in Kawasaki disease typically involve mononuclear cell infiltration rather than giant cells or fragmentation of elastic lamina, making it distinct from temporal arteritis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Antigen-Antibody Complex Mediated Necrotizing arteritis with fibrinoid necrosis is most commonly seen in immune complex-mediated vasculitis. In this type of vasculitis, antigen-antibody complexes are formed and deposited in the walls of blood vessels. These deposits activate the complement system, leading to an inflammatory response and fibrinoid necrosis. This process results in damage to the blood vessel walls, with the deposition of fibrin-like material. This type of vasculitis is seen in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and some forms of post-infectious vasculitis. The presence of fibrinoid necrosis in the arteries is a hallmark of immune complex-mediated injury. Incorrect Responses: A. Immediate Hypersensitivity: Immediate hypersensitivity (Type I hypersensitivity) is characterized by the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils in response to an allergen. This is a rapid reaction, typically seen in conditions such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Immediate hypersensitivity does not result in necrotizing arteritis or fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessels, which are characteristic of immune complex-mediated vasculitis. B. Cell-Mediated Immunity: Cell-mediated immunity (Type IV hypersensitivity) involves T-cells and is responsible for conditions like tuberculosis, contact dermatitis, and graft rejection. While granulomatous inflammation is seen in these conditions, fibrinoid necrosis or necrotizing arteritis is not typically a feature of cell-mediated immunity. This type of response is more associated with chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling rather than the acute vessel damage seen in immune complex-mediated vasculitis. D. Cytotoxic Cell-Mediated: Cytotoxic cell-mediated immunity (Type II hypersensitivity) involves IgG or IgM antibodies directed against specific cell surface antigens, leading to cell destruction through complement activation or cytotoxic T-cells. This type of immune response is seen in diseases like Goodpasture syndrome or autoimmune hemolytic anemia, where specific cells or tissues are targeted for destruction. However, this mechanism does not typically result in fibrinoid necrosis in blood vessels, which is more characteristic of immune complex-mediated vasculitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cell Membrane Defects The increase in serum enzyme levels, particularly CK-MB (creatine kinase MB fraction) and troponin, is commonly seen in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI), which is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's presentation with severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, ST segment elevation on the ECG, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The primary mechanism behind the increase in these enzymes is damage to the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes. This damage leads to the leakage of intracellular enzymes (such as CK-MB and troponin) into the bloodstream. The integrity of the cell membrane is compromised due to necrosis of myocardial cells, and this results in the release of intracellular contents into the extracellular space. Incorrect Responses: A. Clumping of Nuclear Chromatin: Clumping of nuclear chromatin is a sign of cellular injury and is often seen in necrosis. While it is a feature of myocardial cell damage, it is not directly responsible for the release of enzymes like CK-MB or troponin into the bloodstream. These enzymes primarily leak from the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. The release of these cardiac markers is more related to cell membrane disruption rather than chromatin changes. B. Lysosomal Autophagy: Lysosomal autophagy is a process where damaged cellular components are broken down by lysosomes. While autophagy may occur in certain cellular conditions, it is not the primary mechanism leading to the release of CK-MB and troponin during myocardial infarction. The major contributor to the release of cardiac enzymes is the rupture or damage of the cell membrane, which allows the enzymes to leak into the blood. C. Mitochondrial Swelling: Mitochondrial swelling is a hallmark of reversible cell injury and occurs in response to metabolic disturbances, such as ischemia. However, mitochondrial swelling itself is not the primary cause of enzyme release in myocardial infarction. While mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to cell injury and necrosis, the rupture of the cardiomyocyte membrane is the key event that allows CK-MB and troponin to be released into the bloodstream.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 30 minutes In the context of myocardial ischemia, irreversible injury to the heart tissue occurs after approximately 30 minutes of inadequate blood supply. During this time, the myocardial cells begin to suffer from severe oxygen deprivation, leading to the accumulation of metabolic byproducts, disruption of cellular processes, and loss of electrochemical gradients. This results in the onset of irreversible damage, which includes cellular necrosis and the breakdown of the cell membrane. CK-MB and troponin leak into the bloodstream as a consequence. After 30 minutes, the damage becomes significant enough that tissue repair is no longer possible through reperfusion alone. Incorrect Responses: A. 10 minutes: At 10 minutes of ischemia, the damage to the myocardium is still reversible. The myocardial cells can typically survive this short period of oxygen deprivation if blood flow is restored. While subcellular changes like mitochondrial swelling or loss of glycogen stores may occur, full irreversible injury does not happen so early. C. 60 minutes: 60 minutes of ischemia leads to more extensive myocardial damage, and while damage will certainly be irreversible at this point, the critical threshold for irreversible injury is reached around the 30-minute mark. After this time, myocardial infarction and necrosis set in, but the 30-minute timeframe is the point at which irreversible cell death begins to dominate. D. 90 minutes: By 90 minutes, ischemia will have led to complete and irreversible myocardial necrosis. However, this is well beyond the critical time of 30 minutes when irreversible changes typically begin. In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, the 30-minute window is more relevant as the clinical focus for initiating reperfusion therapies to limit myocardial damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Coagulative necrosis In cases of death due to myocardial infarction, the characteristic post-mortem finding is coagulative necrosis. This type of necrosis occurs because of a lack of oxygen and nutrients following myocardial ischemia. The heart muscle cells undergo cellular death, but their architecture is initially preserved. This results in the formation of a firm, pale, and well-defined infarct area. The cells show eosinophilia and loss of nuclei, but the tissue structure can still be recognized in the early stages of necrosis. Over time, this will evolve into liquefactive necrosis as the tissue breaks down. Incorrect Responses: A. Fat necrosis: Fat necrosis occurs when fat tissue is damaged, often as a result of pancreatitis or trauma. In myocardial infarction, fat necrosis is not the primary process. Fatty tissue can become necrotic in the heart's epicardium or around coronary vessels, but it is not the hallmark of infarction itself. Coagulative necrosis of muscle tissue is more characteristic in this scenario. B. Caseous necrosis: Caseous necrosis is most commonly associated with tuberculosis or fungal infections, not myocardial infarction. The affected tissue has a cheese-like appearance due to the accumulation of dead cells and granulomatous inflammation. While myocardial infarction does involve necrosis, it does not typically exhibit this distinct pattern of granulomatous inflammation seen in infections like tuberculosis. C. Liquefactive necrosis: Liquefactive necrosis is common in tissues with a high lipid content, such as the brain, or in infections with pus formation. While myocardial infarction may eventually progress to liquefactive necrosis in the heart tissue as the infarct ages, the initial post-mortem finding in myocardial infarction is coagulative necrosis, not liquefaction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Smoking Buerger disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is strongly associated with smoking. It primarily affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins, leading to thrombosis, inflammation, and ultimately vessel occlusion. The disease is most commonly seen in young men under the age of 40, and there is a clear association with tobacco use. Smoking is thought to contribute to the development of Buerger disease by inducing inflammation and promoting clot formation within the blood vessels. Smoking cessation is one of the most important steps in managing this condition. Incorrect Responses: A. Alcoholism: Alcoholism is not directly associated with the development of Buerger disease. While alcohol abuse can lead to various cardiovascular and liver diseases, it is not a known risk factor for Buerger disease. The primary risk factor for this disease is smoking, not alcohol consumption. C. Trauma: While trauma can lead to vascular injury and may complicate the course of vascular diseases, it is not a primary factor in the development of Buerger disease. The disease is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels, which is most commonly triggered by smoking, rather than by external physical trauma. D. Cold environment: Exposure to cold environments can exacerbate symptoms of peripheral vascular disease, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, but it is not a direct cause of Buerger disease. Cold exposure can cause vasoconstriction and worsen symptoms in individuals already affected by Buerger disease, but it is not a primary cause of the disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Seen in >50 years of age Takayasu arteritis is typically seen in younger individuals, particularly in those under 50 years of age, with a higher prevalence in women, especially in the 20-40 years age range. It is an inflammatory disease of the large to medium-sized arteries, including the aorta and its major branches. It is rarely diagnosed in individuals over 50 years old, making the statement in option D incorrect. The disease tends to affect younger adults and is not typically seen in older individuals. Incorrect Responses: A. Causes transmural granuloma: Takayasu arteritis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation involving the entire thickness of the arterial wall, leading to a transmural granuloma. This inflammation leads to vessel wall thickening, which causes vascular narrowing and obstruction. The presence of granulomas is a hallmark feature of the disease, affecting the aortic wall and its branches. B. Granulomatous vasculitis: This is the defining feature of Takayasu arteritis. The disease is a form of granulomatous vasculitis, where the vessel walls become inflamed due to the formation of granulomas, which can lead to vessel stenosis, aneurysms, or occlusions. This characteristic of granulomatous vasculitis is central to the pathogenesis of the disease. C. Large to medium vessel: Takayasu arteritis primarily affects large to medium-sized vessels, particularly the aorta and its major branches (e.g., subclavian, carotid, and renal arteries). The inflammation and damage to these large vessels can result in significant complications such as vascular stenosis or occlusion, which can impair blood flow to various organs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aschoff bodies The image described in the question shows Aschoff bodies, which are characteristic of rheumatic fever. These bodies are granulomatous lesions found in the heart tissue, particularly in the mitral valve in the context of mitral stenosis. The presence of Aschoff bodies is indicative of rheumatic carditis, which is a major complication of rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease that follows a streptococcal throat infection. These lesions contain t lymphocytes, histiocytes, and giant cells, and are a hallmark of rheumatic heart disease, which can cause mitral stenosis. The left atrial enlargement seen in the X-ray is also consistent with this condition due to the increased pressure from the narrowed mitral valve. Incorrect Responses: A. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that affects multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, and heart. Although sarcoidosis can cause heart involvement (granulomas in the myocardium), the presence of Aschoff bodies in the histological examination is more specific to rheumatic fever. Sarcoidosis granulomas do not have the same histopathological features seen in rheumatic carditis. B. Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis (TB) can cause granulomas in various organs, including the lungs and heart, but the granulomas in TB typically do not resemble Aschoff bodies. In TB, caseating granulomas are seen, and the histology is characterized by a central area of necrosis surrounded by histiocytes and lymphocytes. TB granulomas do not cause the same inflammatory response and valve damage seen in rheumatic fever. D. Fungal granuloma: Fungal granulomas are a feature of chronic fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, which can affect the lungs and heart. These granulomas, like TB, show central necrosis, but they do not have the Aschoff bodies seen in rheumatic fever. The fungal granuloma typically lacks the distinctive giant cells and lymphocytic infiltration seen in the granulomatous lesions of rheumatic carditis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). In this cyanotic infant, the described defects — ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and complete pulmonic stenosis — are consistent with a severe form of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia (complete pulmonic stenosis). In such cases, the pulmonary circulation is severely compromised because blood cannot pass from the right ventricle to the lungs. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is essential for survival in this condition, as it allows oxygen-poor blood to bypass the blocked pulmonary valve and reach the lungs for oxygenation via the ductus arteriosus. The PDA maintains a vital connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, ensuring pulmonary perfusion and oxygenation in the presence of severe pulmonary obstruction. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Bicuspid aortic valve: A bicuspid aortic valve is a congenital anomaly where the aortic valve has two leaflets instead of three. While this condition can lead to complications like aortic stenosis or regurgitation later in life, it does not contribute to or compensate for the cyanotic congenital heart defects described here. It does not provide a shunt or alternative pathway to maintain pulmonary circulation. B. Ostium secundum defect: An ostium secundum defect, the most common form of atrial septal defect (ASD), allows left-to-right shunting of blood at the atrial level. While this may contribute to increased pulmonary blood flow in some cases, it does not help in situations where there is severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, as seen in this patient. It does not effectively support survival in the absence of a PDA. D. Patent foramen ovale (PFO): A patent foramen ovale is a persistent opening between the atria that can allow right-to-left shunting under certain conditions, such as increased right atrial pressure. However, a PFO alone cannot provide the critical pulmonary blood flow needed in this scenario. Without a PDA, the pulmonary circulation remains compromised. E. Preductal coarctation of the aorta: Preductal coarctation refers to a narrowing of the aorta proximal to the ductus arteriosus, typically seen in neonates. While it can lead to lower body hypoperfusion, it does not assist in pulmonary blood flow or oxygenation. In fact, preductal coarctation can exacerbate cyanosis in conditions dependent on a PDA.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Acute interstitial nephritis is a type of hypersensitivity reaction that commonly occurs 1-2 weeks after exposure to certain medications, including antibiotics such as methicillin. The clinical presentation of AIN includes fever, rash, hematuria, proteinuria, and eosinophilia, which are consistent with the patient’s symptoms. AIN involves an immune-mediated injury to the renal interstitium and tubules, leading to an inflammatory response. The presence of eosinophilia is a key diagnostic clue, as it strongly suggests a hypersensitivity reaction. Withdrawal of the offending drug typically results in clinical improvement, although corticosteroids may be required in severe cases. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. Acute renal tubular necrosis (ATN): ATN is a common cause of acute kidney injury and is typically associated with ischemic or nephrotoxic injury to the renal tubules. It presents with oliguria, azotemia, and granular casts in the urine, but it does not cause eosinophilia, rash, or fever. The patient’s history of methicillin use and hypersensitivity symptoms points to AIN rather than ATN. C. Crescentic glomerulonephritis: Crescentic glomerulonephritis, also known as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), is characterized by crescent formation in the glomeruli and presents with rapid loss of renal function, hematuria, and proteinuria. However, it is not associated with fever, rash, or eosinophilia and is not typically triggered by drug hypersensitivity. This makes it less likely in this case. D. Minimal change disease: Minimal change disease is a nephrotic syndrome that primarily presents with massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, without hematuria, fever, rash, or eosinophilia. It is more common in children and is not linked to drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions. E. Pyelonephritis: Pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidneys that presents with symptoms such as fever, flank pain, dysuria, and pyuria (white blood cells in urine). It is not associated with drug hypersensitivity or eosinophilia and does not explain the patient’s rash or recent methicillin use.",

This disorder almost always occurs in cigarette smokers at a young age (usually below 35 years) and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal arteritis or Takayasu’s arteritis.

Infarcts less than 4 hours typically may not be evident on routine gross inspection. An infarct of 5 days age would have a central yellow-tan softening surrounded by hyperemic border. Infarcts that are older than 1 week may show depressed infarct margins and eventually the development of scar tissue.",
