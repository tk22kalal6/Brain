      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Color blindness Color blindness is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning the defective gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Since males have only one X chromosome (XY), they are more likely to express the condition if they inherit the defective gene. Females, with two X chromosomes (XX), would need to inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to exhibit the condition, which is less common. Incorrect Answers: A. Thalassemia: Thalassemia is not X-linked. It is an autosomal recessive disorder that involves mutations in the genes responsible for the production of hemoglobin. It can affect both males and females equally, as the mutations are on autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). C. Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is also not X-linked. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene on chromosome 11. Like thalassemia, it can affect both sexes equally. D. Galactosemia: Galactosemia is another autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused by mutations in the genes that encode enzymes responsible for the metabolism of galactose. As with thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, the disorder affects both males and females equally.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is not an autosomal dominant disorder; it is an autosomal recessive condition. CAH involves mutations in enzymes responsible for adrenal steroid production, leading to an imbalance in hormone levels. Both copies of the gene (one from each parent) must carry the mutation for the condition to be expressed. Individuals who inherit only one copy of the mutated gene are carriers and typically do not show symptoms. Incorrect Answers: A. Familial hypercholesterolemia: Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant condition. It is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene, leading to high cholesterol levels. A person with one mutated gene will typically have elevated cholesterol levels, and the condition can be inherited from just one affected parent. C. Achondroplasia: Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene, which leads to abnormal bone growth and dwarfism. Only one copy of the gene needs to be mutated for the disorder to manifest, which is characteristic of autosomal dominant inheritance. D. Acute intermittent porphyria: Acute intermittent porphyria is another autosomal dominant disorder. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in the production of heme, which affects various bodily functions, including skin and nerve systems. Like the other dominant conditions, having a single mutated gene is sufficient for the disease to be expressed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hereditary spherocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is caused by mutations in the genes that encode proteins such as spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and protein 4.2, which are involved in the structure of the red blood cell membrane. These mutations lead to spherical-shaped red blood cells that are more prone to breaking down (hemolysis). Inheritance is typically autosomal dominant, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is required for the disease to manifest. Incorrect Answers: A. Albinism: Albinism is generally inherited as autosomal recessive. It is caused by mutations in genes responsible for the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Both parents must carry a copy of the mutated gene for the child to be affected. B. Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobin S). A person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to have sickle cell anemia. D. Glycogen storage disease: There are several types of glycogen storage diseases (GSD), and most of them are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. These diseases involve mutations in the enzymes that are responsible for the breakdown and storage of glycogen, leading to abnormal storage of glycogen in the liver and muscles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Autosomal Dominant (AD) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the protein neurofibromin. This protein helps to regulate cell growth. A mutation in this gene leads to the development of multiple neurofibromas (benign tumors of the nerve tissue), café-au-lait spots (skin pigmentation), and other characteristic features. In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of the mutated gene from either parent is enough to cause the disease. Incorrect Answers: B. Autosomal Recessive (AR): Neurofibromatosis type 1 is not autosomal recessive. In autosomal recessive disorders, two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are required to manifest the disease. NF1, however, follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. C. X-linked Recessive: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is not X-linked. X-linked recessive disorders are caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome, and the disease manifests in males (who have only one X chromosome) if they inherit the mutated gene from their mother. NF1 is not inherited in this manner. D. X-linked Dominant: NF1 is also not X-linked dominant. X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome, and they affect both males and females, but females are typically more severely affected because they have two X chromosomes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Autosomal Dominant (AD) Huntington's chorea (also known as Huntington's disease) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene on chromosome 4, leading to an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat. This gene encodes the protein huntingtin, which, when mutated, causes damage to the brain cells, particularly in areas involved in movement and cognition. In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one mutated copy of the gene from either parent is required for the person to develop the disease. Thus, an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their offspring. Incorrect Answers: B. X-linked Recessive (XR): Huntington's disease is not X-linked recessive. X-linked recessive disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome and predominantly affect males. Huntington's disease is inherited on an autosome (chromosome 4), not the X chromosome. C. Autosomal Recessive (AR): Huntington's disease is not autosomal recessive. In autosomal recessive inheritance, an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease, which is not the case for Huntington's disease. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Autosomal Dominant Tuberous sclerosis (also known as Tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC) is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which code for proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These proteins help regulate cell growth and division, and mutations lead to the formation of non-cancerous tumors (hamartomas) in various organs, including the brain, kidneys, and skin. In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of the mutated gene from one affected parent is required to manifest the disease, which means individuals with tuberous sclerosis have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their offspring. Incorrect Answers: B. Autosomal Recessive (AR): Tuberous sclerosis is not autosomal recessive. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to manifest. However, tuberous sclerosis is autosomal dominant, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disease. C. X-linked Dominant (XD): Tuberous sclerosis is not X-linked dominant. X-linked dominant conditions are associated with mutations on the X chromosome, affecting both males and females, but the genetic cause of tuberous sclerosis is on an autosome (chromosome 9 or 16, depending on the gene involved), not the X chromosome. D. X-linked Recessive (XR): Tuberous sclerosis is not X-linked recessive. X-linked recessive conditions are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, typically affecting males more severely.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Autosomal Recessive Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene located on chromosome 13. This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase, which is responsible for regulating copper levels in the body by helping incorporate copper into ceruloplasmin and excreting excess copper into bile. When this gene is mutated, copper accumulates in tissues like the liver, brain, and kidneys, leading to symptoms such as liver disease, neurological dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms. Since Wilson's disease is autosomal recessive, an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. Incorrect Answers: A. Autosomal Dominant: Wilson's disease is not autosomal dominant. In autosomal dominant inheritance, only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disease. However, Wilson's disease requires two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, making it an autosomal recessive condition. C. X-linked Dominant: Wilson's disease is not X-linked dominant. X-linked dominant inheritance involves mutations on the X chromosome and affects both males and females, but Wilson's disease is inherited via an autosomal chromosome and follows an autosomal recessive pattern. D. X-linked Recessive: Wilson's disease is not X-linked recessive. X-linked recessive conditions affect males more frequently because they have only one X chromosome, but Wilson's disease is inherited on an autosome, not the X chromosome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) X chromosome Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning the gene mutations responsible for hemophilia are located on the X chromosome. Hemophilia affects the blood's ability to clot properly due to a deficiency in clotting factors. There are two main types of hemophilia: Hemophilia A: Caused by a deficiency of Factor VIII. Hemophilia B: Caused by a deficiency of Factor IX. Since the mutation is carried on the X chromosome, males, who have only one X chromosome, are more likely to express the disorder when they inherit a defective X chromosome from their carrier mother. Females, having two X chromosomes, are typically carriers unless both X chromosomes are affected. Incorrect Answers: B. Y chromosome: Hemophilia is not associated with the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome carries genes responsible for male sex determination but does not contain the genes related to clotting factor deficiencies found in hemophilia. C. Chromosome 3: Hemophilia is not associated with chromosome 3. The genes responsible for hemophilia are located on the X chromosome, not on chromosome 3. D. Chromosome 16: Hemophilia is not linked to chromosome 16. The mutation causing hemophilia resides on the X chromosome, not chromosome 16.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning the defective gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which codes for the dystrophin protein necessary for muscle fiber integrity. Since DMD is X-linked, it primarily affects males, who have only one X chromosome. If they inherit the mutated gene from their carrier mother, they will develop the disease. Females, with two X chromosomes, can be carriers if they inherit one mutated X chromosome, but they typically do not show symptoms unless both X chromosomes are affected. Incorrect Answers: B. Autosomal dominant: DMD is not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In autosomal dominant inheritance, a single copy of the mutated gene in a pair (on non-sex chromosomes) is sufficient to cause the disorder. DMD, however, follows an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that males with one affected X chromosome will manifest the disease. C. Autosomal recessive: DMD is not inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are required for the disease to manifest. DMD is X-linked, so it requires only one affected X chromosome in males for the disease to develop. D. Codominant: DMD is not inherited in a codominant manner, where both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype. In X-linked inheritance, the condition is typically manifest in males with one affected X chromosome, while females are usually carriers unless both X chromosomes carry the mutation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 50% of boys of a carrier mother are affected Explanation: In an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome. Let's break down each statement to understand why A is correct: A. 50% of boys of a carrier mother are affected: A carrier mother has one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the recessive mutation (X^N X^d). Boys inherit their X chromosome from their mother and their Y chromosome from their father. So, when the mother is a carrier, there is a 50% chance that a son will inherit the affected X chromosome (X^d), resulting in the boy being affected by the X-linked recessive disorder. Incorrect Answers: B. 50% of girls of a diseased father are carriers: A diseased father has the mutation on his X chromosome and can only pass his X chromosome to his daughters. Therefore, all daughters of a diseased father will be carriers, not 50%. Since females inherit one X chromosome from their father and one from their mother, all daughters will inherit the diseased X from their father and will carry the mutation (X^d X^N), but they will not be affected because females need two copies of the mutated gene to be affected. C. Father transmits disease to the son: Fathers pass their Y chromosome to their sons (not their X chromosome). Therefore, fathers cannot pass an X-linked recessive disease to their sons. Sons inherit their X chromosome from their mothers. D. Mother transmits disease to the daughter: A mother who is affected (with X^d X^d) will pass her mutated X chromosome to her daughters, but if the mother is a carrier (X^N X^d), she will pass on one of her two X chromosomes (normal or mutated) randomly to her daughters. If she passes the mutated X chromosome, the daughter will be a carrier, but she won't be affected unless she inherits the mutated X chromosome from both parents.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bloom Syndrome. Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a genetic phenomenon in which both copies of a chromosome (or a part of it) are inherited from one parent, and none from the other parent. This can lead to disorders when there is an imprinted gene involved, where one parent's copy of the gene is normally silenced, and the other copy is active. Angelman syndrome (A) and Prader-Willi syndrome (B) are both disorders associated with uniparental disomy. In these syndromes, the disorder occurs when there is an imprinting error where the child inherits both copies of the affected chromosome from the same parent. In Angelman syndrome, the child inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from the father, leading to the absence of the normally active UBE3A gene from the mother. In Prader-Willi syndrome, the child inherits both copies of chromosome 15 from the mother, resulting in the absence of the normally active genes from the father. Russell-Silver syndrome (C) is also associated with uniparental disomy, particularly involving chromosome 7 or 11. This syndrome can occur when the child inherits both copies of a chromosome from one parent and none from the other, leading to growth restriction and other developmental issues. Incorrect Responses: D. Bloom Syndrome: Bloom syndrome is not associated with uniparental disomy. Instead, it is caused by mutations in the BLM gene (located on chromosome 15) that lead to defective DNA helicase activity, resulting in chromosomal instability. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning both copies of the gene must be defective for the disease to manifest. There is no involvement of uniparental disomy in this syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prader-Willi syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion of a portion of the paternal chromosome 15. This deletion leads to the loss of function of specific genes that are normally active only on the paternal copy of chromosome 15. The symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome include hypotonia, developmental delays, intellectual disability, hyperphagia (excessive hunger), and obesity, among others. Angelman syndrome (A) is caused by a deletion of the maternal chromosome 15 or by mutations in the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome 15. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, speech impairment, ataxia, seizures, and a happy demeanor. In contrast to Prader-Willi syndrome, the deletion is on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. Down syndrome (C) is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) rather than a deletion of a chromosome. It leads to developmental delays, intellectual disability, and physical characteristics such as a flat facial profile and upward-slanting eyes. Turner syndrome (D) is caused by the monosomy of the X chromosome, meaning that one X chromosome is missing or partially missing in females. This leads to a variety of symptoms including short stature, infertility, and heart defects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Uniparental disomy. Explanation: Angelman syndrome is typically caused by a deletion of the UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome 15, or by uniparental disomy where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father, leading to the absence of the normally active UBE3A gene on the maternal chromosome. This condition results in developmental delay, speech impairment, seizures, and a happy demeanor, among other features. Digenic inheritance (A) refers to the involvement of two different genes (from different loci) that both contribute to the manifestation of a disorder. This inheritance pattern is not typically seen in Angelman syndrome, which is usually due to a single gene defect or a chromosomal deletion. Inversion (B) involves a segment of a chromosome being reversed end to end. While inversions can cause certain genetic disorders, they are not the underlying cause of Angelman syndrome, which is linked to the loss of function of the UBE3A gene due to deletion or uniparental disomy. Mitochondrial disorder (D) involves mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited maternally. Angelman syndrome is caused by a defect on an autosomal chromosome (chromosome 15) and is not related to mitochondrial DNA or inheritance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mitochondrial. MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) is a disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial disorders are inherited maternally because mitochondria, and thus their DNA, are inherited exclusively from the mother. Therefore, MELAS follows mitochondrial inheritance. Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance (A) refers to conditions where only one copy of a gene needs to be mutated to cause the disorder, and it is passed on by affected individuals to 50% of their offspring. MELAS does not follow this inheritance pattern. Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance (B) requires both copies of the gene to be mutated for the disorder to manifest. While some mitochondrial disorders may have nuclear DNA mutations inherited in this manner, MELAS specifically involves mitochondrial DNA mutations. X-linked inheritance (D) involves genes located on the X chromosome, and diseases of this inheritance are typically passed from mothers (carriers) to sons. MELAS is not caused by mutations on the X chromosome, so it does not follow X-linked inheritance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mitochondrial inheritance. Mitochondrial inheritance is characterized by the fact that only mothers can pass on mitochondrial genes to their offspring. Mitochondria are inherited solely through the maternal line because the mitochondria in the egg contribute to the mitochondria in the offspring, while the sperm's mitochondria are usually discarded. Therefore, in a pedigree analysis showing only females transmitting the trait to all of their offspring (both sons and daughters), the inheritance pattern would be mitochondrial. For instance, if a mother in the pedigree has the condition and passes it on to both her sons and daughters, but the father does not transmit it to his children, this supports mitochondrial inheritance. Incorrect responses: Autosomal recessive (A) involves a situation where both copies of a gene (one from each parent) must be mutated for the disease to manifest. It typically shows a horizontal inheritance pattern (affected individuals appear in the same generation) and both males and females are equally likely to be affected. In autosomal recessive inheritance, the trait can be passed on by both males and females, not just the mother. Autosomal dominant (B) refers to conditions where only one mutated allele is necessary for a person to exhibit the trait. This type of inheritance would be indicated by an affected individual who passes the condition to approximately half of their offspring, and both males and females can be affected. In this case, if the disease is passed on equally by both parents and does not strictly follow maternal transmission, it would not be autosomal dominant. X-linked dominant (D) inheritance refers to conditions where the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome. In X-linked dominant inheritance, affected fathers would pass the condition to all of their daughters but none of their sons (since males only pass on their Y chromosome to their sons). In contrast, affected mothers can pass the condition to both sons and daughters. If the pattern observed does not fit these features, it would not be X-linked dominant.",

In fact, macro-orchidism (large testes) is one of the hallmark signs of Fragile X syndrome, particularly noticeable in post-pubertal males. Therefore, option C is the false statement about Fragile X syndrome. Incorrect responses: A. FMR1 gene defect: This statement is correct. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, located on the X chromosome. The mutation involves an expansion of the CGG repeat sequence, leading to a lack of the FMR1 protein that is essential for normal brain development. B. Large ears: This statement is correct. Individuals with Fragile X syndrome often have large ears, which is a characteristic physical feature. Other physical features commonly observed in individuals with this syndrome include a long face, prominent jaw, and large forehead. D. Long face: This statement is correct.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Trisomy 13 Patau’s syndrome, also known as trisomy 13, is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 13. This leads to severe developmental and physical abnormalities, including intellectual disability, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, and other congenital malformations. Infants with Patau's syndrome often have a very limited life expectancy, typically only surviving for a few weeks or months. Incorrect responses: A. Trisomy 21: This is the cause of Down syndrome, not Patau's syndrome. In Down syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, and an increased risk for certain medical conditions like heart defects. B. Trisomy 18: This is the cause of Edwards syndrome, which involves an extra copy of chromosome 18. Like Patau's syndrome, Edwards syndrome leads to severe developmental and physical disabilities, but it is a distinct condition with different clinical features. C. 45XO: This chromosomal configuration is seen in Turner syndrome, where there is a single X chromosome and no second sex chromosome. It leads to short stature, infertility, and other medical issues, but it is unrelated to Patau's syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Prader-Willi syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion or uniparental disomy of the paternal chromosome 15. One of the hallmark features of this syndrome is obesity, which typically begins in early childhood, often due to an insatiable appetite caused by hypothalamic dysfunction. Additionally, individuals with PWS often experience mental retardation or intellectual disabilities. Other characteristics may include short stature, hypogonadism, and behavioral problems. Incorrect responses: B. Turner’s syndrome: Turner syndrome is a condition where females have only one X chromosome (45,X). While individuals with Turner syndrome often have short stature and may experience some cognitive issues, obesity and mental retardation are not typically primary features of the syndrome. Intellectual development tends to be normal in most individuals with Turner syndrome, although some may have mild learning difficulties, especially in spatial reasoning and mathematics. C. Fragile X syndrome: Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked genetic disorder that causes intellectual disability, primarily affecting males. It is not typically associated with obesity, although some individuals may have difficulties with weight regulation. Intellectual disabilities in fragile X syndrome are more pronounced, and other characteristics include hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and social anxiety. D. Noonan syndrome: Noonan syndrome is a genetic condition that affects various parts of the body, leading to short stature, heart defects, and developmental delays. However, obesity and mental retardation are not characteristic features of Noonan syndrome. Intellectual disabilities can occur but are generally mild or moderate, and obesity is not a common feature of this syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cardiac septal defects. Multifactorial inheritance refers to the inheritance pattern of diseases or traits that are influenced by multiple genetic factors as well as environmental factors. Cardiac septal defects (such as atrial and ventricular septal defects) are known to follow a multifactorial inheritance pattern. These defects occur due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental influences during fetal development, rather than being caused by a single gene mutation. As a result, the recurrence risk in families is often higher than in the general population, but not as high as in single-gene disorders. Incorrect responses: A. Neurofibroma: Neurofibromas are a hallmark feature of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene, not multifactorial inheritance. While there may be some environmental influences that contribute to the manifestation of neurofibromas, the underlying inheritance is monogenic rather than multifactorial. B. Hemophilia: Hemophilia is a genetic disorder typically inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. It results from mutations in the F8 or F9 genes, leading to deficiencies in clotting factors. Hemophilia follows a single-gene inheritance pattern and is not influenced by multiple genes or environmental factors, making it a monogenic disorder, not multifactorial. D. Hypophosphatemic rickets: Hypophosphatemic rickets is a genetic disorder typically inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, caused by mutations in the PHEX gene. This disorder is not multifactorial but rather a single-gene disorder, and therefore does not fit the description of multifactorial inheritance.",
