      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bloom syndrome Bloom syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which encodes a helicase involved in DNA replication and repair. The defect in this helicase leads to impaired DNA repair, particularly the resolution of replication-associated DNA damage. This results in increased chromosomal instability, a high frequency of sister chromatid exchanges, and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as ultraviolet light. Clinically, individuals with Bloom syndrome present with growth retardation, photosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and an increased risk of malignancies. The role of the BLM gene in maintaining genomic stability makes Bloom syndrome a classic example of a DNA repair defect, making A the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Incontinentia pigmenti: Incontinentia pigmenti is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the IKBKG (NEMO) gene, which is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. This condition primarily affects the skin, hair, teeth, and central nervous system. It is not related to defects in DNA repair but rather to dysregulated apoptosis and inflammatory signaling. Thus, this option is incorrect. (C) Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia is a condition characterized by bone marrow failure and pancytopenia. It can result from various causes, including autoimmune processes, infections, toxins, and radiation. While certain inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (e.g., Fanconi anemia) involve DNA repair defects, aplastic anemia itself is not a direct result of impaired DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (D) Tuberous sclerosis: Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations in the TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin) genes, which regulate cell growth and proliferation via the mTOR pathway. This disorder leads to the formation of benign tumors in multiple organs. It is unrelated to DNA repair defects, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cytokeratin Cytokeratin is a marker specific to epithelial cells and is expressed in all carcinomas, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Cytokeratins are intermediate filament proteins that form part of the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, helping maintain cell integrity and organization. In squamous cell carcinoma, cytokeratin staining by immunohistochemistry helps confirm the epithelial origin of the tumor. Specific subtypes of cytokeratin, such as cytokeratin 5/6 and cytokeratin 14, are particularly useful in identifying squamous differentiation, making B the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Vimentin: Vimentin is a marker of mesenchymal cells and is commonly expressed in sarcomas and tumors of mesenchymal origin. While some epithelial tumors may express vimentin as part of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), it is not specific to squamous cell carcinoma or epithelial tumors, making this option incorrect. (C) Desmin: Desmin is a marker for muscle cells, including both smooth and striated muscle. It is commonly used to identify tumors of muscular origin, such as leiomyosarcomas or rhabdomyosarcomas. Squamous cell carcinoma, being an epithelial tumor, does not express desmin, making this option incorrect. (D) Myogenin: Myogenin is a highly specific marker for skeletal muscle differentiation and is used to identify rhabdomyosarcomas, particularly the alveolar subtype. It has no role in the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, as this tumor is not of muscle origin, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Deposition of amyloid in red pulp A lardaceous spleen refers to a spleen that becomes enlarged and waxy in appearance due to the deposition of amyloid in the red pulp. This form of amyloidosis affects the splenic cords and sinusoids, leading to a diffuse distribution of amyloid throughout the red pulp. The term \"lardaceous\" is used to describe the pale, firm, and waxy texture of the spleen seen grossly. Microscopically, amyloid deposits can be confirmed using stains like Congo red, which demonstrates the characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. The involvement of the red pulp distinguishes lardaceous spleen from other types of splenic amyloidosis, making B the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Deposition of amyloid in white pulp: When amyloid is predominantly deposited in the white pulp, it results in a condition known as sago spleen, where the spleen has scattered pale nodules resembling sago grains. This form of amyloidosis does not produce the diffuse waxy texture characteristic of a lardaceous spleen, making this option incorrect. (C) Deposition of hemosiderin: Hemosiderin deposition in the spleen occurs in conditions such as chronic hemolysis or hemosiderosis, where excess iron is deposited within macrophages. This process leads to a brownish discoloration of the spleen but does not cause the waxy appearance or texture seen in lardaceous spleen. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) Deposition of calcium: Calcium deposition in the spleen can occur in chronic conditions such as granulomatous diseases or old infarcts, leading to calcified nodules. However, this does not produce the diffuse waxy appearance or amyloid-associated changes characteristic of a lardaceous spleen, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gastrointestinal cancer CDX-2 is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. It is highly specific for tissues of gastrointestinal origin and is used as a marker for identifying gastrointestinal cancers, particularly colorectal adenocarcinomas. In cases of carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP), a positive CDX-2 result strongly suggests that the tumor originates from the gastrointestinal tract. CDX-2 positivity is especially valuable in distinguishing gastrointestinal tumors from other potential primary sites, making B the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Bladder cancer: Bladder cancer, particularly urothelial carcinoma, is not associated with CDX-2 expression. Bladder cancers are typically identified using markers such as uroplakin, GATA-3, or CK7/CK20. CDX-2 is not expressed in bladder tissue, making this option incorrect. (C) Lung cancer: Lung cancers, including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, do not typically express CDX-2. Lung cancers are more likely to express markers such as TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor-1) and Napsin A. CDX-2 positivity rules out a pulmonary origin, making this option incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Alveolar soft part sarcoma Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft tissue tumor that is not caused by the fusion of the EWS gene with another gene. Instead, ASPS is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation, t(X;17)(p11;q25), which results in the fusion of the ASPSCR1 gene on chromosome 17 with the TFE3 gene on the X chromosome. This translocation leads to the production of a fusion protein that drives tumorigenesis. Since the EWS gene is not involved in the pathogenesis of ASPS, it makes D the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Ewing sarcoma family tumors: Ewing sarcoma family tumors are strongly associated with translocations involving the EWS gene (EWSR1) fused with various partner genes, most commonly FLI1, resulting in the fusion protein EWS-FLI1. This fusion protein plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Therefore, Ewing sarcoma family tumors are caused by EWS gene fusions, making this option incorrect. (B) Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is also associated with translocations involving the EWS gene, such as t(9;22)(q22;q12), which results in the fusion of EWSR1 with the NR4A3 gene. This fusion is a hallmark of the tumor, implicating EWS involvement, and making this option incorrect. (C) Desmoplastic small round cell tumor: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor is defined by a specific translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12), which results in the fusion of the EWSR1 gene with the WT1 gene. This EWS-WT1 fusion protein drives the development of the tumor, making this option incorrect as well.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Splenectomy Explanation: Howell-Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants found in red blood cells (RBCs). These are normally removed from circulating RBCs by the spleen. After a splenectomy, the spleen is no longer available to filter out these inclusions, leading to the persistence of Howell-Jolly bodies in peripheral blood smears. This is a hallmark finding in patients who have undergone splenectomy or have functional asplenia, such as in sickle cell disease. Incorrect Options: A. Hepatectomy: While the liver plays a vital role in metabolism and detoxification, it is not involved in the clearance of nuclear remnants in RBCs. Hepatectomy does not lead to the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies. C. Pancreatectomy: The pancreas is involved in endocrine and exocrine functions but has no role in filtering or processing blood cells. Pancreatectomy does not result in Howell-Jolly bodies. D. Cholecystectomy: The removal of the gallbladder affects bile storage and digestion but has no impact on RBC morphology. Cholecystectomy does not cause Howell-Jolly bodies to appear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Osteosarcoma Retinoblastoma is strongly associated with osteosarcoma, especially in individuals with hereditary retinoblastoma. This connection arises from mutations in the RB1 gene, a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 13q14. In hereditary cases, individuals inherit one defective copy of the RB1 gene, and loss of the second copy in somatic cells leads to tumor development. The same RB1 mutation increases the risk of developing other cancers, particularly osteosarcoma, which is a malignant tumor of bone. This is most commonly seen during adolescence when bone growth is rapid. This strong genetic and clinical association makes A the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Hepatocellular carcinoma: Hepatocellular carcinoma is primarily associated with chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or metabolic disorders. There is no direct genetic or clinical link between hepatocellular carcinoma and retinoblastoma. Thus, this option is incorrect. (C) Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is linked to risk factors such as UV radiation, smoking, and chronic inflammation. It is not associated with RB1 mutations or hereditary retinoblastoma, making this option incorrect. (D) Osteoclastoma: Osteoclastoma, or giant cell tumor of bone, is a benign but locally aggressive bone tumor that is unrelated to RB1 gene mutations. There is no association between retinoblastoma and osteoclastoma, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common cancer associated with chronic osteomyelitis, particularly in cases where there is a long-standing draining sinus tract. Chronic inflammation and persistent infection in osteomyelitis lead to epithelial changes, including dysplasia, which can eventually progress to SCC. This malignancy is often referred to as Marjolin's ulcer when it arises in a chronic wound or sinus tract. The prolonged exposure to inflammatory mediators and the persistent tissue injury are key factors in the development of SCC, making A the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Osteosarcoma: While osteosarcoma is a common primary bone malignancy, it is not associated with chronic osteomyelitis. Osteosarcoma typically arises de novo or in the context of genetic predispositions (e.g., retinoblastoma) or pre-existing conditions like Paget's disease. It is not linked to chronic infections or draining sinuses, making this option incorrect. (C) Fibrosarcoma: Fibrosarcoma is a rare soft tissue and bone malignancy that can arise from connective tissue cells. While it may occur in a variety of settings, it is not typically associated with chronic osteomyelitis or draining sinus tracts. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) Osteoid osteoma: Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor characterized by a nidus surrounded by sclerotic bone. It typically causes pain, particularly at night, relieved by NSAIDs.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Neuroblastoma N-MYC amplification is a hallmark of neuroblastoma, a common pediatric malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system. The MYCN gene, located on chromosome 2p24, is amplified in a subset of neuroblastomas and is strongly associated with aggressive tumor behavior, rapid progression, and poor prognosis. N-MYC amplification leads to overexpression of the N-MYC protein, a transcription factor that drives uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. This molecular alteration is a key prognostic marker in neuroblastoma, with amplified tumors often requiring intensive treatment strategies. This specific association makes D the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Burkitt lymphoma: Burkitt lymphoma is associated with translocations involving the MYC gene (not N-MYC) on chromosome 8. The most common translocation is t(8;14), which places the MYC gene under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, leading to its overexpression. While MYC overexpression is central to Burkitt lymphoma, N-MYC amplification is not involved, making this option incorrect. (B) Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is typically associated with mutations in genes such as TP53, CDKN2A, and FGFR1 amplification, rather than N-MYC amplification. While MYC family genes may occasionally be altered in lung cancers, N-MYC amplification is not a defining feature of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, making this option incorrect. (C) Astrocytoma: Astrocytomas, particularly high-grade gliomas, are associated with genetic alterations such as mutations in IDH1/IDH2, TP53, and amplifications of EGFR or PDGFRA. N-MYC amplification is not a common feature of astrocytomas. Hence, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma arises through mutations in the RB1 gene, a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 13q14. The RB1 protein plays a critical role in regulating the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting the activity of E2F transcription factors. This prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation. In hereditary retinoblastoma, a child is born with one defective copy of the RB1 gene (a germline mutation). At some point, typically during early childhood, the second functional copy is lost through a somatic mutation, leading to loss of RB1 function and subsequent tumor formation. This \"two-hit hypothesis\" is a hallmark of hereditary retinoblastoma, making A the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Breast carcinoma: Breast carcinoma is typically associated with mutations in genes like BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, or other pathways involved in DNA repair. While the cell cycle may be dysregulated in breast cancer, it is not primarily driven by loss of the RB1 gene. This makes breast carcinoma an incorrect answer in this context. (C) Adenocarcinoma of colon: Colon cancer is most commonly associated with mutations in the APC gene, followed by mutations in KRAS, TP53, and other pathways involved in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Loss of RB1 is not a central mechanism in the development of colorectal carcinoma. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) Cerebral astrocytoma: Astrocytomas are associated with genetic alterations such as mutations in IDH1/IDH2, TP53, and PDGFRA, as well as dysregulation of growth signaling pathways. While cell cycle dysregulation may occur in astrocytomas, it is not typically due to RB1 mutations. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization). FISH is a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting chromosomal translocations, such as the t(11;22) translocation, which is characteristic of Ewing’s sarcoma. This technique uses fluorescently labeled probes that bind to specific DNA sequences on the chromosomes involved in the translocation. The ability of FISH to directly visualize the translocation within the tumor cells makes it particularly effective in confirming the diagnosis. FISH is relatively rapid and can be performed on both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, making it a practical tool for clinical diagnostics. Its utility in detecting specific translocations makes it a gold standard in many laboratories for diagnosing Ewing's sarcoma and other tumors associated with recurrent genetic alterations. Incorrect Options: A. Conventional karyotyping While karyotyping can detect large chromosomal abnormalities and translocations, it has limitations in sensitivity and resolution. It requires dividing cells, which can be challenging to obtain from a solid tumor like Ewing's sarcoma. Additionally, karyotyping might not always identify smaller or cryptic translocations, such as t(11;22), with the same accuracy as FISH. B. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Although NGS is a powerful tool for detecting a wide range of genetic alterations, including translocations, it is typically more complex, time-consuming, and expensive compared to FISH. NGS is not the standard method for diagnosing specific translocations like t(11;22) in Ewing’s sarcoma in routine clinical settings due to these practical limitations. D. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) PCR can be used to detect specific fusion genes resulting from the t(11;22) translocation (e.g., EWSR1-FLI1 fusion). However, it requires prior knowledge of the exact fusion sequence, and different primers are needed for different fusion variants. PCR also lacks the ability to visualize the translocation in its chromosomal context, which can be crucial for diagnostic confirmation.",
