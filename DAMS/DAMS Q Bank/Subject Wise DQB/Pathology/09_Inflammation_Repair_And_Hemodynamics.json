      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Vasodilation is quickly followed by increased permeability of the microvasculature, with the outpouring of protein­rich fluid into the extravascular tissues; this process is described in detail below. The loss of fluid and increased vessel diameter lead to slower blood flow, concentration of red cells in small vessels, and increased viscosity of the blood. These changes result in engorgement of small vessels with slowly moving red cells, a condition termed stasis, which is seen as vascular congestion and localized redness of the involved tissue. As stasis develops, blood leukocytes, principally neutrophils, accumulate along the vascular endothelium. At the same time endothelial cells are activated by mediators produced at sites of infection and tissue damage, and express increased levels of adhesion molecules. Leukocytes then adhere to the endothelium, and soon afterward they migrate through the vascular wall into the interstitial tissue Hence order of steps in inflammation are as follows- Vasodilation (earliest in arterioles) → Increased permeability→ Exudative fluid leaks out → Edema → Slower blood flow → Hemoconcentration and Increased viscosity → Stasis → Margination",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate anti-microbial substances at sites of infection and prevent the spread of the microbes by trapping them in the fibrils. They are produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens (mainly bacteria and fungi) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines, and complement proteins). The extracellular traps consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin that binds and concentrates granule proteins such as anti-microbial peptides and enzymes. NETs provide an additional mechanism of killing microbes that does not involve phagocytosis. In the process of NET formation, the nuclei of the neutrophils are lost, leading to the death of the cells, sometimes called NETosis, representing a distinctive form of cell death affecting neutrophils. NETs also have been detected in the blood during sepsis. The nuclear chromatin in the NETs, which includes histones and associated DNA, may be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus, in which individuals react against their own DNA and nucleoproteins NET is also called Beneficial Suicide of Neutrophils !!",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Decreased hydrostatic pressure: This does not occur in acute inflammation. Instead, hydrostatic pressure in capillaries initially increases due to vasodilation, promoting fluid leakage into tissues Vasodilation: An early response mediated by histamine and nitric oxide, leading to increased blood flow (redness and warmth) Stasis of blood: Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability slow blood flow, causing stasis, and allowing leukocyte margination Increased vascular permeability: Endothelial cells retract under the influence of mediators like histamine, bradykinin, and leukotrienes, leading to leakage of plasma proteins and fluids",

Margination: Leukocytes move toward the periphery of blood vessels due to stasis of blood flow 2. Rolling: Leukocytes transiently adhere to endothelial cells via weak interactions mediated by selectins (e.g., E-selectin, P-selectin) 3. Adhesion: Firm attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells occurs through interaction between integrins (on leukocytes) and ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 4. Diapedesis (Transmigration): Leukocytes squeeze through endothelial gaps into the extravascular space, mediated by PECAM-1 (CD31) 5. Chemotaxis: Leukocytes migrate toward the site of injury or infection, guided by chemical signals like cytokines, complement (C5a), and bacterial products",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Negative acute-phase proteins The liver responds by producing a large number of APRs. At the same time, the production of a number of other proteins is reduced; these are therefore referred to as “negative” APPs. Negative APPs are albumin, transferrin, transthyretin, transcortin, and retinol-binding protein. Positive acute-phase proteins Positive APPs are CRP, D-dimer protein, mannose-binding protein, alpha 1 antitrpysin, alpha 1 antichymotrypsin, alpha 2 macroglobulin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, factor VIII, von-Willebrand factor, plasminogen, complement factors, ferritin, SAP complement, SAA, ceruloplasmin (Cp), and haptoglobin (Hp). Positive APPs serve different physiological functions for the immune system. Some act to destroy or inhibit growth of microbes, e.g., CAA and Hp. Others give negative feedback on the inflammatory response, e.g., serpins, alpha 2 macroglobulin and coagulation factors affect coagulation. Positive APPs are produced during the APR associated with anorexia and changed metabolism.",

They arise in the atherosclerotic plaques and render them more susceptible to sudden occlusion and acute infarction of hte supplied tissues. Commonly, the plaque ulcerates or ruptures, and the exposed surfaces, being highly thrombogenic, precipitate thrombus formation. Thrombi are typified by the lens of Zahn, alternating layers of platelets and fibrin (the pale lines), and layers of blood (the dark lines). Beyond thrombus formation, other features of a complicated plaque include hemorrhage into the lesion itself, and micro embolism by cholesterol crystals or calcified debris. Furthermore, the weakened media underlying the plaque may develop an aneurysmal dilatation. In general, the clinical significance of atherosclerosis is related to the consequence of complicated lesions.

In this pathway, AA is broken down into leukotrienes (vasoconstrictors) and prostaglandins vasodilators). AA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is normally found esterified in plasma membrane phospholipids. It is released by the activation of phospholipases, such as phospholipase A2. Cyclooxygenase transforms AA into the prostaglandin endoperoxide PGG2, which is then converted into PGH2and subsequently into three products: thromboxane A2 (TxA2), prostacyclin (PGI2), and the more stable prostaglandins PGE2, PGF2, and PGD2.
