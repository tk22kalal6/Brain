      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IL-2 IL-2 is secreted by Th1 cells. Th1 cells primarily function in promoting cell-mediated immunity, which involves activating cytotoxic T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. IL-2 is a key cytokine that stimulates the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of these immune cells, thus playing a central role in the immune response to intracellular pathogens and tumors. Incorrect Responses: B. IL-4: IL-4 is primarily secreted by Th2 cells, not Th1 cells. IL-4 plays a significant role in promoting the differentiation of B cells and the production of IgE, which is involved in allergic responses and the immune defense against extracellular parasites. C. IL-10: IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is generally produced by regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th2 cells, and other immune cells. It helps to suppress the inflammatory response and limit excessive immune reactions. IL-10 is not typically produced by Th1 cells, making it less relevant in the context of Th1-associated cytokine production. D. IL-13: IL-13 is another cytokine that is produced by Th2 cells, and it has similar effects to IL-4, including promoting B cell activation and IgE production. It is involved in allergic inflammation and responses to helminths but is not secreted by Th1 cells",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anti-DNA topoisomerase (Scl-70): Anti-DNA topoisomerase (Scl-70) antibodies are most commonly associated with diffuse scleroderma (systemic sclerosis). These antibodies are directed against the Scl-70 enzyme, which plays a role in DNA replication and repair. In diffuse scleroderma, anti-Scl-70 antibodies are often found and are correlated with more severe disease, especially with involvement of internal organs like the lungs (interstitial lung disease), heart, and kidneys. Incorrect Responses: B. Anti-Centromere: Anti-Centromere antibodies are most commonly associated with limited scleroderma (formerly called CREST syndrome), not diffuse scleroderma. These antibodies are directed against centromeric proteins, and their presence is linked with a less severe form of the disease, typically with limited skin involvement and a higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension. C. Anti-RNA polymerase: Anti-RNA polymerase antibodies are associated with diffuse scleroderma as well, but they are less specific compared to anti-Scl-70 antibodies. These antibodies are associated with a more severe disease course, including rapid progression and involvement of internal organs such as the kidneys and lungs. However, anti-Scl-70 is more specific for diffuse scleroderma. D. Anti-Smith: Anti-Smith antibodies are associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), not scleroderma. These antibodies are directed against proteins in the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex and are highly specific for lupus, a condition characterized by a variety of systemic manifestations, including skin, renal, and hematologic involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Diffuse Lupus Nephritis Class IV lupus nephritis is characterized by diffuse lupus nephritis, which is the most severe form of lupus nephritis. It involves diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, affecting more than 50% of the glomeruli. This class is associated with the presence of subendothelial immune complex deposits in the glomeruli, leading to extensive inflammation and damage. Class IV is typically characterized by glomerular crescents and is the most common cause of renal failure in lupus patients. It is a proliferative and inflammatory pattern that results in severe renal impairment. Incorrect Responses: A. Mesangial Lupus Nephritis: Mesangial lupus nephritis (Class II) is a milder form of lupus nephritis where the mesangial area of the glomerulus is predominantly affected. In this class, there is limited glomerular involvement without significant proliferation or inflammation. It does not usually cause the extensive damage seen in Class IV. B. Proliferative Lupus Nephritis: Proliferative lupus nephritis (Class III) also involves glomerular proliferation but to a lesser degree than Class IV. In Class III, there is focal involvement (less than 50% of glomeruli are affected) compared to the diffuse involvement in Class IV. While it is a form of proliferative nephritis, Class III does not present the same level of severity and widespread glomerular involvement as Class IV. C. Membranous Lupus Nephritis: Membranous lupus nephritis (Class V) is primarily characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to the deposition of immune complexes. It is typically associated with nephrotic syndrome, and while it can cause significant renal damage, it is not considered to be a part of Class IV, which involves more proliferative and inflammatory changes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Diffuse Proliferative Glomerulonephritis: The most severe form of lupus nephritis is diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (Class IV). This form is characterized by widespread involvement of the glomeruli, typically affecting more than 50% of them. It involves immune complex deposition in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, which can result in glomerular crescents. The diffuse involvement of the glomeruli in this type leads to significant renal damage, often resulting in renal failure if untreated. This class is associated with the most severe clinical presentation and poor prognosis without aggressive treatment. Incorrect Responses: A. Mesangial Lupus Glomerulonephritis: Mesangial lupus glomerulonephritis (Class II) is a milder form of lupus nephritis. It is characterized by immune complex deposition predominantly in the mesangial areas of the glomerulus, which causes less extensive damage compared to Class IV. This form typically has minimal or no clinical symptoms of renal dysfunction and is not as severe as the diffuse proliferative form. B. Focal Proliferative Glomerulonephritis: Focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (Class III) involves proliferation of glomerular cells but affects less than 50% of the glomeruli. While it is still a significant form of lupus nephritis, it is not as severe as Class IV. Class III can lead to renal impairment but is generally not as widespread or aggressive as diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (Class IV). D. Membranous Glomerulonephritis: Membranous glomerulonephritis (Class V) is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to immune complex deposits. It typically leads to nephrotic syndrome, which involves significant proteinuria, but it is not the most severe form of lupus nephritis in terms of renal function loss or inflammation. This form can cause chronic renal impairment but is generally considered less aggressive compared to Class IV",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Donor T cells: The cells involved in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are donor T cells. GVHD occurs when the donor’s immune cells, primarily T lymphocytes, recognize the recipient’s tissues as foreign and mount an immune response against them. The T cells from the donor graft react to the host's antigens, typically involving tissues such as the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. This is a key feature of allogeneic stem cell or organ transplants, where GVHD can develop as a complication. Incorrect Responses: A. Recipient B cells: Recipient B cells are not involved in GVHD. While B cells play a role in immune responses, including antibody production, they are not the primary cells that cause GVHD. The pathogenesis of GVHD involves donor T cells attacking the host tissues, not the recipient’s B cells. B. Recipient T cells: Recipient T cells are also not involved in the development of GVHD. In GVHD, the donor T cells are responsible for recognizing and attacking the recipient’s tissues. The recipient’s T cells do not participate directly in causing GVHD, although they may play a role in immune regulation or in other post-transplant complications. C. Donor B cells: Donor B cells do not typically cause GVHD. The immune response in GVHD is primarily driven by donor T cells, not B cells. B cells from the donor might participate in immune responses like antibody production, but they are not involved in the cell-mediated response that leads to GVHD.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Renal involvement Renal involvement is not a characteristic feature of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD primarily affects the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract because these organs express the HLA molecules that are recognized by the donor T cells as foreign. The renal system, though it may be indirectly affected, is not typically a primary target of the immune response in GVHD. While renal issues can sometimes arise in post-transplantation scenarios, they are more commonly associated with other complications, such as infection, drug toxicity, or rejection. Incorrect Responses: A. Skin involvement: Skin involvement is one of the hallmark features of GVHD. The donor T cells attack the skin cells of the recipient, leading to symptoms like rash, redness, and desquamation. Skin involvement is one of the earliest and most commonly observed manifestations of GVHD. C. Liver involvement: Liver involvement is another common feature of GVHD. The liver can be affected by the donor T cells attacking the liver cells. This can result in hepatomegaly, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Liver dysfunction due to GVHD is often a critical manifestation and can contribute to significant morbidity. D. Intestinal involvement: Intestinal involvement is also characteristic of GVHD. The gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine and colon, can be attacked by the donor T cells, causing diarrhea, abdominal pain, and mucosal ulcerations. This can lead to significant complications such as malabsorption or dehydration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) B cell defect DiGeorge syndrome is a T-cell deficiency that results from failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The latter give rise to the thymus, the parathyroids, some of the C cells of the thyroid, and the ultimobranchial body. Thus, individuals with this syndrome have a variable loss of T cell–mediated immunity (resulting from hypoplasia or lack of the thymus), tetany (resulting from lack of the parathyroids), and congenital defects of the heart and great vessels. In addition, the appearance of the mouth, ears, and facies may be abnormal. Absence of cell-mediated immunity is caused by low numbers of T lymphocytes in the blood and lymphoid tissues and poor defense against certain fungal and viral infections. The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs—paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen—are depleted. Ig levels may be normal or reduced, depending on the severity of the T-cell deficiency. In many cases, DiGeorge syndrome is not a familial disorder. It results from a deletion that maps to chromosome 22q11.2. This deletion is seen in more than 50% of patients, and DiGeorge syndrome is now considered a component of the 22q11 deletion syndrome, discussed in Chapter 5. One gene in the deleted region is TBX1, which is required for development of the branchial arch and the great vessels. Notably, TBX1 is involved by loss-of-function mutations in a few cases of DiGeorge syndrome that lack 22q11 deletions, strongly suggesting that its loss contributes to the observed phenotype.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) ABeta2 Patients on long-term hemodialysis for renal failure can develop amyloidosis as a result of deposition of Beta2-microglobulin. Explanation: Beta2-microglobulin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in presenting antigens to T cells. In patients with renal failure, especially those undergoing long-term hemodialysis, Beta2-microglobulin accumulates in the bloodstream because the kidneys are unable to filter it out effectively. This accumulation can lead to the formation of amyloid deposits, particularly in the joints and tendons, leading to amyloidosis. A common manifestation of this condition is carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs due to amyloid deposition around the wrist. With older dialysis techniques, where the dialysis membranes were less effective at clearing Beta2-microglobulin, the risk of amyloid deposition was much higher. However, with the advent of more advanced dialysis filters, the incidence of dialysis-related amyloidosis has decreased significantly. Incorrect Responses: A. Deposition of Immunoglobulins (Ig): Immunoglobulins, or antibodies, are typically involved in conditions like multiple myeloma or chronic inflammatory diseases but are not primarily responsible for amyloidosis in dialysis patients. The type of amyloidosis observed in this case is associated with Beta2-microglobulin, not immunoglobulins. B. Deposition of Fibrinogen: Fibrinogen is a protein involved in blood clotting, but it is not a major contributor to amyloidosis in hemodialysis patients. Amyloidosis in this context is due to Beta2-microglobulin deposition, not fibrinogen. D. Deposition of Apolipoproteins: Apolipoproteins, such as Apolipoprotein E, are involved in lipid metabolism but are not associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis. The primary culprit in this form of amyloidosis is Beta2-microglobulin, not apolipoproteins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ankylosing spondylitis: Explanation: HLA-B27 is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule that has been strongly associated with Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), which is a chronic inflammatory condition primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. The presence of HLA-B27 is considered a genetic risk factor for AS, although not everyone with HLA-B27 develops the disease. It is believed that the antigen may play a role in the abnormal immune response that leads to the inflammation and fusion of the spinal joints seen in AS. However, HLA-B27 is not specific to AS and can also be present in other conditions. Incorrect Responses: B. Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the joints but is not strongly associated with HLA-B27. Instead, HLA-DR4 is the most commonly associated genetic marker for RA. HLA-B27 is more closely linked to diseases like Ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and other spondyloarthropathies, rather than rheumatoid arthritis. C. Chronic active hepatitis: Chronic active hepatitis is a liver condition that typically arises from viral infections (e.g., Hepatitis B or C) or autoimmune processes. It is not associated with HLA-B27. Instead, autoimmune hepatitis is more closely associated with markers like ANA (anti-nuclear antibodies) and SMA (smooth muscle antibodies), rather than HLA-B27. D. Diabetes: Diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, is an autoimmune condition, but it is not linked to HLA-B27. Instead, type 1 diabetes is most commonly associated with the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes. HLA-B27 does not have a known significant role in the development of diabetes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Type II Hypersensitivity Explanation: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness of the skeletal muscles, and it is primarily caused by Type II hypersensitivity reactions. In Type II hypersensitivity, antibodies are directed against specific cell surface antigens. In myasthenia gravis, the body's immune system produces antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. These antibodies block or destroy the receptors, impairing the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. This type of immune response is classified as Type II hypersensitivity because it involves IgG or IgM antibodies binding to cell surface antigens. Incorrect Responses: A. Type I hypersensitivity: Type I hypersensitivity, also known as immediate hypersensitivity, involves the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils in response to allergens. This type of hypersensitivity is responsible for conditions like allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis, but it is not involved in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis. C. Type III hypersensitivity: Type III hypersensitivity is caused by the formation of immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) that deposit in various tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. This type of hypersensitivity is involved in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not the mechanism behind myasthenia gravis, which is caused by antibody binding to acetylcholine receptors (Type II hypersensitivity). D. Type IV hypersensitivity: Type IV hypersensitivity, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), is mediated by T cells rather than antibodies. This type of reaction is responsible for conditions like contact dermatitis (e.g., poison ivy rash) and tuberculin skin test responses. Myasthenia gravis, however, is not mediated by T cell responses but by antibody-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction, which is characteristic of Type II hypersensitivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy Explanation: Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (FAP) is a type of amyloidosis caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. Transthyretin is a protein produced primarily in the liver and involved in the transport of thyroid hormones and retinol-binding protein. In FAP, genetic mutations in the TTR gene lead to the production of misfolded transthyretin, which then aggregates and deposits as amyloid in various tissues, particularly the peripheral nerves, leading to neuropathy. These amyloid deposits are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease, which can include sensory and motor nerve impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and in severe cases, heart failure. Incorrect Responses: A. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF): FMF is a genetically inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, typically involving the peritoneum, pleura, and joints. It is not associated with amyloid deposition caused by transthyretin mutation. Instead, FMF is related to mutations in the MEFV gene, which codes for the pyrin protein involved in regulating inflammation. Amyloidosis can develop as a complication in some FMF patients, but it is not the result of a TTR mutation. The amyloid deposition in FMF is usually caused by serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. C. Dialysis Associated Amyloidosis: Dialysis-associated amyloidosis occurs due to the deposition of ?2-microglobulin in various tissues, primarily in patients undergoing long-term dialysis. ?2-microglobulin is a protein involved in the immune system and is normally filtered by the kidneys, but in patients with kidney failure on dialysis, it accumulates and forms amyloid deposits. This condition is unrelated to transthyretin mutations and is distinct from Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy. D. Prion Protein Associated Amyloidosis: Prion protein-associated amyloidosis refers to the accumulation of prion proteins in diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or mad cow disease (Bovine spongiform encephalopathy). Prion diseases are associated with misfolded prion proteins, which aggregate and form amyloid-like plaques in the brain. These conditions are unrelated to transthyretin mutations and do not involve the typical amyloid deposits seen in Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Increased IL-2 Explanation: In HIV infection, interleukin-2 (IL-2) production is typically decreased, not increased. IL-2 is a cytokine crucial for T-cell activation and proliferation. In HIV, the virus targets CD4+ T cells, leading to their depletion over time. This results in a decrease in immune function and a reduction in the capacity to produce IL-2. As the immune system becomes progressively compromised, the ability to generate adequate levels of IL-2 diminishes. The immune dysregulation in HIV involves a defective cytokine response and immune cell dysfunction, which contributes to the progressive immune deficiency observed in patients. Incorrect Responses: B. Loss of memory T cells: One of the hallmark features of HIV infection is the progressive loss of memory T cells, especially CD4+ T cells. These cells are essential for mounting effective immune responses against pathogens. As HIV replicates and destroys CD4+ T cells, the memory T cell pool is depleted, leading to immunodeficiency and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. This loss of memory T cells is a major factor in the progressive immunosuppression seen in HIV-infected individuals. C. Decreased HLA II expression: HLA II molecules are critical for presenting antigens to CD4+ T cells and are essential for initiating immune responses. In HIV infection, the expression of HLA II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (such as macrophages and dendritic cells) is decreased. This is partly due to the direct effects of the virus on the immune system and contributes to impaired antigen presentation, further compromising immune function. This reduced expression of HLA II molecules impairs the ability of the immune system to mount effective responses against infections. D. Hypergammaglobulinemia: Hypergammaglobulinemia is a characteristic feature of HIV infection, particularly in the early stages. Despite the loss of CD4+ T cells, the immune system often compensates by producing increased amounts of immunoglobulins (antibodies). This results in elevated levels of gamma-globulins in the blood. However, the increased antibody production is not always effective in controlling infections, and it can contribute to the development of autoimmunity and other complications in HIV patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IL-4 Explanation: The Th2 subset of T cells is primarily induced by IL-4 (interleukin-4). IL-4 is a key cytokine involved in the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells. Th2 cells play a crucial role in promoting humoral immunity by stimulating B cells to produce antibodies, particularly IgE, and are involved in the defense against extracellular parasites and allergens. IL-4 drives the expression of GATA3, a transcription factor essential for Th2 differentiation. Therefore, IL-4 is the cytokine that specifically induces and promotes the development of Th2 cells. Incorrect Responses: A. Interferon gamma: Interferon gamma (IFN-?) is a cytokine produced by Th1 cells, not Th2 cells. IFN-? is crucial for the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity, particularly in the defense against intracellular pathogens like viruses and some bacteria. Th1 cells produce IFN-?, which activates macrophages and enhances the production of IgG antibodies. Therefore, IFN-? promotes Th1 differentiation rather than Th2 differentiation. C. IL-17: IL-17 is primarily associated with the differentiation of Th17 cells, not Th2 cells. Th17 cells play a key role in immune responses to fungi and extracellular bacteria, as well as in chronic inflammatory diseases. IL-17 promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which recruit neutrophils and other immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation. Thus, IL-17 induces Th17 differentiation and is not responsible for Th2 differentiation. D. IL-12: IL-12 is a cytokine that induces the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells, much like IFN-?. IL-12 promotes the production of IFN-? by Th1 cells and is involved in responses against intracellular pathogens. It does not play a direct role in the induction of Th2 cells. Therefore, IL-12 is more related to Th1 cell development, not Th2.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Reactive arthritis Explanation: Reactive arthritis is not an example of Type II hypersensitivity. It is considered an autoimmune condition often triggered by an infection, such as a urinary or gastrointestinal infection, and is typically classified as a Type III hypersensitivity reaction. In reactive arthritis, the body’s immune system generates a response to bacterial infections, leading to joint inflammation. The immune complexes formed in this process can deposit in tissues and activate complement, leading to inflammation in the joints. Therefore, reactive arthritis is associated with immune complex-mediated reactions, not antibody-mediated (Type II) reactions. Incorrect Responses: A. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a classic example of Type II hypersensitivity, where IgG or IgM antibodies bind to the surface of red blood cells, leading to their destruction (hemolysis). The binding of antibodies activates the complement system or induces phagocytosis of the RBCs by macrophages. This results in the premature destruction of red blood cells, leading to anemia. Type II hypersensitivity reactions are characterized by antibody-mediated cell damage, making autoimmune hemolytic anemia a prime example. B. Goodpasture syndrome: Goodpasture syndrome is another example of Type II hypersensitivity, where autoantibodies target the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidneys and the alveolar basement membrane in the lungs. This leads to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The antibodies bind to the basement membranes, activating the complement system, resulting in tissue damage and inflammation. This is a classic Type II reaction where antibodies directly mediate cell or tissue damage. C. Acute rheumatic fever: Acute rheumatic fever is a classic example of Type II hypersensitivity. It occurs as a post-streptococcal immune response where antibodies against Streptococcus pyogenes cross-react with tissues such as the heart, joints, and skin. The antibodies target heart valves and other tissues, leading to inflammation and damage, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry. The immune system’s response to the bacterial infection results in tissue damage, typical of Type II hypersensitivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Explanation: Onion skin lesions in the spleen are characteristically seen in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These lesions are a result of fibrous concentric layering around small blood vessels, typically in the context of splenic infarction or vasculitis in SLE. The onion skin appearance refers to the layers of fibrosis and thickening that form around the blood vessels due to the autoimmune inflammation seen in SLE. This condition often leads to vasculitis, causing damage to small blood vessels and leading to these characteristic lesions. SLE is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs, and the spleen can be involved with such changes as a consequence of the disease process. Incorrect Responses: B. Lymphoma infiltration: Lymphoma may cause splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen) and can infiltrate the spleen, but it does not typically cause onion skin lesions. Instead, lymphoma infiltration would result in the presence of tumor cells within the spleen, causing lymphoid aggregates or masses, rather than concentric fibrous layers. While lymphoma can affect the spleen, the characteristic onion skin lesions are not a hallmark of this condition. C. Hypersplenism: Hypersplenism is a condition characterized by excessive splenic activity, leading to premature destruction of blood cells (e.g., red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells). It can cause splenomegaly, but it is not associated with the onion skin lesions seen in SLE. Hypersplenism results from various underlying causes, such as portal hypertension, hemolytic anemias, or myeloproliferative disorders, but the fibrotic concentric layering seen in onion skin lesions is not a typical feature. D. Sickle cell anemia: In sickle cell anemia, the spleen may become enlarged (splenomegaly) due to the increased destruction of red blood cells, and in some cases, splenic sequestration may occur. However, onion skin lesions are not characteristic of this condition. In sickle cell anemia, splenic changes are more likely to be related to autosplenectomy (due to recurrent infarctions) or fibrosis, but the typical onion skin lesions seen in SLE are not commonly observed in sickle cell anemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) CD 18 Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD-I) is caused by mutations in CD18, which is part of the beta-2 integrin family. CD18 is essential for the adhesion of leukocytes (white blood cells) to the endothelial cells of blood vessels. This adhesion is critical for the migration of leukocytes from the bloodstream to sites of infection or inflammation. In LAD-I, the mutation in CD18 prevents leukocytes from properly adhering to the endothelium and migrating to infection sites, leading to recurrent bacterial infections, impaired wound healing, and an overall compromised immune response. Therefore, CD18 is directly involved in the immunodeficiency seen in LAD-I. Incorrect Responses: A. CD 16: CD16 is a receptor found primarily on natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells. It plays a role in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which involves the destruction of antibody-coated target cells. However, CD16 does not have a role in leukocyte adhesion or migration. Mutations in CD16 are not responsible for Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I, and its primary function is related to cytotoxic activity rather than adhesion. B. CD 17: CD17 is a marker often used for identifying immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood. It does not directly influence the adhesion or migration of leukocytes, and it is not associated with the pathophysiology of Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I. In LAD-I, the deficiency is linked to CD18, not CD17, making this option incorrect. D. CD 117: CD117 (also known as c-Kit) is a receptor for stem cell factor and plays a crucial role in the development and function of hematopoietic stem cells and mast cells. While it is important for hematopoiesis and mast cell biology, it is not involved in leukocyte adhesion. Mutations in CD117 are associated with disorders such as mastocytosis and not Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I. This makes CD117 an incorrect answer in the context of LAD-I.",

In Goodpasture syndrome, antibodies (IgG) are directed against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidneys and the alveolar basement membrane in the lungs, leading to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. This is a cytotoxic antibody-mediated response, which is characteristic of type II hypersensitivity, not type III. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: B. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: This is a classic example of type III hypersensitivity, where immune complexes are formed between streptococcal antigens and antibodies, and these immune complexes deposit in the glomerular basement membrane, leading to inflammation and injury. The resulting immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis is a key feature of type III hypersensitivity. C. Reactive arthritis: Reactive arthritis (also known as Reiter's syndrome) is also a form of type III hypersensitivity. It is thought to occur due to immune complex deposition in the joints, often triggered by infections like Chlamydia or enteric bacteria. The immune complexes formed in response to these infections lead to inflammation in the joints and other tissues, typical of type III hypersensitivity. D. Serum sickness: Serum sickness is a prototypical example of type III hypersensitivity. It occurs when immune complexes are formed between foreign proteins (often from medications or antiserum) and the host’s antibodies. These complexes can deposit in tissues like the kidneys and joints, causing inflammation and damage, which is a hallmark of type III hypersensitivity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus, and the most characteristic lesions are mediated by immune complex deposition (type III hypersensitivity). In this form of hypersensitivity, antibodies combine with antigen, resulting in antigen antibody complexes. Insoluble aggregates of the immune complex are deposited in vessel walls, serosal surfaces, and other extravascular sites, and complement is bound. The antigen-antibody-complement complexes are highly chemotactic for neutrophils, which release lysosomal enzymes and other mediators of tissue damage (prostaglandins, kinins, and free radicals).<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Pathology-5(3).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Impaired synthesis of the cell-surface GPI anchor Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria results in an acquired intracorpuscular defect in the ability to synthesize the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors required for appropriate placement of complement regulatory proteins on the surface of red blood cells. Functional deficiency of such proteins as CD55 and CD59 renders the cells sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are seen in pernicious anemia. Spectrin is deficient in hereditary spherocytosis. Ineffective erythropoiesis is seen in megaloblastic anemia due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiencies. Substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the -globin gene underlies the defect in sickle cell anemia. IOC for PNH diagnosis is Flow Cytometry",
