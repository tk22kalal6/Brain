      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Insertion A frameshift mutation occurs due to the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in the DNA sequence. When a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three is inserted or deleted, the reading frame of the mRNA is shifted. This alters the codon sequence downstream of the mutation, resulting in a completely different amino acid sequence and often producing a nonfunctional protein. Insertion mutations specifically add extra nucleotides into the DNA sequence, leading to this shift in the reading frame. Incorrect Answers: A. Transition: A transition is a type of point mutation where a purine is replaced by another purine (A <> G) or a pyrimidine is replaced by another pyrimidine (C <> T). This substitution does not typically cause a frameshift, as it involves replacing one base with another, maintaining the reading frame. B. Transversion: A transversion is another form of point mutation where a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine or vice versa (e.g., A <> C or G <> T). Like transitions, transversions do not cause a frameshift unless they involve an insertion or deletion of bases. It only involves one base swapping for another without shifting the entire reading frame. D. Point mutation: Point mutations are changes in a single nucleotide base pair in the DNA sequence. While point mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense mutations, they do not necessarily lead to a frameshift unless they involve insertion or deletion of a non-multiple of three bases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acrocentric The Y chromosome is acrocentric, which means it has a centromere located very close to one end of the chromosome, resulting in a long arm and a short arm. Acrocentric chromosomes are characterized by a satellite region at the short arm, which is typically smaller and may contain repetitive DNA sequences. The Y chromosome is an example of this structure. Incorrect Answers: A. Metacentric: A metacentric chromosome has a centromere located roughly in the middle, creating two arms of approximately equal length. The Y chromosome does not have a centromere in the middle and is therefore not metacentric. B. Submetacentric: A submetacentric chromosome has a centromere located slightly off-center, producing arms of unequal length but not as extreme as in acrocentric chromosomes. The Y chromosome's centromere is closer to the end, making it acrocentric rather than submetacentric. D. Telocentric: A telocentric chromosome has the centromere located at the very end of the chromosome, meaning one arm would be absent. The Y chromosome does not have a telocentric structure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Missense mutation A missense mutation occurs when a single base pair substitution changes the codon for one amino acid to another. This results in the incorporation of a different amino acid during protein synthesis, which can lead to a change in the protein’s function, structure, or stability. Missense mutations can have varying effects, from benign to harmful, depending on the nature of the amino acid change. Incorrect Answers: B. Nonsense mutation: A nonsense mutation occurs when a base substitution changes a codon that normally codes for an amino acid into a stop codon. This results in a truncated protein, often leading to loss of function or incomplete protein synthesis. C. Silent mutation: A silent mutation is a type of base substitution where the change in the codon does not affect the amino acid that is incorporated, due to the redundancy in the genetic code. The resulting protein is unchanged. D. Frame shift mutation: A frameshift mutation occurs when the insertion or deletion of a base pair shifts the reading frame of the codons, altering the entire amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 25% Achondroplasia is a autosomal dominant genetic disorder, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary for the condition to manifest. If both parents have Achondroplasia, each parent carries one copy of the mutated gene (heterozygous). The possible genetic combinations for their offspring are as follows: AA (normal, unaffected): This would occur if both parents pass on the normal allele. Aa (affected with Achondroplasia): This would occur if one parent passes on the mutated allele. aA (affected with Achondroplasia): This would occur if the other parent passes on the mutated allele. aa (normal, unaffected): This would occur if both parents pass on the normal allele. Since Achondroplasia is autosomal dominant, having one copy of the mutated gene (Aa or aA) results in the disorder. If both parents are affected (i.e., both are heterozygous), the possible genetic combinations for their child are: 25% chance of being unaffected (aa). 50% chance of being affected (Aa or aA). 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene (AA), which would typically be lethal and result in miscarriage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 1/4 Explanation: In the case of an autosomal recessive disorder, both parents must be carriers of the mutated gene (genotype Aa). When both parents are carriers, their possible offspring genotypes are as follows: AA (homozygous dominant): The child will be unaffected and a carrier (normal). Aa (heterozygous): The child will be a carrier but not affected by the disease. aa (homozygous recessive): The child will be affected by the autosomal recessive disorder. The possible combinations for offspring from two Aa parents are: AA (unaffected) = 25? (carrier, unaffected) = 50? (affected) = 25% Thus, the probability of the child being affected (genotype aa) is 1 in 4, or 25%. Incorrect Answers: A. 1/1: This would mean that all offspring are affected, which is not true. Only 25% of the offspring will be affected. B. 1/3: There is no 1/3 chance for an affected child in autosomal recessive inheritance. The correct chance is 1/4.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 0% Explanation: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means that an individual must inherit two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) to be affected by the disease. If one parent is affected (genotype ff) and the other is normal (genotype FF), then the possible genotypes for their offspring are: Ff (carrier, not affected) Ff (carrier, not affected) Since both parents cannot pass on the defective gene in this scenario (the affected parent will only pass the f allele, and the unaffected parent can only pass the F allele), the offspring will only be carriers of the gene (genotype Ff) and will not be affected by cystic fibrosis. Therefore, there is a 0% chance of the offspring being affected by cystic fibrosis. Incorrect Answers: A. 25%: This would be the case if both parents were carriers (genotype Ff). However, in this case, only one parent is affected and the other is normal, so no child will be affected. B. 50%: This would imply that there is a 50% chance of having a child with cystic fibrosis, which is incorrect in this scenario. D. 80%: This is not a correct probability for cystic fibrosis inheritance in any typical scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Type 4 Explanation: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of connective tissue disorders caused by defects in collagen synthesis, which affects the skin, joints, and blood vessels. There are multiple types of EDS, and the severity can vary between them. Here's why Type 4 is the most severe: Type 4 (Vascular EDS): This is considered the most severe form of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome due to its life-threatening complications. It is caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene, which affects type III collagen, a key component of blood vessels and organs. People with Type 4 EDS have fragile skin, thin blood vessels, and internal organs that are prone to rupture. Vascular complications like arterial rupture or organ rupture can result in early death, typically in early adulthood. Incorrect Answers: A. Type 1 (Classical EDS): Type 1 is a more mild form of EDS, caused by defects in type I collagen. While individuals with Type 1 EDS may experience hyperelastic skin and joint hypermobility, it is less severe than Type 4 and does not typically involve the life-threatening vascular issues seen in Type 4. C. Type 8 (Periodontal EDS): Type 8 EDS involves defects in collagen and affects the gums and the skeletal system. While it can cause significant dental issues and joint problems, it is not as severe or life-threatening as Type 4. D. Type 2 (Classic-like EDS): Type 2, often grouped under classical EDS, is similar to Type 1 but less commonly seen. It is also associated with skin hyperelasticity and joint hypermobility, but the risk of life-threatening complications is far less compared to Type 4.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fibrillin 1. Explanation: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the connective tissue, and the defect responsible for the condition is in the fibrillin 1 gene. Fibrillin 1 is a glycoprotein that is essential for the formation of microfibrils, which provide structural support to the extracellular matrix. The mutation in this gene leads to the features of Marfan syndrome, including: Tall stature, with long limbs and fingers. Cardiovascular issues, especially aortic aneurysm or dissection due to weakened connective tissue in the aorta. Skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis or chest deformities. Lens dislocation due to the weakened connective tissue in the eye. Incorrect Options: B. Collagen: Collagen defects are seen in conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, not in Marfan syndrome. C. Fibrillin II: Fibrillin II mutations are associated with Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly, which is a separate disorder from Marfan syndrome. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sickle cell anemia. Explanation: Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the hemoglobin gene (HBB). This mutation is a single nucleotide change in the DNA sequence, where adenine is substituted by thymine, leading to the replacement of glutamic acid with valine in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. This alteration causes the hemoglobin molecules to stick together under low oxygen conditions, resulting in the characteristic sickling of red blood cells. Incorrect Options: A. Color blindness: Color blindness is typically due to X-linked recessive inheritance involving defects in the opsin genes, which are not typically caused by point mutations but rather by deletions or duplications of specific gene regions. C. Diabetes: While certain forms of diabetes, particularly type 1, have a genetic component, diabetes as a whole is caused by a combination of genetic factors and environmental influences, rather than being caused by a single point mutation. Type 2 diabetes involves multiple genetic factors, not a single mutation. D. Porphyria: Porphyria is a group of disorders that can involve mutations in genes encoding enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway. These mutations are typically frameshift or deletions, not point mutations in many cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 9q. Explanation: Friedreich's ataxia is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene located on chromosome 9q. This gene encodes the protein frataxin, which is involved in mitochondrial function. Mutations in this gene lead to progressive damage to the nervous system, causing symptoms like ataxia, muscle weakness, and heart problems. The mutation typically involves an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in the gene, which affects its expression. Incorrect Options: B. 19q: This chromosome is involved in some other genetic conditions, but Friedreich's ataxia is not associated with this location. C. 17p: Chromosome 17p is associated with various other genetic disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), but it is not involved in Friedreich's ataxia. D. X chromosome: The X chromosome is involved in several X-linked genetic disorders, but Friedreich's ataxia is autosomal recessive, and its gene is located on chromosome 9q, not the X chromosome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Trinucleotide-repeat expansion. Anticipation refers to a phenomenon where the symptoms of a genetic disorder become more severe or appear at an earlier age as the condition is passed down through generations. This is typically seen in diseases caused by trinucleotide-repeat expansions. These are mutations in which a specific sequence of three nucleotides (a trinucleotide) is repeated multiple times, and the number of repeats can increase in successive generations, leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms. Examples of diseases associated with anticipation due to trinucleotide-repeat expansions include: Huntington's disease (CAG repeats) Fragile X syndrome (CGG repeats) Myotonic dystrophy (CTG repeats) Incorrect Options: A. Translocation: Chromosomal translocations involve a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosomes, but they are not typically associated with anticipation. The transmission of translocations is usually more straightforward without the progressive worsening seen in anticipation. B. Chromosome breaking: Chromosome breaking can lead to structural abnormalities or instability in chromosomes, but this is not associated with anticipation. Chromosome breakage does not typically lead to progressively earlier or more severe symptoms in subsequent generations. D. Mitochondrial mutation: Mitochondrial mutations are inherited maternally and do not typically exhibit the phenomenon of anticipation. These mutations can cause various mitochondrial diseases, but they are not known for the progressive worsening seen in anticipation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chromosome 1 contains the most known genetic diseases of any human chromosome. This chromosome is the largest human chromosome, containing approximately 2,000 to 3,000 genes. Many of these genes are associated with various inherited disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer susceptibility syndromes. The large number of genes on chromosome 1 contributes to its involvement in a wide range of genetic diseases. Incorrect responses: B. 9: While chromosome 9 is involved in several genetic conditions, it does not have the most known genetic diseases. This chromosome includes genes associated with conditions like cystic fibrosis, but its number of related genetic disorders is fewer than chromosome 1. C. 11: Chromosome 11 is involved in some significant genetic conditions such as sickle cell disease and various cancers, but it does not contain as many known genetic diseases as chromosome 1. D. 6: Chromosome 6 contains important genes related to immune function, including those encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but it is not the chromosome with the most known genetic diseases. It does contribute to some inherited conditions, including autoimmune diseases, but it is not the leader in terms of the number of genetic disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Umbilical hernia. Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females, typically caused by the partial or complete absence of one of the X chromosomes (45,X). Characteristic features of Turner syndrome include: Webbing of the neck: This is a common physical feature in individuals with Turner syndrome, caused by a redundant skin fold on the back of the neck. Cubitus valgus: This is an increased carrying angle of the elbow, often seen in individuals with Turner syndrome. It is due to abnormal bone development in the arms. Coarctation of the aorta: This is a congenital heart defect often seen in individuals with Turner syndrome. It involves narrowing of the aorta, which can lead to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues. However, umbilical hernia is not a characteristic of Turner syndrome. Although it can occur in the general population, it is not specifically associated with Turner syndrome. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Incorrect responses: A. Webbing of neck: This is a hallmark feature of Turner syndrome. The skin folds around the neck may be present at birth or develop later, and it is commonly seen in affected individuals. B. Cubitus valgus: This is also a well-known feature of Turner syndrome, often presenting with abnormal angulation at the elbows. D. Coarctation of aorta: This heart defect is one of the most common cardiovascular abnormalities in Turner syndrome.

Turner syndrome is a genetic condition where there is a complete or partial absence of one of the X chromosomes, resulting in a karyotype of 45, X. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, primary amenorrhea, widely spaced nipples, and other physical features such as a webbed neck, low-set ears, and a broad chest. Individuals with Turner syndrome typically have normal intelligence but may experience infertility due to ovarian dysfunction. Incorrect responses: A. 47, XX + 18: This karyotype refers to Edward's syndrome (Trisomy 18), which is a condition characterized by severe developmental and physical abnormalities, including a small head, clenched fists, and a high mortality rate. While short stature is seen in Edward's syndrome, it would not typically present with primary amenorrhea or widely spaced nipples, making it an unlikely match for the described symptoms. B. 46, XXY: This karyotype represents Klinefelter syndrome, a condition in males where an extra X chromosome is present. Klinefelter syndrome typically affects males and presents with features such as tall stature, hypogonadism, infertility, and gynecomastia, but it would not be applicable in a female. C. 47, XXY: This karyotype also represents Klinefelter syndrome, but as previously mentioned, it affects males, not females.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 47, XXY. The description provided — males who are sexually underdeveloped with rudimentary testes and prostate glands, sparse pubic and facial hair, long arms and legs, and large hands and feet — is consistent with Klinefelter syndrome, which is caused by the karyotype 47, XXY. Klinefelter syndrome occurs when males have an extra X chromosome. This extra chromosome leads to hypogonadism, which causes underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics such as sparse facial and body hair, and smaller testes. It also results in taller stature with disproportionately long limbs, large hands, and feet. Incorrect responses: A. 45, XYY: This karyotype represents Jacob's syndrome, a condition in males where there is an extra Y chromosome. Individuals with this karyotype may be tall, but they do not typically exhibit the severe sexual underdevelopment and the other features described, such as rudimentary testes or sparse facial hair. Additionally, individuals with XYY syndrome tend to have normal or slightly lower-than-average intelligence. B. 46, XY: This karyotype is the typical karyotype for males with no chromosomal abnormalities. While individuals with 46, XY might experience some sexual underdevelopment due to other causes such as hormone deficiencies, they would not display the same specific features, such as long limbs and large hands and feet, seen in Klinefelter syndrome. D. 46, X: This karyotype refers to Turner syndrome, a condition in females characterized by a missing or incomplete second X chromosome. Turner syndrome involves short stature, webbed neck, and other physical features, but it does not cause the male-specific symptoms described here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Turner syndrome. Explanation: Streak gonads refer to underdeveloped gonads that are fibrous and do not function as typical ovaries or testes. This condition is characteristic of Turner syndrome, a chromosomal disorder where females have only one functional X chromosome (karyotype 45, X). The absence of the second X chromosome causes the ovaries to fail to develop properly, leading to streak gonads. These individuals typically have primary amenorrhea, short stature, and other features such as webbed neck and shield chest. Incorrect responses: B. Klinefelter’s syndrome: Klinefelter syndrome involves males with an extra X chromosome (karyotype 47, XXY). Males with Klinefelter syndrome usually have normal or underdeveloped testes, but they do not develop streak gonads. Instead, they often have hypogonadism, which results in reduced testosterone production but still have some degree of gonadal function. C. Patau’s syndrome: Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) is a severe genetic condition with multiple physical and intellectual impairments. While individuals with Patau syndrome have multiple birth defects, streak gonads are not a hallmark feature of this condition. D. Down syndrome: Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21. While individuals with Down syndrome may have some degree of gonadal dysfunction, streak gonads are not typically seen in this condition. Down syndrome usually involves intellectual disabilities, characteristic facial features, and other health issues, but the gonads do not undergo the same developmental issue as in Turner syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Turner’s syndrome. Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition where females have only one X chromosome (karyotype 45, X). Since one of the X chromosomes is missing, there is no second X chromosome to form a Barr body. A Barr body is the inactive X chromosome that condenses into a small, dense structure within the nucleus. In Turner syndrome, because there is only one X chromosome, no Barr body is formed, making it absent in these individuals. Incorrect responses: A. Klinefelter’s syndrome: Klinefelter syndrome involves males with an extra X chromosome (karyotype 47, XXY). In individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, the extra X chromosome becomes inactive and forms a Barr body, which can be detected in their cells. Therefore, a Barr body is present in Klinefelter syndrome. C. Super female: A \"super female\" refers to individuals with an extra X chromosome (karyotype 47, XXX). In these individuals, two of the three X chromosomes will form Barr bodies, making the Barr body present in their cells. Hence, a Barr body is found in the \"super female\" syndrome. D. None: This option is incorrect because Turner syndrome is the only condition listed here where a Barr body is absent",

It is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in BRCA1 are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Individuals with mutations in this gene have a higher risk of hereditary breast cancer. The gene plays a key role in DNA repair mechanisms, and when it is mutated, the ability of cells to repair DNA damage is compromised, leading to cancerous growths. Incorrect responses: A. 13: This option refers to BRCA2, another gene associated with familial breast cancer, which is located on chromosome 13. While BRCA2 mutations also increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, it is not the gene mentioned in the question. C. 20: Chromosome 20 is not associated with BRCA1. While there are other genes on chromosome 20 that are involved in various conditions, BRCA1 is located on chromosome 17, not 20.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bloom syndrome. Bloom syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which is involved in the DNA repair process. The mutation leads to a defect in the DNA helicase function, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. This defect increases the frequency of chromosome breaks, leading to a higher susceptibility to cancers and other health issues. Individuals with Bloom syndrome often exhibit features such as short stature, a characteristic \"butterfly\" shaped rash on the face, and an increased risk of developing cancer due to the DNA repair deficiency. Incorrect responses: B. Incontinentia pigmenti: This is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the IKBKG gene, which is involved in the immune system and skin development. It is not primarily associated with DNA repair defects. Incontinentia pigmenti mainly affects the skin, hair, teeth, and nails, leading to characteristic skin rashes and pigmentation changes, but it does not involve DNA repair mechanisms. C. Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells. While it can be caused by various factors, including certain genetic conditions, drugs, and infections, it is not typically classified as a DNA repair defect. Some forms of aplastic anemia, like Fanconi anemia, are linked to defects in DNA repair, but aplastic anemia itself is not a DNA repair disorder by definition. D. Tuberous sclerosis: Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which result in the growth of benign tumors in various organs. While these mutations are involved in cell signaling and growth regulation, they are not primarily linked to a DNA repair defect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) HPLC. Epigenetics involves the study of changes in gene expression or phenotype that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself. These changes are often mediated by modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and changes in chromatin structure. Techniques to study epigenetics focus on detecting and analyzing these modifications. A. ChIP-on-chip: This method is used for studying histone modifications and protein-DNA interactions. It combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to pull down DNA regions associated with specific proteins, followed by hybridization to a microarray (chip). It is commonly used to study epigenetic modifications like histone acetylation or methylation, making it relevant to epigenetics. B. Bisulfite sequencing: This technique is used to analyze DNA methylation, one of the key epigenetic mechanisms. Bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosine residues into uracil, which can then be detected by sequencing. This method is highly relevant to epigenetic research, especially in the study of gene regulation and imprinting. D. Methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes: These enzymes recognize and cut DNA at specific sequences, but their activity is influenced by DNA methylation. They are widely used to detect DNA methylation patterns and study epigenetic changes, particularly in gene regulation. This technique is directly related to epigenetics",

This technique involves staining the chromosomes with a Giemsa dye, which results in a banding pattern that allows for the visualization of individual chromosomes. The light and dark bands seen in the chromosomes help in identifying chromosomal structures and abnormalities, making G-banding the standard procedure for human karyotyping. Incorrect responses: A. C-banding: C-banding is a specific banding technique used to stain the centromeric regions of chromosomes. While it is useful in certain cytogenetic studies, C-banding is not a routine procedure for karyotyping. It is more specialized for studying heterochromatin and centromeric regions. C. Q-banding: Q-banding uses a fluorescent dye (quinacrine) to produce bands on chromosomes. This method is less commonly used than G-banding for routine karyotyping because it is not as well-suited for light microscopy and does not provide as clear a resolution of chromosomal structures in comparison to G-banding. D. Ethidium bromide staining: Ethidium bromide is a fluorescent dye that intercalates with DNA and is primarily used in gel electrophoresis to visualize nucleic acids (e.g., for PCR or DNA fragment analysis). It is not used for routine karyotyping, as it does not provide the necessary banding patterns needed for chromosome identification.",

It is particularly useful in research involving gene expression profiling, mutation detection, and genetic variation analysis. Incorrect responses: B. Study of disease: While microarray technology can be used in disease studies to understand how gene expression changes in response to various conditions, it is not specifically limited to disease study. The primary purpose of a microarray is to assess the expression or variation of many genes, not to study diseases directly. C. Study of organisms: Microarray can be used in organismal studies to analyze genetic variations, but it is more focused on gene expression rather than directly studying entire organisms in terms of their physiology, behavior, or classification.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Metaphase. B. Metaphase: Karyotyping is typically done during the metaphase stage of the cell cycle. During metaphase, chromosomes are highly condensed and aligned at the cell's equatorial plane, making them easier to visualize under a microscope. This is the ideal stage for capturing clear images of chromosomes, as they are most distinct and readily identifiable at this point. Incorrect responses: A. Anaphase: While chromosomes are also visible during anaphase, they are in the process of separating into two sets and are not as well aligned as in metaphase. Anaphase is more focused on chromosome separation, not on the best stage for visualizing their structure and arrangement, which is why it is not typically used for karyotyping. C. Telophase: Telophase is the final phase of cell division, where the chromosomes start to de-condense, and the nuclear membrane begins to reform around the two sets of chromosomes. The chromosomes are less visible and more diffuse in this phase, making it unsuitable for karyotyping. D. S phase: The S phase is when DNA is replicated, but the chromosomes are still in an uncondensed state, and they are not visible in the same way as they are during metaphase. The S phase is crucial for DNA synthesis, but it is not the phase used for karyotyping.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) DNA. The Feulgen reaction is a cytochemical staining technique specifically used to detect and quantify DNA in cells. It involves the hydrolysis of DNA and the subsequent reaction with Schiff's reagent, which produces a magenta-colored complex. This method is specific to DNA, as it selectively binds to aldehyde groups generated from the deoxyribose sugar in DNA. Incorrect responses: A. mRNA: The Feulgen reaction is not used to detect mRNA. While mRNA is a type of nucleic acid, it does not contain the same sugar structure as DNA and does not react with Schiff’s reagent in the same way, making this answer incorrect. B. tRNA: The Feulgen reaction is also not used for detecting tRNA. tRNA molecules are relatively small compared to DNA and do not undergo the same type of chemical reaction in the Feulgen test, so it is not applicable to tRNA. D. All of the above: Since the Feulgen reaction is specific to DNA and does not react with mRNA or tRNA, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome). This patient's presentation—gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and a testicular biopsy showing hyalinized seminiferous tubules with a complete absence of germ cells—is characteristic of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). This genetic disorder occurs in males who have an extra X chromosome (XXY instead of the typical XY). The condition leads to underdeveloped testes, resulting in infertility, low testosterone levels, and secondary sexual characteristics such as gynecomastia. The histologic findings of the seminiferous tubules with sparse Sertoli cells and Leydig cells clumped between hyalinized tubules reflect the testicular changes in Klinefelter syndrome. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Testicular feminization syndrome: Testicular feminization syndrome, also known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), is a disorder where individuals with a male genotype (XY) are resistant to androgens (male sex hormones). This results in female external genitalia despite the presence of testes. The testicular biopsy in AIS would show undescended testes with a lack of spermatogenesis, but the external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics would be female or feminized, which contrasts with the described features in this case. B. Trisomy 18: Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, is a genetic condition characterized by severe developmental delays, growth retardation, heart defects, and other physical anomalies. Although it can cause intellectual disability, it is not typically associated with testicular atrophy or gynecomastia, as seen in this case. C. Trisomy 21: Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome, is a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, and characteristic facial features. It does not typically present with testicular atrophy, hyalinized seminiferous tubules, or gynecomastia. The hallmark features of Down syndrome are distinct, and testicular abnormalities are not a primary concern in this syndrome.",

Hb S is formed by a single nucleotide change in a codon, namely, glutamic acid is replaced by valine in the sixth position in the ? chain of hemoglobin. On deoxygenation, this abnormal hemoglobin polymerizes, the red cells sickle, and symptoms result. Because of the content of Hb A, however, these symptoms are much milder in sickle cell trait than in sickle cell disease. The latter is characterized clinically by the triad of chronic hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and vulnerability to infection. The severe chronic hemolytic anemia leads to chronic hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), which leads to pigmented gallstones. Vascular occlusion results in leg ulcers, renal papillary necrosis, and multiple infarcts, which may cause severe bone pain.

Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to develop benign tumors in various organs, but renal cell carcinoma is not one of the hallmark tumors of this condition. Instead, patients with tuberous sclerosis are more likely to develop renal angiomyolipomas, which are benign tumors made up of fat, blood vessels, and smooth muscle. While individuals with tuberous sclerosis have an increased risk of kidney problems, renal cell carcinoma is not a common or typical feature. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Renal angiomyolipoma: Renal angiomyolipomas are a well-known and common feature of tuberous sclerosis. These benign tumors, often composed of fat, blood vessels, and smooth muscle, can occur in the kidneys of individuals with tuberous sclerosis. They are often detected incidentally on imaging studies and can sometimes cause complications like hemorrhage, but they are not malignant. C. Shagreen patch: A shagreen patch is another characteristic feature of tuberous sclerosis. It is a type of connective tissue hamartoma that typically appears as an orange-peel-like patch of skin, often on the lower back. These patches are frequently observed in individuals with tuberous sclerosis and are considered a dermatologic manifestation of the disorder. D. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a common and characteristic brain tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis. These benign tumors arise in the ventricular system, typically near the foramen of Monro. They are often identified in the MRI of individuals with tuberous sclerosis and can cause symptoms such as hydrocephalus if they obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Transthyretin. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is most commonly caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. Transthyretin is a protein that normally binds and transports thyroxine (T4) and retinol-binding protein. In FAP, mutations in the TTR gene lead to the formation of amyloid fibrils, which deposit in nerves and other tissues, causing progressive sensory and motor polyneuropathy. This is the primary mechanism behind familial amyloid polyneuropathy, making transthyretin the most relevant protein involved. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Abeta-amyloid: Abeta-amyloid is associated with Alzheimer's disease, not familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Abeta-amyloid plaques are formed by the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide fragments, which accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. This is unrelated to the mutation of transthyretin or the polyneuropathy seen in familial amyloidosis. B. Gelsolin: Gelsolin is involved in the regulation of actin filaments in cells. Mutations in gelsolin can cause familial amyloidosis with corneal deposits and other systemic involvement, but it is not the most common cause of familial amyloid polyneuropathy. The TTR mutation is far more prevalent in FAP. C. Prion: Prion proteins are associated with prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and mad cow disease. These diseases involve the misfolding of prion proteins and do not relate to the formation of amyloid fibrils in the context of familial amyloid polyneuropathy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The phenomenon of earlier and more severe manifestations of a disorder in successive generations (anticipation) is a characteristic of many trinucleotide repeat disorders,the best known examples of which are fragile X syndrome and Huntington disease. In the fragile X syndrome, expansion occurs during oogenesis. In Huntington disease, expansion occurs during spermatogenesis. Even though trinucleotide repeats almost always involve guanine and cytosine (G and C), the third nucleotide is different in the two conditions: CGG in fragile X syndrome and CAG in Huntington's disease.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Pathology-4(2).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",
