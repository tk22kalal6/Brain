      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ca (Calcium) Myocardial reperfusion injury is primarily caused by calcium overload in the cells during the restoration of blood flow after ischemia (lack of oxygen). When blood flow is restored, there is a sudden influx of calcium into the cells due to dysfunctional ion channels and impaired calcium handling. This calcium overload leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of proteases, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately causing cellular injury and death. The high intracellular calcium also disrupts cellular homeostasis and contributes to the formation of contraction bands, necrosis, and apoptosis, making calcium a critical factor in reperfusion injury. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Mg (Magnesium): Magnesium is not a primary factor in reperfusion injury. In fact, magnesium often has a protective role in cardiac cells by stabilizing ion channels, reducing calcium overload, and minimizing oxidative stress. Its deficiency can exacerbate ischemia-reperfusion injury, but magnesium itself is not a causative agent. (C) K (Potassium): Potassium levels are disrupted during ischemia and reperfusion, but they are not the primary cause of reperfusion injury. Abnormal potassium handling can lead to arrhythmias, but it does not directly result in the cellular damage seen in reperfusion injury. Potassium imbalances are more of a consequence than a cause in this context. (D) Mn (Manganese): Manganese is a trace element that has antioxidant properties and is a component of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which helps mitigate oxidative stress. It is not involved in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury but may play a protective role against oxidative damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) BAX BAX is a pro-apoptotic gene belonging to the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which regulate programmed cell death (apoptosis). BAX promotes apoptosis by facilitating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), leading to the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. This triggers the activation of caspases, the enzymes responsible for the execution phase of apoptosis. BAX forms oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane, disrupting its integrity, a critical step in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Its activity is antagonistic to anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2 and BCL-XL, making it a central player in apoptosis regulation. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) BCL2: BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic gene that inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane and preventing the release of cytochrome c. It counteracts pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX and promotes cell survival. Thus, it is not pro-apoptotic but rather a key regulator in preventing apoptosis. (C) BCL-XL: Like BCL2, BCL-XL is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. It binds to and inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAX and BAK, preventing them from compromising mitochondrial integrity. Its function is to promote cell survival rather than apoptosis. (D) BIM: BIM is a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, but it acts indirectly. It promotes apoptosis by binding to and neutralizing anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL2 and BCL-XL, allowing pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX and BAK to function. While BIM plays a role in apoptosis, it is not the direct mediator like BAX, which directly disrupts mitochondrial membranes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pro-apoptotic protein SMAC/DIABLO (Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspases/Direct IAP Binding Protein with Low PI) is a pro-apoptotic protein that promotes apoptosis by neutralizing Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). During apoptosis, SMAC/DIABLO is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. IAPs typically bind and inhibit caspases, the enzymes responsible for executing apoptosis. By binding to IAPs, SMAC/DIABLO prevents them from blocking caspase activity, thereby facilitating the apoptotic process. This makes SMAC/DIABLO a key regulator in ensuring that apoptosis progresses efficiently, particularly under conditions where anti-apoptotic mechanisms are upregulated, such as in cancer cells. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Anti-apoptotic protein: SMAC/DIABLO is not anti-apoptotic. Its role is to promote apoptosis by antagonizing anti-apoptotic IAPs. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2 or BCL-XL, work to preserve cell survival by inhibiting pro-apoptotic pathways. SMAC/DIABLO works in opposition to these types of proteins. (B) Induces necrosis: SMAC/DIABLO does not induce necrosis, which is an uncontrolled and non-programmed form of cell death characterized by inflammation and cell rupture. SMAC/DIABLO specifically facilitates programmed cell death (apoptosis) by enhancing caspase activity. It is not associated with necrotic pathways. (C) Acts both as anti- and pro-apoptotic protein: SMAC/DIABLO is strictly a pro-apoptotic protein. It does not have a dual role as both anti- and pro-apoptotic. Its function is solely to promote apoptosis by inhibiting IAPs and enabling caspase activation. Proteins like BCL-2 family members may exhibit dual roles in apoptosis, but SMAC/DIABLO does not.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) BAX BAX is a pro-apoptotic effector protein that directly contributes to the execution of apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). It is not a sensor of apoptosis but an executor. Once activated, BAX oligomerizes in the mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors that activate caspases. BAX does not act as an upstream sensor but as a downstream effector that physically causes cell death, distinguishing it from apoptosis sensors like Puma, Noxa, and BAD. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Puma: Puma (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis) is a BH3-only protein and a sensor of apoptotic signals. It is transcriptionally upregulated by p53 in response to cellular stress, such as DNA damage, and functions by neutralizing anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2 and BCL-XL. This allows pro-apoptotic effectors like BAX and BAK to initiate mitochondrial permeabilization and trigger apoptosis. Thus, Puma acts as a sensor of apoptotic signals, not an effector. (B) Noxa: Noxa is another BH3-only protein and sensor of apoptosis, activated in response to stress signals mediated by p53. Like Puma, Noxa binds to and inhibits anti-apoptotic proteins, facilitating the activation of BAX and BAK. Its role is upstream, sensing cellular stress and helping to commit the cell to apoptosis, classifying it as a sensor. (D) BAD: BAD (Bcl-2-associated death promoter) is also a BH3-only sensor protein. It promotes apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, thereby releasing pro-apoptotic effectors like BAX and BAK. BAD is activated by dephosphorylation and functions as a sensor of apoptotic signals, not as a direct effector.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Autoimmune diseases In autoimmune diseases, defective apoptosis and increased cell survival play a central role. Apoptosis is a crucial mechanism for eliminating self-reactive immune cells during development in the thymus and for removing immune cells after they have fulfilled their function. When apoptosis is defective, self-reactive immune cells persist and may attack the body's own tissues, leading to autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, defective clearance of apoptotic debris can lead to the presentation of self-antigens, perpetuating autoimmunity. This persistence and improper regulation of immune cells and apoptotic material are hallmarks of defective apoptosis in autoimmune diseases. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Neurodegenerative diseases: Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are associated with excessive apoptosis rather than defective apoptosis. In these conditions, neuronal cells undergo premature and uncontrolled apoptosis, leading to progressive loss of neurons and functional deficits. These diseases are linked to increased apoptosis, not increased cell survival, making this option incorrect. (C) Viral infections: In some viral infections, apoptosis may be inhibited as viruses develop strategies to evade the host immune system by blocking apoptotic pathways (e.g., using viral proteins to inhibit caspases or anti-apoptotic proteins). However, this phenomenon is context-specific and not a generalized cause of defective apoptosis leading to increased cell survival. Furthermore, in many cases, apoptosis is actually triggered to eliminate infected cells, so this option is less relevant than autoimmune diseases. (D) Ischemic injury: Ischemic injury, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, is primarily associated with excessive cell death, including both necrosis and apoptosis, rather than defective apoptosis or increased cell survival. In these conditions, apoptosis contributes to the damage caused by oxygen deprivation and reperfusion injury, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Necroptosis Receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 (RIP1) and 3 (RIP3) are key mediators of necroptosis, a regulated form of cell death that combines characteristics of both apoptosis and necrosis. Necroptosis is triggered when apoptosis is inhibited, and it is typically activated by signals such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?). RIP1 and RIP3 form a complex called the necrosome, which activates downstream pathways leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and loss of membrane integrity. Unlike apoptosis, necroptosis is caspase-independent and results in cell lysis, promoting inflammation. RIP1 and RIP3 are essential regulators of this process, making them critical to necroptosis. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Necrosis: Necrosis is an uncontrolled and accidental form of cell death caused by severe injury or trauma. It is not regulated and does not involve specific signaling pathways like RIP1 and RIP3. Necrosis leads to the uncontrolled release of cellular contents and inflammation, but it lacks the regulated processes characteristic of necroptosis, making this option incorrect. (B) Apoptosis: Apoptosis is a regulated form of cell death mediated by caspases, which are not involved in necroptosis. RIP1 and RIP3 do not play a central role in apoptosis, as apoptosis relies on distinct signaling pathways such as those involving caspase-3 and caspase-9. Additionally, apoptosis does not result in the inflammatory outcomes seen in necroptosis, further differentiating the two processes. (D) Pyroptosis: Pyroptosis is a regulated inflammatory form of cell death mediated by gasdermin proteins and caspases, particularly caspase-1 and caspase-11 (or their equivalents). It is triggered by the activation of inflammasomes and is associated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1? and IL-18. RIP1 and RIP3 are not involved in pyroptosis, making this option incorrect.",

The function of the inflammasome is to activate caspase1, (also known as interleukin-1 Beta converting enzyme) which cleaves a precursor form of IL-1 and releases its biologically active form. IL-1 is a mediator of many aspects of inflammation, including leukocyte recruitment and fever. Caspase-1 and, more importantly, the closely related caspase-11 also induce death of the cells. Unlike classical apoptosis, this pathway of cell death is characterized by swelling of cells, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and release of inflammatory mediators.

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (A) Peroxisome Explanation of the Correct Answer: Peroxisomes are specialized organelles involved in the production and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Peroxisomes contain enzymes such as oxidases, which generate H2O2 as a byproduct of various metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of fatty acids and the oxidation of other substrates. To prevent cellular damage from the highly reactive H2O2, peroxisomes also contain the enzyme catalase, which converts H2O2 into water and oxygen. This dual function of producing and detoxifying H2O2 makes peroxisomes critical for cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Lysosome: Lysosomes are involved in intracellular digestion and the breakdown of macromolecules through hydrolytic enzymes like proteases, lipases, and nucleases. They do not produce or detoxify H2O2. Their primary role is in degrading cellular waste, not managing reactive oxygen species like H2O2, making this option incorrect. (C) Golgi body: The Golgi apparatus is responsible for processing, modifying, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or transport to other organelles. It is not involved in the production or detoxification of H2O2. Its functions are related to vesicle trafficking and glycosylation, not oxidative metabolism, so this option is incorrect. (D) Ribosome: Ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis by translating mRNA into polypeptide chains. They do not participate in the production or detoxification of H2O2.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) NADPH oxidase NADPH oxidase is an enzyme responsible for generating free radicals, specifically reactive oxygen species (ROS), rather than removing them. It is primarily involved in the respiratory burst of immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages, where it produces superoxide radicals (O2-) to destroy pathogens. While NADPH oxidase plays a crucial role in innate immunity, it contributes to the formation of free radicals rather than their detoxification. Hence, it is not involved in the removal of free radicals, making it the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Catalase: Catalase is a key enzyme in the detoxification of free radicals. It breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species, into water and oxygen. This reaction prevents the accumulation of H2O2, which can otherwise generate harmful hydroxyl radicals. As an enzyme involved in free radical detoxification, catalase is not the correct answer. (B) Superoxide Dismutase (SOD): Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an essential antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals (O2-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen. This reaction is a critical step in the cellular defense against oxidative stress. Like catalase, SOD removes free radicals and is not the correct answer. (D) Glutathione Peroxidase: Glutathione peroxidase is another antioxidant enzyme that reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, using reduced glutathione as a cofactor. This enzyme plays a significant role in mitigating oxidative stress and removing free radicals, making it an important detoxifier.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Residual bodies Lipofuscin granules are residual bodies, which are indigestible byproducts of cellular metabolism, specifically lysosomal degradation. Lipofuscin is often referred to as the \"wear-and-tear pigment\" because it accumulates over time in long-lived, non-dividing cells such as neurons, cardiac myocytes, and hepatocytes. It is composed of oxidized lipids, proteins, and other cellular materials that result from lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Residual bodies like lipofuscin represent the remnants of autophagic or phagocytic activity that cannot be further degraded. Their accumulation is a hallmark of aging and certain chronic conditions, making them examples of residual bodies. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Apoptotic bodies: Apoptotic bodies are membrane-bound vesicles that form during apoptosis, containing cellular fragments such as nuclear material and cytoplasm. They are phagocytosed and removed by neighboring cells or macrophages. Lipofuscin granules are not associated with apoptosis or apoptotic bodies; they result from long-term metabolic activity rather than cell death, making this option incorrect. (C) Psammomatous calcification: Psammomatous calcification refers to concentric, lamellated calcified structures, often seen in certain tumors like papillary thyroid carcinoma or meningioma. These calcifications have a different origin and structure compared to lipofuscin granules, which do not involve calcification or the deposition of calcium salts. Thus, this option is incorrect. (D) Hyaline change: Hyaline change describes the accumulation of homogenous, glassy, eosinophilic material in cells or tissues, often composed of proteins. Examples include hyaline arteriolosclerosis and intracellular hyaline droplets. Lipofuscin granules are pigmented and granular, not homogenous or proteinaceous like hyaline changes, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Only pathological Apoptosis is not exclusively pathological; it is a physiological process that occurs naturally in healthy tissues as well as in response to disease or damage. Physiological apoptosis is essential for processes such as embryonic development (e.g., digit formation through removal of interdigital webs), immune system regulation (e.g., removal of autoreactive T cells), and maintenance of tissue homeostasis (e.g., elimination of old or damaged cells). Pathological apoptosis, on the other hand, occurs in conditions such as viral infections, ischemic injury, or exposure to toxins. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that apoptosis is only pathological, making this the correct choice for the \"exception.\" Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Cell shrinkage: Cell shrinkage is a hallmark of apoptosis. During apoptosis, the cell decreases in size as its cytoplasm condenses and organelles become tightly packed. This is a distinct feature of apoptosis that differentiates it from necrosis, where cells typically swell and rupture. Thus, this statement is correct and not an exception. (B) Altered orientation of lipids: Apoptosis involves the externalization of phosphatidylserine, a lipid normally confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This alteration in lipid orientation acts as an \"eat-me\" signal, facilitating the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. This feature is a well-documented aspect of apoptosis, making this statement correct. (D) No adjacent inflammation: Apoptosis is a controlled and non-inflammatory process because apoptotic bodies are neatly packaged and phagocytosed without releasing cellular contents into the surrounding environment. This prevents the activation of inflammatory responses, distinguishing apoptosis from necrosis, which triggers inflammation. Therefore, this statement is accurate and not an exception.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The following features characterize necroptosis: Morphologically, and to some extent biochemically, it resembles necrosis, both characterized by loss of ATP, swelling of the cell and organelles, generation of ROS, release of lysosomal enzymes and ultimately rupture of the plasma membrane as discussed earlier. Mechanistically, it is triggered by genetically programmed signal transduction events that culminate in cell death. In this respect it resembles programmed cell death, which is considered the hallmark of apoptosis Because of the duality of these features, necroptosis is sometimes called programmed necrosis to distinguish it from the more usual forms of necrosis driven passively by toxic or anoxic injury to the cell. In sharp contrast to apoptosis, the genetic program that drives necroptosis does not result in caspase activation and hence it is also sometimes referred to as “caspase-independent” programmed cell death.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Atg 5 Atg5 (Autophagy-related gene 5) is a critical component of the autophagy pathway. It plays a key role in the formation of autophagosomes, which are responsible for engulfing and degrading intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the causative agent of tuberculosis. Macrophage-specific deletion of Atg5 disrupts autophagy, impairing the macrophage's ability to control intracellular bacterial growth. This leads to an increased susceptibility to tuberculosis as the bacteria evade the immune response and proliferate within macrophages. Thus, Atg5 is essential for the immune defense against tuberculosis, making it the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Atg 3: Atg3 is an E2-like enzyme involved in the conjugation of Atg8 (LC3) to phosphatidylethanolamine, a critical step in autophagosome formation. While Atg3 is important for autophagy, its macrophage-specific deletion has not been directly linked to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis. This makes it a less relevant option compared to Atg5. (B) Atg 4: Atg4 is a cysteine protease that processes Atg8 (LC3) precursors, allowing them to participate in autophagosome formation. While Atg4 is essential for general autophagy, studies have not identified its macrophage-specific deletion as a direct factor in increased susceptibility to tuberculosis. Therefore, it is not the correct choice. (D) Atg 6: Atg6 is another name for Beclin-1, a key regulator of autophagy. While Beclin-1 is critical for initiating autophagy, its specific role in macrophage-related resistance to tuberculosis has not been emphasized to the same extent as Atg5. Additionally, the question specifically refers to the susceptibility linked to Atg5 deletion, not Beclin-1.",

It involves the activation of caspases and other proteins that require energy for proper function Other options: Apoptosis can be self-initiated through intrinsic pathways (like mitochondrial involvement) or triggered by external signals. Both pathways lead to activation of caspases and other apoptotic machinery Swelling of the cytoplasm is a feature of necrosis, not apoptosis. In apoptosis, the cell typically shrinks and undergoes fragmentation without cytoplasmic swelling In apoptosis, the cell membrane remains largely intact during the early stages. It is the cell's contents that are contained within vesicles, avoiding inflammation. Loss of membrane integrity occurs in necrosis",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lipofuscin Lipofuscin is a pigment that accumulates in cells as a result of free radical injury and oxidative stress. It is primarily composed of oxidized lipids, proteins, and other cellular components. Lipofuscin is often referred to as the \"wear-and-tear\" pigment because it is formed during the breakdown of cellular membranes and organelles, especially in long-lived cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes. The accumulation of lipofuscin is a hallmark of aging and chronic oxidative stress, making it directly linked to free radical injury. While it is not harmful to the cell itself, its presence indicates prior oxidative damage, making it the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (B) Melanin: Melanin is a pigment involved in the protection of tissues from UV radiation and does not play a role in free radical injury. It serves an antioxidant function by scavenging free radicals generated by UV exposure, rather than being a byproduct of free radical damage. Hence, it is not associated with free radical injury in the same way as lipofuscin. (C) Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme metabolism and is primarily involved in the excretion of waste products from red blood cell turnover. While bilirubin has mild antioxidant properties and may scavenge free radicals, it is not a pigment formed as a direct consequence of free radical injury. Its accumulation is related to conditions like jaundice, not oxidative stress. (D) Hematin: Hematin is a pigment derived from hemoglobin breakdown, often seen in conditions involving hemolysis or parasitic infections (e.g., malaria). It is not formed due to free radical injury and has no significant association with oxidative stress or lipid peroxidation, making it an incorrect choice.",

Morphologically, this is demonstrated by cellular swelling, microscopic vacuoles, and lipid vacuoles. Eventually, sufficient cellular injury occurs such that the damage becomes irreversible, resulting in cell death by either necrosis or apoptosis. Irreversible changes of injury resulting in necrosis are characterized by cell membrane disruption, lysosomal rupture, and severe mitochondrial damage.

This pattern of necrosis preserves the tissue architecture for several days, but the cells are eosinophilic and lack nuclei. Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by digestion of the dead cells, resulting in a liquid, viscous mass; this pattern is frequently seen in bacterial infections and CNS infarction.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Liquefactive necrosis. Liquefactive necrosis is most characteristic of abscess formation. In an abscess, bacteria or other pathogens cause tissue injury, leading to inflammation and the accumulation of pus (which consists of dead cells, bacteria, and immune cells). The necrotic tissue in the center of an abscess undergoes liquefaction, a process where the tissue becomes soft, liquid, and purulent. This type of necrosis is common in infections, particularly bacterial infections, and it results in the formation of a localized collection of pus, as seen in the patient's brain abscess. Explanation for the Incorrect Options: A. Caseous necrosis: Caseous necrosis is typically seen in granulomatous infections, such as tuberculosis. The necrotic tissue becomes dry and crumbly with a cheese-like appearance. This is not typically seen in abscess formation in the brain, which is associated with liquefactive necrosis rather than the characteristic appearance of caseous necrosis. B. Coagulative necrosis: Coagulative necrosis is the most common form of necrosis in ischemic injury (e.g., myocardial infarction). It involves the preservation of tissue architecture, although the cells lose their nuclei and eventually undergo breakdown. While coagulative necrosis is a hallmark of ischemia, it is not typically associated with abscesses, which tend to involve liquefactive necrosis. C. Fibrinoid necrosis: Fibrinoid necrosis refers to the deposition of fibrin-like material in blood vessel walls, often seen in immune complex diseases like vasculitis. This type of necrosis is associated with vascular damage and is not characteristic of abscess formation, which involves liquefactive necrosis of infected tissue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pyknosis → Karyorrhexis → Karyolysis The sequence Pyknosis → Karyorrhexis → Karyolysis represents the progressive nuclear changes observed during irreversible cell injury and necrosis. These changes occur as follows: Pyknosis: The nucleus shrinks and becomes dense due to chromatin condensation. This is the earliest nuclear change, marking the onset of irreversible injury. Karyorrhexis: The condensed nucleus fragments into smaller pieces, signifying nuclear breakdown. Karyolysis: The nuclear fragments dissolve as enzymes degrade nuclear DNA and proteins, leading to the complete disappearance of the nucleus. This sequence reflects the gradual dismantling of the nucleus during cell death, making it the correct answer. Explanation of the Incorrect Options: (A) Karyolysis → Pyknosis → Karyorrhexis: This sequence is incorrect because karyolysis is the final stage of nuclear degradation, not the initial step. Nuclear dissolution (karyolysis) occurs after the nucleus undergoes condensation (pyknosis) and fragmentation (karyorrhexis). Starting with karyolysis misrepresents the progression of nuclear changes. (C) Karyorrhexis → Karyolysis → Pyknosis: This sequence is incorrect because karyorrhexis and karyolysis occur after pyknosis, not before. Pyknosis is the first step where the nucleus condenses, followed by fragmentation (karyorrhexis) and dissolution (karyolysis). Reversing this order does not align with the typical progression. (D) Karyolysis → Karyorrhexis → Pyknosis: This sequence is also incorrect because karyolysis is the final step, not the starting point. Nuclear condensation (pyknosis) must occur before fragmentation (karyorrhexis) and dissolution (karyolysis). Reversing the order disrupts the logical sequence of nuclear changes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Efferocytosis is the process in which macrophages or other phagocytic cells engulf and clear apoptotic cells. This is an essential process for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing the release of pro-inflammatory contents from dying cells Other options: Efferocytosis typically prevents inflammation, not activates it. By clearing apoptotic cells, it helps resolve inflammation and tissue damage rather than promoting further immune responses Efferocytosis is a process that occurs in multiple tissues and is not limited to the nervous system. It plays a key role in various organs and systems to maintain cellular homeostasis Efferocytosis does not typically lead to the production of reactive oxygen species. In fact, it helps prevent the release of ROS and other pro-inflammatory mediators by removing dying cells in an anti-inflammatory manner",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Necroptosis does not involve the activation of caspases, which are typically involved in apoptosis. This distinguishes necroptosis from apoptotic cell death, as it occurs through a caspase-independent pathway Other options: MLKL (Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein) is crucial for executing necroptosis. Once phosphorylated by RIPK3, MLKL forms pores in the plasma membrane, leading to cell rupture and death Necroptosis is mediated by the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinases (RIPK1 and RIPK3), which play central roles in initiating the signalling cascade that leads to necroptosis Necroptosis leads to plasma membrane rupture and the release of cellular contents, like necrosis. This results in inflammation due to the leakage of cellular components into the extracellular space",
