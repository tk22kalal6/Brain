CD20 is expressed on the surface of mature B-cells and is absent in plasma cells, making it an essential tool for diagnosing B-cell lymphomas and other B-cell-related conditions. Incorrect Responses: A. CD3: CD3 is a marker for T-cells, which are primarily located in the paracortical areas of the lymph node. It would not highlight the B-cell zones. C. CD56: CD56 is a marker for natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T-cells. It is not specific to B-cells or relevant for the labelled area being referred to. D.

CD20: CD20 is a marker expressed on the surface of B-lymphocytes. It is not a general leukocyte marker but is specific to the B-cell lineage, including mature B-cells and some stages of B-cell development. C. CD19: CD19 is another B-cell-specific marker expressed on early B-cell precursors and mature B-cells. It is not found on other leukocytes and thus does not qualify as a leukocyte common antigen. D. CD41: CD41 is a marker associated with platelets and megakaryocytes. It is also known as the glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) and is involved in platelet aggregation. CD41 is not related to leukocytes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) BCR-ABL1 fusion The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, which results from the t(9;22) translocation, is a characteristic feature of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), not Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). In PMF, the primary genetic abnormalities are mutations in genes such as JAK2, CALR, and MPL, but BCR-ABL1 is not associated with PMF. Therefore, Option B (BCR-ABL1 fusion) is the correct answer as the exception. Incorrect Answers: A. JAK2 mutation: The JAK2 V617F mutation is found in about 50% of patients with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). It is one of the common genetic abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of PMF. C. CALR mutation: The CALR (calreticulin) mutation is another common genetic abnormality seen in about 25-30% of PMF patients. CALR mutations are typically associated with a favorable prognosis in PMF. D. MPL mutation: Mutations in the MPL gene (which encodes the thrombopoietin receptor) are also seen in a subset of PMF patients. These mutations are less common than JAK2 or CALR mutations but are still a recognized feature of PMF.",

This marker is commonly expressed in mast cells, particularly in conditions like Systemic Mastocytosis, a neoplastic disorder involving the abnormal proliferation of mast cells. Incorrect Answers: A. CD20: CD20 is a surface marker typically expressed on B cells, particularly in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, not on mast cells. Therefore, it is not a marker for mast cells. B. CD3: CD3 is a marker for T cells. It is used to identify T lymphocytes, not mast cells. Thus, it is not expressed on neoplastic mast cells. D. CD117: CD117, also known as c-kit, is indeed a marker for mast cells and is expressed in neoplastic mast cells in conditions like mastocytosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CD1a The child’s presentation of scattered skull lesions and a biopsy revealing Langerhans cells strongly suggests a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). CD1a is a hallmark marker of Langerhans cells and is highly specific for this condition. Langerhans cells are specialized dendritic cells that express CD1a on their surface, and its presence is used to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, the detection of Birbeck granules via electron microscopy, which are characteristic of LCH, correlates with the expression of CD1a. Why the other options are incorrect: (B) CD57: CD57 is a marker associated with natural killer (NK) cells and subsets of T-cells. It is not expressed on Langerhans cells and has no diagnostic utility in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, making this option incorrect. (C) CD3: CD3 is a marker found on T-lymphocytes and is used to identify T-cell lineage in hematological malignancies or immune studies. Since Langerhans cells are not of T-cell origin, CD3 is not expressed in LCH and is irrelevant in this context. (D) CD68: CD68 is a marker of macrophages and monocytes and is expressed in many histiocytic disorders. While Langerhans cells may weakly express CD68, it is not specific to LCH and cannot be used as a definitive diagnostic marker. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Langerhans cells Birbeck granules are characteristic cytoplasmic organelles found in Langerhans cells, which are specialized antigen-presenting dendritic cells primarily found in the skin and mucosa. These granules are rod- or tennis racket-shaped structures seen under electron microscopy and are thought to play a role in antigen processing and presentation. Their presence is a hallmark feature of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and helps in confirming the diagnosis. Birbeck granules are unique to Langerhans cells, making this the correct answer. Why the other options are incorrect: (A) Mast cells: Mast cells are immune cells involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. They contain granules rich in histamine and other mediators, but they do not contain Birbeck granules. Mast cell granules are typically involved in degranulation during allergic reactions, and their structure is distinct from that of Birbeck granules. (C) Thrombocytes (platelets): Thrombocytes are involved in blood clotting and hemostasis. They are small anucleate cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes and contain dense granules and alpha granules, but not Birbeck granules. Their granules are associated with clotting factors, not antigen processing. (D) Myelocytes: Myelocytes are immature granulocytic precursors found in the bone marrow during granulopoiesis. They contain primary and secondary granules characteristic of granulocytes, but they do not possess Birbeck granules. These granules are unrelated to the antigen-presenting functions of Langerhans cells.",

CD1a is expressed on the surface of Langerhans cells, which are specialized antigen-presenting dendritic cells involved in histiocytic disorders. The detection of CD1a through immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry is a critical diagnostic tool in confirming LCH. Additionally, CD1a expression correlates with other hallmark findings in LCH, such as the presence of Birbeck granules, further emphasizing its diagnostic importance. Why the other options are incorrect: (B) CD1b: CD1b is another member of the CD1 family of glycoproteins involved in antigen presentation. However, it is not specific to Langerhans cells or histiocytosis and is instead expressed on other types of antigen-presenting cells. It is not a diagnostic marker for LCH, making it less relevant in this context. (C) CD1c: CD1c is also part of the CD1 family and plays a role in presenting antigens to T-cells. However, like CD1b, it is not specific to Langerhans cells and is not typically used as a diagnostic marker for histiocytosis. Its role in LCH diagnosis is minimal. (D) CD1d: CD1d is involved in the presentation of lipid and glycolipid antigens to natural killer T (NKT) cells.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum in neutrophils Döhle bodies are light blue, oval to rod-shaped inclusions seen in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, particularly during infections, inflammation, or other stress responses (e.g., sepsis, burns). They represent aggregates of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) containing RNA. These structures indicate the active protein synthesis associated with a heightened inflammatory state. Döhle bodies are often accompanied by toxic granulation and cytoplasmic vacuolization, further reflecting neutrophil activation. Why the other options are incorrect: (B) Mitochondria: Mitochondria are involved in energy production and cellular respiration, and while they are present in neutrophils, they do not form Döhle bodies. Döhle bodies are specific to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, not mitochondria, making this option incorrect. (C) Golgi apparatus: The Golgi apparatus is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins for secretion or use within the cell. While it plays a critical role in neutrophil function, it does not form Döhle bodies. The Golgi apparatus typically appears as a clear area near the nucleus in neutrophils and does not contribute to the characteristic blue inclusions. (D) Lysosomes: Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles involved in intracellular digestion and contain hydrolytic enzymes. In neutrophils, they are a component of azurophilic granules, which are involved in pathogen destruction. However, they are not associated with the formation of Döhle bodies and do not appear as light blue cytoplasmic inclusions.",
