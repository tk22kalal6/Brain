      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 5 days Platelets are typically stored at a temperature range of 22-25°C with continuous agitation to maintain their viability. The recommended storage duration for platelets under these conditions is 5 days. Agitation helps to prevent clumping and maintains the platelets in a usable state, ensuring that they are functional for transfusion purposes. Beyond this period, platelet functionality begins to decline, and they may no longer be effective for clinical use. Incorrect Responses: B. 7 days: While some platelet storage systems might aim to extend the shelf life, the standard maximum storage period for platelets at 22-25°C with agitation is 5 days. Storing for 7 days would not maintain the necessary quality for transfusion. C. 21 days: 21 days is the typical storage time for red blood cells, not platelets. Red blood cells are stored at 2-6°C, which preserves their integrity for a much longer period, but platelets require higher temperatures and agitation, which limits their storage to 5 days. D. 35 days: 35 days is far beyond the typical storage limit for platelets. Platelets have a much shorter shelf life compared to other blood products like red blood cells and plasma, and they cannot remain viable for this length of time.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) O +ve AB +ve Fresh Frozen Plasma • FFP is plasma prepared from whole blood, either from the primary centrifugation of whole blood into red cells and plasma or from a secondary centrifugation of platelet rich plasma. • The plasma is rapidly frozen to –25°C or colder within 8 hours of collection and contains normal plasma levels of stable clotting factors, albumin, immunoglobulin and • Factor VIII at a level of at least 70% of normal fresh plasma. • Should be ABO compatible. Universal Plasma Donor • Plasma components should be compatible with the ABO group of the recipient to avoid potential haemolysis caused by donor anti-A or anti-B. • Group AB individuals have neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies in their plasma. Group AB plasma can therefore be given to patients of any ABO blood group and is often referred to as the universal plasma donor<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/783889910K5.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Now we will look at the platelets. • If you have a place to store platelets, platelets can be transfused without agitation in room temperature upto 24 hours. • Seeing the options, the it seems there is a facility to store platelets. • So PC will be the second to be transfused. In a setting where you don’t have storing option (like hospital ward), platelets should be transfused first for concern of bacterial contamination (since two options in the above questions are about storing platelets we presume there is a facility to store platelets)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 4 hours Any transfusion should be completed within 4 hours of initiation to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and contamination. Once blood products are transfused, they are kept at room temperature, which allows any bacteria present to proliferate. Transfusing within 4 hours minimizes the risk of complications like transfusion-associated bacterial infections. This time frame is the standard recommended by most blood banks and medical institutions to ensure patient safety. Incorrect Responses: B. 6 hours: A transfusion completed after 6 hours exceeds the safe window and can pose a risk of bacterial contamination. Blood products are typically only safe for up to 4 hours at room temperature, and extending this to 6 hours is not advisable. C. 8 hours: 8 hours is even further beyond the recommended limit. After this time, the risk of complications such as bacterial growth increases significantly. Transfusion should not be carried out after such a long period, and this time frame is not within the safe guidelines. D. 10 hours: 10 hours is far too long for a transfusion to be considered safe. After 4 hours, blood products should be discarded if not used, as they could pose serious health risks to the patient. There is no clinical reason to extend transfusion to 10 hours.",

The major blood groups of this system are A, B, AB, and O. 0 type RBCs lack A or B antigens. These antigens are carbohydrates attached to a precursor backbone, may be found on the cellular membrane either as glycosphingolipids or glycoproteins, and are secreted into plasma and body fluids as glycoproteins. H substance is the immediate precursor on which the A and B antigens are added. This H substance is formed by the addition of fucose to the glycolipid or glycoprotein backbone. The subsequent addition of N-acetylgalactosamine creates the A antigen, whereas the addition of galactose produces the B antigen. The genes that determine the A and B phenotypes are found on chromosome 9q and are expressed in a Mendelian codominant manner. The gene products are glycosyl transferases, which confer the enzymatic capability of attaching the specific antigenic carbohydrate Individuals who lack the “A” and “B” transferases are phenotypically type “0,” whereas those who inherit both transferases are type “AB.” Rare individuals lack the H gene, which codes for fucose transferase, and cannot form H substance.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 48 hours The recommended interval between two apheresis procedures is 48 hours. This time frame allows the donor's body to replenish the components that were removed during the apheresis. The 48-hour period ensures that the donor is able to safely donate again without putting their health at risk. This guideline is typically followed for platelet apheresis, where the body's platelet count needs to recover adequately. Incorrect Responses: B. 6 weeks: 6 weeks is typically the minimum interval between whole blood donations, not apheresis. For platelet apheresis, the recovery time required is much shorter—usually 48 hours—because only specific components (platelets) are collected, and the body’s ability to recover is quicker than after whole blood donations. C. 12 weeks: 12 weeks is the recommended interval for whole blood donations, not apheresis. In the case of apheresis, the required time for recovery is shorter, as the donation process only removes certain components (e.g., platelets or plasma), and the body can regenerate these faster compared to whole blood. D. 20 weeks: A 20-week interval is unnecessarily long for apheresis. For platelet donation via apheresis, a 48-hour interval is sufficient. This long period is more appropriate for situations like donating whole blood or for certain other components, but not for the apheresis procedures where the body recovers faster.",

CPDA is a commonly used preservative solution that helps maintain the viability and function of RBCs during storage. The addition of adenine in CPDA helps extend the storage period by providing a source of energy for the red blood cells, thus prolonging their shelf life to 35 days. Incorrect Responses: A. 21 days: RBCs stored in CPDA have a shelf life of 35 days, not 21 days. While 21 days is the shelf life of RBCs stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) solution (without adenine), the addition of adenine extends the shelf life by an additional 14 days. Therefore, 21 days is not correct for RBCs in CPDA. B. 28 days: 28 days is not the correct shelf life for RBCs stored in CPDA. It is closer to the shelf life of RBCs stored in a solution called CPD-SAG (Citrate Phosphate Dextrose with Saline and Adenine Glucose), but in CPDA, RBCs are viable for up to 35 days, not 28 days. D. 42 days: The shelf life of 42 days is typically seen in RBCs stored in additive solutions like SAG-M (saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol), which are not the same as CPDA. While RBCs stored in these newer solutions can last up to 42 days, CPDA specifically allows for 35 days of storage, not 42.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 60 minutes Platelet transfusions should be completed within 60 minutes of initiation. This is because platelets are stored at room temperature (20-24°C) and are susceptible to bacterial contamination if kept for longer periods. To minimize the risk of bacterial growth and ensure the safety and efficacy of the transfusion, platelet transfusions are recommended to be completed within 1 hour. Incorrect Responses: B. 4 hours: While 4 hours might be a reasonable duration for some transfusion types, platelets are more prone to contamination at room temperature. Therefore, transfusions should not exceed 60 minutes, as a 4-hour window increases the risk of bacterial growth and a decrease in platelet functionality. C. 6 hours: A 6-hour duration is too long for a platelet transfusion. As mentioned, platelets are stored at room temperature and should be transfused as soon as possible, ideally within 1 hour. Extending the transfusion time increases the risk of complications like bacterial infection. D. 8 hours: Similar to the 4-hour and 6-hour options, 8 hours is much too long for platelet transfusions. Prolonged exposure to room temperature for this length of time is unsafe and can lead to a higher risk of bacterial contamination and platelet dysfunction",
