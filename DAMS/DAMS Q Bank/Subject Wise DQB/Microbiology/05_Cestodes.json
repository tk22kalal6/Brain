      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Larval invasion does not occur in beef tapeworm infection. In beef tapeworm (Taenia saginata) infection, the larvae (cysticerci) do not invade tissues like they do in pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) infection. Pork tapeworms can cause cysticercosis, where the larvae form cysts in various tissues, including the brain, eyes, and muscles, leading to serious complications such as neurocysticercosis. In contrast, beef tapeworm infections typically remain confined to the intestines, causing fewer and less severe complications. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Acute intestinal obstruction is less common in beef tapeworm infection – (Incorrect) While intestinal obstruction can occur in both beef and pork tapeworm infections, it is not the primary reason why beef tapeworm infection is considered less serious. Acute obstruction is more commonly associated with heavier parasitic loads and can occur in both types of infections, though it is not the distinguishing factor between the two. B. Beef tapeworm eggs cause less irritation of the mucosa of the digestive tract – (Incorrect) The irritation caused by tapeworm eggs is generally not the main concern in beef tapeworm infections. The main reason beef tapeworm infections are considered less serious is the lack of larval tissue invasion, rather than the irritation caused by eggs. Both types of tapeworms can irritate the intestinal mucosa, but this is not a key differentiating factor. D. The adult beef tapeworms are smaller in size – (Incorrect) While beef tapeworms (Taenia saginata) are typically larger than pork tapeworms (Taenia solium), the size difference does not explain the difference in the seriousness of infection. The serious complications of pork tapeworm infections are due to larval tissue invasion, not the size of the adult worms. E. Toxic by-products are not given off by adult beef tapeworm – (Incorrect) Both beef and pork tapeworms may produce toxins, but these are not the main reason why beef tapeworm infections are less serious than pork tapeworm infections. The larval invasion of pork tapeworms is the critical factor that makes their infections more dangerous.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infection with fish tapeworm. The most likely cause of the medical technologist's anemia and low vitamin B12 levels is infection with the fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum. This tapeworm is often acquired by consuming raw or undercooked fish, which matches the technologist’s travel and dietary history. Diphyllobothrium latum can lead to megaloblastic anemia by competing for vitamin B12 in the intestines. This results in B12 deficiency, which is commonly associated with anemia and neurological symptoms. The infection can persist for months or even years, leading to chronic deficiency of this vital vitamin. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Cysticercosis – (Incorrect) Cysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and is typically acquired through ingestion of undercooked pork containing the larvae. This infection can cause symptoms such as neurological problems, but it is not associated with vitamin B12 deficiency or anemia. The technologist’s raw fish consumption makes cysticercosis an unlikely diagnosis. C. Infection with Parvovirus B19 – (Incorrect) Parvovirus B19 can cause anemia, particularly in individuals with chronic hemolytic conditions. However, it does not cause vitamin B12 deficiency or the symptoms associated with it. There is no link between Parvovirus B19 infection and raw fish consumption or megaloblastic anemia. D. Infection with Yersinia – (Incorrect) Yersinia infections, particularly those caused by Yersinia enterocolitica, can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and sometimes bacteremia, but they are not typically associated with anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency. There is no clear association between Yersinia and the clinical presentation described, and it is not related to raw fish consumption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cerebral cysticercosis. Cerebral cysticercosis is a common cause of solitary calcified lesions in the brain, particularly in individuals who have a history of exposure to Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) or live in areas where this infection is endemic. The infection occurs when a person ingests the tapeworm eggs, which then develop into larvae that migrate to the brain, forming cysts. Over time, these cysts can calcify, which is often seen on imaging, like a CAT scan. Seizures are a common clinical manifestation in individuals with cysticercosis, and this patient’s presentation of seizures with a calcified brain lesion is highly suggestive of this condition. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Central nervous system coccidioidomycosis – (Incorrect) Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides species, which primarily affects the lungs but can also disseminate to other organs, including the brain. While it can cause granulomatous lesions in the brain, it is less likely to present as a solitary calcified lesion in a previously healthy individual. The calcified appearance on the CAT scan makes cysticercosis a more probable diagnosis. C. Cerebral echinococcosis – (Incorrect) Cerebral echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus species, is typically associated with hydatid cysts, which are often larger, cystic lesions in the brain. These cysts are not commonly calcified in the early stages, and the patient's presentation of a solitary calcified lesion does not fit the typical presentation of echinococcosis, which usually involves multi-organ involvement and larger cysts. D. Extraintestinal amebiasis – (Incorrect) Extraintestinal amebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, can lead to abscess formation in various organs, including the liver, lungs, and brain. However, it is not typically associated with calcified lesions. The cystic or abscess-like lesions caused by amebiasis are usually more fluid-filled rather than calcified. Additionally, extraintestinal amebiasis is less likely to present as a solitary calcified lesion in the brain.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Beef. Taenia saginata, commonly known as the beef tapeworm, is transmitted to humans through the ingestion of undercooked or raw beef that contains cysticerci (larval forms of the parasite). When a person consumes the infected beef, the cysticerci are able to develop into adult tapeworms in the intestines. Beef is the primary source of infection for Taenia saginata, making this the correct answer. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Pork – (Incorrect) The pork tapeworm, or Taenia solium, is responsible for infections transmitted by eating undercooked or raw pork. This parasite is different from Taenia saginata, which specifically infects humans through beef consumption. Therefore, pork is not the correct source for Taenia saginata. C. Lamb – (Incorrect) Lamb is not a typical source of Taenia saginata infection. The primary hosts for Taenia saginata are cattle (beef). Lamb may host other types of parasites, but Taenia saginata does not typically come from eating lamb. D. Fish – (Incorrect) Fish can harbor other parasitic infections, such as those caused by Diphyllobothrium (fish tapeworms), but Taenia saginata is not one of them. This parasite is transmitted through beef, not fish.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cysticercosis. B. Cysticercosis – (Correct) Cysticercosis is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in India. It is caused by the larval form of the tapeworm Taenia solium. When humans ingest Taenia solium eggs (often through contaminated food or water), the larvae can migrate to various tissues, including the brain, where they form cysts. These cysts, known as neurocysticercosis, can cause seizures, hydrocephalus, and other neurological symptoms. Cysticercosis is particularly prevalent in countries with poor sanitation and is the leading cause of epilepsy in many parts of India. A. Schistosomiasis – (Incorrect) Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma species. The infection primarily affects the liver, intestines, and bladder. Although Schistosoma can cause CNS involvement in rare cases (such as schistosomal myelopathy), it is not the most common parasitic infection affecting the CNS in India. Schistosomiasis is more common in tropical and subtropical regions but not as prevalent as cysticercosis in India. C. Trichinella spiralis – (Incorrect) Trichinella spiralis is a parasitic roundworm that causes trichinosis, typically acquired by consuming undercooked pork or wild game meat. The larvae of Trichinella spiralis can migrate to the muscles and, rarely, the CNS. However, trichinosis is not a common cause of CNS infection in India and is much less frequent compared to cysticercosis. D. Hydatid cyst – (Incorrect) Hydatid cyst disease is caused by Echinococcus granulosus or Echinococcus multilocularis. The infection typically involves the liver and lungs, but cysts can occasionally affect the CNS, particularly the brain. While hydatid disease is a concern in parts of India, it is much less common than cysticercosis as a cause of CNS infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Brain parenchyma. A. Brain parenchyma – (Correct) Neurocysticercosis caused by the larval form of Taenia solium most commonly affects the brain parenchyma. The larvae, after being ingested, migrate and form cysts in the brain tissue, leading to the development of neurocysticercosis. These cysts can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, such as seizures, headaches, and hydrocephalus. The brain parenchyma is the most common site of cyst formation because it is the primary target for the larvae once they enter the bloodstream and migrate. B. Subarachnoid space – (Incorrect) Although cysts can occasionally be found in the subarachnoid space, this location is much less common compared to the brain parenchyma. In the subarachnoid space, cysts can lead to meningeal inflammation and hydrocephalus, but these instances are less frequent than those affecting the brain parenchyma itself. Brain parenchyma is the preferred site for cysticercosis, as the cysts are typically found embedded in the neural tissue. C. Spinal cord – (Incorrect) While spinal cord involvement in neurocysticercosis can occur, it is much rarer. The spinal cord is not a common location for the cysts to form. When they do affect the spine, the cysts usually cause symptoms like back pain, weakness, or paralysis, but these cases are less frequent compared to brain parenchyma involvement. D. Orbit – (Incorrect) Although orbital involvement is a possibility in neurocysticercosis, it is an extremely rare occurrence. Cysts are much more likely to be found in the brain or spinal cord than in the orbit, which is an unusual location for the parasite to lodge.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (C) T. solium. Explanation: T. solium (Taenia solium), commonly known as the pork tapeworm, has pigs as its primary reservoir host. Pigs ingest the eggs of T. solium from contaminated food or water, and the eggs hatch into larvae that develop into cysts (cysticerci) in the pig's muscles. Humans become infected by eating undercooked or raw pork containing these cysts. In addition to being the reservoir, pigs also play a critical role in the transmission of T. solium to humans. Incorrect responses: B. T. saginata: The reservoir host for T. saginata (the beef tapeworm) is cattle, not pigs. Cattle ingest T. saginata eggs from contaminated environments, and the larvae develop into cysts (cysticerci) in the muscles, which humans can acquire by consuming undercooked beef. C. Trichinella spiralis: Pigs can be a reservoir for Trichinella spiralis, which causes trichinosis, but they are not the only reservoir. Other animals like wild boars, bears, and rodents can also be reservoirs. Humans become infected by consuming undercooked meat containing the encysted larvae. D. Ancylostoma: Ancylostoma species, such as Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, are hookworms, and they do not have pigs as a reservoir. These hookworms infect humans directly, typically through contact with soil contaminated with their larvae, which penetrate the skin of the host.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (D) (E) Paragonimus westermanii, D. Echinococcus granulosus, and E. Echinococcus multilocularis. Explanation: B. Paragonimus westermanii: This is the correct answer because Paragonimus westermanii, also known as the oriental lung fluke, is a parasitic trematode that causes pulmonary infestation. Infection occurs when humans ingest contaminated crustaceans, and the larvae migrate to the lungs, where they mature and cause symptoms like chronic cough and hemoptysis. D. Echinococcus granulosus: This is correct as well. Echinococcus granulosus, the causative agent of hydatid disease, can form cysts in the lungs, liver, and other organs. When the cysts are in the lungs, they can cause respiratory issues, coughing, and chest pain. Humans become infected by ingesting the eggs from dog feces. E. Echinococcus multilocularis: Similarly, Echinococcus multilocularis can lead to alveolar echinococcosis, which primarily affects the liver but may also involve the lungs. It forms multilocular cysts, which can spread to the lungs and other organs. Infection occurs through the ingestion of eggs from canine feces. Incorrect responses: A. H. nana: Hymenolepis nana is a type of tapeworm that typically infects the intestines rather than the lungs. It is not associated with lung infestations. C. Taenia saginata: Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm, also does not cause lung infestation. It resides in the human intestine, causing intestinal issues, and its larvae are usually found in muscle tissues (not lungs) after consumption of undercooked beef.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hymenolepis diminuta Hymenolepis diminuta, also known as the rat tapeworm, is a cestode parasite that occasionally infects humans. It is commonly found in rodents but can be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of contaminated food or water containing infected arthropods (beetles, fleas, or grain weevils). The diagnosis of Hymenolepis diminuta is based on the identification of its characteristic eggs in stool samples. These eggs: Measure 70–85 µm in diameter, aligning with the reported size (~75 µm). Have a round to oval shape with a thick outer shell. Lack polar filaments (which distinguishes them from Hymenolepis nana eggs). Contain an oncosphere (larval stage) with hooklets in the center. Since the screening program detected these eggs in low numbers, it is consistent with Hymenolepis diminuta infection, which is less common than Hymenolepis nana. Incorrect Answers: A. Acanthamoeba Acanthamoeba is a free-living amoeba associated with keratitis (eye infections) and granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) rather than intestinal infections. It is diagnosed through corneal scrapings or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, not fecal examination. The size does not match—Acanthamoeba cysts are typically 10–25 µm, much smaller than the 75 µm objects observed in this case. B. Babesia Babesia is a protozoan parasite that infects red blood cells, causing Babesiosis, a malaria-like illness transmitted by ticks (Ixodes species). It is diagnosed through blood smears, not stool samples. Babesia trophozoites appear as ring forms inside RBCs and are much smaller (~1–5 µm) compared to the 75 µm structures observed. C. Entamoeba coli Entamoeba coli is a non-pathogenic intestinal amoeba found in stool samples of individuals with poor hygiene but does not cause disease. The cysts of E. coli measure 15–35 µm, much smaller than the reported 75 µm objects. Cysts are multinucleated (up to 8 nuclei), whereas Hymenolepis diminuta eggs contain an oncosphere with hooklets.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Taenia saginata: This 42-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain and stool containing small structures resembling rice grains, which are later identified as proglottids on microscopic examination. Additionally, the presence of characteristic parasite eggs suggests a tapeworm infection, with Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) being the most likely cause. Taenia saginata is a cestode (tapeworm) transmitted through the ingestion of raw or undercooked beef containing cysticerci (larval stage of the parasite). The adult tapeworm resides in the human intestine and releases proglottids, which contain eggs and can be visible in stool, often appearing as flat, white, rice-like segments. Patients typically present with: Mild abdominal discomfort or pain Nausea, diarrhea, or bloating (though many infections are asymptomatic) Proglottids in stool, which may move actively No significant eosinophilia, as the adult worm remains in the intestine without systemic migration Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of stool for eggs and proglottids, and treatment involves praziquantel or niclosamide. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Ascaris lumbricoides (Roundworm) Ascaris lumbricoides is a large, round nematode that causes intestinal obstruction and eosinophilia, but it does not produce proglottids. Its eggs are round and thick-walled and are seen in stool, but no visible segments resembling rice grains are passed in feces. Unlike Taenia, Ascaris larvae migrate through the lungs, causing transient pulmonary symptoms (Löffler’s syndrome), which is not present here. Option B: Enterobius vermicularis (Pinworm) Enterobius vermicularis causes enterobiasis (pinworm infection), which primarily presents with perianal itching at night, not abdominal pain or proglottids in stool. Eggs are detected via the scotch tape test around the perianal area rather than in stool samples. Pinworms do not release proglottids into the stool. Option C: Necator americanus (Hookworm) Necator americanus (a type of hookworm) is a small, thread-like nematode that causes iron-deficiency anemia due to blood loss from intestinal attachment. It does not produce proglottids or large, visible structures in stool. Hookworm infections primarily cause chronic fatigue and anemia rather than the presence of rice-like segments in feces.",
