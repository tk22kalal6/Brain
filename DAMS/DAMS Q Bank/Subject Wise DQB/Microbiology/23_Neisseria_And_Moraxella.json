      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Gonococcus. Bartholinitis is an infection of the Bartholin's glands, which are located on either side of the vaginal opening and secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina. The most common causative agent of Bartholinitis is Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus), the bacterium responsible for gonorrhea. When the duct of the Bartholin's gland becomes obstructed, it can lead to infection, resulting in painful swelling, abscess formation, and discharge. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection, and gonococcal infection is the leading cause of Bartholinitis. Explanation of Other Options: (A) Trichomonas – (Incorrect) Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that causes trichomoniasis, a common sexually transmitted infection. While it can cause vaginal discharge, irritation, and painful urination, it is not the typical cause of Bartholinitis. Although Trichomonas can infect the vaginal mucosa, it does not commonly lead to Bartholin gland infection or abscesses. (B) Candida – (Incorrect) Candida albicans is a fungus that can cause vaginal candidiasis, often leading to itching, discharge, and irritation. However, it is not a typical cause of Bartholinitis. Fungal infections can occasionally involve the Bartholin's glands, but this is far less common than gonococcal infection. (C) Staphylococcus – (Incorrect) Staphylococcus aureus, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), can cause a wide range of infections, including skin abscesses, boils, and mastitis. While it can cause abscesses in various parts of the body, including the genital area, it is not the most common cause of Bartholinitis. Gonococcus is more frequently implicated in this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The differentiation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis is primarily based on their carbohydrate fermentation patterns. Both species ferment glucose, but only Neisseria meningitidis can ferment maltose. This characteristic is used as a key biochemical test in the laboratory to distinguish between the two. Neisseria gonorrhoeae ferments glucose only, whereas Neisseria meningitidis ferments both glucose and maltose. Thus, maltose fermentation (B) is the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Glucose fermentation: Both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis ferment glucose, so this test cannot differentiate between the two species. (C) Voges-Proskauer (V.P.) reaction: The Voges-Proskauer test detects acetoin production, which is not relevant for differentiating Neisseria species. Both N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis are negative for this test. (D) Indole test: The indole test detects the ability to break down tryptophan into indole. However, Neisseria species do not produce indole, making this test irrelevant for differentiation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Neisseria infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, are strongly associated with deficiencies in the late complement components (C5-C9). These components form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which plays a crucial role in killing Gram-negative bacteria, especially encapsulated Neisseria species. Individuals with late complement deficiency (C5-C9) are unable to effectively form the MAC, leading to an increased susceptibility to recurrent Neisseria infections, particularly meningococcal sepsis and meningitis. Thus, the correct answer is (B) Deficiency of late complements. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Deficiency of early complements: The early complement components (C1-C4) are primarily involved in opsonization and immune complex clearance. While their deficiency can increase susceptibility to certain infections (e.g., autoimmune disorders and encapsulated bacteria like pneumococcus), they are not specifically associated with Neisseria infections. (C) There is no such association: This statement is incorrect because numerous studies have shown a strong link between late complement deficiencies and increased risk of Neisseria infections. Individuals with C5-C9 deficiency have a significantly higher rate of recurrent infections with Neisseria species. (D) Any deficiency can be associated: While complement deficiencies can affect the immune system in various ways, Neisseria infections are specifically linked to late complement (C5-C9) deficiencies. Other complement deficiencies do not show the same strong correlation with Neisseria infections.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Meningococci (Neisseria meningitidis) differ from gonococci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) primarily in that meningococci possess a polysaccharide capsule, which is a major virulence factor. This capsule helps N. meningitidis evade phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing, allowing it to spread systemically and cause severe diseases such as meningitis and meningococcemia. The capsule also serves as the basis for serogroup classification and is a target for vaccines. In contrast, N. gonorrhoeae lacks a capsule, which limits its ability to cause invasive bloodstream infections. Thus, the correct answer is (B) Possess a capsule. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Are intracellular: Both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are facultatively intracellular and can survive within neutrophils. This trait allows them to evade immune responses, but it is not a distinguishing feature between the two species. (C) Cause fermentation of glucose: Both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae ferment glucose, so this characteristic cannot differentiate them. However, only N. meningitidis can ferment maltose, which is a key distinguishing feature, but maltose fermentation is not an option in this question. (D) Are oxidase positive: Both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are oxidase positive, meaning they produce cytochrome c oxidase, which turns the reagent tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine deep purple in an oxidase test. Since this property is shared, it does not differentiate the two species.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (WFS) is a severe, life-threatening condition characterized by bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ failure. It is most commonly associated with Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal sepsis). The endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide) produced by N. meningitidis triggers a massive inflammatory response, leading to widespread vascular damage, adrenal gland necrosis, and circulatory collapse. Patients present with fever, purpura fulminans, hypotension, and adrenal insufficiency. Due to its strong association with meningococcal infections, the correct answer is (B) N. meningitidis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Pneumococcus: Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, but it is not a common cause of Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. While pneumococcal infections can lead to severe systemic complications, they do not typically result in adrenal hemorrhage. (C) Pseudomonas: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and burn wound infections. However, it does not cause Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, as it lacks the same endotoxin-mediated vascular damage seen with N. meningitidis. (D) Yersinia: Yersinia pestis causes plague, and Yersinia enterocolitica can cause gastroenteritis and sepsis, but neither is a common cause of adrenal hemorrhage. While Yersinia infections can be severe, they do not have the same strong association with WFS as Neisseria meningitidis.",

      "solution": "Correct answer (D) With a combination of ceftriaxone and doxycycline. This patient presents with urethral discharge and dysuria, which are classic symptoms of urethritis. The Gram stain of the urethral discharge shows intracellular and extracellular Gram-negative diplococci, which is highly suggestive of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin that is highly effective against N. gonorrhoeae, administered as a single intramuscular (IM) dose. However, due to the high rate of co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, which is frequently asymptomatic and not detected on Gram stain, doxycycline (or azithromycin) is added to cover chlamydial infections. Dual therapy is the standard approach recommended by the CDC and WHO to prevent resistance and ensure both infections are treated. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) No treatment is necessary: This is incorrect because gonorrhea is a serious sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, epididymitis in men, and disseminated gonococcal infection if left untreated. Additionally, untreated gonorrhea facilitates the spread of infection to sexual partners. (B) With a tetracycline-based antibiotic such as doxycycline: While doxycycline is used to treat Chlamydia trachomatis, it is not effective as monotherapy for gonorrhea. N. gonorrhoeae has developed high levels of resistance to tetracyclines, and using doxycycline alone would not adequately treat the gonococcal infection. (C) With a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic such as ceftriaxone: While ceftriaxone is the preferred treatment for gonorrhea, monotherapy is not recommended because chlamydial co-infection is common (seen in about 20–40% of gonorrhea cases). Without doxycycline or azithromycin, an undiagnosed chlamydial infection could persist, leading to complications and further transmission.",

The presence of gram-negative diplococci with neutrophils in a urethral exudate is highly suggestive of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, which causes gonorrhea. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as it has excellent activity against this pathogen. It is typically used as part of empiric treatment for gonorrhea due to its broad-spectrum activity and ability to cover gonococcal infections, including urethritis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Gentamicin: While gentamicin is an aminoglycoside with activity against a broad range of gram-negative bacteria, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for gonorrhea. It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics, but it is not as effective as ceftriaxone for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. (C) Penicillin G: Penicillin G is not recommended for treating gonorrhea due to the high rates of penicillin resistance among Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. Therefore, it is ineffective for this infection and should not be used. (D) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective against certain bacterial infections, it is not first-line treatment for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonococcal infections require antibiotics with proven activity against Neisseria, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole does not have reliable efficacy against gonorrhea.",

This patient's presentation with fever, painful arthritis of the right knee, and pustules on her extremities is consistent with gonococcal infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that typically grows as small, round colonies on modified Thayer-Martin agar, a selective medium used for isolating Neisseria species. This bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive, which are key biochemical tests that help confirm the diagnosis of gonococcal infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Growth of small colonies consisting of gram-positive cocci. Bacteria grown on plates are catalase and oxidase positive: This option is incorrect because Neisseria gonorrhoeae is gram-negative and not gram-positive. The characteristics described in this option suggest a gram-positive cocci like Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, but these bacteria would not be the causative agent of gonococcal infection, which is caused by a gram-negative diplococcus. (C) Growth of small colonies consisting of gram-negative diplococci. Bacteria growth on plates are catalase and oxidase negative: While Neisseria gonorrhoeae is gram-negative and forms diplococci, it is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive, unlike what is described in this option. This set of biochemical tests does not match Neisseria gonorrhoeae, making it an incorrect answer. (D) Growth of large mucoid colonies consisting of gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria growth on plates are catalase and oxidase negative: This option describes the growth of gram-negative bacilli, which is not characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus and does not form mucoid colonies or bacilli. Furthermore, it is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive, not negative.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease are at increased risk of developing secondary disease with reports of secondary cases in up to 3% of primary cases. The rate of secondary cases is highest during the week after presentation of the index case with most cases presenting within 6 weeks. Increased risk remains for up to 1 year. Prophylaxis is recommended for persons who are intimate or household contacts of the index case and health care workers who have been directly exposed to respiratory secretions. Mass prophylaxis is not usually offered. The aim of prophylaxis is to eradicate colonization of close contacts with the strain that has caused invasive disease. Prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible to all contacts at the same time to avoid recolonization. Waiting for culture is not recommended. Ceftriaxone as a single dose is currently the most effective option in reducing carriage. Rifampin is no longer the optimal agent because it requires multiple doses and fails to eliminate carriage in up to 20% of cases. In some countries, ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin is used, but resistance has been reported in some areas. Current conjugated vaccines do not include N. meningitidis serotype B. Most sporadic cases in the United States are now caused by this serotype. Vaccination should be offered in cases of meningococcal disease caused by documented infection by a serotype included in the current vaccine",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (Because of emerging resistance, treatment recommendations for gonorrhea require frequent updating. Fluoroquinolones and penicillin are no longer generally recommended in the US because of resistance. Current effective therapies utilize single dose therapies to maximize adherence. Intramuscular ceftriaxone is recommended by the CDC as first line therapy and is effective for urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis. Azithromycin given orally in a 1 gram dose also should be administered as dual treatment and also because of the presumption of chlamydial co-infection. Doxycycline also an option for co-treatment in nonpregnant women. Patients with uncomplicated infection who receive therapy do not require a test of cure. Patients should be instructed to contact sexual partners for screening and therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated that the provision of medications or prescriptions to treat gonorrhea and chlamydia in sexual partners diminishes the risk of reinfection in the affected patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Urethritis in men causes dysuria with or without discharge, usually without frequency. The most common causes of urethritis in men include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and possibly adenovirus. Until recently, C. trachomatis accounted for 30% to 40% of cases; however, this number may be decreasing. Recent studies suggest that M. genitalium is a common cause of nonchlamydial cases. Currently, the initial diagnosis of urethritis in men includes specific tests only for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Tenets of urethral discharge treatment include providing treatment for the most common causes of urethritis with the assumption that the patient may be lost to follow-up. Therefore, prompt empirical treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydial infections with ceftriaxone and azithromycin should be given on the day of presentation to the clinic to the patient, and recent partners should be contacted for treatment. Azithromycin will also be effective for M. genitalium. If pus can be milked from the urethra, cultures should be sent for definitive diagnosis and to allow for contact tracing by the health department because both of these are reportable diseases. Urine nucleic acid amplification tests are an acceptable substitute in the absence of pus. It is also critical to provide empirical treatment for at-risk sexual contacts. If symptoms do not respond to the initial empirical therapy, patients should be reevaluated for compliance with therapy, reexposure, and T. vaginalis infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Neisserial infection. Explanation of the Correct Answer: A deficiency in C5 through C9 complement components means that the patient has an impaired ability to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC is crucial for the lysis of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Neisseria species (N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae). Individuals with C5-C9 deficiencies are at higher risk for recurrent, invasive Neisserial infections like meningococcal meningitis and septicemia. Neisserial infections are characterized by: Severe headache, fever, and neck stiffness (in meningitis) Petechial or purpuric rash Rapid progression and potential for septic shock Sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea) Prevention and Management: Vaccination against N. meningitidis is particularly important in individuals with complement deficiencies. Prophylactic antibiotics might be considered in some cases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) AIDS – Incorrect AIDS is caused by HIV, which targets the immune system’s CD4+ T cells. It is not directly related to complement deficiencies, especially C5-C9. Susceptibility in AIDS is typically to opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex, and certain fungi/viruses. (B) Giardiasis – Incorrect Giardiasis is caused by the protozoan Giardia lamblia, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and malabsorption. Susceptibility is more related to IgA deficiency or poor hygiene/sanitation, not complement deficiencies. (C) Histoplasmosis – Incorrect Histoplasmosis is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, often affecting the lungs and sometimes disseminating in immunocompromised patients. It’s associated with cell-mediated immunity deficiencies (like in HIV/AIDS), not complement system defects.",
