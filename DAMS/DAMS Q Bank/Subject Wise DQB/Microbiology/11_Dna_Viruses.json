      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CMV (Cytomegalovirus). Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a herpesvirus, primarily affects immunocompromised individuals and neonates, causing diseases such as CMV retinitis, congenital infections, and pneumonia. It is not a common cause of conjunctivitis, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Enterovirus 70 – Incorrect Enterovirus 70 is a well-known cause of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), a highly contagious form of conjunctivitis that spreads rapidly in epidemics. It presents with sudden onset of painful, red eyes, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and watery discharge. (C) Coxsackie A24 – Incorrect Coxsackie A24 is another enterovirus that causes acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), similar to Enterovirus 70. It leads to rapid onset of conjunctival redness, pain, and swelling, often resolving in 7–10 days. (D) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenoviruses are the most common viral cause of conjunctivitis, particularly epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF). EKC presents with severe conjunctivitis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, photophobia, and corneal involvement, while PCF is associated with fever, pharyngitis, and conjunctivitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Explanation of the Correct Answer: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Herpesviridae family. It is the primary viral agent associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), especially in Southeast Asia, Southern China, and North Africa. EBV and Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC): EBV infection leads to latent viral gene expression, which contributes to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Viral proteins such as LMP1 (Latent Membrane Protein 1) and LMP2 play a role in immune evasion, apoptosis inhibition, and oncogenesis. EBV DNA is consistently detected in tumor cells of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Risk Factors for NPC: Genetic susceptibility (HLA alleles) Environmental factors (high consumption of salted fish, which contains nitrosamines, a known carcinogen) EBV infection (a strong link in endemic regions) Clinical Features of NPC: Painless neck mass (due to cervical lymph node metastasis) Nasal obstruction, epistaxis (nosebleeds) Hearing loss, tinnitus (due to Eustachian tube blockage) Headaches, cranial nerve palsies (advanced disease) Diagnosis & Detection: Serology (anti-EBV IgA antibodies, EBV DNA in plasma) Histopathology and immunohistochemistry MRI or CT scan for tumor staging Treatment & Prognosis: Radiotherapy + chemotherapy (gold standard) Good response to treatment in early-stage NPC Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Herpes – Incorrect The Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is mainly associated with oral and genital herpes infections. HSV does not have a significant role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Another herpesvirus, Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), is linked to Kaposi's sarcoma, but not NPC. (B) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenoviruses typically cause upper respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. No strong evidence links adenoviruses to cancer development, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma. (C) Coronavirus – Incorrect Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) cause respiratory tract infections. No established link exists between coronaviruses and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Explanation of the Correct Answer: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute bronchiolitis in children, particularly in infants under 2 years of age. RSV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and is an enveloped, single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus. Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract infection that leads to inflammation, mucus production, and airway obstruction in small bronchioles. The hallmark symptoms include wheezing, cough, tachypnea (rapid breathing), nasal congestion, and fever. It spreads through respiratory droplets and is highly contagious, particularly in daycare centers and hospitals. Severe cases may require hospitalization, especially in premature infants, immunocompromised children, and those with underlying lung or heart disease. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used as prophylaxis in high-risk infants but is not used for treatment. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenovirus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchitis, but it is not the most common cause of bronchiolitis. It typically causes pharyngoconjunctival fever, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis, especially in older children and military recruits. (C) Klebsiella – Incorrect Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacillus that causes pneumonia, especially in alcoholics, diabetics, and hospitalized patients. It is not a common cause of bronchiolitis, as it primarily affects adults with underlying health conditions. (D) Staphylococci – Incorrect Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive cocci that can cause pneumonia, but it is usually seen in hospital-acquired infections, post-viral infections, or aspiration pneumonia. It is not a major cause of bronchiolitis in children.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Single stage lesions are found at a time Explanation of the Correct Answer: Varicella (chickenpox), caused by Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), is characterized by multiple stages of lesions appearing simultaneously. This means that at any given time, a patient will have vesicles, pustules, and crusted scabs all present together. This is a key distinguishing feature of chickenpox compared to other vesicular rashes like smallpox, where lesions are in the same stage at a given time. The rash classically begins on the trunk and spreads outward, including the face, scalp, and extremities. The lesions progress in crops, meaning they appear over several days, resulting in a \"starry sky\" pattern of different stages of evolution. Pruritus (itching) is a common symptom associated with the rash. Thus, the statement that \"Single stage lesions are found at a time\" is false, making it the correct answer to this question. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Produces rash in flexor surface of forearm – Correct Chickenpox rash can appear on the flexor surfaces of the forearm, but it typically starts on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities. While the rash is not exclusively confined to flexor surfaces, it can still appear there. (C) Secondary infection rate is >90% – Correct Secondary attack rate refers to how likely close contacts (such as household members) are to get infected after exposure. Chickenpox is highly contagious, with a secondary infection rate exceeding 90% in susceptible individuals (those who have never been vaccinated or previously infected). It spreads via respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular fluid. (D) Vaccine protection rate is high – Correct The varicella vaccine (live-attenuated VZV vaccine) is highly effective, offering about 85–90% protection against infection and nearly 100% protection against severe disease. Countries with routine childhood vaccination have seen a dramatic drop in varicella cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (D) Herpes simplex Explanation of the Correct Answer: The Tzanck test is a rapid cytological test used for diagnosing herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, including HSV-1 and HSV-2. It is performed by: Scraping the base of a fresh vesicle (usually from the oral or genital mucosa). Staining the sample with Giemsa, Wright, or Papanicolaou stain. Examining it under a microscope for characteristic multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions (Tzanck cells). The Tzanck test is useful for diagnosing herpes simplex virus infections when vesicular lesions are present, but it does not differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2. This test can also detect varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections (chickenpox and shingles), but HSV is the primary diagnostic focus. Thus, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common indication for the Tzanck test, making option (A) the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Impetigo – Incorrect Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The diagnosis is usually clinical or confirmed by Gram stain and bacterial culture, not the Tzanck test, which is used for viral infections. (C) Carbuncle – Incorrect Carbuncles are deep bacterial infections of the hair follicles, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and bacterial culture, not the Tzanck test, as it is not a viral infection. (D) Chickenpox – Incorrect (but partially related) Chickenpox (varicella) is caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which can also show Tzanck-positive cells (multinucleated giant cells). However, the Tzanck test is primarily used for HSV diagnosis, while PCR and direct fluorescent antibody tests are preferred for diagnosing chickenpox.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Herpes simplex type II Explanation of the Correct Answer: Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) primarily causes genital herpes, characterized by painful vesicular lesions in the genital or anal areas. It is not associated with a glandular fever-like syndrome (infectious mononucleosis-like illness). While HSV-2 can cause systemic symptoms like fever and malaise during a primary outbreak, it does not typically cause lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, or splenomegaly, which are hallmark features of glandular fever. Therefore, HSV-2 is the exception and does not cause a glandular fever-like syndrome, making option (D) the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) – Incorrect CMV is a beta-herpesvirus that can cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome in immunocompetent adults. Symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and mild hepatitis, resembling infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV. CMV infection is characterized by negative heterophile antibody tests (Paul-Bunnell test) but positive CMV IgM antibodies. (B) Toxoplasma gondii – Incorrect Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, can cause a mononucleosis-like illness in immunocompetent individuals. Symptoms include lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue, often without significant organ involvement. Severe manifestations occur in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS), leading to cerebral toxoplasmosis. (C) Infectious mononucleosis (caused by Epstein-Barr Virus, EBV) – Incorrect EBV is the classic cause of infectious mononucleosis, commonly known as glandular fever. Clinical features include fever, sore throat, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and fatigue. Positive heterophile antibody test (Monospot test) is characteristic of EBV infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Infectious mononucleosis Explanation of the Correct Answer: The Paul-Bunnell test is used to detect heterophile antibodies, which are produced in infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The test is based on agglutination of sheep or horse red blood cells (RBCs) by these heterophile antibodies present in the patient’s serum. Infectious mononucleosis presents with: Fever Sore throat Generalized lymphadenopathy (posterior cervical nodes are classically involved) Splenomegaly Atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear Paul-Bunnell test vs. Monospot test Paul-Bunnell test: A historical test based on heterophile antibody titration. Monospot test: A more rapid and sensitive test detecting heterophile antibodies using horse RBCs. Since heterophile antibodies are characteristic of EBV, this test is useful for confirming infectious mononucleosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Malta fever – Incorrect Malta fever is caused by Brucella species and is commonly known as Brucellosis. It is diagnosed using serologic tests like the Standard Agglutination Test (SAT) or the Rose Bengal Test (RBT), not the Paul-Bunnell test. (B) Enteric fever – Incorrect Enteric fever (Typhoid fever) is caused by Salmonella typhi and is diagnosed using: Widal test (detects antibodies against Salmonella antigens O and H). Blood culture (gold standard in early infection). The Paul-Bunnell test is not useful in enteric fever diagnosis. (D) Typhus fever – Incorrect Typhus fever is caused by Rickettsial species and is transmitted by lice, fleas, or mites. Diagnosis is typically done using Weil-Felix test or serologic assays (IFA, ELISA), not the Paul-Bunnell test.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mumps Explanation of the Correct Answer: Mumps virus (Paramyxovirus) does NOT commonly cause pneumonia. Instead, it primarily affects the salivary glands (parotitis), and complications may include orchitis, oophoritis, pancreatitis, and meningitis, but not pneumonia. Mumps is a respiratory virus but does not typically lead to lower respiratory tract infections like pneumonia. The primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets, but it predominantly affects the parotid glands and CNS rather than the lungs. Complications like viral encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, and orchitis are more common than pneumonia. Thus, Mumps does not cause pneumonia, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Influenza – Incorrect Influenza virus (Orthomyxovirus) is a major viral cause of pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised individuals, young children, and the elderly. Influenza-associated pneumonia can be: Primary viral pneumonia (caused by the influenza virus itself). Secondary bacterial pneumonia (due to superimposed infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae). Symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia, sometimes leading to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). (B) Varicella – Incorrect Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, can lead to viral pneumonia, especially in adults or immunocompromised patients. Varicella pneumonia is a serious complication and can present with: Diffuse interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray. Cough, dyspnea, fever, and hypoxia. It is more common in pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients and can be life-threatening. (C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) – Incorrect CMV (a Herpesvirus) is a major cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, such as: HIV/AIDS patients (CMV pneumonitis). Organ transplant recipients (CMV reactivation). Neonates (congenital CMV infection). CMV pneumonia presents as: Interstitial pneumonia with bilateral infiltrates on imaging.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Erythroid Cells Explanation of the Correct Answer: Human parvovirus B19 has a strong tropism for erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. It primarily infects and destroys these cells, leading to transient anemia in healthy individuals and severe aplastic crisis in patients with pre-existing hematologic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease) in children presents as a \"slapped-cheek\" rash, caused by parvovirus B19. In adults, parvovirus B19 infection often presents with arthralgia or arthritis, commonly affecting the small joints of the hands (as seen in this patient). Pathogenesis: The virus binds to P antigen (globoside) on erythroid progenitor cells, leading to cell lysis and impaired red blood cell production. This can cause transient aplastic anemia, especially in individuals with underlying hemolytic disorders. Thus, erythroid progenitor cells are the primary target of parvovirus B19 infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) CD4 T Lymphocytes – Incorrect CD4 T cells are the primary targets of HIV, not parvovirus B19. While B19 can cause immune-mediated symptoms, it does not directly infect CD4 T cells. (B) Renal Tubule Cells – Incorrect Renal tubule cells are affected in infections such as polyomavirus (BK virus) and Leptospira. Parvovirus B19 does not have a tropism for renal tubular cells. (D) Glial Cells – Incorrect Glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) are infected by neurotropic viruses like JC virus (causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, PML). Parvovirus B19 does not target glial cells. (E) Peyer’s Patches – Incorrect Peyer’s patches are lymphoid tissues in the intestine and are involved in mucosal immunity. They are targeted by Salmonella typhi and poliovirus, but not by parvovirus B19.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) It can be reactivated by emotional disturbances or prolonged exposure to sunlight Explanation of the Correct Answer: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a latent virus that can be reactivated under conditions of stress. This includes: Emotional disturbances (stress, anxiety) Physical stressors (fever, illness) Prolonged exposure to sunlight (UV radiation) Immunosuppression HSV establishes latency in sensory ganglia after the initial infection. HSV-1 typically resides in the trigeminal ganglia and is associated with oral lesions. HSV-2 typically resides in the sacral ganglia and is associated with genital herpes. Reactivation leads to recurrent outbreaks of painful vesicular lesions. Thus, HSV infections can be triggered by emotional stress or sunlight, making option (C) the correct choice. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Infection with type I virus is most common – Incorrect While HSV-1 is more common overall, it primarily causes oral herpes. HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital infections, as seen in this patient. Genital herpes can also be caused by HSV-1, but HSV-2 remains the most frequent cause. (B) Initial infection usually occurs by intestinal absorption of virus – Incorrect HSV is not absorbed through the intestine. It is transmitted via direct contact with infected lesions, mucous membranes, or secretions. HSV-1 is typically spread by oral contact (e.g., kissing). HSV-2 is usually transmitted sexually. (D) It rarely recurs in hosts who have high antibody titer – Incorrect Even with high antibody levels, HSV can still reactivate because it establishes latency in nerve ganglia. Immunity does not prevent reactivation, but it may reduce the severity of symptoms. Recurrent infections are common, especially in immunocompromised individuals. (E) The CNS and visceral organs are usually involved – Incorrect While HSV can involve the CNS (e.g., HSV encephalitis or aseptic meningitis) or visceral organs (e.g., HSV pneumonitis in neonates), these are not common in otherwise healthy adults. Genital herpes is typically localized to the genital region and does not affect the CNS or visceral organs in most cases.",

HSV-1 is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. It has a predilection for the temporal lobes, often leading to: Fever Altered mental status Seizures Hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobe, which can be seen on MRI Histopathology shows multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions (Cowdry type A bodies), a hallmark of HSV infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HSV DNA. Early treatment with IV Acyclovir is crucial, as untreated HSV encephalitis has a high mortality rate. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Coxsackievirus – Incorrect Coxsackievirus A & B are enteroviruses that can cause viral meningitis but are not a common cause of focal encephalitis. They do not specifically target the temporal lobe, nor do they produce multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions. (B) Hepatitis C virus – Incorrect Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic virus that primarily affects the liver. While it has been linked to neurological complications like cognitive dysfunction, it does not cause focal encephalitis with temporal lobe involvement. (D) Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) – Incorrect HSV-2 is the primary cause of viral meningitis, rather than encephalitis. In neonates, HSV-2 can cause diffuse encephalitis, but in adults, HSV-1 is the primary cause of temporal lobe encephalitis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aplastic crisis Explanation of the Correct Answer: Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. This viral infection can lead to anemia and bone marrow suppression, making it particularly dangerous for individuals with pre-existing hematologic disorders. In children, Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), a mild illness characterized by a \"slapped cheek\" rash, low-grade fever, and malaise. However, in individuals with chronic hemolytic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia), the virus stops red blood cell production, leading to a transient aplastic crisis. Laboratory findings show severe anemia with low reticulocyte count, while white blood cells and platelets remain relatively unaffected. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting Parvovirus B19 DNA by PCR or IgM antibodies. Management includes supportive care and, in severe cases, blood transfusion. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Acute respiratory disease – Incorrect Parvovirus B19 does not primarily cause acute respiratory disease. While mild upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., fever, cough) may precede the rash in Fifth disease, it is not a major cause of pneumonia or severe respiratory infections. Acute respiratory disease is more commonly caused by adenoviruses, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). (C) Gastroenteritis – Incorrect Parvovirus B19 does not cause gastroenteritis. Viral gastroenteritis is commonly caused by rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, and astrovirus. (D) Keratoconjunctivitis – Incorrect Parvovirus B19 does not cause keratoconjunctivitis. Adenoviruses, particularly serotypes 8, 19, and 37, are the most common causes of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Other causes include herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) It can be transmitted across the placental barrier Explanation of the Correct Answer: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus from the Herpesviridae family that is a significant cause of congenital infections worldwide. It is transmitted transplacentally from an infected mother to the fetus, leading to congenital CMV infection. CMV is the most common congenital viral infection and can result in sensorineural hearing loss, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, mental retardation, and intracranial calcifications. The risk of transmission is highest when a mother acquires a primary CMV infection during pregnancy because she lacks pre-existing immunity. Diagnosis in neonates is confirmed via PCR or CMV culture from urine, saliva, or blood within the first three weeks of life. Treatment with ganciclovir or valganciclovir may reduce the risk of hearing loss and improve outcomes in symptomatic infants. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) While a common infection, CMV is almost always symptomatic – Incorrect CMV is very common, but most infections in immunocompetent individuals are asymptomatic. When symptomatic, it often presents as a mononucleosis-like illness (fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy) but with negative heterophile antibody tests (unlike Epstein-Barr virus). Severe disease mainly occurs in newborns (congenital CMV) and immunocompromised patients (e.g., transplant recipients, AIDS patients with CD4 <50 cells/µL). (C) The CMV can be cultured from red blood cells of infected patients – Incorrect CMV does not replicate in red blood cells (RBCs). Instead, it is commonly isolated from urine, saliva, throat swabs, blood leukocytes (WBCs), and tissue biopsy samples. (D) Unlike other viral infections, CMV is not activated by immune-suppressive therapy – Incorrect CMV is a latent virus that can reactivate under immunosuppressive conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or chemotherapy. CMV reactivation can cause retinitis, colitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis in these patients. (E) There is no specific therapy for CMV – Incorrect Specific antiviral therapy is available for CMV. Ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are used to treat severe or symptomatic CMV infections, especially in immunocompromised patients and neonates.",

Fifth disease primarily affects children and presents with a \"slapped-cheek\" rash followed by a lacy, reticular rash on the body. It can cause aplastic crisis in patients with hemolytic anemia (e.g., sickle cell disease) and hydrops fetalis in pregnant women.

Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Roseola Infantum – Incorrect Roseola infantum (exanthem subitum) is caused by Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and occasionally HHV-7. It typically affects infants aged 6 months to 2 years and presents with high fever for 3–5 days, followed by the sudden appearance of a maculopapular rash as the fever subsides. (C) Roseola subitum – Incorrect This is another name for Roseola infantum and is also caused by HHV-6. The characteristic high fever followed by rash differentiates it from other childhood exanthems. (D) Exanthem subitum – Incorrect Exanthem subitum is simply another term for Roseola infantum, also caused by HHV-6.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) HPV-6 and HPV-18 are mainly sexually transmitted Explanation of the Correct Answer: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that affects the skin and mucous membranes. Among its numerous types, HPV-6 and HPV-18 are commonly transmitted through sexual contact. HPV-6 and HPV-11 are low-risk strains that cause genital warts (condylomata acuminata) and respiratory papillomatosis. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are high-risk strains that are strongly associated with cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV spreads primarily through direct skin-to-skin or mucosal contact, most commonly via sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, and oral sex). Since HPV-6 and HPV-18 are both sexually transmitted, option (B) is the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Papillomavirus infection is commonly diagnosed by viral culture – Incorrect HPV cannot be cultured in vitro, as it requires differentiating squamous epithelial cells to replicate. Diagnosis is typically made by: Pap smear (Papanicolaou test) – detects koilocytes (HPV-infected squamous cells) in cervical smears. HPV DNA testing – identifies high-risk HPV strains using PCR. Colposcopy and biopsy – used for further evaluation if abnormalities are found. Since HPV is not diagnosed by viral culture, this statement is incorrect. (C) HPV-16 and HPV-11 are mostly associated with cervical cancers – Incorrect HPV-16 and HPV-18, not HPV-11, are the primary strains responsible for cervical cancer. HPV-11, like HPV-6, is a low-risk strain associated with benign genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, not malignancy. (D) Are associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy – Incorrect Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus (a Polyomavirus), not HPV. HPV is not known to cause PML or any other significant neurological disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Exanthema subitum, also known as roseola infantum or sixth disease, is primarily caused by HHV-6 and, less commonly, HHV-7. It is a common childhood viral infection that typically affects infants and young children (6 months to 2 years old). The disease is characterized by a sudden high fever lasting for 3–5 days, followed by a rash that appears as the fever subsides. The rash is maculopapular and starts on the trunk, spreading to the neck and extremities. HHV-6 infects CD4+ T cells, leading to viremia and fever, followed by immune-mediated clearance resulting in rash. The infection is usually self-limiting. Incorrect options: (A) Parvovirus B19 – Incorrect. Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), not exanthema subitum. Fifth disease presents with a characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash followed by a lacy reticular rash on the extremities. It primarily affects school-aged children and is associated with complications like aplastic crisis in individuals with hemolytic anemia. (C) Rubella virus – Incorrect. Rubella virus causes rubella (German measles), which presents with a mild maculopapular rash, beginning on the face and spreading downward. It is typically associated with postauricular and occipital lymphadenopathy. Congenital rubella syndrome can cause severe birth defects if a pregnant woman is infected. However, rubella does not cause the high fever preceding the rash, which is a hallmark of exanthema subitum. (D) Rubeola virus (Measles virus) – Incorrect. Rubeola virus causes measles, which presents with a high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis (3 Cs), and Koplik spots (small white lesions on the buccal mucosa). The rash in measles is erythematous, maculopapular, and starts at the hairline, spreading downward. Unlike roseola, where the rash appears after fever subsides, the measles rash appears while the fever is still present.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. All three viruses listed—Rabies virus, Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV)—are known for their ability to spread via nerves (neurotropism). These viruses infect neurons and travel along axons using retrograde and anterograde transport via dynein and kinesin motor proteins, allowing them to establish latent infections or spread within the nervous system. Rabies virus: Rabies is a neurotropic RNA virus from the Rhabdoviridae family. It enters the body through animal bites, infects peripheral nerve endings, and travels via retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system (CNS), causing fatal encephalitis. It then spreads to salivary glands, cornea, and other tissues. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV): VZV, a herpesvirus, initially causes chickenpox (varicella). After primary infection, it travels via sensory nerves to the dorsal root ganglia, where it remains latent. Reactivation leads to shingles (herpes zoster), causing painful vesicular rashes along dermatomal distributions due to viral spread along sensory nerves. Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 & HSV-2): HSV infects mucosal surfaces and spreads to the sensory ganglia (trigeminal ganglion for HSV-1, sacral ganglia for HSV-2) via retrograde axonal transport, establishing latency. Reactivation leads to recurrent oral (HSV-1) or genital (HSV-2) lesions, with virus traveling via anterograde transport to the skin/mucosa. Incorrect options: Since all three viruses spread via nerves, none of the options (A, B, or C) can be considered incorrect in isolation. Therefore, option (E) None of the above is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG). In a pregnant woman without immunity (Varicella IgG negative) who has been exposed to chickenpox, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with Varicella-Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG) is recommended. The goal is to reduce the risk of maternal varicella, which can lead to severe complications like pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis. Additionally, varicella infection during the first trimester increases the risk of congenital varicella syndrome (CVS), which can cause limb hypoplasia, skin scarring, microcephaly, and eye abnormalities in the fetus. VZIG should be administered within 10 days of exposure, preferably as soon as possible, to provide passive immunity and reduce disease severity. However, it does not completely prevent infection. Incorrect options: (B) Oral Acyclovir – Incorrect. Acyclovir is used for active varicella infection but is not recommended as prophylaxis in immunocompetent pregnant women. It may be considered if symptoms develop but is not a substitute for VZIG in preventing infection. (C) Both VZ immunoglobulin and oral Acyclovir – Incorrect. While VZIG is necessary for prophylaxis, adding oral acyclovir is not needed unless the mother develops clinical varicella. Acyclovir is only indicated for treatment, not prophylaxis. (D) Nothing, only reassurance – Incorrect. Doing nothing is not appropriate because the mother is susceptible (Varicella IgG negative) and at risk of severe disease. Reassurance alone would fail to protect both the mother and fetus from potential complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 is the causative agent of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), a common childhood illness characterized by a \"slapped cheek\" rash. The disease typically begins with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, malaise, and headache, followed by a bright red facial rash on the cheeks. A lacy, reticular rash may also appear on the trunk and extremities. Parvovirus B19 infects erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which can lead to transient aplastic crisis in individuals with underlying hemolytic disorders such as sickle cell disease. In immunocompromised patients, it can cause chronic pure red cell aplasia. In pregnant women, infection can result in hydrops fetalis due to severe fetal anemia. Incorrect options: (A) Herpes simplex – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically causes painful vesicular lesions on the oral mucosa (HSV-1) or genital area (HSV-2). It does not present with a \"slapped cheek\" rash and is not associated with aplastic crisis. (C) Rubella – Incorrect. Rubella (German measles) causes a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward, often accompanied by postauricular and occipital lymphadenopathy. However, it does not cause the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" appearance or transient aplastic crisis. (D) Rubeola (Measles) – Incorrect. Measles (Rubeola) presents with a high fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (3 C's) followed by a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward. Koplik spots (white lesions on the buccal mucosa) are a hallmark of measles, which are absent in Parvovirus B19 infection.",

While EBV is known to be involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), particularly in Southeast Asia, its role in oropharyngeal cancer (which mainly arises from HPV infection or smoking and alcohol use) is not well established. Therefore, this statement is incorrect, making it the correct answer to the question. Incorrect options: (A) Infectious mononucleosis/glandular fever – Correct. EBV is the primary cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM), also known as glandular fever. It is a self-limiting disease that presents with: Fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy Hepatosplenomegaly Atypical lymphocytosis (Downey cells) EBV infects B cells via the CD21 receptor, leading to a strong T-cell immune response, which causes the symptoms of mononucleosis. (B) Progressive lymphoproliferative disease in transplant recipients, immunodeficient, AIDS – Correct. EBV can cause post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in organ transplant recipients and immunocompromised individuals. The virus evades immune control, leading to uncontrolled B-cell proliferation, which can develop into lymphoma. (C) B-cell lymphoma in transplant recipients & AIDS – Correct. EBV is strongly associated with B-cell lymphomas, including: Burkitt lymphoma (particularly in endemic African cases) Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) Hodgkin lymphoma These lymphomas are more common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or organ transplants.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) IgG detection by ELISA is used for diagnosis. Detection of IgG antibodies by ELISA is not the primary method for diagnosing an active Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. IgG antibodies indicate past exposure and lifelong immunity but do not confirm an active or recent infection. IgM antibodies (which indicate recent infection) or CMV DNA PCR (which detects viral replication) are preferred for diagnosing acute or congenital CMV infections. Therefore, this statement is incorrect, making it the correct answer to the question. Incorrect options: (A) Replicates in epithelial cells of salivary glands, kidneys & respiratory epithelium – Correct. CMV primarily infects and replicates in epithelial cells of the salivary glands, kidneys, and respiratory tract. It establishes latent infection in mononuclear cells and can reactivate in immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients and AIDS patients. (B) Infected persons carry the virus for life and secrete it in all body secretions – Correct. Once infected, CMV remains latent in the body for life, with periodic reactivation. The virus can be shed in saliva, urine, blood, semen, breast milk, and cervical secretions, making it easily transmissible through close contact, organ transplantation, and congenital infection. (C) Most common agent to cause intrauterine infection of the fetus – Correct. CMV is the most common congenital infection worldwide, causing hearing loss, developmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, and microcephaly in newborns. It is transmitted transplacentally, and primary maternal infection during pregnancy poses the highest risk to the fetus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Kaposi’s sarcoma is associated. Kaposi’s sarcoma is not associated with HHV-6 or HHV-7. Instead, it is caused by Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), which is linked to Kaposi’s sarcoma, a vascular tumor commonly seen in AIDS patients. HHV-6 and HHV-7 primarily cause Roseola infantum (Exanthema subitum) and are not oncogenic viruses. Therefore, this statement is incorrect, making it the correct answer. Incorrect options: (A) Infects CD4 T-lymphocytes & Macrophages – Correct. Both HHV-6 and HHV-7 primarily infect CD4+ T-lymphocytes, leading to their depletion. This is why HHV-6 was initially considered in the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS. These viruses can also infect macrophages and other mononuclear cells, contributing to persistent infection and reactivation in immunocompromised individuals. (B) Reservoir is the salivary glands – Correct. The salivary glands serve as the primary reservoir for HHV-6 and HHV-7. The virus is shed in saliva, which plays a major role in person-to-person transmission, especially in young children. (C) Exanthema subitum/Roseola infantum is associated – Correct. HHV-6 (most common) and HHV-7 are the causative agents of Exanthema subitum (Roseola infantum), a common childhood illness. It presents with: High fever for 3–5 days followed by sudden defervescence Maculopapular rash appearing after fever subsides The rash primarily affects the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rounding & aggregation of cells (grape-like clusters) with basophilic, I/N IB Cowdry type A. Adenovirus does not typically produce Cowdry type A inclusions, which are eosinophilic nuclear inclusions seen in herpesvirus infections (HSV, VZV, CMV). Instead, adenovirus causes intranuclear basophilic inclusions without a clear halo, and infected cells often show a characteristic smudgy or glassy nucleus. The description of grape-like clusters is also not a specific feature of adenoviral cytopathic effects. Therefore, this statement is incorrect, making it the correct answer. Incorrect options: (A) Causes Pharyngoconjunctival fever with types 3, 4, 7, 14 – Correct. Adenovirus types 3, 4, 7, and 14 are well-known causes of Pharyngoconjunctival fever, which typically occurs in children and military recruits. It presents with: Fever, sore throat (pharyngitis) Conjunctivitis (red eyes, watery discharge) Lymphadenopathy It is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets, fomites, and contaminated water (e.g., swimming pools). (B) Causes infantile gastroenteritis with type 40 & 41 – Correct. Adenovirus types 40 and 41 are known causes of viral gastroenteritis, especially in infants and young children. These strains primarily affect the intestinal epithelium, leading to watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Unlike rotavirus, adenoviral gastroenteritis lacks seasonal variation and can occur year-round. (C) Causes acute hemorrhagic cystitis in infants & children with 11 & 21 – Correct. Adenovirus types 11 and 21 are associated with acute hemorrhagic cystitis, a self-limiting condition characterized by: Hematuria (bloody urine) Dysuria (painful urination) No significant fever or systemic symptoms This condition mainly affects boys aged 5–15 years and is thought to result from direct viral invasion of the bladder epithelium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Do not spread by direct contact. Molluscum contagiosum does spread by direct contact, making this statement incorrect. The Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus that spreads via skin-to-skin contact, autoinoculation, and fomites (contaminated objects like towels, clothing, or gym equipment). It is also sexually transmitted when lesions occur in the anogenital region. This mode of transmission is well-established, so Option (D) is incorrect, making it the correct answer to the question. Incorrect options: (A) Painless, umbilicated, pearly white nodules on trunk & anogenital area – Correct. Molluscum contagiosum lesions are painless, small, dome-shaped, pearly white or flesh-colored papules with central umbilication. They commonly appear on the trunk, face, extremities, and anogenital area, especially in children and sexually active adults. (B) Non-cultivable virus – Correct. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) cannot be cultured in vitro using standard laboratory methods. It requires a human host for replication, making it a non-cultivable virus in traditional cell cultures. (C) Molluscum bodies are diagnostic – Correct. Molluscum bodies (Henderson-Patterson bodies) are large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies seen inside infected keratinocytes. They are pathognomonic for molluscum contagiosum and can be identified in histopathological examination of skin biopsies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cervical cancer is caused by Papilloma virus type 6, 11. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is divided into low-risk and high-risk types. While HPV 6 and 11 cause benign anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata) and laryngeal papillomatosis, they do not cause cervical cancer. Instead, cervical cancer is primarily caused by high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45, which are associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical carcinoma. Thus, Option (B) is incorrect, making it the correct answer to the question. Incorrect options: (A) Nonenveloped, icosahedral, dsDNA – Correct. Papovaviruses (which include Polyomaviruses and Papillomaviruses) are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Their structure allows them to persist in host cells and evade immune clearance, contributing to their oncogenic potential. (C) JC polyoma virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with Hodgkin’s, CLL, AIDS – Correct. JC virus (JCV) is a member of the Polyomavirus family and is responsible for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It typically affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with AIDS, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). (D) BK polyoma virus persists in the kidney for life – Correct. BK virus (BKV) is a Polyomavirus that establishes lifelong latent infection in the kidneys. It can reactivate under immunosuppressive conditions, leading to BK virus nephropathy, a serious complication in renal transplant recipients.",

It does not cause umbilicated, flesh-colored papules. (B) Herpesvirus 6 – Incorrect Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is responsible for roseola infantum (exanthem subitum), which presents with high fever followed by a maculopapular rash. It does not cause the flesh-colored umbilicated papules seen in molluscum contagiosum.

It can cause disseminated disease, encephalitis, or localized infections. In some cases, neonates with HSV-II encephalitis may present without skin lesions, making diagnosis challenging. Early recognition and treatment with intravenous acyclovir are crucial for survival and neurological outcomes. Incorrect Options: (A) HSV-I – Incorrect HSV-I is the more common cause of sporadic encephalitis in older children and adults, rather than neonates. Neonatal HSV encephalitis is predominantly caused by HSV-II, which is acquired during vaginal delivery from a mother with genital herpes. (C) Meningococci – Incorrect Meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis) causes bacterial meningitis rather than viral encephalitis. It is rare in neonates, with a higher incidence in older children and young adults. Additionally, meningococcal infections are associated with petechial rash, which is not a typical feature of HSV encephalitis. (D) Streptococci – Incorrect Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis, but it does not typically cause isolated encephalitis without skin lesions.

It is caused by Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and characteristically affects the frontal and temporal lobes, leading to symptoms such as focal seizures, fever, altered mental status, and personality changes. MRI findings of temporal and frontal lobe enhancement are highly suggestive of HSE, and CSF analysis typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and normal glucose. The gold standard for diagnosis is HSV DNA PCR in CSF, and early treatment with intravenous acyclovir is critical to reduce mortality and neurological complications. Incorrect Options: (A) Meningococcal Meningitis – Incorrect Meningococcal meningitis (caused by Neisseria meningitidis) typically presents with fever, neck stiffness, headache, altered mental status, and petechial rash. It primarily involves the meninges rather than the brain parenchyma, and MRI does not show focal temporal or frontal lobe enhancement, making it unlikely in this case. (C) Japanese Encephalitis – Incorrect Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that primarily affects basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem rather than the frontal and temporal lobes. It typically presents with diffuse encephalopathy, movement disorders (e.g., Parkinsonian features), and coma rather than focal seizures. (D) Enterovirus Encephalitis – Incorrect Enteroviruses (such as Coxsackievirus and Echovirus) can cause aseptic meningitis and encephalitis, but they rarely cause focal seizures or frontal/temporal involvement.

Chickenpox (Varicella-Zoster Virus, VZV) is highly contagious and is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular fluid. The infectious period begins 1–2 days before the rash appears and continues until all the vesicles have crusted over, which typically occurs about 5–6 days after rash onset. The presence of new vesicles and active fluid-filled lesions indicates ongoing viral shedding and infectivity. Incorrect Options: (A) Till the last scab falls off – Incorrect Although scabs can persist for several weeks, infectivity ceases once all the vesicles have crusted over, which usually happens by day 5–6. Scabs do not contain live virus, so the patient is no longer contagious after the vesicles have dried. (C) 3 days after onset of rash – Incorrect By day 3, new vesicles may still be appearing, and active viral shedding continues, making the person still infectious. The infectivity period extends beyond 3 days after rash onset.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals, including organ transplant recipients. It is a member of the herpesvirus family and is known to cause CMV pneumonitis, which presents as bilateral diffuse interstitial pneumonia with fever, cough, and dyspnea. CMV infection typically occurs 1–6 months post-transplant due to immunosuppressive therapy, which weakens the body's ability to control latent CMV reactivation or primary CMV infection. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting CMV DNA via PCR or antigenemia assay, and treatment includes antiviral therapy such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Incorrect Options: (A) Herpes simplex virus – Incorrect While Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients, it is not a common cause of interstitial pneumonia in transplant recipients. Instead, HSV more commonly causes mucocutaneous lesions, esophagitis, or encephalitis. (C) Epstein-Barr virus – Incorrect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) rather than interstitial pneumonia. While EBV can cause fever and systemic symptoms, it does not typically present as diffuse lung disease in transplant recipients. (D) Varicella-zoster virus – Incorrect Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, but it typically presents with a vesicular rash (disseminated varicella) along with pulmonary involvement. CMV pneumonitis is a more common cause of post-transplant pneumonia than VZV.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is the most common opportunistic viral infection in organ transplant recipients, particularly within the first 1–6 months post-transplantation. It can cause CMV pneumonitis, which presents as bilateral diffuse interstitial pneumonia, along with symptoms such as fever, non-productive cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. Immunosuppressive therapy given post-transplant weakens the immune system, leading to CMV reactivation or primary infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by CMV DNA PCR, antigen detection, or histopathology showing \"owl-eye\" inclusions. Treatment includes antiviral therapy such as ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Incorrect Options: (B) Histoplasma – Incorrect Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. While it can cause pulmonary involvement in immunocompromised patients, it is more common in endemic areas (e.g., Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys). It usually presents as granulomatous pneumonia rather than diffuse interstitial pneumonia. (C) Candida – Incorrect Candida species commonly cause bloodstream infections (candidemia) and invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised patients, but it rarely causes pneumonia. If it does, it is usually due to hematogenous dissemination rather than primary lung involvement. (D) Pneumocystis carinii (Pneumocystis jirovecii) – Incorrect Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients but can also affect transplant recipients. It also presents as bilateral interstitial pneumonia, but it typically occurs later post-transplant (beyond 6 months) or in cases where prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was not given. CMV remains a more likely cause in this case due to the timing (2 months post-transplant).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). A Tzanck smear showing multinucleated giant cells is characteristic of herpesviruses, including VZV and herpes simplex virus (HSV). VZV causes chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster), with shingles presenting as a painful vesicular rash along a dermatome, commonly affecting the thorax, face, or extremities like the shin. The vesicles contain infectious viral particles, and examination of a Tzanck smear from the base of a lesion shows multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions, which is a hallmark of herpesvirus infections. Incorrect Options: (A) Vaccinia virus – Incorrect Vaccinia virus is a poxvirus used in the smallpox vaccine. While it can cause localized vesicles at the vaccination site, it does not typically present with a widespread vesicular rash like VZV. Moreover, poxviruses do not show multinucleated giant cells on Tzanck smear; instead, they produce intracytoplasmic inclusions (Guarnieri bodies). (C) Tuberculosis – Incorrect Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which primarily affects the lungs but can also cause cutaneous TB (lupus vulgaris, scrofuloderma, etc.). However, TB does not cause vesicular skin lesions, nor does it show multinucleated giant cells on a Tzanck smear. Instead, TB is diagnosed via Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). (D) Molluscum contagiosum – Incorrect Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and presents as umbilicated, pearly papules rather than vesicles. It is diagnosed by identifying molluscum bodies (large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions) in keratinocytes on histology. Unlike VZV, it does not produce multinucleated giant cells on Tzanck smear.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Varicella (Varicella-Zoster Virus - VZV). Congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) occurs when a fetus is infected with VZV during the first or early second trimester of pregnancy. This can lead to limb hypoplasia, cicatricial (scarred) skin lesions, microcephaly, ocular abnormalities (e.g., chorioretinitis, cataracts), and neurological defects. The characteristic scarring follows a dermatomal distribution due to intrauterine infection damaging fetal tissues. CVS is rare but can cause severe birth defects if maternal varicella occurs early in pregnancy. Incorrect Options: (B) Herpes simplex virus (HSV) – Incorrect Congenital HSV infection usually results in neonatal herpes, which presents with vesicular skin lesions, encephalitis, and systemic infection (disseminated herpes). It does not typically cause limb hypoplasia or dermatomal scarring, distinguishing it from congenital varicella syndrome. HSV transmission primarily occurs during birth (perinatal transmission), rather than causing developmental defects in utero. (C) Rubella – Incorrect Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) causes sensorineural deafness, cataracts, congenital heart defects (PDA, pulmonary stenosis), and growth retardation. However, limb hypoplasia and cicatricial scarring are not features of CRS. Instead, rubella primarily affects ocular, cardiac, and auditory systems. (D) Toxoplasma – Incorrect Congenital toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is characterized by the classic triad: Chorioretinitis (ocular damage) Hydrocephalus Intracranial calcifications Limb hypoplasia and scarring are not features of congenital toxoplasmosis, making this an incorrect option.",

Vaccinia virus, a member of the Poxviridae family, has been widely used as a vector for vaccine development due to its ability to efficiently deliver foreign antigens and induce a strong immune response. It was originally used in the smallpox vaccine, which led to the eradication of smallpox. Recombinant vaccinia virus-based vaccines have been developed for various diseases, including HIV, rabies, and certain cancers, as it can carry and express foreign genes in host cells. Incorrect Options: (A) Rhinovirus – Incorrect Rhinoviruses cause the common cold and belong to the Picornaviridae family. They have high genetic variability and are not suitable as a vaccine vector. Unlike vaccinia, they do not elicit a strong or long-lasting immune response, making them an ineffective choice for vaccine development. (C) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenoviruses can be used as viral vectors in vaccines, such as the AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) and Johnson & Johnson (Ad26.COV2.S) COVID-19 vaccines. However, vaccinia virus has historically been the primary and most widely used viral vector for vaccine development. Adenoviruses are an emerging option but not the classical answer for this question. (D) Ebola – Incorrect Ebola virus, a member of the Filoviridae family, is a highly pathogenic virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever. It is not used as a viral vector for vaccine preparation. Instead, Ebola vaccines such as rVSV-ZEBOV use the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a vector, not Ebola itself. (E) Hepatitis B – Incorrect Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a hepadnavirus, is not used as a viral vector. The Hepatitis B vaccine is a subunit vaccine that contains recombinant HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), not a viral vector-based vaccine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Transplacental transfer occurs in only 10% of cases. This statement is incorrect because Parvovirus B19 can cross the placenta in approximately 30% of maternal infections, not just 10%. While the risk of fetal complications depends on the gestational age at which the infection occurs, transplacental transmission is more frequent than stated in option (D). Severe fetal effects include hydrops fetalis, severe anemia, and intrauterine fetal demise, particularly when infection occurs in the second trimester. Correct Statements: (A) Spread by respiratory route – Correct Parvovirus B19 is primarily transmitted via the respiratory route, through droplet infection. Close contact with infected individuals, especially in schools, daycare centers, and households, facilitates its spread. It can also be transmitted through blood transfusion and vertical transmission (mother to fetus). (B) Has affinity for erythrocyte progenitor cells – Correct Parvovirus B19 has a strong tropism for erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The virus binds to the P antigen (globoside) on erythroid precursor cells, leading to their destruction. This results in temporary suppression of erythropoiesis, which can lead to anemia, especially in individuals with underlying hemolytic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis). (C) Causes transient aplastic crisis – Correct Parvovirus B19 infection can cause transient aplastic crisis (TAC) in individuals with underlying hemolytic anemia. Since the virus halts erythropoiesis, patients with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassemia) are at risk of severe anemia. Unlike pure red cell aplasia, which is a chronic condition seen in immunocompromised individuals, TAC is self-limiting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Monospot test. The Monospot test is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). It is a heterophile antibody test that detects IgM antibodies produced in response to EBV infection. The test provides rapid results and has a high sensitivity and specificity, making it the preferred initial diagnostic test. Incorrect Options: (B) Paul Bunnel test – Less sensitive The Paul Bunnel test is an older test that also detects heterophile antibodies. However, it is less sensitive than the Monospot test and may give false-negative results in the early stages of infection. (C) Lymphocytosis in peripheral smear – Non-specific While lymphocytosis (increase in lymphocytes) and the presence of atypical lymphocytes are commonly seen in infectious mononucleosis, they are not specific for EBV infection. Other viral infections can also cause similar blood picture changes, making this finding insufficient for a definitive diagnosis. (D) Culture of the virus – Not practical EBV culture is rarely performed because it is technically challenging, time-consuming, and not routinely available. It is not useful for rapid diagnosis, making it the least practical option among the choices.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has a viral etiology and is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). EBV is a gamma herpesvirus that infects B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The virus can integrate into host DNA and contribute to oncogenesis through the activation of oncogenes and inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. NPC is endemic in regions such as Southeast Asia, North Africa, and Southern China, where high rates of EBV infection are observed. Incorrect Options: (A) Myeloma – Not viral Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by abnormal proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. While some viruses, like HHV-8 (Human Herpesvirus-8), have been studied in relation to hematologic malignancies, no definitive viral cause has been established for multiple myeloma. (C) Sarcoidosis – Likely immune-mediated, not viral Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by non-caseating granulomas in various organs, especially the lungs and lymph nodes. While some studies have suggested an association with infectious agents, including viruses, no specific viral etiology has been confirmed. The disease is thought to be due to an abnormal immune response rather than a direct viral infection. (D) Hemophilia – Genetic disorder, not viral Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by deficiencies in clotting factors (Factor VIII in Hemophilia A and Factor IX in Hemophilia B). It has a genetic basis and is not caused by a virus. However, in the past, some hemophilia patients contracted HIV and Hepatitis C due to contaminated blood transfusions, but the disease itself is not viral in origin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). VZV, a herpesvirus, initially causes chickenpox (varicella) as a primary infection. After recovery, the virus remains dormant (latent) in the dorsal root ganglia or cranial nerve ganglia for years. In some individuals, especially immunocompromised or elderly individuals, the virus can reactivate, causing herpes zoster (shingles). Shingles presents as a painful, unilateral, vesicular rash along a dermatome. Postherpetic neuralgia is a common complication, causing persistent pain even after the rash resolves. Immunosuppression, stress, or aging are major risk factors for VZV reactivation. Incorrect Options: (A) HIV – Incorrect HIV does not remain dormant in the classical sense. Instead, it integrates into the host genome and persists as a chronic infection. It may remain in a latent phase with low viral replication, but it continuously weakens the immune system. Once the immune system is severely compromised (CD4+ count < 200), it progresses to AIDS. However, unlike VZV, HIV is not known for sudden symptomatic reactivation after a period of complete dormancy. (C) HBV – Incorrect Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) can establish a chronic carrier state in some individuals, but it does not remain completely dormant. It continues to replicate at low levels in hepatocytes, leading to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. In some cases, HBV can reactivate in immunosuppressed patients, but it is not a classical latent virus like VZV. (D) HPV – Incorrect Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can persist in epithelial cells but does not remain dormant in the same way as VZV. It can cause latent infections and later manifest as warts or cervical dysplasia, but this is due to persistent infection rather than true viral latency and reactivation. Unlike VZV, HPV does not remain in a neural ganglion and reactivate later.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Herpes-Zoster Virus (HZV). Herpes-Zoster (caused by Varicella-Zoster Virus, VZV) remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after primary infection (chickenpox). It can reactivate later in life, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or the elderly, leading to shingles. When reactivation involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1), it results in Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO). This condition can cause: Keratitis (corneal inflammation) Conjunctivitis Uveitis Optic neuritis A key clinical sign of HZO is Hutchinson’s sign, where vesicular lesions appear on the tip or side of the nose, indicating involvement of the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve, which is strongly associated with ocular complications. Early antiviral treatment with Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, or Famciclovir can help reduce complications. Incorrect Options: (B) CMV – Incorrect Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpesvirus that can cause CMV retinitis, particularly in HIV/AIDS patients (CD4 <50 cells/µL). While it can affect the eyes, it does not \"reactivate\" in the same way as VZV, which causes shingles and ophthalmic involvement due to neural latency. CMV retinitis leads to progressive vision loss and retinal necrosis, often described as a “pizza pie” or \"cheese and ketchup\" appearance on fundus examination. (C) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) – Incorrect EBV is associated with infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but it does not typically involve eye reactivation. It can cause posterior uveitis in rare cases but is not a common cause of recurrent ocular disease like VZV. (D) Enterovirus-70 – Incorrect Enterovirus-70 is a major cause of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), an epidemic eye infection. It does not reactivate but instead causes sudden, self-limiting outbreaks of painful conjunctivitis with subconjunctival hemorrhage. It does not cause chronic or recurrent ocular disease like VZV.",

Instead, IgM detection in fetal blood or CMV DNA detection by PCR in amniotic fluid is used for prenatal diagnosis. IgA is not a standard marker for CMV diagnosis in fetuses. Congenital CMV infection is confirmed by: Detection of CMV DNA by PCR in amniotic fluid, urine, or blood. IgM positivity in neonates, but false positives and negatives can occur. Histopathology showing cytomegalic cells with \"owl's eye\" inclusions. Correct Statements: (A) It is a DNA virus – Correct CMV belongs to the Herpesviridae family and is a double-stranded DNA virus. Like other herpesviruses, it can establish latency and reactivate under immunosuppressive conditions (e.g., transplant recipients, HIV/AIDS patients). (B) Most commonly infected in the last trimester – Correct Congenital CMV infection occurs when a pregnant woman gets primary CMV infection or reactivation. While CMV transmission can occur at any stage, it is most common in the third trimester due to the higher placental permeability. However, infection in the first trimester is more severe and associated with congenital CMV syndrome, including sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, and intracranial calcifications. (D) Most common cause of congenital viral infection – Correct CMV is the most common congenital viral infection worldwide, affecting 0.5–2% of live births.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Human parvovirus B19. Erythema infectiosum, also known as \"Fifth disease\", is caused by human parvovirus B19. It is a single-stranded DNA virus that primarily affects children. The disease presents with a \"slapped cheek\" rash, followed by a lace-like rash on the trunk and extremities. Other symptoms include low-grade fever, malaise, and arthralgia (more common in adults). Pathogenesis: Parvovirus B19 infects erythroid progenitor cells, leading to temporary suppression of erythropoiesis. In patients with underlying hemolytic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis), this can cause a transient aplastic crisis. Transmission: It spreads via respiratory droplets and transplacental transmission can lead to hydrops fetalis in pregnant women. Incorrect Options: (B) Papovavirus – Incorrect Papovaviruses (now classified as Papillomaviruses and Polyomaviruses) do not cause erythema infectiosum. Instead, they are associated with conditions such as: Human papillomavirus (HPV) ? Warts, cervical cancer. JC virus ? Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). BK virus ? Nephropathy in transplant patients. (C) Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) – Incorrect HHV-8 is the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a vascular tumor seen in HIV/AIDS and immunocompromised patients. It does not cause erythema infectiosum. (D) Measles virus – Incorrect Measles virus (a paramyxovirus) causes measles (rubeola), which presents with: Koplik’s spots (white lesions on the buccal mucosa). Maculopapular rash starting from the face and spreading downward. High fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough. Unlike erythema infectiosum, measles rash is not lacy or limited to the cheeks.",

While the primary manifestation of the disease is a vesicular skin rash, extra-cutaneous complications can also occur. The most common extra-skin manifestation of varicella is CNS involvement, particularly acute cerebellar ataxia and encephalitis. Acute cerebellar ataxia is the most frequent neurological complication in children, presenting with gait instability, nystagmus, and dysmetria. It is usually self-limiting and resolves within a few weeks. Varicella encephalitis is rarer but more severe, presenting with seizures, altered consciousness, and focal neurological deficits. Other neurological complications include meningitis and transverse myelitis. Incorrect Options: (B) Lungs – Incorrect Varicella pneumonia is a serious but less common complication, primarily seen in adults, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. It presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. However, it is not as common as CNS involvement.

(D) CVS (Cardiovascular System) – Incorrect Cardiac involvement in varicella is extremely rare. There have been reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, but these are exceptional and not among the most common complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is a white, non-scrapable lesion that typically appears on the lateral borders of the tongue. It is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection and is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. EBV infects oral epithelial cells, leading to hyperproliferation and thickening of the epithelium, which causes the characteristic corrugated, \"hairy\" appearance of the lesion. OHL is painless, and unlike oral candidiasis, it does not scrape off. It is not premalignant and does not require treatment unless symptomatic, though it may indicate a worsening of immune suppression, especially in HIV-positive patients. Incorrect Options: (B) CMV (Cytomegalovirus) – Incorrect CMV is another opportunistic virus seen in immunocompromised patients, but it primarily causes retinitis, esophagitis, colitis, and pneumonia rather than oral hairy leukoplakia. (C) HIV – Incorrect HIV is a predisposing factor for oral hairy leukoplakia but not the direct cause. HIV-induced immunosuppression allows EBV to reactivate, leading to the development of OHL. However, HIV itself does not directly cause the lesion. (D) HZV (Herpes Zoster Virus) – Incorrect HZV (Varicella-Zoster Virus) causes shingles and varicella (chickenpox). While it can affect the oral mucosa in cases of zoster reactivation, it does not cause oral hairy leukoplakia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Double-stranded DNA. Adenoviruses belong to the Adenoviridae family and are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. They are icosahedral in shape and have a linear double-stranded DNA genome. Adenoviruses are responsible for a variety of human infections, including respiratory illnesses (pharyngoconjunctival fever), gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and keratoconjunctivitis. They are highly stable in the environment due to their lack of an envelope, making them resistant to detergents and desiccation. Incorrect Options: (B) Enveloped – Incorrect Adenoviruses are non-enveloped. The absence of an envelope makes them more resistant to disinfectants and environmental stress, allowing them to survive outside the host for extended periods. Enveloped viruses, like herpesviruses and influenza viruses, are generally more susceptible to environmental destruction. (C) Complex symmetry – Incorrect Adenoviruses have icosahedral symmetry, not complex symmetry. Complex symmetry is seen in poxviruses, which have a brick-shaped or ovoid appearance. Adenoviruses, on the other hand, have a well-defined icosahedral capsid with fibers protruding from the vertices. (D) None – Incorrect This option is incorrect because adenoviruses are clearly characterized as double-stranded DNA viruses, making option (A) the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). African Burkitt’s lymphoma is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV is a gamma herpesvirus that infects B lymphocytes and can cause uncontrolled proliferation in immunocompromised individuals. The virus promotes c-Myc oncogene translocation, specifically t(8;14) translocation, leading to dysregulated cell growth and malignancy. Endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma is common in malaria-endemic regions of Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum infection plays a co-factorial role by impairing the immune response to EBV, allowing persistent viral infection and subsequent malignancy. Incorrect Options: (A) Cytomegalovirus – Incorrect Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta herpesvirus that can cause congenital infections, mononucleosis-like illness, and opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, but it is not associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma. (C) Herpes zoster – Incorrect Herpes zoster (Varicella-zoster virus, VZV) is a neurotropic herpesvirus that causes chickenpox (primary infection) and shingles (reactivation). It does not play a role in the development of Burkitt’s lymphoma. (D) Infectious mononucleosis – Incorrect While infectious mononucleosis (IM) is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), not all EBV infections lead to Burkitt’s lymphoma. IM is a self-limiting disease primarily affecting adolescents and young adults, characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. However, Burkitt’s lymphoma arises due to persistent EBV infection and additional genetic mutations, particularly in malaria-endemic areas.",

It primarily affects B lymphocytes, not T-cells. The disease is characterized by c-Myc oncogene translocation (t(8;14)), which leads to uncontrolled B-cell proliferation. There are three forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma: endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated, all of which involve B-cells rather than T-cells. Incorrect Options: (A) Ether-sensitive – Correct Statement Herpesviruses are enveloped viruses, and ether sensitivity is a characteristic of enveloped viruses because ether dissolves lipid membranes. Since herpesviruses possess a lipid envelope, they are inactivated by ether and other lipid solvents. (B) May cause malignancy – Correct Statement Several Herpesviruses are associated with malignancies: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) – Causes Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) – Associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma. These viruses integrate their DNA into host cells, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumorigenesis. (C) HSV-II involves below the diaphragm – Correct Statement Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is primarily responsible for genital herpes, which involves regions below the diaphragm (i.e., genitals and perineum). In contrast, HSV-1 is mainly responsible for oral and facial lesions (above the diaphragm), though both viruses can cause infections at either site.",

Incorrect Options: (A) Enterovirus – Incorrect Enteroviruses belong to the Picornaviridae family and include poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and enterovirus D68. These are non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses primarily associated with diseases like hand-foot-mouth disease, poliomyelitis, and viral meningitis.

The virus integrates into host epithelial cells, promoting uncontrolled cell growth through viral oncogenes such as LMP1 (latent membrane protein 1) and EBNA1 (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1). EBV is also associated with other malignancies such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), but its strongest association with epithelial malignancy is nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Incorrect Options: (B) CRF (Chronic Renal Failure) – Incorrect EBV is not a known cause of chronic renal failure (CRF).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Macrocephaly. Congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) occurs when a fetus is infected with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) during the first 20 weeks of gestation. This leads to multiple congenital anomalies, primarily affecting the skin, limbs, and central nervous system (CNS). However, macrocephaly (enlarged head size) is not a typical feature of congenital varicella infection. Instead, microcephaly (small head size) may be observed due to cortical atrophy and neurological damage. Incorrect Options: (B) Limb hypoplasia – Correct Feature of CVS Limb hypoplasia (underdevelopment of limbs) is a characteristic feature of congenital varicella infection. The virus disrupts limb development, leading to shortened or malformed limbs, particularly when infection occurs in early pregnancy.

Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the primary causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a vascular tumor that commonly affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. HHV-8 induces angiogenesis and promotes the uncontrolled proliferation of endothelial cells, leading to the characteristic purplish-red skin lesions of Kaposi’s sarcoma. It is also associated with primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease. Incorrect Options: (A) Burkitt’s Lymphoma – Caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Burkitt’s lymphoma is a B-cell malignancy strongly linked to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), not HHV-8.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 is the causative agent of erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), a common childhood exanthem. The hallmark feature of this disease is the \"slapped cheek\" appearance, characterized by bright red rash on both cheeks. This is followed by a lace-like rash on the trunk and extremities. The virus primarily affects erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, leading to transient aplastic crisis in individuals with underlying hemolytic disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis). Transmission: It spreads via respiratory droplets, blood transfusion, and transplacentally, potentially causing hydrops fetalis in pregnant women. Incorrect Options: (B) JC Virus – Causes Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) JC virus is a polyomavirus that does not cause erythema infectiosum or the \"slapped cheek\" rash. Instead, it leads to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., AIDS patients), affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and causing demyelination. (C) Rotavirus – Causes Gastroenteritis Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrhea and dehydration in children but is not associated with any rash. It primarily affects the small intestine, leading to watery diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. The \"slapped cheek\" rash is not a feature of rotavirus infection. (D) Mumps – Causes Parotitis Mumps virus, a paramyxovirus, primarily causes painful swelling of the parotid glands (parotitis), along with fever and malaise. It can also lead to orchitis, meningitis, and pancreatitis. However, it does not present with a \"slapped cheek\" rash.",

It is highly contagious and typically spreads through respiratory droplets or contaminated water (e.g., swimming pools). The disease is characterized by a triad of symptoms: pharyngitis (sore throat), conjunctivitis (eye redness), and fever. PCF is commonly seen in children and young adults, especially in summer camps and swimming pools, leading to its nickname \"swimming pool conjunctivitis.\" Incorrect Options: (B) Adenovirus 11, 21 – Causes Hemorrhagic Cystitis Adenovirus serotypes 11 and 21 are primarily associated with hemorrhagic cystitis, which presents with dysuria (painful urination) and hematuria (blood in urine). They do not typically cause pharyngoconjunctival fever. (C) Adenovirus 40, 41 – Causes Gastroenteritis Serotypes 40 and 41 of adenovirus are major causes of viral gastroenteritis, particularly in young children. They are not associated with pharyngitis or conjunctivitis but instead lead to watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. (D) Adenovirus 8, 10 – Causes Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) Adenovirus serotypes 8 and 10 are linked to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), a more severe and contagious eye infection. EKC presents with painful conjunctivitis, photophobia, and corneal involvement, leading to subepithelial corneal infiltrates, which can impair vision temporarily.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 90%. A newly diagnosed genital herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection is highly likely to undergo reactivation within the first year. Studies indicate that more than 90% of individuals with a primary HSV-2 infection will experience at least one recurrence within the first 12 months. HSV-2 establishes lifelong latency in the sacral ganglia, and periodic reactivation leads to symptomatic or asymptomatic viral shedding. The frequency of recurrences is highest in the first year and tends to decrease over time as the immune system builds a partial response. Incorrect Options: (A) 5% This percentage is far too low. Reactivation occurs in almost all newly infected individuals within the first year, not just 5%. (B) 25% Although this might represent the proportion of individuals who experience very frequent symptomatic recurrences, the overall likelihood of any reactivation (symptomatic or asymptomatic) is much higher.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) If the heterophile antibody test result is negative, testing for IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigen will likely be diagnostic. This patient’s presentation, including fatigue, malaise, low-grade fever, sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and a rash after taking ampicillin, is highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The preferred diagnostic test is the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test), which detects antibodies that react with horse or sheep red blood cells. However, if the heterophile antibody test is negative, the more appropriate next step is testing for IgM (not IgG) antibodies against the viral capsid antigen (VCA), which appear early in the infection. IgG antibodies indicate past exposure rather than an active infection, making this answer incorrect. Incorrect Options: (A) Greater than 10% atypical lymphocytosis is likely. Correct statement. In infectious mononucleosis, the immune response leads to a significant increase in atypical lymphocytes (>10%), which are activated CD8+ T cells. These cells appear large with irregular nuclei and abundant cytoplasm, characteristic of EBV infection. (B) Heterophile antibody testing will likely be diagnostic. Correct statement. The heterophile antibody (Monospot) test has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis, especially after the first week of illness. It detects antibodies produced in response to EBV infection. However, in some cases, particularly in early infection or young children, the test may be negative. (D) It is spread via contaminated saliva. Correct statement. EBV is known as the \"kissing disease\" because it spreads through saliva. It can also be transmitted through sharing drinks, utensils, or exposure to infected oral secretions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rest, supportive measures, and reassurance. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a self-limiting viral illness that primarily requires supportive care. Treatment focuses on adequate rest, hydration, pain management (with NSAIDs or acetaminophen), and throat lozenges for symptomatic relief. Patients should avoid contact sports for at least 3-4 weeks due to the risk of splenic rupture, a serious complication associated with EBV-induced splenomegaly. Since IM is a viral infection without a specific antiviral cure, reassurance and symptomatic management are the mainstay of treatment. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Acyclovir Incorrect. Acyclovir is an antiviral agent that targets herpesviruses, including EBV. However, its use in infectious mononucleosis does not significantly impact disease progression or symptoms. EBV remains latent in B cells and is not eliminated by acyclovir. (B) Acyclovir plus prednisone Incorrect. While glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) may be used in severe complications of IM (such as airway obstruction due to tonsillar hypertrophy, hemolytic anemia, or thrombocytopenia), routine use is not recommended in uncomplicated cases. Similarly, as noted above, acyclovir has minimal clinical benefit in EBV infections. (C) Ganciclovir Incorrect. Ganciclovir is an antiviral agent primarily used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, not EBV. CMV can cause mononucleosis-like symptoms, but in this case, the presence of heterophile antibody positivity strongly suggests EBV, making ganciclovir unnecessary.",

HHV-8 infection is more common in parts of Africa than in the United States. Primary HHV-8 infection in immunocompetent children may manifest as fever and maculopapular rash. Among individuals with intact immunity, chronic asymptomatic infection is the rule, and neoplastic disorders generally develop only after subsequent immunocompromise. In patients with AIDS, effective antiretroviral therapy has caused improvement in HHV-8–related disease.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Involvement of the soles of the feet. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection caused by the poxvirus, which leads to umbilicated, flesh-colored papules. It typically affects areas such as the face, trunk, extremities, and genital region but spares the palms and soles. The absence of involvement of the soles of the feet makes option (B) the correct exception. Lesions on the palms and soles are more characteristic of syphilis, hand-foot-mouth disease, or verruca plantaris (plantar warts) rather than molluscum contagiosum. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Involvement of the genitals Incorrect. Molluscum contagiosum frequently involves the genital region, particularly in adults, where it is often transmitted sexually. Genital involvement is a common presentation, especially in immunocompromised individuals. (C) Lack of inflammation or necrosis at the site of the rash Incorrect. Molluscum contagiosum lesions are usually smooth, firm, dome-shaped papules that lack inflammation or necrosis unless they become secondarily infected or irritated by scratching. The absence of inflammation is a key clinical feature. (D) Rash associated with an eczematous eruption Incorrect. Molluscum contagiosum can trigger an eczematous reaction (molluscum dermatitis) around the lesions, leading to redness and irritation. This occurs due to immune system activation in response to the virus. The presence of an eczematous eruption does not exclude molluscum contagiosum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The most likely diagnosis based on the patient’s antecedent illness with a facial rash is parvovirus infection. Arthropathy is uncommon in childhood parvovirus infection but may cause a diffuse symmetric arthritis in up to 50% of adults. This corresponds to the immune phase of illness when immunoglobulin M antibodies are developed. The arthropathy syndrome is more common in women than men. The distribution of affected joints is typically symmetric, most commonly in the small joints of the hands and less commonly the ankles, knees, and wrists. Occasionally the arthritis persists over months and can mimic rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor can be detected in serum. Parvovirus B19V infection may trigger rheumatoid disease in some patients and has been associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Reactive arthritis caused by Chlamydia spp. or a list of other bacterial pathogens tends to affect large joints such as the sacroiliac joints and spine. It is also sometimes accompanied by uveitis and urethritis. The large number of joints involved with a symmetric distribution argues against crystal or septic arthropathy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Vaccinees should continue to receive standard Pap smear testing. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is highly effective at preventing infections caused by high-risk HPV types (such as 16 and 18), which are responsible for the majority of cervical cancers. However, the vaccine does not protect against all oncogenic HPV types or pre-existing infections. Since HPV-related cervical cancer can still develop from non-vaccine strains, women who receive the vaccine should continue to undergo routine Pap smear (cervical cytology) screenings as per medical guidelines. Pap smears remain essential for the early detection of cervical dysplasia and cancer, ensuring comprehensive protection. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Both protect against genital warts. Incorrect. The quadrivalent (HPV4 - Gardasil) and nonavalent (HPV9 - Gardasil 9) vaccines protect against genital warts (caused by HPV types 6 and 11), but the bivalent vaccine (HPV2 - Cervarix) does not provide protection against genital warts, as it only targets high-risk cancer-causing HPV strains (16 and 18). Thus, this statement is not entirely accurate. (B) After becoming sexually active, women will derive little protective benefit from vaccination. Incorrect. While the HPV vaccine is most effective when given before sexual activity begins, sexually active individuals can still benefit from vaccination. Many individuals may not yet be exposed to all oncogenic HPV types, so vaccination can still prevent future infections with high-risk strains they have not yet encountered. (C) They are inactivated live virus vaccines. Incorrect. The HPV vaccines are not live virus vaccines. They are recombinant vaccines made using virus-like particles (VLPs) that mimic the structure of HPV but contain no viral DNA, meaning they cannot cause infection.",

It is not premalignant and is often unrecognized by the patient but is sometimes a cosmetic, symptomatic, and therapeutic nuisance. The white, thickened folds on the side of the tongue can be pruritic or painful and sometimes resolve with acyclovir derivatives or topical podophyllin resin. Ultimate resolution occurs after immune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy. Oral candidiasis or thrush is a very common, relatively easy-to-treat condition in HIV patients and takes on an appearance of white plaques on the tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa that bleed with blunt removal. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) recurrences or aphthous ulcers present as painful ulcerating lesions. The latter should be considered when oral ulcers persist, do not respond to acyclovir, and do not culture HSV. Kaposi’s sarcoma is uncommon in the oropharynx and takes on a violet hue, suggesting its highly vascularized content.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Integration of the viral genome The integration of the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome into the host cell DNA is a critical step in the development of cervical cancer. HPV, particularly high-risk types like HPV 16 and 18, can lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and eventually cervical cancer when its genome integrates into the host genome. This integration leads to increased expression of viral oncogenes E6 and E7, which inactivate tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb (retinoblastoma protein), respectively. E6 promotes p53 degradation, preventing apoptosis and allowing the accumulation of mutations. E7 binds and inactivates Rb, disrupting cell cycle control and leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Since persistent HPV infection with viral genome integration is a hallmark of progression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to invasive cervical cancer, option (A) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (B) Loss of HPV E6 and E7 genes – Incorrect. The E6 and E7 oncogenes are crucial for HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. If these genes were lost, HPV would not be able to disrupt tumor suppressor pathways, and malignant transformation would not occur. Instead, their overexpression is a key factor in cervical cancer development. (C) Mutation of the virus – Incorrect. Although mutations in HPV or host cell genes can contribute to cancer progression, they are not the primary mechanism. The major event leading to malignancy is viral genome integration and oncogene overexpression, rather than spontaneous viral mutation. (D) Viral replication – Incorrect. HPV replication occurs in differentiating epithelial cells, but replication alone does not lead to cancer. In fact, in productive HPV infections where viral replication occurs normally, the virus typically does not integrate into the host genome and may eventually be cleared by the immune system. Persistent infection with genome integration, rather than mere replication, drives cancer development.",

Parvovirus B19 is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects children and causes: Slapped cheek rash: Bright red cheeks are the hallmark feature. Lacy reticular rash: Spreads to the trunk and extremities after the fever subsides. Nonspecific prodromal symptoms: Fever, malaise, and headache often precede the rash. Transient aplastic crisis in sickle cell disease patients: Parvovirus B19 infects erythroid progenitor cells, leading to temporary anemia. Thus, the correct answer is (B) Parvovirus B19. Incorrect Answers: A. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 HSV-1 typically causes cold sores (herpetic gingivostomatitis) with painful vesicles on the lips and oral mucosa, not a widespread rash. It does not present with the slapped cheek appearance or lacy rash. Incorrect because HSV-1 does not cause erythema infectiosum. C. Rubella virus Rubella (German measles) presents with a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downward, but it does not have the slapped cheek appearance. Postauricular lymphadenopathy is a distinguishing feature. Incorrect because rubella lacks the characteristic facial rash of erythema infectiosum. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The presentation of vesicular lesions in mother and severe disease in the baby suggests congenital herpes acquired in utero. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of antiviral therapy with IV acyclovir is critical for survival of the infant. Neonatal herpes is more frequently acquired during or shortly after birth and can be categorized as skin, eye, and mucous membrane (SEM) disease appearing 10 to 12 days after birth, disseminated infection apparent within the first few days of life, or CNS infection occurring at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Recognition and treatment of neonatal herpes simplex SEM is important as without treatment, many will progress to disseminated disease. When lesions are present, the most rapid test that allows definitive identification is the direct immunofluores cence assay on cells from the lesions in which specific antisera against HSV-1 and HSV-2 are applied to the cells; the test takes as little as 30 minutes. Viral culture of the lesions would also be positive, but takes 18 to 14 hours. Tzanck smear would likely be positive as well, but the test only detects the presence of multinucleated giant cells suggestive of human herpesvirus infection. As the mother most likely has a primary infection with HSV, she is unlikely to have HSV-specific IgG antibodies ; HSV-specific IgM antibodies would not be transferred to the neonate. HSV PCR on cerebrospinal fluid, which takes several hours, is used to diagnosis suspected HSV meningitis or encephalitis and is often referred to specialty laboratories for testing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The lesions described and shown are characteristic of Kaposi sarcoma caused by human herpesvirus 8. This is the most common opportunistic skin disease seen in males with AIDS. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an indolent angio-proliferative spindle-cell tumor derived from endothelial and immune cells infected with human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8; also known as Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus [KSHV]). KS is categorized into the following 4 types : 1. Epidemic (AIDS related) 2. Iatrogenic (immunosuppressant therapy related) 3. Classic, or sporadic 4. Endemic (African) Bacillary angiomatosis, caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana, is the second most common; it is characterized by vascular blood-filled nodules. Human T-cell leukemia virus may cause nodular, indurated, or exfoliative skin lesions associated with acute T-cell leukemia. HPV causes papillomatous, or wartlike, outgrowths of the skin and mucous membranes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fifth Disease Explanation of the Correct Answer: The child presents with low-grade fever, coryza (runny nose), sore throat, and a bright red rash on the cheeks (\"slapped cheek\" appearance) followed by a more diffuse, less intense erythematous rash on the body. This clinical presentation is highly characteristic of Fifth Disease, which is caused by Parvovirus B19. Fifth Disease, also known as erythema infectiosum, is a common viral exanthem in children. It starts with non-specific flu-like symptoms (fever, malaise, sore throat, and runny nose), followed by a classic facial rash (\"slapped cheek\" rash) and a lace-like rash that spreads to the trunk and limbs. The disease is self-limiting, and diagnosis is confirmed by elevated IgM and IgG antibodies against Parvovirus B19: IgM antibodies indicate recent infection. IgG antibodies indicate past infection and immunity. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Acute Lyme Disease – Incorrect Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by Ixodes ticks and does not cause a \"slapped cheek\" rash. Early Lyme disease presents with erythema migrans (a bull's-eye rash), flu-like symptoms, and possible joint pain. IgM and IgG antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi would be elevated in Lyme disease, but the clinical presentation in this case does not match Lyme disease. (C) Possible Hepatitis B Infection – Incorrect Hepatitis B infection presents with jaundice, fatigue, nausea, dark urine, and liver enzyme abnormalities, none of which are present in this child. Hepatitis B serology tests look for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs, rather than IgM and IgG for Parvovirus B19. (D) Possible Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) – Incorrect SSPE is a rare, fatal late complication of measles (rubeola virus), occurring years after initial measles infection. Symptoms include progressive neurological deterioration (cognitive decline, seizures, myoclonus), which are absent in this patient. Diagnosis of SSPE involves detection of measles virus IgG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), not IgM and IgG titers found in Fifth Disease.",
