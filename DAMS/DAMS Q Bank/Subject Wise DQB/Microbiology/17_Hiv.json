      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is the most common cause of viral retinitis in HIV/AIDS patients, particularly when the CD4 count falls below 50 cells/µL. CMV retinitis presents with painless progressive visual loss, floaters, and visual disturbances. Fundoscopic examination typically reveals characteristic “pizza pie” or “cottage cheese with ketchup” lesions, consisting of bilateral retinal exudates, perivascular hemorrhages, and necrotizing retinitis. If untreated, CMV retinitis can progress to retinal detachment and blindness. Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet is essential for treatment. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Herpes simplex retinitis – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) retinitis is less common than CMV retinitis in HIV patients. HSV can cause acute retinal necrosis (ARN), which is more aggressive and associated with significant inflammation and vitritis. Unlike CMV retinitis, ARN typically affects immunocompetent individuals rather than HIV/AIDS patients. (B) Human herpes virus – Incorrect. The term \"Human herpes virus\" (HHV) is non-specific and includes multiple herpesviruses (e.g., HHV-1 to HHV-8). Among these, CMV (HHV-5) is the most relevant to HIV-associated retinitis, making this answer too broad and unspecific. (D) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) – Incorrect. EBV is not a common cause of retinitis in HIV/AIDS patients. Although EBV is associated with malignancies such as primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) in AIDS, it is not a major cause of viral retinitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Single-stranded RNA. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is an RNA virus belonging to the Retroviridae family and the Lentivirus genus. It contains two identical single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecules as its genetic material. Upon infection, the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is then integrated into the host genome. This integrated viral DNA, known as proviral DNA, allows the virus to persist in the host and replicate. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Single-stranded DNA – Incorrect. HIV does not contain single-stranded DNA as its genetic material. Instead, it initially carries single-stranded RNA, which is later converted into double-stranded DNA during replication. (C) Double-stranded DNA – Incorrect. HIV does produce double-stranded DNA during its replication cycle, but it does not contain it as its original genetic material. The virus enters the host as a single-stranded RNA virus. (D) Double-stranded RNA – Incorrect. HIV is not a double-stranded RNA virus. Double-stranded RNA viruses, such as Reoviruses (e.g., Rotavirus), have different replication mechanisms compared to HIV.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Dendritic cells do not support replication. This statement is false because dendritic cells do support HIV replication, although at lower levels compared to CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Dendritic cells play a crucial role in HIV transmission and dissemination. They capture HIV at mucosal surfaces via DC-SIGN receptors and transfer it to CD4+ T cells in lymphoid tissues, facilitating viral spread. While dendritic cells may not be the primary site of active replication, they harbor the virus and contribute to its persistence and immune evasion. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) p24 is used for early diagnosis – Correct. p24 is a core protein of HIV and one of the earliest detectable antigens in acute HIV infection. HIV p24 antigen testing is used for early diagnosis before antibodies develop, typically within 1-2 weeks of infection. This antigen is detected by fourth-generation HIV tests, which improve early detection compared to antibody-only tests. (B) Lysis of infected CD4 cells is seen – Correct. HIV primarily infects CD4+ T cells, leading to their destruction through direct viral cytopathic effects and immune-mediated mechanisms. Progressive CD4 cell depletion results in immune system failure and opportunistic infections, characteristic of AIDS. (D) Macrophage is a reservoir for the virus – Correct. Macrophages serve as a major reservoir for HIV, supporting viral persistence even in the presence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Unlike CD4+ T cells, macrophages are more resistant to lysis and can harbor HIV for extended periods, contributing to chronic infection and viral rebound when ART is stopped.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI or MAC - Mycobacterium avium complex). In HIV/AIDS patients, especially those with a CD4 count <50 cells/µL, MAC is a common cause of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and disseminated infection. MAC is an acid-fast bacillus (AFB)-positive organism that is found in stool samples of affected patients. It is an opportunistic pathogen that causes systemic infection, involving the gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Disseminated MAC infection presents with fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and significant weight loss, mimicking tuberculosis but with more gastrointestinal involvement. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Mycobacterium tuberculosis – Incorrect. While M. tuberculosis can be an opportunistic infection in HIV patients, it typically causes pulmonary or disseminated tuberculosis, not chronic diarrhea. AFB staining in stool is uncommon with TB, as it mainly affects the lungs and lymph nodes rather than the GI tract. (C) Mycobacterium leprae – Incorrect. M. leprae is the causative agent of leprosy, which primarily affects the skin and peripheral nerves. It does not cause diarrhea or significant GI involvement, making it an unlikely cause of AFB-positive organisms in stool. (D) Mycoplasmas – Incorrect. Mycoplasmas are not acid-fast bacilli (AFB-positive). They lack a cell wall and do not stain with acid-fast staining techniques. They are also not known to cause chronic diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Opportunistic infection. AIDS-related complex (ARC) is an intermediate stage between HIV infection and full-blown AIDS, characterized by persistent constitutional symptoms and opportunistic infections. Individuals with ARC typically experience weight loss, chronic diarrhea, night sweats, fever, and recurrent infections due to progressive immunosuppression. Opportunistic infections are the most common clinical manifestation and may include oral candidiasis (thrush), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, and chronic herpes simplex infections. As the CD4 count declines, the risk of severe opportunistic infections increases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Cancer related to AIDS – Incorrect. AIDS-defining cancers such as Kaposi’s sarcoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer typically occur in the later stages of AIDS, when the immune system is severely compromised. Although malignancies can be seen in ARC, opportunistic infections are a more prominent feature at this stage. (C) Generalized lymphadenopathy – Incorrect. Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is an early feature of HIV infection, often present before the onset of ARC. While lymphadenopathy may be seen in ARC, it is not the most significant manifestation compared to opportunistic infections. (D) Herpes zoster – Incorrect. While herpes zoster (shingles) is more common in HIV-infected individuals, it is not the defining characteristic of ARC. It is an opportunistic infection, but other infections, like fungal, bacterial, and protozoal infections, are more frequently associated with ARC progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Put the dressing material directly in an appropriate bag and send for incineration. Blood-soaked dressings from an HIV-positive patient are considered biomedical waste and should be disposed of as per standard infection control guidelines. The appropriate method of disposal is placing them in a yellow biohazard bag and sending them for incineration without any chemical pretreatment. Incineration at high temperatures effectively destroys HIV and other bloodborne pathogens, ensuring safe disposal. Chemical disinfection is not necessary prior to incineration for such waste, as incineration itself is the definitive method of pathogen destruction. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Pour 1% hypochlorite on the dressing material and send it for incineration in an appropriate bag – Incorrect. Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is commonly used for surface disinfection and liquid waste decontamination but is not required for blood-soaked dressings that are designated for incineration. Additionally, hypochlorite can produce toxic fumes and may react with organic material in an unpredictable way. (B) Pour 5% hypochlorite on the dressing material and send it for incineration in an appropriate bag – Incorrect. A higher concentration of hypochlorite is unnecessary and does not offer any additional benefits. Moreover, high concentrations of hypochlorite can cause chemical hazards and environmental contamination. (D) Pour 2% Lysol on the dressing material and send it for incineration in an appropriate bag – Incorrect. Lysol (phenol-based disinfectant) is used for surface disinfection, not for treating biomedical waste. Blood-soaked dressings must be directly incinerated without pretreatment, as adding chemicals does not enhance safety and may introduce additional hazards.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vascular. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a vascular tumor originating from endothelial cells of blood or lymphatic vessels. It is strongly associated with Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection and is commonly seen in HIV/AIDS patients as an AIDS-defining illness. The tumor manifests as purple, red, or brown skin lesions, often appearing on the extremities, face, and mucous membranes. Histologically, Kaposi’s sarcoma consists of spindle-shaped cells, slit-like vascular spaces, and extravasated red blood cells, confirming its vascular origin. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Lymphoid – Incorrect. Kaposi’s sarcoma does not originate from lymphoid tissue. Lymphoid malignancies include lymphomas (e.g., non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), which arise from B or T lymphocytes, whereas KS originates from vascular endothelial cells. (C) Neural – Incorrect. Neural tumors arise from nerve cells, Schwann cells, or glial cells, such as neurofibromas or gliomas. Kaposi’s sarcoma does not originate from neural tissue, and its histological features are distinct from neural tumors. (D) Muscular – Incorrect. Kaposi’s sarcoma is not derived from muscle cells.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) HIV ELISA. HIV ELISA is not used for the diagnosis of HIV infection in a 2-month-old child because this test detects maternal HIV antibodies (IgG), which can persist in the infant’s circulation for up to 18 months. Since maternal antibodies cross the placenta, a positive ELISA test in a newborn does not necessarily indicate an active HIV infection in the child. Instead, direct detection methods such as DNA PCR, viral culture, or p24 antigen assay are preferred for early diagnosis of HIV in infants. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) DNA PCR – Correct method. DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is the gold standard for diagnosing HIV infection in infants under 18 months. This test detects proviral HIV DNA integrated into the infant’s white blood cells, confirming active infection rather than passive maternal antibody transfer. (B) Viral culture – Correct method. HIV can be isolated from the infant’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using viral culture techniques, though this method is not widely used due to its labor-intensive nature and long turnaround time. (D) p24 antigen assay – Correct method. The p24 antigen test detects the HIV core protein (p24), which appears early in infection before antibody production. It is useful for early diagnosis in neonates but is less sensitive than DNA PCR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CD4+ helper cells. HIV primarily infects CD4+ T helper cells, which play a crucial role in immune regulation. The virus enters these cells by binding to the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4), allowing viral RNA to integrate into the host genome. As HIV replicates, it leads to progressive CD4+ cell depletion, weakening the immune system and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. The decline in CD4+ T cell count is a key marker of HIV disease progression, and AIDS is defined when CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/µL. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) CD8+ cells – Incorrect. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are not the primary target of HIV infection. Instead, they play an important role in controlling the infection by attacking HIV-infected cells. However, as the disease progresses and CD4+ cells are lost, CD8+ function also declines, worsening immune suppression. (C) Macrophages – Incorrect, but partially relevant. HIV can infect macrophages as they express low levels of CD4 along with CCR5 co-receptors. Macrophages act as a reservoir for HIV and contribute to viral persistence, especially in the brain, leading to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). However, they are not the primary site of viral replication. (D) Neutrophils – Incorrect. Neutrophils do not express CD4 receptors and are not directly infected by HIV. However, HIV-induced immunosuppression can lead to neutropenia, increasing susceptibility to bacterial infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sinus disease. HIV infection is not commonly associated with primary sinus disease. While individuals with HIV may develop sinus infections due to opportunistic pathogens, sinus disease is not a defining or characteristic feature of HIV infection. Instead, HIV primarily affects the immune system, leading to conditions such as opportunistic infections, neurological disorders, and systemic immune activation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) A glandular fever-like illness – Incorrect. Acute HIV infection (seroconversion illness) often resembles infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Symptoms include fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, rash, and malaise, which typically occur 2–4 weeks after exposure to HIV. (B) Generalized lymphadenopathy – Incorrect. Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is a hallmark of HIV infection, occurring due to immune activation and chronic viral replication. Enlarged lymph nodes are commonly found in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions and may persist for months to years. (C) Gonococcal septicemia – Incorrect. HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of severe and disseminated gonococcal infections due to immune suppression. Gonococcal septicemia (disseminated gonococcal infection, DGI) can present with arthritis, dermatitis, and bacteremia. (E) Pre-senile dementia – Incorrect. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) can cause early-onset cognitive impairment (pre-senile dementia). HIV directly affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to HIV-associated dementia (HAD), especially in advanced disease stages.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cryptococcus. Cryptococcus is not a recognized cause of persistent diarrhea in AIDS patients. Cryptococcus, particularly Cryptococcus neoformans, is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS), causing cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. It does not commonly cause gastrointestinal infections or chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Microsporidia – Incorrect. Microsporidia, including Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis, are known to cause chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients. These intracellular parasites infect the intestinal epithelium, leading to watery diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. (B) Cryptosporidium parvum – Incorrect. Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the most common causes of chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients. This protozoan parasite infects the small intestine, causing profuse, watery diarrhea, which can be life-threatening in severely immunocompromised individuals. (D) Isospora belli – Incorrect. Isospora belli (now called Cystoisospora belli) is another recognized cause of chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients. It leads to malabsorption, dehydration, and weight loss. Diagnosis is confirmed by acid-fast staining of stool samples. (E) Giardia lamblia – Incorrect. Giardia lamblia causes chronic diarrhea, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, including those with AIDS. It results in fatty, foul-smelling stools, malabsorption, and weight loss.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) None. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) does not have any of the listed gene names. The viral genome of HIV consists of three major structural genes: gag, pol, and env. These genes encode important viral proteins, but none of the options listed (Gp73, p24, Gp120, Gp5) are correct HIV genes. The confusion arises because some of these names refer to HIV proteins rather than genes. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Gp73 – Incorrect. Gp73 is not a gene or protein associated with HIV. It is a protein involved in cellular processes such as Golgi apparatus function and is not a recognized HIV-related protein. (B) p24 – Incorrect. p24 is not a gene but a protein encoded by the gag gene of HIV. It is one of the major core proteins of the HIV virus, forming the viral capsid. It is commonly used as a marker for detecting HIV infection in serological tests. (C) Gp120 – Incorrect. Gp120 is a protein, not a gene. It is a glycoprotein on the surface of HIV that is involved in the virus's attachment to CD4+ T cells, facilitating viral entry. The gene encoding this protein is the env gene. (D) Gp5 – Incorrect. Gp5 is not associated with HIV. It could refer to a protein in some other viruses but is not relevant to HIV.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most common cause of tuberculosis (TB) in AIDS patients in India, as it is globally the leading pathogen responsible for TB cases. HIV infection weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection, which can result in pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The combination of HIV and TB is a significant public health concern in India due to the high burden of both diseases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) M. avium intracellular – Incorrect. Mycobacterium avium intracellular is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause infections in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in late-stage HIV infection. However, it is much less common than M. tuberculosis in India among AIDS patients. This organism typically causes infections in advanced HIV or AIDS with very low CD4 counts. (C) M. scrofulaceum – Incorrect. Mycobacterium scrofulaceum is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) that causes infections, usually affecting the lymph nodes, but it is not a major cause of tuberculosis in AIDS patients. It is less commonly encountered than M. tuberculosis. (D) M. akari – Incorrect.

Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Reverse transcriptase – Incorrect. The reverse transcriptase enzyme is encoded by the Pol gene, not the Gag gene. Reverse transcriptase is essential for converting the viral RNA into DNA after HIV enters the host cell, which is a critical step for HIV replication. (C) Envelope – Incorrect. The envelope proteins of the HIV virus, which are responsible for allowing the virus to enter host cells, are encoded by the Env gene, not the Gag gene. These proteins include gp120 and gp41, which interact with the CD4 receptor and co-receptors on host cells. (D) Gene activation – Incorrect. The Gag gene does not directly involve gene activation. Instead, it codes for the structural proteins of the virus. Gene activation and regulation of transcription are typically associated with other viral genes, such as those involved in regulatory proteins (like Tat or Rev).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The correct answer is (A) 0.3%. The risk of acquiring HIV infection following a needle-stick injury is approximately 0.3% (or about 1 in 300). This is based on studies and data from healthcare settings, where the virus can be transmitted through contact with contaminated blood or bodily fluids. The risk can vary depending on factors such as the amount of blood involved, the type of needle, and the HIV status of the source person. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) 3-0% – Incorrect. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle-stick injury is much lower than 3%. The actual rate is 0.3%, not in the range of 3-0%. The rate cited here is overly high. (C) 0-30% – Incorrect. This is an exaggerated range. The actual risk is around 0.3%, and while there are many factors that influence the risk, it does not extend up to 30% in typical needle-stick injuries. (D) 0.003% – Incorrect. While 0.003% might be a figure for other risks or exposures, the documented risk of HIV transmission following a needle-stick injury is approximately 0.3%, which is much higher than this figure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cryptosporidium. In patients with AIDS, Cryptosporidium is one of the most common causative agents of diarrhea. This protozoan parasite can cause chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. The infection is often persistent and difficult to treat in these patients, leading to significant dehydration and malabsorption. Cryptosporidium infection is typically diagnosed by stool examination or through specialized tests like PCR. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Toxoplasma – Incorrect. While Toxoplasma gondii can cause infection in AIDS patients, it primarily leads to encephalitis and other central nervous system manifestations rather than diarrhea. Toxoplasma is not a common cause of gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea in AIDS patients. (C) Salmonellae – Incorrect. Salmonella infection is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal diseases but is not as frequent in AIDS patients as Cryptosporidium. Salmonella infections can occur in immunocompromised individuals, but they are not the leading cause of diarrhea in these patients. (D) Mycobacteria – Incorrect. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections may cause gastrointestinal symptoms in AIDS patients, but they are less commonly the primary cause of diarrhea compared to Cryptosporidium. Mycobacterial infections usually present with other systemic features and are diagnosed by specific tests like blood cultures or stool acid-fast bacilli staining.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Retrovirus. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is classified as a retrovirus, which is a type of virus that belongs to the family Retroviridae. Retroviruses have an RNA genome that they convert into DNA via the enzyme reverse transcriptase during the infection process. This is a hallmark of retroviruses, and HIV uses this method to integrate its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, leading to persistent infection. The ability to reverse transcribe RNA into DNA distinguishes retroviruses from other types of viruses. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Picorna virus – Incorrect. Picornavirus is a family of viruses that includes several important pathogens like polio virus, hepatitis A virus, and rhinovirus (the common cold virus). These viruses are RNA viruses, but they do not reverse transcribe their RNA into DNA and do not share characteristics with retroviruses. Therefore, HIV is not a picornavirus. (B) Pox virus – Incorrect. Poxviruses, like the smallpox virus, are a large group of viruses with a complex DNA genome. Unlike retroviruses, poxviruses do not reverse transcribe RNA into DNA, and they replicate within the cytoplasm of the host cell, not in the nucleus. HIV is not a poxvirus. (D) Herpes – Incorrect. Herpes viruses belong to the family Herpesviridae and include viruses like herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These are DNA viruses and do not have the RNA-to-DNA reverse transcription characteristic of retroviruses. Therefore, HIV is not a herpesvirus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) CD4+ T lymphocytes. HIV primarily infects CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are a critical part of the immune system. The virus binds to the CD4 receptor on the surface of these cells using its gp120 protein. This interaction allows HIV to enter the cells, where it replicates and eventually destroys the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Over time, the depletion of these cells compromises the immune system, leading to the progression of AIDS. CD4+ T cells are considered the primary target for HIV infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) CD8+ T lymphocytes – Incorrect. While CD8+ T lymphocytes play an important role in the immune response by killing infected cells, they are not the primary targets for HIV infection. Instead, CD8+ T cells help control and suppress viral replication by killing HIV-infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, but they are not infected by the virus itself. (C) B cells – Incorrect. B cells are responsible for producing antibodies in response to infections. Although they play a key role in the immune system, they are not the primary targets of HIV infection. HIV mainly targets CD4+ T lymphocytes and can occasionally infect other immune cells like macrophages, but B cells are not typically infected by HIV. (D) Macrophages – Incorrect. Macrophages can be infected by HIV, and the virus can replicate within these cells. However, the primary cells that HIV targets are CD4+ T lymphocytes. Macrophages act as reservoirs for the virus, and while they can facilitate viral spread, they are not the main cells infected by HIV.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Seen in heterosexual only. This statement is false because AIDS is not exclusive to heterosexual individuals. HIV/AIDS can affect individuals regardless of sexual orientation. It can be transmitted through heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual contact, as well as through other modes of transmission like blood transfusions, sharing needles, and from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding. Therefore, AIDS is not seen only in heterosexual individuals but in anyone who is at risk for HIV infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Caused by retrovirus – Correct. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is a type of retrovirus. Retroviruses are RNA viruses that use reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's genome, leading to chronic infection and progressive immune system damage, characteristic of AIDS. (C) Candidiasis is also common feature – Correct. Candidiasis (often oral thrush or vaginal candidiasis) is a common opportunistic infection seen in individuals with AIDS. It occurs due to the immune system's weakened state, particularly when CD4+ T lymphocyte counts drop significantly. Candidiasis is one of the early indicators of AIDS progression. (D) Retrovirus is thermolabile – Correct. Retroviruses, including HIV, are indeed thermolabile, meaning they are sensitive to heat and can be inactivated by elevated temperatures. This is one of the reasons why HIV does not survive well outside the human body, especially in environments with high temperatures.",

This enzyme is essential for the replication of retroviruses like HIV. It allows the viral RNA genome to be reverse-transcribed into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's genome. This process is what distinguishes retroviruses from other viruses, as they must first convert their RNA into DNA before they can replicate within the host cell. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) DNA polymerase – Incorrect. DNA polymerase is an enzyme that synthesizes DNA from a DNA template, not an RNA template.

DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an enzyme that synthesizes RNA from a DNA template. This process, known as transcription, is a key step in protein synthesis but is not what reverse transcriptase does. Reverse transcriptase works in the opposite direction by creating DNA from an RNA template. (D) None – Incorrect. The correct answer is (C), as explained above.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) ELISA. ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is the standard screening test used to detect the presence of HIV antibodies in an individual’s blood. It is a highly sensitive and widely used method for initial screening. If the ELISA test is positive, further confirmatory tests, such as the Western blot or PCR, are done to validate the results. ELISA is the first-line screening method because it is cost-effective, easy to perform, and capable of detecting HIV antibodies early in the infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) PCR – Incorrect. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a confirmatory test used to detect the HIV RNA or viral load in an individual’s blood. While PCR is important for diagnosing HIV and assessing viral replication, it is not the primary screening test. It is typically used when further confirmation is needed or when monitoring the progression of the disease. (C) Western blot – Incorrect. Western blot is a confirmatory test, not a screening test. It is used after a positive ELISA test to confirm the presence of HIV infection by detecting specific proteins (antibodies) associated with HIV. It is more specific than ELISA but not used for initial screening because of its complexity and higher cost. (D) CD-4 count – Incorrect. CD-4 count measures the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the blood and is used to assess the immune status of a person with HIV. While it is an important test for monitoring disease progression and guiding treatment decisions, it is not used for screening HIV infection.",

These enzymes are essential for converting HIV RNA into DNA and for integrating the viral genome into the host's DNA. (C) Env – Incorrect. The Env gene encodes the envelope proteins of HIV, including the gp120 and gp41 proteins. These proteins are involved in the virus's ability to enter host cells, specifically by binding to the CD4 receptors on T lymphocytes and other cells.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 6-8 weeks. The p24 antigen is a core protein of the HIV virus and can be detected in the blood shortly after infection, often during the acute phase of HIV infection. However, it disappears from the blood within 6-8 weeks post-infection as the body begins to mount an immune response and HIV-specific antibodies are produced. Once the antibodies are present, they effectively bind to the p24 antigen, leading to a decrease in its detectability in the bloodstream. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) 2-4 weeks – Incorrect. While the p24 antigen can be detected soon after infection, it typically remains detectable for a longer period (6-8 weeks). By 2-4 weeks, the immune system is starting to respond, but p24 levels are still often detectable. (B) 4-6 weeks – Incorrect. By 4-6 weeks, the p24 antigen is still present in the blood, but it's generally not until the 6-8 week mark that its levels drop significantly, coinciding with the development of detectable HIV antibodies. (D) 8-10 weeks – Incorrect. 8-10 weeks is later than the typical time frame for the disappearance of p24 antigen, which usually occurs by the 6-8 week period. At this point, the HIV-specific antibodies are well established, and p24 antigen is generally no longer detectable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Risk of HIV in the baby is up to 90%. The risk of transmitting HIV from mother to child is not up to 90%. With appropriate interventions such as antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and possibly postnatal ART for the newborn, the risk of transmission can be reduced to less than 1-2%. Without intervention, the risk of vertical transmission can be as high as 25-30%, not 90%. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) HIV infection cannot be diagnosed in the baby with available methods – Incorrect. It is false that HIV cannot be diagnosed in the baby. HIV can be diagnosed in infants through PCR testing or the detection of HIV-specific antibodies, although antibodies from the mother may still be present for up to 18 months. PCR testing is used to confirm HIV infection in the infant by detecting the virus itself. (C) AIDS can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery – Incorrect. This is true. HIV transmission can occur during delivery (labor and vaginal birth) due to contact with infected maternal blood and fluids. The mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) can affect the likelihood of transmission, with cesarean delivery often being recommended in certain circumstances (e.g., when maternal viral load is high). (D) Breastfeeding can transmit AIDS – Incorrect. This is true. HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, and breastfeeding is a recognized route of HIV transmission from mother to child. Therefore, HIV-positive mothers are often advised to avoid breastfeeding, especially in regions where safe alternatives are available.",

Aspergillosis primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, but it is a fungal, not bacterial, infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cryptosporidiosis – Incorrect. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium, and it is indeed common in HIV patients, especially those with advanced immunosuppression. This infection leads to persistent diarrhea, a significant issue in HIV/AIDS patients. (B) Atypical mycobacterial infection – Incorrect.

One of the common manifestations of Toxoplasma infection in HIV patients is cerebral toxoplasmosis, which can cause neurological symptoms like hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), headache, and vomiting, all of which are characteristic of increased intracranial pressure or brain lesions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Gonococcus – Incorrect. Gonococcus (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) is a bacterium that causes gonorrhea, typically affecting the genitourinary tract. It is not typically associated with neurological symptoms like hemiparesis, headache, or vomiting in HIV patients. (B) Streptococcus – Incorrect. Streptococcus species, while capable of causing infections such as meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis, are not typically the cause of hemiparesis, headache, and vomiting in HIV patients. While HIV can increase the risk of infections like bacterial meningitis, Toxoplasmosis is more commonly associated with the neurological symptoms described. (D) None – Incorrect.

This co-receptor is a chemokine receptor found on the surface of various immune cells, including CD4+ T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. HIV uses the CCR5 receptor along with CD4 to initiate infection. The R5 variant is the most common form of HIV in early stages of infection, and individuals who have mutations in the CCR5 receptor (such as those with a CCR5-Δ32 allele) can have a degree of resistance to infection by R5-tropic HIV. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Integrin – Incorrect. Integrins are a type of adhesion molecule that play a role in cell signaling and immune responses, but they are not involved in the entry of HIV into host cells. They are not co-receptors for HIV infection. (C) CXCR4 – Incorrect. CXCR4 is the co-receptor used by the X4 variant of HIV, not the R5 variant. The X4 variant typically emerges later in infection when the virus begins to use the CXCR4 receptor to enter cells, often associated with a more advanced stage of HIV infection. While both CCR5 and CXCR4 can serve as co-receptors, they are used by different strains of HIV.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Enhancing viral replication. The Nef gene in HIV encodes a protein called Nef (Negative Regulatory Factor), which plays a critical role in the virus's ability to replicate and cause disease. Nef enhances viral replication by manipulating the host cell's machinery to favor the virus’s survival and replication. Nef does this by downregulating the expression of certain host cell surface molecules, such as CD4, and promoting the recycling of these molecules, making the host cell more susceptible to infection and helping the virus to replicate more efficiently. Additionally, Nef plays a key role in immune evasion by modulating the immune response. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Enhancing the expression of genes – Incorrect. Nef does not directly enhance the expression of host genes. Instead, it manipulates host cell processes to promote viral replication and immune evasion, rather than promoting the expression of cellular genes in general. (C) Decreasing viral replication – Incorrect. Nef actually increases, not decreases, viral replication. It is a key factor in promoting HIV’s replication within infected cells, making the virus more effective in spreading throughout the body. (D) Maturation – Incorrect. The Nef protein is not involved in the maturation of HIV particles. Maturation of HIV occurs through the action of the pol gene-encoded protease enzyme, which processes the viral polyprotein into mature functional components. Nef is not involved in this maturation step.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 2 hours of exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within 2 hours of exposure. The earlier PEP is started, the more effective it is in reducing the risk of HIV transmission. PEP consists of a 28-day course of antiretroviral therapy (ART), typically including tenofovir, emtricitabine, and dolutegravir (or raltegravir). While PEP can still be initiated up to 72 hours post-exposure, its effectiveness decreases with time, making early initiation crucial. The goal is to prevent viral replication before the virus establishes infection in host cells. Incorrect options: (B) 4 hours of exposure – Incorrect. While 4 hours is still within the optimal window for initiating PEP, the guideline recommendation is to start as soon as possible, preferably within 2 hours. Delaying even a few hours may reduce efficacy. (C) 72 hours of exposure – Incorrect. PEP can be given within 72 hours post-exposure, but it is most effective when started earlier. Waiting too long increases the risk of HIV establishing infection, reducing PEP's ability to prevent seroconversion. (D) 20 minutes of exposure – Incorrect. Although sooner is better, 20 minutes is an arbitrarily short time frame that is not a strict cutoff. The recommendation is as soon as possible, preferably within 2 hours.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) HIV ELISA. In a 2-month-old infant, HIV ELISA (which detects HIV antibodies) is not useful for diagnosis because maternal HIV antibodies (IgG) cross the placenta and can persist in the baby’s circulation for up to 18 months, leading to false-positive results. Since ELISA cannot distinguish between maternal and infant antibodies, it is not reliable for early infant diagnosis. Instead, molecular tests that detect the virus itself, such as DNA-PCR, are preferred for diagnosing HIV in infants. Incorrect options: (A) DNA-PCR – Correct method, so incorrect choice. HIV DNA-PCR is the gold standard for early infant diagnosis. It detects proviral HIV DNA integrated into the infant’s cells, making it a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying true HIV infection. It can be performed as early as birth and is typically repeated at 6 weeks and 3 months to confirm results. (B) Viral culture – Correct method, so incorrect choice. HIV can be cultured from blood or other tissues, but this method is not commonly used due to its complexity, time consumption, and high cost. While possible, it is not the preferred method for early diagnosis in infants. (D) p24 antigen assay – Correct method, so incorrect choice. The p24 antigen assay detects the HIV p24 core protein, which appears in early infection before antibodies develop. While it is less sensitive than DNA-PCR, it can be used in infants, particularly in high-risk cases. However, due to its lower sensitivity in neonates, DNA-PCR remains the preferred choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Prevent vertical transmission. Antenatal HIV diagnosis is crucial to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, which can occur during pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breastfeeding. Early diagnosis allows for timely interventions, including: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the mother to reduce viral load Elective cesarean section if indicated Neonatal PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) with antiretrovirals Avoidance of breastfeeding if formula feeding is feasible Without intervention, the risk of vertical transmission is 15-45%, but with proper ART and preventive measures, this risk can be reduced to less than 1%. Therefore, early HIV diagnosis in pregnancy is essential for preventing transmission and ensuring a healthy outcome for both mother and child. Incorrect options: (B) Terminate – Incorrect. HIV diagnosis does not mandate termination of pregnancy. With effective ART, HIV-positive mothers can have safe pregnancies and deliver healthy, HIV-negative babies. Termination is not recommended solely based on HIV status. (C) Discharge – Incorrect. HIV diagnosis during pregnancy requires medical care, counseling, and follow-up, not discharge. Pregnant women with HIV should receive regular antenatal checkups, ART, and monitoring for opportunistic infections to ensure the best outcomes. (D) Isolate the patient – Incorrect. HIV is not spread through casual contact, and isolation is unnecessary. Stigmatizing or isolating HIV-positive pregnant women discourages proper care-seeking behavior and goes against ethical medical practices. Standard precautions in medical settings are sufficient to prevent transmission.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ganciclovir. The patient is an AIDS patient with progressive visual blurring and retinal lesions, which is highly suggestive of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals, particularly in HIV/AIDS patients with CD4 counts below 50 cells/µL. Ganciclovir is a first-line antiviral treatment for CMV infections, including CMV retinitis. It is a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral DNA polymerase, effectively reducing viral replication and preventing further retinal damage. Incorrect options: (A) Acyclovir – Incorrect. Acyclovir is primarily used for Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) infections. However, it is not effective against CMV, as CMV lacks the viral thymidine kinase enzyme required for acyclovir activation. (B) Amantadine – Incorrect. Amantadine is an antiviral drug used against Influenza A virus. It works by inhibiting the M2 ion channel to prevent viral uncoating. However, it has no role in treating CMV infections. (C) Flucytosine – Incorrect. Flucytosine is an antifungal used in combination therapy for Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida infections.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) NK cells because HIV does not directly infect natural killer (NK) cells. While HIV can impact NK cell function indirectly by altering the immune environment, NK cells lack CD4 receptors, which are the primary entry points for HIV. Hence, HIV does not actively replicate within NK cells. Incorrect Options: (A) T helper cells – Incorrect HIV primarily infects CD4+ T helper cells, leading to their progressive depletion. The virus binds to the CD4 receptor and uses coreceptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) for entry, causing immune system dysfunction and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. (B) Macrophages – Incorrect HIV infects macrophages, which act as reservoirs for the virus. Macrophages express CD4 receptors and CCR5 coreceptors, allowing HIV entry. They also contribute to viral dissemination and chronic inflammation. (D) B lymphocytes – Incorrect Although HIV does not directly infect B lymphocytes, it affects B cell function by disrupting CD4+ T cell regulation. This results in polyclonal B cell activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and impaired antibody responses, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. (E) Follicular dendritic cells – Incorrect Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) trap and present HIV to T helper cells in lymphoid tissues, aiding in the persistence of infection.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis presents with early manifestations of headache, nausea, gait disturbance, confusion, and visual changes. Fever and nuchal rigidity are often mild or absent. Papilledema is present in more than 30% of cases. Asymmetric cranial nerve palsies occur in 25% of cases. Neuroimaging findings are often normal. If there are focal neurologic findings, magnetic resonance imaging may be used to diagnose cryptococcomas in the basal ganglia or caudate nucleus, although they are more common in immunocompetent patients with Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii. Imaging does not make the diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis remains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. However, capsular antigen testing in both the serum and the CSF is very sensitive and can provide a presumptive diagnosis. Approximately 90% of patients, including all with a positive CSF smear, and the majority of AIDS patients have detectable cryptococcal antigen. The result is often negative in patients with isolated pulmonary disease. However, because of a very small false-positive rate in antigen testing, CSF culture remains the definitive diagnostic test. In this condition C. neoformans often can also be cultured from the urine; however, other testing methods are more rapid and useful.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cefotaxime. Rhodococcus equi is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly affects immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV and a CD4 count below 100 cells/µL. It typically causes pneumonia with necrotizing nodules on chest radiograph. Given its distinctive gram-positive coccobacilli morphology and characteristic growth in culture, it is diagnosed in this patient who presents with pneumonia and has a HIV infection with a history of poor HAART adherence. The standard treatment for Rhodococcus equi infections includes macrolides, linezolid, and tigecycline, which are effective against this pathogen. However, cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, is not effective against Rhodococcus equi, as it is generally resistant to cephalosporins. This is why cefotaxime is not a suitable choice for therapy in this case. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Azithromycin: Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is an appropriate treatment for Rhodococcus equi infections. It is commonly used in combination with other antibiotics, such as rifampin, for optimal therapy. Azithromycin is effective against Rhodococcus equi due to its activity against this pathogen, making it an appropriate choice for this patient. (C) Linezolid: Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic effective against gram-positive bacteria, including Rhodococcus equi. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Linezolid is an excellent option for treating Rhodococcus equi infections, especially in immunocompromised patients like those with HIV. (D) Tigecycline: Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antibiotic that is effective against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Rhodococcus equi. It is often used to treat serious infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms, making it an appropriate treatment for this patient's Rhodococcus equi pneumonia.",

This qualitative test for detection of HIV virions is positive at the time symptoms of acute infection appear, as early as 7 days postinfection; the test is also positive in asymptomatic individuals and is used to s creen donated blood. The test for HIV p24 antigen is the next to become positive, 17 to 38 days after infection. Antibodies appear last at 21 to 42 days (3 to 6 weeks) postinfection. While there is some difference in the time to positivity of the various types of HIV antibody tests, the HIV antibody test by ELISA would be no more likely to be positive this early than the latex aggregation test. The western blot for HIV antibodies is used to confirm positive s creening tests for antibodies. The CD4 T-cell count is used to assess status of the immune system, determine the timing for treatment, suggest the likelihood of onset of various opportunistic infections, and monitor progress response of the immune system to treatment. The count is unlikely to be decreased at 2 weeks postinfection although a drop does coincide with the peak of viremia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Patients often improve rapidly on appropriate HAART; their CD4 lymphocyte counts increase and their HIV viral loads are drastically reduced, often to less than 50 copies per milliliter. These two changes are indicative of the fact that the antiretroviral therapy has been effective. While her risk of contracting some opportunistic infections, such as esophagitis caused by Candida albicans or cytomegalovirus, Cryptococcus neofor-mans meningitis, Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis, or Cryptosporidium parvum diarrhea, has lessened, she is still at risk for other opportunistic infections. These include polydermatomal VZV (shingles), acquisition or reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, oral hairy leukoplakia caused by Epstein–Barr virus, and C. albicans pharyngitis (thrush), as well as recurrent bacterial pneumonia. Thus, choice (a), the patient is no longer in danger of opportunistic infections, is incorrect. While she may have an excellent 5-year prognosis, that cannot be stated at this time. The patient still has viral RNA present and must be considered infectious, so choice (d) is incorrect; even if her HIV RNA drops to undetectable levels, she could still harbor the virus within macrophages, dendritic cells, or other cells within her body.",
