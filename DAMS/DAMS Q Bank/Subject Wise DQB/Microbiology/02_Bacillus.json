      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Anthrax of skin. A malignant pustule is a characteristic lesion of cutaneous anthrax, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis. The lesion starts as a painless papule that enlarges to form a vesicle, which later ulcerates and develops a black necrotic eschar surrounded by edema. This painless black eschar with surrounding edema is a hallmark of cutaneous anthrax. The infection occurs through direct contact with spores from contaminated animal products such as wool, hides, or bone meal fertilizer. If untreated, the infection can spread systemically, leading to septicemia and death. Explanation of Other Options: (A) Carbuncle – (Incorrect) A carbuncle is a deep skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, involving multiple interconnected furuncles (boils). It presents as a painful, swollen, red mass with multiple pus-draining sinuses, but it does not form a black eschar like a malignant pustule. (B) Ulcerating melanoma – (Incorrect) Ulcerating melanoma is a form of malignant melanoma, a skin cancer arising from melanocytes. It presents as an irregular, pigmented ulcerated lesion that may bleed easily but does not have the black necrotic eschar with surrounding edema seen in cutaneous anthrax. (D) Pyoderma – (Incorrect) Pyoderma refers to bacterial skin infections, commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It includes conditions like impetigo, folliculitis, and ecthyma, which present with pustules, crusted lesions, and abscesses but lack the characteristic painless black eschar of cutaneous anthrax.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Presence of abdominal pain. Bacillus cereus food poisoning presents with abdominal pain as a key symptom. It occurs due to two different toxins produced by the bacterium: Emetic type (heat-stable toxin) – Causes rapid-onset vomiting (within 1–6 hours), typically linked to consumption of contaminated rice and starchy foods. Diarrheal type (heat-labile enterotoxin) – Causes delayed-onset watery diarrhea (8–16 hours after ingestion), often associated with meat, vegetables, and dairy products. Both types may present with abdominal pain and cramping, making it a characteristic feature of B. cereus food poisoning. Explanation of Other Options: (A) Presence of fever – (Incorrect) Bacillus cereus food poisoning is a toxin-mediated illness, meaning it does not cause fever. Fever is typically seen in invasive bacterial infections like Salmonella or Campylobacter, but not in toxin-mediated gastroenteritis. (C) Absence of vomiting – (Incorrect) The emetic type of B. cereus food poisoning is characterized by profuse vomiting, similar to Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. It occurs due to the ingestion of the pre-formed heat-stable toxin, which rapidly stimulates the vomiting center. Therefore, vomiting is present in one form of B. cereus food poisoning. (D) Absence of diarrhea – (Incorrect) The diarrheal type of B. cereus food poisoning presents with watery diarrhea, due to the heat-labile enterotoxin, which increases intestinal fluid secretion. Therefore, diarrhea is present in this form of B. cereus infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bacillus anthracis. Malignant pustule is a cutaneous form of anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. The infection occurs when the spores of Bacillus anthracis come into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, leading to the development of a painful ulcer with a characteristic black necrotic center surrounded by edematous tissue. The lesion is typically localized and is one of the first signs of cutaneous anthrax. Malignant pustule is a hallmark of anthrax infection, especially in people who handle animals or animal products (e.g., farmers or butchers), as they are at higher risk of exposure to the spores. Explanation of Other Options: (A) Corynebacterium diphtheriae – (Incorrect) Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the causative agent of diphtheria, a respiratory infection characterized by the formation of a pseudomembrane in the throat. While Corynebacterium diphtheriae can cause severe respiratory illness, it is not associated with malignant pustules. Diphtheria typically affects the upper respiratory tract, leading to symptoms like sore throat, fever, and difficulty swallowing, but not cutaneous lesions. (B) Clostridium tetani – (Incorrect) Clostridium tetani is the bacterium responsible for tetanus, a disease characterized by muscle spasms, rigidity, and lockjaw due to the action of tetanus toxin. While Clostridium tetani causes severe neurological symptoms, it is not associated with malignant pustules. The infection occurs after the introduction of spores into deep, non-sterile wounds, but it does not produce the necrotic pustule typical of anthrax. (D) Streptococcus pyogenes – (Incorrect) Streptococcus pyogenes is a beta-hemolytic streptococcus responsible for a variety of infections, including pharyngitis, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. However, it is not the cause of malignant pustules. Streptococcal infections can lead to skin ulcers or abscesses, but these are different from the black necrotic lesions seen in anthrax.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cutaneous anthrax. Porter's disease is an old term used synonymously for cutaneous anthrax, which refers to an infection caused by Bacillus anthracis. It is typically contracted through contact with contaminated animal products such as hides, wool, or meat. The disease manifests as a localized ulcer with a characteristic black necrotic center, often occurring at the site of inoculation. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of anthrax infection and is generally less severe than the inhalational or gastrointestinal forms. Explanation of Other Options: (A) Relapsing fever – (Incorrect) Relapsing fever is caused by Borrelia species, which are transmitted by lice or ticks. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, but it is not referred to as Porter's disease. Relapsing fever does not match the description of cutaneous anthrax or its historical naming conventions. (B) Weil’s disease – (Incorrect) Weil’s disease is a severe form of Leptospirosis caused by Leptospira bacteria. It is associated with jaundice, kidney failure, and hemorrhages, and is not related to Porter's disease. Weil's disease is a different infectious condition altogether. (C) Bubonic plague – (Incorrect) Bubonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, presents with painful swollen lymph nodes (buboes) and can lead to septicemia and septic shock. Although historically significant, it is not referred to as Porter's disease. Bubonic plague and Porter's disease are distinct diseases caused by different pathogens.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Malignant pustule – (Correct) The McFadyean reaction is a diagnostic test used to identify Bacillus anthracis, the causative organism of anthrax, specifically in cases of malignant pustule. The reaction involves the detection of blue-stained capsules in tissue specimens when they are stained with methylene blue. These capsules are a key feature of Bacillus anthracis and play a role in its virulence. Malignant pustule is a skin lesion that appears at the site of entry of Bacillus anthracis spores, typically following contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. The McFadyean reaction helps to confirm the diagnosis of anthrax when the organism is suspected. Incorrect Answers: (A) Weil’s disease – (Incorrect) Weil's disease is caused by Leptospira spp., which is a type of spirochete. The disease is characterized by jaundice, renal failure, hemorrhage, and liver dysfunction. The McFadyean reaction is not applicable to Leptospira infections, as this test specifically targets the anthrax-causing Bacillus anthracis. Diagnostic tests for Weil’s disease typically involve serologic tests or detection of Leptospira spp. using microscopy or PCR. (B) Meningococcemia – (Incorrect) Meningococcemia is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative diplococcus. The McFadyean reaction is not used for identifying Neisseria meningitidis or for meningococcemia. Meningococcemia is diagnosed through blood cultures, Gram staining, or PCR to identify Neisseria meningitidis. This infection presents with sepsis and can cause meningitis, but it is unrelated to the McFadyean reaction. (C) Syphilis – (Incorrect) Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete, and the McFadyean reaction is not used in its diagnosis. Syphilis is typically diagnosed using serologic tests, such as the VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test, RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test, and confirmatory tests like the FTA-ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) test. The McFadyean reaction does not apply to Treponema pallidum or syphilis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bacillus anthracis – (Correct) The most likely organism is Bacillus anthracis, which is the causative agent of anthrax. The patient's symptoms—fever, severe dyspnea, cyanosis, and tachycardia—along with the presence of large, gram-positive rods with subterminal spores on blood smear, strongly suggest anthrax infection. Bacillus anthracis is known for causing severe infections in individuals who work with animal hides, wool, or hair, such as a wig manufacturer. It can cause inhalational anthrax, which presents with flu-like symptoms initially, followed by severe respiratory distress, often leading to death if untreated. The organism is nonmotile, nonhemolytic on blood agar, and forms characteristic subterminal spores. Incorrect Answers: (A) Clostridium tertium – (Incorrect) Clostridium tertium is a gram-positive rod that can cause infections, but it is not associated with spore formation at the subterminal location as seen with Bacillus anthracis. It is also more often implicated in soft tissue infections or sepsis in immunocompromised patients, rather than causing respiratory distress as described in this case. The lack of motility and hemolysis could apply to Clostridium tertium, but the absence of anthrax-like symptoms makes it an unlikely diagnosis here. (C) Clostridium perfringens – (Incorrect) Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive rod often associated with gas gangrene and food poisoning. While it does form spores, it is not typically linked to respiratory distress or cyanosis as in inhalational anthrax. Additionally, Clostridium perfringens usually produces hemolysis on blood agar, which contrasts with the nonhemolytic nature of the organism isolated in this case. (D) Bacillus subtilis – (Incorrect) Bacillus subtilis is a nonpathogenic bacterium typically found in soil. Although it is a gram-positive rod and can form endospores, it does not typically cause the severe respiratory symptoms seen in this case. Furthermore, it is motile, which is in contrast to the nonmotile nature of the organism in this scenario. Bacillus subtilis does not typically present with the inhalational anthrax-like symptoms that this patient exhibits.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Presence of Abdominal Pain Bacillus cereus food poisoning is a well-known cause of gastrointestinal illness and is characterized by abdominal pain, which occurs due to the action of enterotoxins. B. cereus food poisoning has two distinct forms: Diarrheal Type – Caused by a heat-labile enterotoxin, leading to abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, and nausea. It is associated with the consumption of contaminated meat, vegetables, or sauces. Emetic Type – Caused by a heat-stable toxin, leading to severe nausea and vomiting, usually after consuming contaminated rice or starchy foods. Abdominal pain is a common symptom in both types, making option (B) the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Presence of Fever – Incorrect Unlike bacterial infections like Salmonella or Shigella, Bacillus cereus food poisoning rarely causes fever because it is a toxin-mediated illness, not an invasive infection. Fever is not a characteristic feature of B. cereus food poisoning. (C) Presence of Vomiting – Incorrect Vomiting occurs in the emetic type of B. cereus food poisoning but is not a universal feature of both types. The diarrheal form primarily causes abdominal pain and watery diarrhea rather than vomiting. Since B. cereus food poisoning can present with or without vomiting, this option is not the best choice. (D) Absence of Diarrhea – Incorrect The diarrheal type of B. cereus food poisoning causes watery diarrhea, so diarrhea is present in at least one form of the illness. Therefore, stating that diarrhea is absent is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bacillus cereus Bacillus cereus is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacillus known to cause noninvasive diarrhea through the production of enterotoxins. It has two types of food poisoning syndromes: Emetic type – Characterized by vomiting, caused by a heat-stable toxin found in contaminated rice. Diarrheal type – Characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, caused by a heat-labile enterotoxin, which stimulates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP and secretory diarrhea. This form is associated with meat, vegetables, and sauces. The diarrheal type of B. cereus is a classic example of noninvasive diarrhea, where the bacteria do not invade the intestinal mucosa, but rather secrete toxins that lead to excessive fluid loss. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Shigella – Incorrect Shigella causes invasive diarrhea (dysentery) by invading the colonic epithelium and producing Shiga toxin. It leads to bloody diarrhea with pus and mucus, unlike the watery diarrhea seen in noninvasive infections. (C) Salmonella – Incorrect While Salmonella enteritidis can cause gastroenteritis, it invades the intestinal mucosa, triggering an inflammatory response. Salmonella typhi (causative agent of typhoid fever) is also an invasive pathogen that can disseminate systemically. This makes Salmonella an invasive diarrheal pathogen, unlike B. cereus. (D) Yersinia enterocolitica – Incorrect Yersinia enterocolitica causes invasive diarrhea by invading the terminal ileum and colon. It can mimic appendicitis with symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Since it invades tissues, it is not classified as a noninvasive diarrheal pathogen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bacillus anthracis Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming rod that causes anthrax, a zoonotic disease primarily affecting livestock but transmissible to humans. The cutaneous form of anthrax, known as a malignant pustule, starts as a painless papule that rapidly develops into a necrotic ulcer with a black eschar and surrounding edema. It occurs due to direct contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products (e.g., wool, hides, or bones). The characteristic black eschar formation is due to the lethal toxin produced by B. anthracis, which leads to tissue necrosis and edema. If untreated, the infection can progress to septicemia and systemic involvement, making early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment (e.g., ciprofloxacin or doxycycline) essential. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Leishmania – Incorrect Leishmania species cause cutaneous leishmaniasis, which presents as chronic, non-healing skin ulcers but lacks the black eschar seen in anthrax. It is transmitted by sandflies and does not produce the characteristic malignant pustule associated with B. anthracis. (C) Basal Cell Carcinoma – Incorrect Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a malignant skin tumor arising from basal keratinocytes due to prolonged UV exposure. It typically presents as a pearly nodule with telangiectasia and may ulcerate, but it is not infectious and does not cause the rapid necrosis and edema seen in anthrax. (D) Pyoderma – Incorrect Pyoderma refers to bacterial skin infections (e.g., impetigo, folliculitis, or cellulitis) caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. While it can cause pustules and ulcers, it does not produce a black eschar, which is the hallmark of a malignant pustule in anthrax.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cutaneous Anthrax The presence of a malignant pustule in an abattoir worker suggests cutaneous anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis. This form of anthrax occurs due to direct contact with infected animal products (such as hides, wool, or meat). The disease begins as a painless papule, which rapidly progresses into a vesicular lesion, and then forms a necrotic ulcer with a black eschar (malignant pustule) surrounded by edema. Laboratory Gram staining of the smear would show large, gram-positive, spore-forming bacilli, confirming B. anthracis infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Carbuncle – Incorrect A carbuncle is a deep-seated skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, typically involving multiple hair follicles. It appears as a painful, swollen, and pus-filled mass, often associated with fever. Unlike anthrax, it lacks a black eschar and does not have an occupational exposure history related to animals. (C) Ulcerating Melanoma – Incorrect Melanoma is a malignant skin tumor originating from melanocytes. While some forms may ulcerate, they do not present as a malignant pustule and are usually pigmented rather than necrotic with a black eschar. A biopsy would reveal atypical melanocytes rather than bacterial infection. (D) Infected Rodent Ulcer – Incorrect A rodent ulcer is a type of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a slow-growing skin cancer that erodes tissue over time. Unlike anthrax, it does not appear suddenly, lacks acute inflammation, and is not associated with animal exposure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anthrax. Explanation: Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive, spore-forming rod that primarily affects individuals handling animal products, such as wool cutters, farmers, and veterinarians. This occupational exposure is a significant clue in this case. The inhalation form of anthrax (also called wool-sorter’s disease) is a life-threatening condition that begins with nonspecific flu-like symptoms, including fever and malaise, followed by the development of severe respiratory distress and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, in this case, the cervical lymph node enlargement suggests the oropharyngeal or cutaneous form, which can occur when spores enter through skin abrasions or mucous membranes. The disease progresses rapidly if untreated, making early diagnosis crucial. Why the other options are incorrect: Option (B) Mycetoma Incorrect: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous disease of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and bone, caused by fungi (Eumycetoma) or filamentous bacteria (Actinomycetoma). It typically presents as a slowly growing mass with discharging sinuses, not acute fever with lymphadenopathy. Also, it is more common in farmers who walk barefoot in contaminated soil rather than wool cutters. Option (C) Sporotrichosis Incorrect: Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It is often associated with gardening, handling plants, and soil exposure rather than wool cutting. The typical presentation is painless nodular lesions along lymphatic channels (lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis) rather than generalized fever with cervical lymphadenopathy. Option (D) Coccidioidomycosis Incorrect: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by Coccidioides spp., is endemic to the southwestern U.S. (desert regions) and primarily causes a pulmonary infection (Valley fever) with fever, cough, and fatigue. It does not typically present with cervical lymphadenopathy in an occupational setting like wool cutting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bacillus anthracis. Explanation: Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that causes anthrax. It is well known for its “Medusa head” appearance on culture media, particularly blood agar. This characteristic appearance is due to its long, wavy, filamentous projections of colonies, resembling snake-like hair strands of Medusa from Greek mythology. This occurs because B. anthracis produces a sticky, tenacious, and irregular colony structure due to its unique capsule made of poly-D-glutamate. Additionally, colonies of B. anthracis do not exhibit hemolysis on blood agar and are non-motile, further distinguishing them from other Bacillus species. Why the other options are incorrect: Option (B) Bacillus subtilis Incorrect: Bacillus subtilis is a common environmental bacterium and is not associated with the Medusa head appearance. Instead, it forms large, dry, rough colonies with irregular edges, but they do not exhibit the same characteristic wavy projections as B. anthracis. Moreover, B. subtilis is motile and hemolytic, distinguishing it from B. anthracis. Option (C) Bacillus cereus Incorrect: Bacillus cereus is a well-known cause of food poisoning and opportunistic infections. While it can produce rough colonies, it does not display the Medusa head appearance. Instead, its colonies tend to be irregular, spreading, and beta-hemolytic on blood agar. Additionally, B. cereus is motile, unlike B. anthracis. Option (D) Bacillus licheniformis Incorrect: Bacillus licheniformis is primarily an environmental bacterium and an occasional opportunistic pathogen. Its colonies are flat, dull, and rough, but they lack the distinctive Medusa head appearance of B. anthracis. Like B. subtilis and B. cereus, it is motile and hemolytic, further differentiating it from B. anthracis.",

While some Bacillus species (like Bacillus cereus) have been implicated in ocular infections, B. brevis is not a recognized pathogen for corneal ulcers. Since the question asks for a Gram-negative bacterium that does not cause corneal ulcers, and B. brevis is Gram-positive, it is the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Options: (A) Pseudomonas aeruginosa – Incorrect. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, highly virulent bacterium that is a leading cause of bacterial keratitis (corneal ulcer), especially in contact lens users. It produces proteases and exotoxins, leading to rapid corneal destruction. (B) Moraxella lacunata – Incorrect. Moraxella lacunata is a Gram-negative rod that can cause corneal ulcers, particularly in individuals with chronic eye conditions or immunosuppression. (D) Klebsiella pneumoniae – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Polymyxin, Lysozyme, EDTA, and Thallous Acetate Explanation for the Correct Answer: PLET (Polymyxin-Lysozyme-EDTA-Thallous acetate) medium is a selective medium used for the isolation of Bacillus anthracis from mixed bacterial populations. Polymyxin: An antibiotic that inhibits the growth of many Gram-negative bacteria, allowing Bacillus anthracis to grow. Lysozyme: Enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls, particularly useful for inhibiting non-Bacillus contaminants. EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid): A chelating agent that enhances lysozyme activity and prevents the growth of unwanted bacteria. Thallous acetate: A heavy metal salt that suppresses competing flora, making the medium highly selective for Bacillus anthracis. Since all these components are crucial in the selectivity of PLET medium for Bacillus anthracis, option (D) is the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Options: (A) Polymyxin, Lactose, EDTA, and Thallous Acetate – Incorrect. Lactose is not a component of PLET medium. The correct carbohydrate source for bacterial metabolism in some media is lactic acid, not lactose. (B) Polymyxin, Lysozyme, EDTA, and Tetracycline – Incorrect. While Polymyxin, Lysozyme, and EDTA are correct, Tetracycline is not a component of PLET medium. Tetracycline is an antibiotic that could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis, which is not desirable in a selective medium for its isolation. (C) Polymyxin, Lactose, EDTA, and Tetracycline – Incorrect. Lactose is not a component of PLET medium. Tetracycline is not included in PLET medium because it might suppress the growth of Bacillus anthracis. (E) Polymyxin, Lactic acid, EDTA, and Tetracycline – Incorrect. While Lactic acid is used in some media, Tetracycline is not part of PLET medium. The correct inhibitory agent used in PLET is Thallous acetate, not Tetracycline.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bacillus anthracis. The patient in this case presents with a 2-cm lesion that began as a painless papule, which ulcerated and formed a black crust (eschar). This clinical presentation is highly characteristic of cutaneous anthrax, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis. The eschar and the location of the lesion on the arm, combined with the patient’s occupation in an abattoir (where he handles cattle hides), strongly suggest exposure to Bacillus anthracis, as it is often associated with handling infected animal products. The Gram stain showing large gram-positive rods further supports this diagnosis, as Bacillus anthracis appears as large, spore-forming, gram-positive rods. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Clostridium botulinum: Clostridium botulinum causes botulism, a disease characterized by descending flaccid paralysis due to botulinum toxin. It does not cause skin lesions like the one described in this case. Furthermore, botulism is typically acquired via ingestion of preformed toxin, or through wound infections, but it would not present with an eschar or a painless papule. (C) Clostridium perfringens: Clostridium perfringens is a common cause of gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) and is typically associated with traumatic wounds or deep tissue infections. It can also cause food poisoning, but it is not typically responsible for the eschar seen in cutaneous anthrax. The appearance of large gram-positive rods on Gram stain is more consistent with Bacillus anthracis rather than Clostridium perfringens. (D) Clostridium tetani: Clostridium tetani causes tetanus, characterized by muscle spasms and lockjaw, but not skin lesions. It is acquired through contamination of puncture wounds with spores, and while it produces gram-positive rods, it does not cause the distinctive ulcerated, black eschar lesion seen in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct answer (D) Bacillus anthracis. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The patient is a cattle rancher presenting with a large scab-like wound, which is highly suggestive of cutaneous anthrax, a zoonotic infection caused by Bacillus anthracis. The culture findings confirm the diagnosis: Gram-positive, nonmotile rods with square ends Centrally located spores Irregular, non-hemolytic colonies on blood agar Bacillus anthracis is the only nonmotile species of Bacillus, differentiating it from Bacillus cereus. It forms spores that can survive in the environment for years. Direct contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products (such as wool, hides, or meat) is a common mode of transmission, making farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians at high risk. Cutaneous anthrax typically begins as a painless papule that enlarges into an ulcer with a black eschar (scab) and surrounding edema, known as a malignant pustule. If untreated, it can lead to septicemia and systemic spread. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Listeria monocytogenes Incorrect. While Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod, it is motile (tumbling motility) and does not form spores. It typically causes foodborne illness leading to meningitis or sepsis, particularly in pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals. It does not cause cutaneous infections like anthrax. (B) Staphylococcus aureus Incorrect. S. aureus is gram-positive, but it is a coccus (round-shaped), not a rod. It is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., abscesses, cellulitis), but does not produce spores or form large black eschars. Additionally, S. aureus produces beta-hemolytic colonies on blood agar, unlike B. anthracis, which is non-hemolytic. (C) Legionella pneumophila Incorrect. L. pneumophila is a gram-negative rod, making it an unlikely cause. It primarily causes Legionnaires’ disease, a severe atypical pneumonia, rather than cutaneous infections. It is found in water systems (e.g., cooling towers, air conditioning units) and does not form spores.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A foul-smelling discharge Bacteroides fragilis is an obligate anaerobic, gram-negative rod that is part of the normal gut microbiota but can cause serious infections when introduced into sterile body sites, such as the peritoneal cavity following a ruptured appendix. Key features of B. fragilis infections: Foul-smelling discharge due to the production of short-chain fatty acids and other metabolic byproducts Abscess formation in intra-abdominal infections Polymicrobial infection (often coexists with other anaerobes and facultative anaerobes) Resistant to penicillin due to production of β-lactamase The foul odor is a distinguishing characteristic of anaerobic infections caused by B. fragilis, making option (B) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) A black exudate in the wound – Incorrect. A black exudate or necrotic tissue is more characteristic of necrotizing infections caused by Clostridium perfringens (gas gangrene) or Fusobacterium necrophorum. Bacteroides fragilis does not produce black necrotic exudate. (C) A heme-pigmented colony formation – Incorrect. Some Porphyromonas and Prevotella species produce black-pigmented colonies due to their ability to break down heme. B. fragilis does not form heme-pigmented colonies. (D) An exquisite susceptibility to penicillin – Incorrect. B. fragilis is resistant to penicillin due to β-lactamase production, which hydrolyzes penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. Metronidazole and carbapenems are preferred treatments.",
