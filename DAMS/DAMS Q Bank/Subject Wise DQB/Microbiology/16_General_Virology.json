      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Influenza virus. The influenza virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, has a segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA (ssRNA) genome. It consists of 8 segments, which allows for a unique genetic phenomenon known as reassortment. Reassortment occurs when two different strains of influenza infect the same host cell, leading to the exchange of genome segments. This process is responsible for the emergence of new influenza strains, contributing to antigenic shift, which can cause pandemics. The segmented nature of the genome provides influenza virus with high genetic variability, enabling it to evade immune responses and making vaccine updates necessary. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Rabies virus: Incorrect. The rabies virus, a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, has a non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA (ssRNA) genome. Since its genome is linear and non-segmented, it cannot undergo reassortment like influenza. Rabies virus primarily evolves through point mutations rather than genome segment exchange. (C) Herpes virus: Incorrect. Herpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), belong to the Herpesviridae family and have a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. DNA viruses do not exhibit segmentation or reassortment. Instead, herpesviruses persist in the host through latent infections and reactivation rather than rapid genetic shifts. (D) Molluscum contagiosum virus: Incorrect. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus and belongs to the Poxviridae family. It has a large, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome and does not exhibit segmentation. Unlike RNA viruses, DNA viruses tend to evolve more slowly and rely on different mechanisms for genetic variation, such as recombination rather than reassortment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rabies. The rabies vaccine can be prepared using embryonated hen’s eggs, specifically in the development of certain cell culture-based vaccines. One such vaccine, the Purified Chick Embryo Cell (PCEC) vaccine, is derived from rabies virus grown in chick embryo cells. This method ensures high viral yield while maintaining safety and efficacy. The PCEC vaccine is widely used for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis in humans. It is a significant alternative to older nerve tissue-derived vaccines, offering improved immunogenicity with fewer side effects. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Measles: Incorrect. The measles vaccine is produced using human diploid cell culture (such as WI-38 or MRC-5 cells) or chick embryo fibroblasts, but not directly in embryonated hen’s eggs. Though chick embryo fibroblasts are used, this is different from whole embryonated eggs. The standard live-attenuated measles vaccine (as part of the MMR vaccine) is not prepared in embryonated eggs. (C) Rubella: Incorrect. The rubella vaccine, commonly included in the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine, is prepared using human diploid cell cultures (e.g., WI-38 or MRC-5 cells), not embryonated hen’s eggs. These cells provide an effective environment for viral replication without causing allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to egg proteins. (D) Varicella: Incorrect. The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, which contains a live-attenuated Varicella-Zoster virus (Oka strain), is grown in human diploid cell culture (MRC-5 cells). It is not produced using embryonated hen’s eggs, as human cell lines provide a more suitable environment for viral replication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Scratches without oozing of blood. In rabies exposure classification, Class II exposure refers to moderate-risk exposures that require post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies vaccination, but not rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). Scratches that do not cause active bleeding (i.e., without oozing of blood) fall into this category because they may still allow rabies virus transmission through contaminated saliva, particularly if the scratch was caused by an infected animal. However, since there is no direct mucosal exposure or deep tissue penetration, the risk is lower than Class III exposure. Immediate wound washing and rabies vaccination are recommended. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Licks on a fresh wound: Incorrect. Licks on a fresh wound represent a Class III exposure, which is more severe than Class II. This is because saliva from a rabid animal can directly enter the bloodstream through a fresh wound, increasing the risk of rabies transmission. Class III exposures require both rabies vaccination and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). (C) Scratch with oozing of blood on palm: Incorrect. A scratch with oozing blood is classified as Class III exposure, especially when it occurs on the palm or fingers, which are highly innervated areas. The presence of active bleeding increases the risk of viral entry, requiring both rabies vaccination and RIG administration for full post-exposure prophylaxis. (D) Bites from wild animals: Incorrect. Bites from wild animals are considered high-risk (Class III exposure) because wild animals are more likely to be rabies carriers, and bites result in direct inoculation of the virus into deep tissues. Any bite from a potentially rabid wild animal necessitates immediate rabies vaccination and RIG administration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Detection of viral hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibodies in a single serum specimen, which is incorrect for establishing an acute viral respiratory tract infection diagnosis. HAI antibodies indicate past exposure or immunity rather than an active infection. A single serum specimen is not reliable for diagnosing a current infection, as antibody levels take time to rise. Instead, paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples taken 2–3 weeks apart are required to confirm a fourfold rise in antibody titers, which is the standard for diagnosing viral infections serologically. Explanation of Correct Options: (A) Detection of virus-specific IgM antibodies in a single serum specimen: Correct. IgM antibodies are produced early during acute infection, making them useful for diagnosing recent respiratory viral infections. However, IgM testing alone may have limitations due to false positives and cross-reactivity, so it is often used alongside other diagnostic tests. (B) Demonstration of viral antigens by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) in nasopharyngeal washings: Correct. IFA is a rapid and reliable method for detecting viral antigens directly in respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal washings, swabs, or bronchoalveolar lavage. It is commonly used for influenza, RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), and parainfluenza virus detection. (C) Isolation of viruses using centrifugation-enhanced culture: Correct. Rapid centrifugation-enhanced viral culture (shell vial culture) allows quick isolation and identification of respiratory viruses. After inoculation, viral antigens can be detected using immunofluorescence, making this method faster than traditional culture. It is commonly used for detecting influenza, adenoviruses, and RSV.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Adenovirus. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a molecular technique used for detecting RNA viruses by first converting viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase, followed by amplification through PCR. Adenovirus, however, is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus, meaning that RT-PCR is not required for its detection. Instead, PCR without reverse transcription is used to diagnose adenoviral infections. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Astrovirus – Incorrect Astrovirus is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that causes gastroenteritis, especially in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Because it is an RNA virus, RT-PCR is the preferred method for detecting astrovirus in stool samples. (C) Rotavirus – Incorrect Rotavirus belongs to the Reoviridae family and has a segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. Despite being double-stranded, RT-PCR is still used for rotavirus detection because reverse transcription is needed to amplify and analyze the RNA genome. RT-PCR is highly sensitive for detecting rotavirus in stool specimens. (D) Poliovirus – Incorrect Poliovirus is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. As an RNA virus, poliovirus requires RT-PCR for detection, especially in surveillance of polio cases and environmental monitoring. It is commonly detected in stool, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and throat swabs.",

It is not a common cause of pneumonia, as it primarily affects the salivary glands, central nervous system (CNS), pancreas, and testes. While rare respiratory complications such as mild bronchitis may occur, mumps virus does not typically lead to pneumonia, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) – Incorrect CMV, a herpesvirus, is a significant cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV/AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and neonates. CMV pneumonia can be severe, leading to interstitial pneumonia with cytopathic effects seen on histology. (C) Measles – Incorrect Measles virus (Morbillivirus, a paramyxovirus) is a well-known cause of pneumonia, especially in malnourished children. Measles pneumonia, also known as giant cell pneumonia, is a major cause of mortality in measles infection. It occurs due to direct viral damage or secondary bacterial infections.

These viruses are divided into Group A and Group B based on their pathogenic effects in mice: Group A Coxsackie viruses cause flaccid paralysis due to muscle fiber necrosis. Group B Coxsackie viruses cause spastic paralysis due to inflammation and degeneration of neurons. Suckling mice (usually 1–3 days old) are highly susceptible to Coxsackie virus infection and serve as an effective model for virus isolation and pathogenesis studies. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Poxvirus: Poxviruses, such as Variola (smallpox) and Vaccinia virus, do not require suckling mice for isolation. Instead, they are cultured in chick embryo membranes, tissue cultures, or in some cases, rabbit models. (C) Herpesvirus: Herpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), are best isolated using human diploid cell cultures (e.g., Vero cells or HeLa cells). They do not require suckling mice for isolation. (D) Adenovirus: Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that replicate well in human cell cultures such as HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells and HeLa cells. Suckling mice are not needed for their isolation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Granular because Cowdry type A inclusion bodies appear as eosinophilic, granular nuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo. These inclusions are characteristic of certain viral infections, particularly those caused by herpesviruses (HSV, VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). They represent sites of viral replication and accumulation of viral proteins within infected cells. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Circumscribed – Incorrect While Cowdry type A inclusions are well-defined within the nucleus, they are not typically referred to as circumscribed. The term circumscribed implies a sharply demarcated boundary, whereas Cowdry type A inclusions have a more irregular and granular appearance. (C) In Polio – Incorrect Poliovirus does not produce Cowdry type A inclusion bodies. Instead, polio causes neuronal degeneration and perivascular cuffing, leading to anterior horn cell destruction without characteristic nuclear inclusions. Cowdry type A inclusions are more commonly associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). (D) None – Incorrect Since Cowdry type A inclusions do appear as granular structures in infected cells, option (D) is incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Alzheimer's disease because Alzheimer’s disease is not caused by prions but rather by the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain. It is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. Unlike prion diseases, which are caused by infectious misfolded proteins (prions) that can induce other proteins to misfold, Alzheimer's disease does not involve infectious transmission. While there are similarities in protein misfolding and aggregation, Alzheimer’s disease is not classified as a prion disease. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Scrapie – Incorrect Scrapie is a prion disease that affects sheep and goats. It is caused by the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins (PrP^Sc) in the central nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms such as ataxia, itching, and behavioral changes. The disease is transmissible among animals but does not affect humans. It is considered the prototype of prion diseases and has been extensively studied in relation to human prion disorders. (B) Kuru – Incorrect Kuru is a human prion disease that was historically observed among the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea, where it was transmitted through ritualistic cannibalism. The disease resulted from the ingestion of prion-infected human brain tissue, leading to progressive neurological decline, tremors, and loss of coordination. Kuru provided crucial insights into the infectious nature of prions and their role in human disease. (C) Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) – Incorrect Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a fatal prion disease that affects humans. It exists in sporadic, inherited (familial), and acquired (iatrogenic and variant) forms. CJD is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus (involuntary muscle jerks), and neurological decline. Variant CJD (vCJD) is linked to consumption of prion-contaminated beef (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or \"mad cow disease\").",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Slow virus because Mad Cow Disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), is a prion disease, which was historically referred to as a \"slow virus\" disease due to its long incubation period and progressive nature. Prions are misfolded infectious proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases by inducing normal proteins to misfold, leading to brain damage, neuronal loss, and characteristic sponge-like (spongiform) changes in brain tissue. Unlike conventional viruses, prions lack nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), are resistant to normal sterilization processes, and trigger disease through protein misfolding rather than viral replication. Mad Cow Disease gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s due to outbreaks linked to the consumption of prion-contaminated beef products, leading to the human form of the disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Mycoplasma – Incorrect Mycoplasma are a group of bacteria-like organisms that lack a cell wall and cause diseases such as pneumonia (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and urogenital infections (Mycoplasma genitalium). They do not cause prion diseases or conditions like Mad Cow Disease, which is purely a prion-mediated neurodegenerative disorder. (C) Bacteria – Incorrect Bacteria are unicellular microorganisms that can cause a variety of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, pneumonia, and meningitis. However, Mad Cow Disease is not caused by bacteria, as it does not involve a bacterial infection, inflammatory response, or antibiotic treatment. Bacteria contain DNA and RNA, whereas prions are protein-based infectious agents. (D) Fungus – Incorrect Fungal infections are caused by organisms such as Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus, leading to diseases like candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcal meningitis. Mad Cow Disease does not involve any fungal pathogen, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Prion disease because Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) is a rare, inherited prion disease that affects the brain, specifically the thalamus, leading to severe sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. It is caused by a mutation in the PRNP (prion protein) gene, which leads to the misfolding of prion proteins. These misfolded proteins accumulate in the brain and cause progressive neuronal damage. FFI is characterized by intractable insomnia, autonomic dysfunction (such as hypertension and tachycardia), motor dysfunction, and ultimately, dementia and death. There is no cure, and the disease progresses rapidly, typically leading to death within a few months to a few years. Since it is a genetic prion disease, it follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Degenerative disease – Incorrect Although FFI leads to neurodegeneration, it is specifically a prion disease, rather than a general degenerative disorder like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease, which are caused by misfolding of proteins such as beta-amyloid, tau, or alpha-synuclein. Unlike classical degenerative diseases, FFI has a well-defined genetic and prion-based pathology. (C) Neoplastic disease – Incorrect Neoplastic diseases refer to conditions involving uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation, such as cancers (e.g., brain tumors, leukemia, or carcinomas). FFI is not a result of abnormal cell proliferation but rather protein misfolding, making this option incorrect. (D) Vascular disease – Incorrect Vascular diseases involve blood vessel abnormalities that can lead to conditions such as stroke, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. FFI is not caused by vascular dysfunction or impaired blood flow to the brain, but rather by prion-induced neurodegeneration, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cryptococcus neoformans. Cryptococcus neoformans is a monomorphic yeast and does not exhibit thermal dimorphism. It remains a yeast at all temperatures, both in the environment and within the human body. Unlike thermally dimorphic fungi, which change their form from a mold in the environment to a yeast or yeast-like form in the host (at body temperature), Cryptococcus neoformans does not undergo this morphological transition. It is primarily recognized for its capsulated yeast cells, which are prominent in infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. A. Sporothrix schenckii is thermally dimorphic. It exists as a mold at ambient temperatures (25–30°C) and changes into a yeast form at body temperature (37°C). This dimorphism is characteristic of sporotrichosis, which is caused by this fungus, especially following trauma from plant material or soil. C. Blastomyces dermatitidis is also thermally dimorphic. It grows as a mold at cooler environmental temperatures and transitions into a yeast form at body temperature, which is responsible for causing blastomycosis. The ability to switch forms is a defining characteristic of this pathogen. D. Histoplasma capsulatum is another thermally dimorphic fungus. It exists as a mold in the environment at cooler temperatures and transforms into a yeast form in the host's body, typically causing histoplasmosis. The yeast form is present in tissues, especially within macrophages.",

Their genetic material, typically a single circular chromosome, is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane (unlike eukaryotes, where the nucleus is membrane-bound). This is a key distinguishing feature of prokaryotic cells. Incorrect responses: B. Presence of microvilli on its surface: Microvilli are specialized protrusions found on the surface of certain eukaryotic cells, such as epithelial cells, to increase surface area for absorption. Prokaryotes, on the other hand, do not have microvilli. They may have other surface structures like pili or flagella, but not microvilli. C. Presence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum: Prokaryotic cells do not possess membrane-bound organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is a structure found in eukaryotic cells involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification. Prokaryotes do not have a compartmentalized structure like the SER. D.

Chickenpox is diagnosed clinically and confirmed by PCR or direct fluorescent antibody testing, rather than relying on histopathological inclusion bodies. Thus, chickenpox is the exception among the listed options, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Rabies – Incorrect Rabies virus (Lyssavirus) produces Negri bodies, which are eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies found in neurons of the hippocampus and cerebellum. Negri bodies are pathognomonic of rabies and are used in postmortem diagnosis. (C) Molluscum Contagiosum – Incorrect Molluscum contagiosum (caused by a poxvirus) produces large, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, called Henderson-Patterson bodies, within the keratinocytes. These are characteristic of the disease and can be identified on histopathology. (D) Trachoma – Incorrect Trachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, C), is associated with basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies known as Halberstaedter-Prowazek bodies, found within conjunctival epithelial cells.

It is not known to cause subclinical infections, meaning that individuals infected with the virus typically develop the classic prodrome of fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis (the 3 Cs), followed by a maculopapular rash. Unlike some viral infections that can remain asymptomatic or subclinical, measles has a high attack rate, meaning most exposed individuals develop full-blown disease. Even in vaccinated individuals, asymptomatic infection is rare. Due to its characteristic clinical presentation and near-universal symptomatic response, measles is not associated with subclinical infections, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Diphtheria – Incorrect Corynebacterium diphtheriae can cause both clinical and subclinical infections. Many individuals carry the bacterium in their nasopharynx without symptoms, acting as carriers who can spread the disease. Asymptomatic carriers are a major source of diphtheria transmission, especially in partially immunized populations. (B) Polio – Incorrect Poliovirus (an enterovirus) is well known for causing subclinical infections in over 90% of cases. Only a small percentage (about 1% of cases) develop paralytic poliomyelitis; most individuals have mild or asymptomatic infections. This is why silent transmission was common before polio vaccination. (D) Staphylococcus aureus – Incorrect S. aureus is a common bacterial pathogen that frequently colonizes the skin, nose, and throat of healthy individuals without causing disease. Many people carry S. aureus asymptomatically, and infection only occurs when host immunity is compromised or the bacteria gain access to deeper tissues. This makes subclinical carriage very common.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Viruses Explanation of the Correct Answer: Pharyngitis, or inflammation of the pharynx, is most commonly caused by viral infections, accounting for 60-90% of cases in both children and adults. Common viral causes of pharyngitis include: Rhinovirus (most frequent cause) Adenovirus Influenza virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (causes infectious mononucleosis) Coronavirus Coxsackievirus Viral pharyngitis symptoms: Gradual onset of sore throat Low-grade fever Cough, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis (suggesting a viral cause) Absence of exudates on tonsils (except in EBV infection) Treatment: Supportive care (rest, hydration, analgesics like paracetamol, and throat lozenges). No antibiotics are needed unless a bacterial infection is suspected. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Pneumococcus – Incorrect Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) is not a common cause of pharyngitis. It primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis. (C) Streptococcus – Incorrect (but an important bacterial cause) Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis, but bacterial pharyngitis occurs in only 10-30% of cases, making viruses the more common cause overall. Strep throat symptoms (bacterial pharyngitis): Sudden onset of sore throat Fever > 38°C Tonsillar exudates Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy Absence of cough (suggests bacterial origin) While important, it accounts for fewer cases than viral causes. Rapid strep tests and throat cultures help differentiate it from viral pharyngitis. (D) Corynebacterium – Incorrect Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes diphtheria, which can present with pharyngitis, but it is rare due to widespread vaccination (DPT/DTaP vaccine). Diphtheria features: Pseudomembrane formation in the throat Bull neck appearance due to lymphadenopathy Toxin-mediated complications (myocarditis, neuropathy) Diphtheria is NOT the most common cause of pharyngitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Aedes Explanation of the Correct Answer: The term \"Tiger mosquito\" refers to Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes albopictus, which is easily recognizable due to its distinct black-and-white striped appearance on its body and legs. Key Characteristics of Aedes mosquitoes: Aggressive daytime biters, especially in the early morning and late afternoon. Breeds in small water collections (e.g., flower pots, discarded tires, water storage containers). Primary vector for diseases such as: Dengue fever Chikungunya Zika virus Yellow fever Striking white stripes on the body and legs resemble a tiger’s markings. Highly invasive species, known for rapid spread in urban and semi-urban areas. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Ticks – Incorrect Ticks are arachnids, not mosquitoes (they belong to the class Arachnida, whereas mosquitoes belong to the class Insecta). Ticks are vectors of diseases like Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, but they are not mosquitoes and do not fit the description of \"Tiger mosquitoes.\" (B) Culex – Incorrect Culex mosquitoes are a different genus of mosquitoes. They are primarily nocturnal biters and breed in stagnant, polluted water (e.g., drains, sewage water). Transmit diseases like: West Nile virus Japanese encephalitis Lymphatic filariasis Culex mosquitoes do NOT have the distinctive tiger-like stripes seen in Aedes. (C) Anopheles – Incorrect Anopheles mosquitoes are best known as the vectors for malaria (caused by Plasmodium species). They lack the distinct black-and-white striped pattern of Aedes mosquitoes. Active at night, unlike Aedes mosquitoes, which bite during the day.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence is the best technique to detect viral growth in cell culture because it allows for specific identification of viral antigens using fluorescently labeled antibodies. This method is highly sensitive and specific, enabling early detection of viral replication before other observable effects (such as cytopathic effects) appear. Direct immunofluorescence (DFA) uses labeled antibodies to directly bind viral antigens, while indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) uses a secondary fluorescent antibody to enhance signal detection. Incorrect options: (A) Cytopathic Effect (CPE) – Incorrect. CPE refers to morphological changes in infected cells due to viral replication. While it is a commonly used method to detect viral growth, it is not the best technique because: It can take several days for CPE to appear. Some viruses do not produce distinct CPE, making identification difficult. (B) Haemadsorption – Incorrect. Haemadsorption detects viruses that express haemagglutinin proteins on infected cells, allowing them to bind red blood cells (RBCs). This method is useful for detecting certain viruses like influenza and parainfluenza, but it cannot detect all viral infections, making it less comprehensive than immunofluorescence. (D) Interference – Incorrect. Interference assays detect viral growth indirectly by assessing the inhibition of another virus’s replication. This technique is not commonly used in routine diagnostics because it is less specific and more complex than immunofluorescence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Allantoic cavity. The allantoic cavity is the best site for inoculating influenza virus in chick embryos for vaccine production because it provides: A large fluid-filled space that supports efficient viral replication. A rich supply of nutrients for viral growth. Easy harvesting of the virus-containing allantoic fluid for further processing. The influenza virus replicates well in this site, making it ideal for large-scale vaccine production. The allantoic cavity is commonly used for the cultivation of orthomyxoviruses (influenza virus) and paramyxoviruses (e.g., Newcastle disease virus). Incorrect options: (A) Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) – Incorrect. The CAM is primarily used for growing poxviruses (e.g., vaccinia and variola viruses), which produce pocks (lesions) on the membrane. It is not optimal for influenza virus growth, as replication efficiency is lower compared to the allantoic cavity. (C) Amniotic cavity – Incorrect. The amniotic cavity can be used for influenza virus inoculation, but it is mainly useful for primary virus isolation rather than large-scale vaccine production. Viral replication in the amniotic cavity is lower compared to the allantoic cavity, making it less efficient for vaccine development. (D) Yolk sac – Incorrect. The yolk sac is primarily used for the cultivation of rickettsiae and some viruses, but not influenza virus. It is not an ideal site for influenza virus replication due to limited viral yield.",

The H7N7 strain demonstrated the ability to transmit to humans, raising concerns about potential pandemic risks. Incorrect Options: (A) H5N1 – Incorrect H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus that has caused multiple outbreaks in birds and sporadic human infections, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. However, H5N1 was not responsible for the 2003 Netherlands outbreak. (C) H9N2 – Incorrect H9N2 is a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus that is found in poultry and has occasionally infected humans. While it has pandemic potential, it was not the cause of the Netherlands outbreak in 2003. (D) H3N1 – Incorrect H3N1 is a relatively rare strain of avian influenza and has not been linked to major outbreaks in humans or poultry. It was not responsible for the Netherlands outbreak.

(C) HEP-2 – Incorrect HEP-2 cells are immortalized human laryngeal carcinoma cells. Like HeLa cells, they can grow indefinitely in culture and are frequently used in viral studies, cytotoxicity assays, and cancer research. They do not qualify as primary cell cultures. (D) HL-8 – Incorrect HL-8 is an established cell line and not a primary cell culture. Like other continuous cell lines, it is used for research but does not exhibit the natural, finite lifespan of primary cultures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Adenovirus because human fibroblast cell lines, such as MRC-5 and WI-38, provide a suitable environment for adenovirus replication. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that infect epithelial cells and fibroblasts efficiently. These cell lines support adenovirus growth and are commonly used in laboratory settings for virus isolation, vaccine production, and research. Incorrect Options: (B) Polio – Incorrect Poliovirus is an RNA virus that primarily replicates in human epithelial and neuronal cells rather than fibroblasts. It is best cultivated in continuous cell lines such as Vero cells (from African green monkey kidney) and HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cells). (C) HIV – Incorrect HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus that specifically infects CD4+ T cells and macrophages. It does not grow in human fibroblast cell lines. Specialized lymphoid cell lines, such as MT-2 and CEM, are used for HIV cultivation in research. (D) Measles – Incorrect Measles virus is a paramyxovirus that grows best in human or monkey kidney epithelial cells rather than fibroblasts. It is commonly propagated in Vero cells or primary human amnion cells for research and vaccine production.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) HSV-1 causes encephalitis. Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a major cause of viral encephalitis, particularly Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE). It typically affects the temporal lobes, leading to symptoms like fever, altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, seizures, and personality changes. MRI often shows temporal lobe enhancement, and PCR for HSV DNA in CSF is the most sensitive diagnostic test. Early treatment with IV Acyclovir is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. Incorrect Options: (B) EBV affects T lymphocytes – Incorrect Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) primarily infects B lymphocytes, not T cells. It binds to CD21 (CR2) receptors on B cells, leading to infectious mononucleosis. In some cases, EBV can contribute to the development of malignancies like Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. (C) CMV is always symptomatic – Incorrect Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. However, in immunocompromised patients (e.g., organ transplant recipients, HIV/AIDS patients), CMV can cause severe disease, including CMV pneumonia, retinitis, colitis, and encephalitis. In neonates, congenital CMV can lead to sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, and hepatosplenomegaly. (D) Herpes zoster is not reactivated – Incorrect Herpes zoster (shingles) is caused by reactivation of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), which remains latent in dorsal root ganglia after primary chickenpox (varicella) infection. Reactivation occurs due to immunosuppression, stress, or aging, leading to a painful, dermatomal vesicular rash.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus that is unique because it cannot be cultured in embryonated eggs or traditional animal cell cultures. Unlike other poxviruses, MCV primarily infects humans and has a strict host specificity, meaning it does not grow well in non-human systems. It causes umbilicated, flesh-colored papules on the skin, commonly in children and immunocompromised individuals. Incorrect Options: (A) Cowpox – Can Grow in Egg and Animal Cells Cowpox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, can be cultured in embryonated eggs and various animal cell lines. It was historically used as the basis for the smallpox vaccine due to its cross-protection against Variola virus. (B) Vaccinia – Can Grow in Egg and Animal Cells Vaccinia virus, which was used in smallpox vaccination, is another Orthopoxvirus that can be grown in embryonated eggs and cultured animal cells. It is widely studied in virology and vaccine research. (C) Variola – Can Grow in Animal Cells Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, was historically cultured in chick embryo tissues and monkey kidney cell lines for research and vaccine development before smallpox eradication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Smallpox virus. Smallpox virus (Variola virus) belongs to the Poxviridae family and is a brick-shaped, double-stranded DNA virus. It is the largest and most complex of all viruses and has a unique morphology with a dumbbell-shaped core containing DNA and associated proteins. The virus is enveloped and has a characteristic biconcave structure with lateral bodies. Smallpox was eradicated globally in 1980 through vaccination efforts but remains significant in historical and bioterrorism contexts. Incorrect Options: (A) Chickenpox (Varicella-Zoster Virus) – Icosahedral Shape Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox, belongs to the Herpesviridae family and has an icosahedral-shaped nucleocapsid. It is a double-stranded DNA virus, but unlike smallpox, it does not have a brick-like morphology. (C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) – Herpesvirus with Icosahedral Shape Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is another member of the Herpesviridae family and also has an icosahedral nucleocapsid. It does not exhibit the brick-shaped structure seen in poxviruses. CMV mainly affects immunocompromised individuals and is a leading cause of congenital viral infections.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (CJD) The most appropriate diagnosis in this case is sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD), a rapidly progressive prion disease that causes spongiform encephalopathy. The patient's poor memory, rapidly progressing vision impairment, myoclonic jerks, and severe cognitive deterioration within months, followed by death, strongly suggest CJD. The presence of 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) supports the diagnosis, as this protein is a biomarker for neuronal damage and is often found in prion diseases. Autopsy findings of spongiform changes (vacuolization of the brain parenchyma) further confirm the diagnosis. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) is the most common form, accounting for ~85% of all CJD cases, with no clear cause or inheritance pattern. It typically occurs in individuals aged 50-70 years and presents with rapidly progressing dementia, myoclonus, visual disturbances, and ataxia, leading to death within 6-12 months. There is no effective treatment, and diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by CSF 14-3-3 protein, MRI, and EEG findings. Incorrect Options: (B) Familial CJD – Incorrect. Familial CJD (fCJD) is a genetic form of CJD caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, which encodes prion protein (PrP). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and has a longer disease course than sporadic CJD. This patient has no family history of neurodegenerative disease, making fCJD unlikely. (C) Iatrogenic CJD – Incorrect. Iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) occurs due to medical transmission, often through contaminated surgical instruments, corneal transplants, dura mater grafts, or growth hormone therapy derived from human pituitary glands. This patient has no history of surgical procedures or medical exposure to infected material, making iCJD unlikely. (D) Variant CJD (vCJD) – Incorrect. Variant CJD (vCJD) is linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, \"mad cow disease\") and occurs in younger individuals (usually <40 years old). Unlike sCJD, vCJD progresses more slowly (often over 12-24 months) and presents with psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) before neurological decline. The age (67 years) and rapid progression (death within 8 months) strongly favor sporadic CJD over vCJD.",
