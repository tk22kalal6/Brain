      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Unfertilized eggs of Ascaris, as they do not float in a saturated solution of saline. This is because unfertilized Ascaris lumbricoides eggs are lighter and less dense compared to fertilized eggs or other helminth eggs, making them unable to float in a flotation technique using saturated saline (specific gravity ~1.2 g/mL). The diagnostic method of fecal flotation relies on the difference in density between the eggs and the saline solution, and unfertilized Ascaris eggs fail to float due to their lower density and irregular shape. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Ankylostoma eggs – (Incorrect) Hookworm eggs (Ankylostoma spp.) float in saturated saline because their specific gravity is lower than that of the solution. They are relatively lighter and easily detected in fecal flotation techniques used for diagnosing helminth infections. B. Trichuris eggs – (Incorrect) Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) eggs also float in saturated saline because their specific gravity is appropriate for the flotation technique. They have a characteristic barrel shape with polar plugs but still remain buoyant in the solution. D. Fertilized eggs of Ascaris – (Incorrect) Unlike unfertilized Ascaris eggs, fertilized Ascaris eggs are heavier and denser, but they can still float in saturated saline. Their thick shell and greater density make them different from unfertilized eggs, allowing them to be recovered through the flotation method.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ascaris, as it does not typically cause malabsorption. Ascaris lumbricoides is a large intestinal nematode that primarily causes intestinal obstruction rather than direct malabsorption. In heavy infections, Ascaris can form tangled masses in the intestines, leading to mechanical obstruction, biliary obstruction, or even volvulus, but it does not directly interfere with nutrient absorption in the same way as other parasites that invade the intestinal mucosa. Malabsorption syndromes are usually caused by organisms that damage the intestinal lining, disrupt villi, or impair digestion, which Ascaris does not do significantly. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Giardia – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia is a well-known cause of malabsorption syndrome, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The parasite attaches to the small intestinal mucosa, leading to villous atrophy, inflammation, and impaired fat absorption, which results in steatorrhea (greasy, foul-smelling stools), weight loss, and vitamin deficiencies. C. Strongyloides – (Incorrect) Strongyloides stercoralis can cause chronic infections in immunocompromised patients, leading to mucosal damage and malabsorption. It infiltrates the intestinal lining, causing villous atrophy, chronic diarrhea, and protein-losing enteropathy, which contributes to weight loss and malnutrition. In severe cases, disseminated strongyloidiasis can occur, leading to life-threatening complications. D. Capillaria philippinensis – (Incorrect) Capillaria philippinensis is a significant cause of malabsorption syndrome in endemic regions. The parasite invades the intestinal mucosa, causing chronic diarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and severe electrolyte imbalances, leading to progressive weight loss, edema, and even death if untreated. It is one of the most severe parasitic causes of malabsorption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Trichuris trichiura, as this species of nematode does not give birth to larvae. Trichuris trichiura, also known as the whipworm, lays unembryonated eggs in the host's intestine, which then pass out in the feces. These eggs mature in the environment into infective larvae, which are then ingested by a new host. Therefore, the life cycle of Trichuris trichiura involves eggs that hatch into larvae outside the host, not larvae being born inside the host. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Trichinella spiralis – (Incorrect) Trichinella spiralis is a nematode that causes trichinosis. The adult female worm gives birth to larvae, which migrate through the bloodstream to striated muscles, where they encyst and cause infection. The larvae are born live inside the host and do not require egg maturation outside the body. C. Dracunculus medinensis – (Incorrect) Dracunculus medinensis, also known as the guinea worm, is another nematode that gives birth to larvae. The female worm releases larvae into water, where they are ingested by a suitable intermediate host (such as a copepod). After ingestion by the human host, the larvae mature into worms. D. Wuchereria bancrofti – (Incorrect) Wuchereria bancrofti is a filarial nematode that causes lymphatic filariasis. The adult female worms give birth to microfilariae, which circulate in the bloodstream and are transmitted to mosquitoes during a blood meal. The larvae develop within the mosquito before being transmitted to a new human host.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Enterobius, as Enterobius vermicularis is commonly known as the seat worm or pinworm. This parasitic worm causes enterobiasis, a type of intestinal infection. It is known as the seat worm because the female worm migrates to the anus to lay its eggs, causing itching and irritation around the perianal area, especially at night. The infection is highly contagious, typically spread through the fecal-oral route. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Dracunculus – (Incorrect) Dracunculus medinensis, also known as the guinea worm, causes dracunculiasis. This worm is transmitted through contaminated water, and it typically affects the skin, where the female worm slowly emerges to release larvae. The term \"seat worm\" is not associated with this parasite. C. Ankylostoma – (Incorrect) Ancylostoma species, such as Ancylostoma duodenale, are hookworms that cause hookworm disease. They infect the small intestine and can lead to anemia and malnutrition. Hookworms do not cause itching around the anus, nor are they referred to as \"seat worms.\" D. Necator – (Incorrect) Necator americanus is another hookworm species, similar to Ancylostoma, and causes hookworm infection. It also infects the small intestine, leading to symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and anemia. Like Ancylostoma, it does not cause itching around the anus and is not known as a \"seat worm.\"",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) Strongyloides. The presence of rhabditiform larvae in both stool and sputum is highly suggestive of an infection with Strongyloides stercoralis. This parasitic worm is capable of completing its life cycle in both the intestinal lumen and in the lungs. Strongyloides larvae can migrate from the intestines to the lungs, where they can be coughed up and subsequently swallowed, leading to the presence of larvae in both stool and sputum samples. This can be particularly concerning in immunocompromised patients, such as renal transplant recipients, where hyperinfection syndrome may occur, leading to severe disseminated disease. The detection of rhabditiform larvae is a hallmark of Strongyloides infection. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Ascaris – (Incorrect) Ascaris lumbricoides is a large roundworm that infects the intestines and produces fertilized eggs that are passed in the stool, not larvae. The larvae of Ascaris hatch in the intestine, migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs, and can be found in the sputum. However, Ascaris larvae are not typically rhabditiform and would not be the most likely cause of the findings described in this case. B. Hymenolepis – (Incorrect) Hymenolepis is a genus of tapeworms (such as Hymenolepis nana, the dwarf tapeworm). Tapeworms typically produce eggs that are passed in the stool, and larvae (cysticercoids) develop in the intestines of intermediate hosts. There are no reports of rhabditiform larvae associated with Hymenolepis infections, and Hymenolepis does not cause the lung involvement described in the case. C. Loa Loa – (Incorrect) Loa loa is a filarial worm transmitted by Chrysops flies (mango flies). The larvae (microfilariae) are typically found in the blood rather than in stool or sputum. They are not characterized by rhabditiform larvae, and Loa loa infections generally do not present with the pulmonary involvement seen in the question. D. Necator – (Incorrect) Necator americanus is a species of hookworm that, like Strongyloides, can enter the body through the skin and migrate through the lungs. However, Necator typically produces eggs in the stool, not rhabditiform larvae. Though both Necator and Strongyloides are hookworms, Strongyloides is more likely to present with larvae in both stool and sputum, particularly in immunocompromised patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Baermann technique. The Baermann technique is the best method for detecting Strongyloides larvae. This method involves using a warm water bath to allow the larvae to migrate out of stool samples or other tissues and then collect them for examination under a microscope. This technique is particularly effective in detecting the rhabditiform larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis, which are typically found in stool or rectal swabs. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Dilution followed by egg count – (Incorrect) This method is primarily used for detecting intestinal helminth eggs, such as those from Ascaris or hookworms, not larvae. Strongyloides typically does not produce eggs that can be easily counted in stool samples, as its life cycle involves larvae rather than eggs being passed in the feces. C. NIH swab – (Incorrect) The NIH (National Institutes of Health) swab is generally used to collect Enterobius vermicularis eggs from the perianal region to diagnose pinworm infections. This method is not appropriate for detecting Strongyloides larvae, as they do not reside in the perianal area but in the intestinal lumen. D. Sigmoidoscopy and aspiration of mucosal lesions – (Incorrect) While sigmoidoscopy can be helpful for visualizing intestinal lesions, it is not the best method for detecting Strongyloides larvae. Although Strongyloides can cause mucosal damage and larvae may be found in biopsy samples or aspirates, the Baermann technique is far more efficient and sensitive for detecting larvae in stool.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Visceral Larva migrans. Visceral Larva migrans (VLM) is most commonly caused by the migration of Toxocara larvae, particularly Toxocara canis, which is a roundworm typically found in dogs. Since the teenager works in a dog kennel, it is highly plausible that he was exposed to Toxocara eggs, which are shed in dog feces. The larvae, upon ingestion, migrate through the intestines and then spread to various organs, causing symptoms such as a skin rash, eosinophilia, and enlarged liver and spleen. The chronic nature of these symptoms (lasting for two years) also aligns with the typical course of Visceral Larva migrans. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Schistosomiasis – (Incorrect) Schistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma species, which are parasitic worms transmitted through contact with contaminated freshwater. Symptoms typically include fever, fatigue, and gastrointestinal or urinary tract issues, but eosinophilia and an enlarged liver and spleen are more commonly seen in chronic cases. However, the patient's history of working in a dog kennel and the nature of the symptoms makes Schistosomiasis less likely than Visceral Larva migrans in this case. B. Toxoplasmosis – (Incorrect) Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, and while it can lead to eosinophilia and organ enlargement, the typical mode of transmission is through ingestion of oocysts from contaminated food, water, or cat feces, rather than from dogs. The patient's chronic skin rash and organ enlargement more strongly suggest Visceral Larva migrans than Toxoplasmosis. C. Trichinosis – (Incorrect) Trichinosis is caused by the roundworm Trichinella spiralis, which is typically transmitted through consumption of undercooked or raw meat from infected animals, especially pigs. The symptoms of Trichinosis usually include muscle pain, fever, and swelling around the eyes, but liver and spleen enlargement are not characteristic. This makes Trichinosis an unlikely cause of the teenager’s symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Transmitted by the bite of a fly. Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is caused by the parasitic filarial worm Onchocerca volvulus. The disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected blackfly (genus Simulium), which bites and deposits larvae that mature into adult worms in the human host. The blackfly is the vector responsible for the transmission of this parasite. The adult worms produce microfilariae that can migrate through the body, potentially causing ocular involvement, as well as skin lesions and nodules. Explanation of the Other Options: A. is caused by a protozoan – (Incorrect) Onchocerciasis is caused by a helminth (parasitic worm), not a protozoan. Protozoa are single-celled organisms, whereas Onchocerca volvulus is a multicellular roundworm. Thus, the disease is caused by a worm, not a protozoan, making this option incorrect. C. is confined to the African continent – (Incorrect) While Onchocerciasis is highly prevalent in Africa, it is not confined exclusively to this continent. The disease is also found in Latin America and parts of the Middle East, particularly in countries near river systems where the blackfly vectors thrive. Therefore, stating it is confined only to Africa is incorrect. D. Ocular involvement results from lymphatic migration of the parasites – (Incorrect) The ocular involvement in Onchocerciasis results from the migration of microfilariae, not the adult worms, in the subcutaneous tissue, and not specifically from lymphatic migration. These microfilariae migrate to various parts of the body, including the eyes, where they can cause blindness. The presence of microfilariae in the eye leads to inflammatory responses, which can damage the cornea and retina, ultimately resulting in blindness. Therefore, lymphatic migration is not responsible for ocular damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The infestation is acquired from both dogs and cats. Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection caused by the roundworms Toxocara canis (from dogs) and Toxocara cati (from cats). Humans typically acquire the infection by ingesting the eggs of these parasites, which can be found in soil contaminated by the feces of infected animals, primarily dogs and cats. Both dogs and cats are the main sources of infection for humans. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Infestation occurs through ingestion of larvae – (Incorrect) In Toxocariasis, humans usually become infected by ingesting eggs of the parasite, not larvae. The eggs are ingested accidentally through contact with contaminated soil, surfaces, or hands. Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the intestine, releasing larvae that migrate to various tissues. Therefore, it is not larvae that are ingested, but rather the eggs that lead to infection. C. Intraocular calcification is a common feature of ocular toxocariasis – (Incorrect) While ocular toxocariasis can lead to serious eye conditions, intraocular calcification is not a common feature. The typical presentation of ocular toxocariasis includes uveitis, retinal lesions, and vision impairment. Intraocular calcification is more commonly associated with infections like toxoplasmosis, not Toxocariasis. Therefore, this option is incorrect. D. Steroid is contraindicated – (Incorrect) In the treatment of Toxocariasis, steroids may be used to reduce inflammation, especially in cases of ocular toxocariasis or visceral larva migrans, where there is significant tissue damage. Steroids help control the immune response that causes inflammation. However, the use of steroids is often carefully managed, particularly when there is a risk of suppressing the body’s ability to fight the parasitic infection. Steroids are not generally contraindicated, but they need to be used cautiously in combination with anti-parasitic treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Loa loa. C. Loa loa – (Correct) Loa loa, also known as the African eye worm, is a filarial parasite transmitted by Chrysops flies (mango flies). The key diagnostic feature for Loa loa in a blood smear is the presence of sheathed microfilariae with nuclei extending to the tail tip. These microfilariae are typically seen in the blood during the day, as they are diurnal, meaning they circulate in the bloodstream during daylight hours and return to the lungs at night. The patient in this case from Bihar, India, presenting with fever and the characteristic microfilaria pattern, suggests an infection with Loa loa. A. B. malayi – (Incorrect) Brugia malayi is another filarial parasite but it is typically associated with nocturnal microfilaria, meaning the microfilariae are present in the peripheral blood at night rather than during the day. B. malayi microfilariae are sheathed but have a different tail structure compared to Loa loa, where the nuclei do not extend to the tail tip. This is a key distinguishing feature between Loa loa and B. malayi. B. W. bancrofti – (Incorrect) Wuchereria bancrofti is the most common cause of lymphatic filariasis and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Like B. malayi, W. bancrofti microfilariae are sheathed, but they have nuclei that do not extend to the tail tip. Additionally, W. bancrofti microfilariae are typically nocturnal, meaning they circulate in the blood at night, which does not align with the scenario presented in the question. D. Onchocerca volvulus – (Incorrect) Onchocerca volvulus causes onchocerciasis (river blindness) and is transmitted by black flies. The microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus are unsheathed and are typically found in skin biopsies rather than blood smears. The presence of sheathed microfilariae with nuclei extending to the tail tip does not match the characteristics of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Onchocerca volvulus. B. Onchocerca volvulus – (Correct) Onchocerca volvulus is the causative agent of onchocerciasis (river blindness), and it is transmitted by black flies. It commonly causes subcutaneous nodules, which are typically found over areas like the iliac crest, as described in this case. These nodules are firm, nontender, and mobile, and they often contain both adult worms and microfilariae. The microfilariae can be found in the skin, which is typically the site of biopsy or scraping to confirm the diagnosis. The presence of itchy nodules and microfilariae in the skin scrapings is characteristic of Onchocerca volvulus infection. A. Loa loa – (Incorrect) Loa loa (African eye worm) also causes subcutaneous nodules, but these are typically seen in the forehead, eyes, or calf. The microfilariae of Loa loa are diurnal and usually circulate in the blood during daylight hours, unlike the microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which are found in the skin. Additionally, the subcutaneous nodules in Loa loa are not usually found in the iliac crest area, which makes this diagnosis less likely in this case. C. Brugia malayi – (Incorrect) Brugia malayi is a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, and it typically causes lymphatic edema and elephantiasis rather than subcutaneous nodules. The microfilariae of B. malayi are typically found in blood smears during nighttime and are not usually present in skin scrapings. Furthermore, B. malayi is associated with mosquito vectors, and it is not typically found in the subcutaneous tissue as described here. D. Mansonella perstans – (Incorrect) Mansonella perstans is another filarial parasite, but it generally causes mild or asymptomatic infections. The microfilariae of Mansonella perstans are present in the blood rather than the skin. They do not usually cause the firm, subcutaneous nodules seen in Onchocerca volvulus. Additionally, M. perstans is generally not associated with itchy nodules or adult worms visible in skin scrapings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Flat or fleshy leaf-like worms. B. Flat or fleshy leaf-like worms – (Incorrect) This option is incorrect because flat or fleshy leaf-like worms are characteristic of platyhelminths (flatworms), not nematodes (roundworms). Platyhelminths include trematodes (flukes) and cestodes (tapeworms), which typically have flat, leaf-like, or segmented bodies. Nematodes, on the other hand, are cylindrical and unsegmented. Therefore, this characteristic does not apply to nematodes and is the key differentiating feature. A. Absent fragmentation – (Correct) Nematodes do not undergo fragmentation. Unlike tapeworms (a type of flatworm) which can break into segments, nematodes maintain their cylindrical, unsegmented body structure throughout their lifecycle. This characteristic helps differentiate them from segmented worms like cestodes. C. Separate sexes – (Correct) Most nematodes exhibit sexual dimorphism, meaning they have distinct male and female individuals. The males are usually smaller, and they have specialized structures for mating. This is different from some other types of worms, such as hermaphroditic flatworms (like trematodes and cestodes), where both male and female reproductive organs may be present in the same individual. D. Cylindrical body – (Correct) The most distinctive feature of nematodes is their cylindrical body. They have a long, slender, and unsegmented body structure, which is a key characteristic that sets them apart from other worms like flatworms. This cylindrical shape is well-suited for their movement through their host's tissues. E. GIT is formed completely – (Correct) Nematodes possess a complete gastrointestinal tract (GIT), meaning they have both a mouth and an anus. This is in contrast to some other worms, like flatworms, which may have an incomplete digestive system (with only a single opening that serves as both mouth and anus). The complete GIT in nematodes allows for more efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients.",

Trichinella spiralis – (Correct) Trichinella spiralis is a nematode (roundworm) that causes trichinosis, a parasitic infection primarily transmitted through the consumption of undercooked or raw meat, particularly pork. While Trichinella larvae can invade muscles and form cysts, it does not typically infect the nervous system, making it not a neuroparasite. The primary symptoms are muscle pain and swelling, not neurological manifestations. Therefore, it is not considered a neuroparasite. A. Taenia solium – (Incorrect) Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, can indeed affect the nervous system. When its larvae, known as cysticerci, invade the brain, it can cause neurocysticercosis, a leading cause of acquired epilepsy in many parts of the world. Neurocysticercosis is a significant neurological infection, and as a result, Taenia solium is classified as a neuroparasite. B. Acanthamoeba – (Incorrect) Acanthamoeba is an amoeba that can cause Acanthamoeba encephalitis, a rare but serious infection of the brain, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It can also cause a severe eye infection known as keratitis. Since it affects the central nervous system (CNS), it is classified as a neuroparasite. C. Naegleria – (Incorrect) Naegleria fowleri, commonly known as the \"brain-eating amoeba,\" causes a fatal infection of the brain called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). It is a well-known neuroparasite, as it directly affects the CNS by entering the body through the nasal passages and migrating to the brain.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Enterobius. Explanation: Enterobius vermicularis, commonly known as the pinworm, is known for its ability to cause autoinfection. This occurs when a person who has pinworm eggs on their hands or nails re-ingests the eggs, typically from scratching the anal region and then touching the mouth. Autoinfection can lead to a perpetuating cycle of reinfection in the same individual, often making treatment more challenging. Incorrect responses: A. Ankylostoma (Hookworm): Ankylostoma species, such as Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, do not cause autoinfection. These worms typically infect humans through skin penetration by larvae, which mature in the intestines. Autoinfection does not occur in the life cycle of these hookworms. C. Echinococcus: Echinococcus species cause hydatid disease, and their life cycle involves intermediate hosts (such as sheep or cattle) and definitive hosts (like dogs). There is no mechanism for autoinfection with Echinococcus, as humans are accidental intermediate hosts and the eggs are typically transmitted through contact with infected animal feces. D. Ascariasis: Ascaris lumbricoides, the roundworm, does not cause autoinfection. The eggs of Ascaris are ingested by humans and hatch in the intestines. The larvae then migrate through the body before returning to the intestines. Autoinfection does not occur because the eggs must pass through the environment to remain infective.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tail tip free from nuclei. Explanation: B. Tail tip free from nuclei: Wuchereria bancrofti is a filarial parasite transmitted by mosquitoes, and its microfilariae are characterized by the absence of nuclei in the tail tip. This is one of the key distinguishing features when identifying W. bancrofti microfilariae under a microscope. The tail of the microfilaria is typically tapered and lacks the nuclei that can be found in the tail tip of other filarial species such as Brugia malayi. Incorrect responses: A. Unsheathed: Wuchereria bancrofti is actually sheathed, meaning its microfilariae are surrounded by a hyaline sheath, which is not characteristic of all filarial worms. Some species, like Brugia malayi, are unsheathed, but W. bancrofti microfilariae are typically sheathed. C. Non-periodic: Wuchereria bancrofti is periodic, meaning that its microfilariae exhibit a diurnal or nocturnal periodicity. In contrast, non-periodic filariae, like Brugia malayi, do not follow a strict period pattern. The microfilariae of W. bancrofti typically peak in the blood at night, which helps in the diagnosis of the infection. D. All: Since statements A and C are incorrect, this option is not valid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ascaris. Explanation: B. Ascaris: Ascaris lumbricoides is a common intestinal helminth, but it typically does not cause malabsorption syndrome. While heavy infestations can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction, Ascaris infection usually does not impair nutrient absorption to the extent that other parasitic infections might. Therefore, Ascaris does not generally lead to malabsorption syndrome. Incorrect responses: A. Giardiasis: Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, which can lead to malabsorption syndrome. The parasite attaches to the intestinal mucosa, causing inflammation and disrupting the normal absorption of nutrients, leading to diarrhea, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. Giardiasis is one of the most common causes of malabsorption. C. Strongyloides: Strongyloides stercoralis is another parasitic infection that can cause malabsorption. The larvae of this helminth invade the intestines, where they can cause chronic inflammation and interfere with the absorption of nutrients, especially in immunocompromised individuals. D. Capillaria philippinensis: Capillaria philippinensis is a parasitic nematode that can cause malabsorption syndrome. The infection leads to intestinal inflammation, villous atrophy, and malabsorption of nutrients, resulting in diarrhea and weight loss. This parasite is primarily found in Southeast Asia and can lead to significant nutritional deficiencies if untreated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) This patient likely has filariasis with acute lymphadenitis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. It is endemic throughout the tropics and subtropics, including Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, parts of South America, and the Caribbean. W. bancrofti is the most widely distributed human filarial parasite and is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Lymphatic infection is common and may be acute or chronic. Chronic lower-extremity lymphatic infection causes elephantiasis. Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the parasite. Microfilariae may be found in blood, hydrocele, or other body fluid collections by direct microscopic examination. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for circulating antigens are available commercially and have sensitivity of greater than 93% with excellent specificity. Polymerase chain reaction–based assays have been developed that may be as effective. In cases of acute lymphadenitis, ultrasound examination with Doppler may actually reveal motile worms in dilated lymphatics. Live worms have a distinctive movement pattern (filarial dance sign). Worms may be visualized in the spermatic cords of up to 80% of men infected with W. bancrofti. Stool ova and parasite examination is not useful for demonstration of W. bancrofti.",
