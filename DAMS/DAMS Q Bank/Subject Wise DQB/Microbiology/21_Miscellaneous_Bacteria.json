      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gardnerella vaginalis Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is primarily caused by an overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobic bacterium. In BV, there is a disruption of the normal vaginal flora, especially a decrease in protective lactobacilli, leading to an imbalance where anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, proliferate excessively. This condition is characterized by a thin, grayish-white vaginal discharge with a fishy odor, particularly after sexual intercourse. A key diagnostic feature is the presence of \"clue cells\" (vaginal epithelial cells coated with bacteria) on microscopic examination. The \"whiff test\" (adding KOH to the discharge to release the fishy odor) is also commonly positive. Treatment usually involves metronidazole or clindamycin to target anaerobic bacteria. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: B. Trichomonas vaginalis – Incorrect Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI), not bacterial vaginosis. Trichomoniasis presents with frothy greenish-yellow discharge, vaginal itching, and a \"strawberry cervix\" on examination due to punctate hemorrhages. Although it causes vaginal infection, it is not bacterial vaginosis and requires different treatment (usually metronidazole targeting the protozoan). C. Candida albicans – Incorrect Candida albicans is a fungus responsible for vulvovaginal candidiasis, characterized by thick, white, \"cottage cheese-like\" discharge, intense itching, and redness. Unlike BV, candidiasis is a fungal infection, not bacterial, and is treated with antifungal agents such as fluconazole. Candida does not cause bacterial vaginosis. D. Escherichia coli (E. coli) – Incorrect E. coli is a gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) rather than vaginal infections. While E. coli can be part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the perineal area, it is not responsible for bacterial vaginosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Q fever. Q fever is caused by Coxiella burnetii, a bacterium that is typically transmitted to humans through inhalation of contaminated dust from animal feces, urine, or birth products, but it can also be transmitted through unpasteurized milk. This makes milk a potential vehicle for infection, particularly if consumed from infected animals like cattle, sheep, or goats. Individuals can develop fever, headache, and pneumonia following exposure. Pasteurization of milk helps to prevent the transmission of Q fever. Explanation of Other Options: (B) Poliomyelitis – (Incorrect) Poliomyelitis, caused by the poliovirus, is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, typically by ingestion of contaminated water or food. While there are rare instances where milk could be contaminated by fecal material, poliomyelitis is not commonly spread through milk. The main preventive measure against polio is vaccination. (C) Whooping cough – (Incorrect) Whooping cough (pertussis) is caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is not transmitted by milk. The disease affects the respiratory system, causing severe coughing fits, and can be prevented by vaccination. (D) Diphtheria – (Incorrect) Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, or through direct contact with an infected person. Milk is not a significant transmission route for diphtheria, and vaccination against diphtheria is a standard preventive measure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Donovanosis. Donovanosis (also known as granuloma inguinale) is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis and is characterized by painless genital ulcers that develop into beefy red, friable lesions. While lymphadenopathy can occur, buboes (swollen, painful lymph nodes) are not a hallmark feature of this disease. The disease is primarily focused on genital ulcers, and although secondary infections can involve lymph nodes, buboes are not typically seen in Donovanosis. Explanation of Other Options: (A) LGV (Lymphogranuloma Venereum) – (Incorrect) Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by specific serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, is known for the development of buboes. The disease often presents with a painful genital ulcer followed by inguinal lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) that progress to buboes. This is a classic feature of LGV. (B) Plague – (Incorrect) Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is another disease that characteristically presents with buboes. These swollen and painful lymph nodes are a common finding, particularly in bubonic plague, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. Plague can also present in other forms such as septicemic or pneumonic, but buboes are most associated with the bubonic form. (D) Filariasis – (Incorrect) Filariasis, caused by parasitic worms like Wuchereria bancrofti, is another disease that can cause buboes. It results from lymphatic obstruction due to the parasitic infection, leading to swelling of lymph nodes (buboes) and, in chronic cases, elephantiasis (severe swelling of limbs). Buboes are seen during the acute phase of the disease.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mycoplasma. The term Eaton agent refers to the causative organism of Eaton's disease, also known as atypical pneumonia or mycoplasma pneumonia. The agent responsible for this infection is Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a type of bacterium that lacks a cell wall, making it resistant to certain antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis (like penicillin). Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known for causing walking pneumonia, which is typically milder than other forms of pneumonia, and is often associated with respiratory tract infections. The name \"Eaton agent\" was originally used to describe the organism in the early studies of the disease. Explanation of Other Options: (A) Corynebacterium – (Incorrect) Corynebacterium species, including Corynebacterium diphtheriae, are responsible for diseases like diphtheria. Corynebacterium does not cause Eaton's disease or atypical pneumonia. It is known for forming a grayish pseudomembrane in the throat and can lead to respiratory complications, but it is not related to the Eaton agent. (B) Pseudomonas – (Incorrect) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. It can cause infections in the lungs, skin, and urinary tract but is not the Eaton agent. It does not cause atypical pneumonia and is not linked to Mycoplasma pneumonia. (D) Gonococcus – (Incorrect) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) causes gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection. While gonococcus can lead to various infections, including urethritis and pelvic inflammatory disease, it does not cause atypical pneumonia or relate to the Eaton agent. It is unrelated to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Yersinia pestis – (Correct) The most probable etiologic agent is Yersinia pestis, the causative organism of plague, which is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, hypotension, cyanosis, and lymphadenopathy, specifically buboes (painful, swollen lymph nodes). The patient’s clinical presentation, including bipolar-staining, short, gram-negative bacilli on blood culture, is strongly suggestive of Yersinia pestis. The characteristic bipolar staining is due to the intracellular location of the bacteria in macrophages and their staining pattern, which resembles a \"safety pin.\" Plague, particularly septicemic plague, can progress rapidly and is often fatal if untreated, as seen in this case. Transmission typically occurs through the bite of an infected flea, or contact with infected animals. Incorrect Answers: (B) Brucella abortus – (Incorrect) Brucella abortus is the causative agent of brucellosis, which usually presents with fever, malaise, and musculoskeletal pain, rather than the acute onset of hypotension and cyanosis seen in this patient. Brucellosis does not typically cause buboes or the bipolar-staining appearance of the bacteria as observed in this case. While Brucella abortus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or consumption of unpasteurized milk, the presentation is not as rapidly fatal or dramatic as plague. (C) Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis – (Incorrect) Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis causes rhinoscleroma, a chronic infection affecting the nasal passages and upper respiratory tract, characterized by granulomatous inflammation and tissue destruction, not the acute septic presentation seen in this patient. It does not typically cause hypotension, cyanosis, or bipolar-staining gram-negative bacilli. Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis is not associated with buboes or rapidly fatal septicemia. (D) Francisella tularensis – (Incorrect) Francisella tularensis causes tularemia, which can present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin ulcers after contact with infected animals or vectors like ticks. However, tularemia usually presents with unilateral lymphadenopathy, rather than bilateral inguinal and axillary lymphadenopathy as seen in this case. Additionally, Francisella tularensis does not produce the bipolar-staining, short gram-negative bacilli characteristic of Yersinia pestis. While tularemia can be severe, it is less likely to cause septicemia and death as rapidly as plague does.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Q fever, because lice are not vectors for Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever. Instead, Q fever is primarily transmitted via inhalation of aerosols contaminated with Coxiella burnetii, which is commonly found in the birth products, urine, feces, and milk of infected animals, particularly cattle, sheep, and goats. The disease is zoonotic and is often associated with exposure to livestock or contaminated environments rather than arthropod vectors like lice. Unlike other rickettsial diseases, Q fever does not require an insect vector for transmission. Incorrect Options: (A) Relapsing fever: Incorrect because lice (Pediculus humanus humanus) are known vectors of Borrelia recurrentis, the causative agent of epidemic relapsing fever. The disease is transmitted when infected lice are crushed and their body contents come into contact with mucous membranes or broken skin, allowing the spirochetes to enter the host’s bloodstream. (C) Trench fever: Incorrect because Bartonella quintana, the bacterium responsible for trench fever, is transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus). The infection occurs when louse feces containing Bartonella quintana are scratched into the skin or come into contact with mucous membranes. Trench fever was historically common among soldiers in World War I. (D) Epidemic typhus: Incorrect because Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus, is transmitted by the human body louse. Infection occurs when louse feces containing the bacteria are rubbed into skin abrasions or mucous membranes. Epidemic typhus is often associated with overcrowding and poor sanitation, such as in refugee camps or during wartime.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chlamydia. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular organism, meaning it cannot survive or replicate outside a host cell. This is because it lacks the ability to synthesize its own ATP, relying instead on the host cell’s energy supply. Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci are well-known species that cause human infections, including trachoma, sexually transmitted infections, pneumonia, and psittacosis. Its unique biphasic life cycle includes: Elementary Body (EB) – Infectious but metabolically inactive form. Reticulate Body (RB) – Non-infectious but metabolically active form, which replicates inside host cells. Incorrect Options: (A) Mycoplasma – Incorrect. Mycoplasma species are extracellular bacteria, though they have a unique feature of lacking a cell wall. They can survive independently and do not require entry into host cells for replication. Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia, but it does not exhibit strict intracellular dependence. (C) Cryptococcus – Incorrect. Cryptococcus is a fungus, not a bacterium. It is an extracellular pathogen, though it can survive within macrophages. It primarily causes cryptococcal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. (D) Helicobacter pylori – Incorrect. H. pylori is a microaerophilic extracellular bacterium that colonizes the stomach lining and is associated with gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. Although it can invade gastric epithelial cells, it does not rely on an obligate intracellular lifestyle.",

Plague outbreaks in India have historically occurred in states where rodent populations and flea infestations are common, particularly in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh. These states have had recorded plague outbreaks due to their climatic conditions, presence of wild rodents, and human settlements conducive to plague transmission. However, Kerala has not reported any major plague outbreak in history, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Gujarat – Incorrect. Gujarat has experienced multiple plague outbreaks, including the 1994 Surat plague outbreak, which was one of the most significant outbreaks in India, causing widespread panic and migration. (B) Maharashtra – Incorrect. Plague has been historically reported in parts of Maharashtra, particularly in rural areas with high rodent populations. Some outbreaks occurred in the early 20th century and sporadic cases have been documented. (D) Madhya Pradesh (MP) – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) They are inhibited by Penicillins. Mycoplasma species are inherently resistant to penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics because they lack a cell wall, which is the primary target of these drugs. Penicillins, cephalosporins, and other β-lactams work by inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis, but since Mycoplasma do not possess peptidoglycan, these antibiotics have no effect on them. Instead, Mycoplasma infections are treated with antibiotics that target bacterial ribosomes, such as macrolides (e.g., azithromycin), tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline), or fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin). Incorrect Options: (B) They can reproduce in cell-free media – Correct. Unlike many intracellular bacteria, Mycoplasma can grow in artificial laboratory media without requiring a host cell. However, they require sterol supplementation (such as cholesterol) for membrane synthesis, which is included in special media like SP4 or Eaton’s agar. (C) They have an affinity for mammalian cell membranes – Correct. Mycoplasma species, especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have a strong affinity for respiratory epithelium due to the presence of adhesion proteins like P1 adhesin. This allows them to attach tightly to host cell membranes, evading immune responses and causing prolonged infections. (D) They can pass through filters of 450 nm pore size – Correct. Mycoplasma are among the smallest self-replicating bacteria, with a size range of 150–250 nm, allowing them to pass through standard bacterial filters (450 nm pore size). This feature initially led to confusion, as they were once thought to be viruses due to their filterability.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mycoplasma. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, especially in cases of atypical (walking) pneumonia, is associated with a positive cold agglutination test. This test detects cold agglutinins, which are IgM antibodies that agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs) at low temperatures (≤4°C) and cause hemolytic anemia. These autoantibodies target the I antigen on RBC surfaces, leading to cold agglutinin disease. Though not highly specific for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, this test is a useful early diagnostic clue before confirmatory serological tests are performed. Incorrect Options: (B) Chlamydia – Incorrect. Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections do not typically induce cold agglutinins. Instead, serological tests such as microimmunofluorescence (MIF) and PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis. (C) Infectious mononucleosis – Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis, does not induce cold agglutinins. Instead, it is associated with the heterophile antibody test (Monospot test), which detects antibodies that react with sheep or horse RBCs. (D) Varicella – Incorrect. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox and shingles, does not produce cold agglutinins. Its diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation, PCR, or direct fluorescent antibody tests.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mycoplasma. Mycoplasma species are unique among bacteria because they completely lack a cell wall. Instead, they have a triple-layered plasma membrane rich in sterols, which provides structural integrity. Due to the absence of a peptidoglycan layer, Mycoplasma are intrinsically resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins), which target cell wall synthesis. They are also highly pleomorphic (varying in shape) and can pass through bacterial filters due to their small size (150–250 nm). Incorrect Options: (A) Chlamydia – Incorrect. While Chlamydia species have an atypical cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, they still have an outer membrane with cysteine-rich proteins, providing some structural rigidity. Unlike Mycoplasma, Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria that depend on host cells for replication. (C) Streptococcus – Incorrect. Streptococcus species have a typical Gram-positive cell wall, consisting of thick peptidoglycan layers and teichoic acids. This makes them susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins. (D) Anaerobes – Incorrect. Anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium) have cell walls, either Gram-positive or Gram-negative, depending on the species. While some anaerobes may have altered cell wall structures, they are not cell wall-deficient like Mycoplasma.",

Mycoplasma species lack a cell wall and instead have a unique triple-layered plasma membrane, which requires cholesterol for stability and growth. This dependence on cholesterol is why special enriched media, such as SP4 agar or Eaton’s agar, supplemented with sterols, are used to culture Mycoplasma. Unlike most bacteria, which synthesize their own membrane lipids, Mycoplasma must obtain cholesterol from their environment, making this a distinguishing characteristic of the genus. Incorrect Options: (A) Obligate intracellular organism – Incorrect. Mycoplasma are facultative extracellular bacteria, meaning they can grow outside host cells in artificial media.

The fishy odor intensifies when the discharge is mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH), a diagnostic test known as the whiff test. Additionally, the presence of clue cells—vaginal epithelial cells covered with adherent bacteria—on wet mount microscopy is a hallmark of BV. BV is associated with a disrupted vaginal microbiota, where normal lactobacilli are replaced by anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Gonorrhea: Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection typically causes a purulent, yellow-green discharge rather than a thin, fishy-smelling one. Gonorrhea also frequently presents with dysuria, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The diagnosis is confirmed using Gram stain (showing Gram-negative diplococci) or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) rather than clue cells or the whiff test. (B) Chlamydia infection: Chlamydia trachomatis infection is often asymptomatic but can cause mucopurulent cervical discharge. Unlike BV, it does not produce a foul odor or clue cells, and the KOH whiff test is negative. Chlamydia is diagnosed via NAATs rather than wet mount microscopy. (C) Chancroid: Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid, leads to painful genital ulcers and tender, suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy, not vaginal discharge. Diagnosis is made via special culture media or PCR, and clue cells are not seen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Yersinia pestis is a gram-negative rod that causes the plague and has been one of the most widely used bioweapons over the centuries. Although Y. pestis lacks environmental stability, it is highly contagious and has a high mortality rate, making it an effective agent of bioterrorism. There are two major syndromes caused by Y. pestis that reflect the mode of infection. These patients presented with symptoms typical of bubonic plague, which still exists widely in nature. In the United States, the area with the greatest number of naturally occurring cases of bubonic plague is in the Southwest with transmission occurring via contact with infected animals or fleas. In this case, infected animals or fleas were present in the concentrated population of an immigrant camp that had poor sanitation. After an individual is bitten by an infected vector, the bacteria travel through the lymphatics to regional lymph nodes, where they are phagocytized but not destroyed. The organisms can then multiply with the cells, leading to inflammation, painful and markedly enlarged lymph nodes, and fever. The affected lymph nodes can develop necrosis and are characteristically called buboes. Infection can progress to severe sepsis and death. The mortality rate for treated bubonic plague is 1–15% and 40–60% in untreated cases. When Y. pestis is used as an agent of bioterrorism, it is aerosolized to a large area, and the affected cases present primarily with pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague presents with fever, cough, hemoptysis, and gastrointestinal symptoms that occur 1–6 days after exposure. Without treatment, pneumonic plague has an 85% morality rate with death occurring rapidly within 2–6 days. The treatment for Y. pestis could include aminoglycosides or doxycycline.",

Overnight, she developed a fever of 39.6°C and had shaking chills. By this morning, she was feeling very fatigued. Her son feels that she has had periods of waxing and waning mental status. She denies cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. She has a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis. She takes prednisone, 10 mg daily, and methotrexate, 15 mg weekly. On examination, she is lethargic but appropriate. Her vital signs are blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg, heart rate of 122 beats/min, temperature of 39.1°C, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical examination shows clear lung fields and a regular tachycardia without murmur. There is no abdominal tenderness or masses. Stool is negative for occult blood. There are no rashes. Hematologic studies show a white blood cell count of 24,200/µL with a differential of 82% PMNs, 8% band forms, 6% lymphocytes, and 3% monocytes. Hemoglobin is 8.2 g/dL. Urinalysis shows numerous white blood cells with gram-negative bacteria on Gram stain. Chemistries reveal the following: bicarbonate of 16 meq/L, BUN of 60 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response that develops in response to a microbial source. To diagnose the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), a patient should have two or more of the following conditions: (1) fever or hypothermia; (2) tachypnea; (3) tachycardia; or (4) leukocytosis, leukopenia, or greater than 10% band forms. This patient fulfills the criteria for sepsis with septic shock because she meets these criteria for SIRS with the presence of organ dysfunction and ongoing hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. The patient has received 2 L of intravenous colloid and now has a central venous pressure of 18 cmH2O. Ongoing large-volume fluid administration may result in pulmonary edema as the central venous pressure is quite high. At this point, fluid administration should continue but at a lower infusion rate. In this patient, who is receiving chronic glucocorticoids for an underlying inflammatory condition, stress-dose steroids should be administered because adrenal suppression will prevent the patient from developing the normal stress response in the face of SIRS. If the patient fails to respond to glucocorticoids, she should be started on vasopressor therapy. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency may be very difficult in critically ill patients. Whereas a plasma cortisol level of less than 15 µg/mL indicates adrenal insufficiency (inadequate production of cortisol), many experts now feel that the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test is not useful for detecting less profound degrees of corticosteroid deficiency in patients who are critically ill. A single small study has suggested that norepinephrine may be preferred over dopamine for septic shock, but these data have not been confirmed in other trials. The “Surviving Sepsis” guidelines state that either norepinephrine or dopamine should be considered as a first-line agent for the treatment of septic shock. Transfusion of red blood cells in critically ill patients has been associated with a higher risk for development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and death. A threshold hemoglobin value of 7 g/dL has been shown to be as safe as a value of 10 g/dL and is associated with fewer complications. In this patient, a blood transfusion is not currently indicated, but it may be considered if the central venous oxygen saturation is below 70% to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. An alternative to blood transfusion in this setting is the use of dobutamine to improve cardiac output.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia (walking pneumonia), which typically presents with gradual-onset symptoms including headache, fever, malaise, and a persistent dry cough. The chest X-ray often shows a diffuse, patchy bronchopneumonia that appears more severe than the patient's clinical condition would suggest. A key feature of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is a normal or only mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, distinguishing it from bacterial pneumonias. This infection is common in young adults and spreads via respiratory droplets, often in crowded settings such as dormitories or military barracks. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Legionellosis (Legionella pneumophila infection): Legionella pneumophila can cause Legionnaires' disease, which also presents with atypical pneumonia, fever, and cough. However, it is often associated with high fever, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea), and hyponatremia. Additionally, WBC count is usually elevated, and the condition is more common in elderly, immunocompromised, or individuals exposed to contaminated water sources (e.g., air conditioning systems, hot tubs). The lack of GI symptoms and normal WBC count in this case makes Mycoplasma pneumoniae the more likely cause. (B) Infection with parainfluenza virus: Parainfluenza virus is a cause of viral respiratory infections, especially in children, and is the most common cause of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). It typically presents with barking cough, stridor, and hoarseness, rather than a patchy bronchopneumonia. Additionally, viral pneumonias often have more prominent upper respiratory symptoms (runny nose, congestion), which are not described in this case. (C) Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae: S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which presents with sudden onset of high fever, chills, productive cough with rust-colored sputum, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest X-ray typically shows lobar consolidation, rather than the diffuse bronchopneumonia seen here. The normal WBC count in this patient also makes S. pneumoniae infection less likely, as bacterial pneumonias usually cause leukocytosis.",

Surveillance data from Australia and Asia suggest that infections are common, and there are reports of community-acquired Acinetobacter infection. They typically infect patients receiving long-term care in intensive care units by causing ventilator-associated pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections. They are particularly of concern because of their propensity to develop multidrug (or pan-drug) resistance and their ability to colonize units because of health care worker transmission. A. baumannii is the most common isolate and develops drug resistance avidly. Many strains are currently resistant to carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem). Last-line agents such as colistin, polymixin A, and tigecycline are often the only available therapeutic options. Tigecycline has been used for pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant strains but is not thought to be efficacious in bloodstream infection because usual dosing does not achieve therapeutic levels against Acinetobacter spp.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Gentamicin, 5 mg/kg twice daily. This patient’s presentation is most consistent with Francisella tularensis infection, also known as tularemia. Tularemia is a zoonotic infection commonly contracted through contact with infected animals, such as rabbits, squirrels, and other wildlife, or through bites from infected insects like ticks or mosquitoes. The patient’s ulcerative skin lesion with a black eschar, as well as the enlargement of regional lymph nodes, particularly the fluctuating epitrochlear node, are classic signs of ulceroglandular tularemia, the most common form of the disease. Additionally, the patient’s fever, headache, muscle aches, pneumonia (evidenced by crackles and fluffy bilateral alveolar infiltrates on the chest radiograph), and hypotension with progressive hypoxia are indicative of severe systemic involvement, which can be life-threatening without proper treatment. Gentamicin is the preferred treatment for severe tularemia. The drug is effective against Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative bacterium, and is the recommended antibiotic for severe cases of tularemia, particularly when the infection involves pneumonia or septic shock. Gentamicin has good activity against this pathogen and is used to treat severe systemic infections. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Ampicillin, 2 g IV q6h: While ampicillin is an excellent antibiotic for many bacterial infections, it is not effective against Francisella tularensis. Tularemia requires treatment with aminoglycosides such as gentamicin or alternative therapies like streptomycin. Ampicillin is not the drug of choice in this case. (B) Ceftriaxone, 1 g IV daily: Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin and is effective against many gram-negative organisms. However, Francisella tularensis is resistant to ceftriaxone. While ceftriaxone might be useful for some infections, it would not be appropriate for tularemia. Again, gentamicin is preferred for severe cases. (C) Ciprofloxacin, 400 mg IV twice daily: Although ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with activity against Francisella tularensis, it is generally not the first-line therapy for severe tularemia, especially in critically ill patients. Gentamicin or streptomycin remains the gold standard, with ciprofloxacin being more commonly used in less severe cases or as an alternative in certain circumstances.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) B. fragilis is an anaerobic gram-negative rod whose natural habitat is the human colon. Bacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic, gram-negative rod that is part of the normal flora of the human colon. It is the most common anaerobic pathogen in intra-abdominal infections and abscesses, such as the one described in this case. Although B. fragilis is normally harmless in the colon, it can cause infections when it is introduced into sterile body sites, such as during trauma, surgery, or when the intestinal barrier is compromised. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) A stage in the life cycle of B. fragilis involves forming spores in the soil: This is incorrect because B. fragilis does not form spores. Spore formation is characteristic of other anaerobic organisms, such as Clostridium species. B. fragilis is an obligate anaerobe but does not have a spore-forming lifecycle. (C) B. fragilis produces black colonies when grown on blood agar: This is incorrect. Bacteroides fragilis typically produces grayish colonies on blood agar, not black. The black colony formation on blood agar is a characteristic of other species, such as Clostridium perfringens (due to its production of hydrogen sulfide), but not B. fragilis. (D) Pathogenesis by B. fragilis involves an exotoxin that increases cyclic AMP by ADP-ribosylation of a G protein: This is incorrect because the pathogenesis of B. fragilis is primarily attributed to its ability to produce capsular polysaccharides and enzymes that enhance its virulence, not a cyclic AMP-exotoxin mechanism. The organism’s capsule helps it evade host immune responses, while enzymes like proteases and lipases contribute to tissue destruction and abscess formation. The exotoxin described here is more characteristic of other pathogens like Vibrio cholerae or Bordetella pertussis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) This patient has culture-negative endocarditis, a rare entity defined as clinical evidence of infectious endocarditis in the absence of positive blood cultures. In this case, evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis includes valvular regurgitation; an aortic valve vegetation; and embolic phenomena on the extremities, spleen, and kidneys. A common reason for negative blood culture results is prior antibiotics. In the absence of this, the two most common pathogens (both of which are technically difficult to isolate in blood culture bottles) are Q fever, or Coxiella burnetii (typically associated with close contact with livestock), and Bartonella spp. In this case, the patient’s homelessness and body louse infestation are clues for Bartonella quintana infection. Diagnosis is made by blood culture about 25% of the time. Otherwise, direct polymerase chain reaction of valvular tissue, if available, or acute and convalescent serologies are diagnostic options. Empirical therapy for culture-negative endocarditis usually includes ceftriaxone and gentamicin with or without doxycycline. For confirmed Bartonella endocarditis, optimal therapy is gentamicin plus doxycycline. Epstein-Barr virus and HIV do not cause endocarditis. A peripheral blood smear would not be diagnostic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Donovanosis is caused by the intracellular organism Calymmatobacterium granulomatis and most often presents as a painless erythematous genital ulceration after a 1- to 4-week incubation period. However, incubation periods can be as long as 1 year. The infection is predominantly sexually transmitted, and autoinoculation can lead to formation of new lesions by contact with adjacent infected skin. Typically, the lesion is painless but bleeds easily. Complications include phimosis in men and pseudo-elephantiasis of the labia in women. If the infection is untreated, it can lead to progressive destruction of the penis or other organs. Diagnosis is made by demonstration of Donovan bodies within large mononuclear cells on smears from the lesion. Donovan bodies refers to the appearance of multiple intracellular organisms within the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells. These organisms are bipolar and have an appearance similar to a safety pin. On histologic examination, there is an increase in the number of plasma cells with few neutrophils; additionally, epithelial hyperplasia is present and can resemble neoplasia. A variety of antibiotics can be used to treat donovanosis, including macrolides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Treatment should be continued until the lesion has healed, often requiring 5 or more weeks of treatment. All of the choices listed in the question are in the differential diagnosis of penile ulcerations. Lymphogranuloma venereum is endemic in the Caribbean. The ulcer of primary infection heals spontaneously, and the second phase of the infection results in markedly enlarged inguinal lymphadenopathy, which may drain spontaneously. Haemophilus ducreyi results in painful genital ulcerations, and the organism can be cultured from the lesion. The painless ulcerations of cutaneous leishmaniasis can appear similarly to those of donovanosis but usually occur on exposed skin. Histologic determination of intracellular parasites can distinguish leishmaniasis definitively from donovanosis. Finally, it is unlikely that the patient has syphilis in the setting of a negative rapid plasma reagin test result, and the histology is inconsistent with this diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Penicillin. For infections caused by Bacteroides fragilis, Penicillin is an appropriate first-line therapy. Bacteroides species are anaerobic gram-negative rods, and although they are generally resistant to penicillin alone due to beta-lactamase production, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, or carbapenems (e.g., meropenem) are often used in more severe cases. In this case, Penicillin is typically used for the management of the infection, but it’s crucial to confirm the organism's antibiotic resistance profile to ensure adequate treatment. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Amphotericin B: Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication, not an antibiotic. It is used to treat systemic fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, candidiasis, and aspergillosis, but not bacterial infections like the one caused by Bacteroides fragilis. Therefore, it is not the appropriate choice for this case. (B) Itraconazole: Itraconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat various fungal infections, including aspergillosis and histoplasmosis. Similar to amphotericin B, it would not be effective for treating an infection caused by Bacteroides fragilis, which is a bacterial pathogen, not a fungal one. (D) Surgical debridement: Surgical debridement is an important part of the management of abscesses caused by Bacteroides fragilis, especially in cases of large or necrotizing infections. However, it is not the sole treatment. The infection also requires antibiotic therapy to address the underlying bacterial cause. In this case, while surgical debridement may be necessary, Penicillin or a broader-spectrum beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination is the correct initial therapy for the infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most likely cause of the patient's presentation. This patient is a 20-year-old college student with headache, fever, cough with scant sputum, and bilateral peribronchial pneumonia seen on chest radiography, all classic symptoms of atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The patient’s symptoms of wheezing, scattered crackles, and the absence of lobar consolidation are consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which often leads to interstitial pneumonia rather than the more classic lobar pneumonia seen with bacterial pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae. The fact that several individuals in the same dormitory are also affected points to an outbreak of a respiratory infection, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known for its propensity to cause outbreaks in close-contact settings, such as college dormitories. This organism also commonly causes non-productive cough, which fits with the patient's scant sputum. Additionally, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection often manifests with extrapulmonary symptoms, such as headache, which is present in this case. Incorrect Options: (A) Adenovirus Adenovirus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including pharyngitis and pneumonia, but it is less likely in this case due to the lack of significant upper respiratory symptoms like sore throat and nasal congestion, which are commonly seen with adenoviral infections. Furthermore, adenovirus typically causes lobar pneumonia, which does not fit the radiographic findings of bilateral peribronchial pneumonia with interstitial markings seen in this patient. (B) Chlamydia pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae is another organism that can cause atypical pneumonia, but it is less common as a cause of outbreaks in close-contact environments like college dormitories, where Mycoplasma pneumoniae is more prevalent. While Chlamydia pneumoniae can cause bilateral pneumonia and wheezing, it is not as strongly associated with the scant sputum, headache, and interstitial pneumonia findings seen in this case. (C) Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumophila typically causes severe pneumonia with symptoms like high fever, productive cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and it is usually associated with water sources such as air conditioning systems or humidifiers. This patient's history of living in a dormitory does not suggest exposure to Legionella pneumophila sources. Additionally, Legionella often causes lobar pneumonia, whereas the patient here has peribronchial pneumonia and increased interstitial markings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Gardnerella vaginalis The most likely cause of this patient’s vaginitis is Gardnerella vaginalis, which is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is characterized by: Gray-white, thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge Fishy odor (malodorous discharge), especially after sexual activity or KOH test (positive whiff test) Clue cells on microscopy Vaginal epithelial cells covered with adherent bacteria, giving a stippling appearance pH >4.5 (alkaline vaginal environment) Gardnerella vaginalis is a facultative anaerobic gram-variable rod that disrupts normal vaginal flora (Lactobacillus), leading to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and BV development. BV is not strictly a sexually transmitted infection, as it can occur even without recent sexual activity, unlike trichomoniasis. Incorrect Options: (A) Candida albicans – Incorrect. C. albicans causes vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which presents with: Thick, white, curd-like (cottage cheese) vaginal discharge Intense pruritus (itching) and erythema Normal vaginal pH (~4.0, acidic environment) Microscopy: Budding yeasts and pseudohyphae on KOH prep This patient’s thin, malodorous discharge and increased vaginal pH (>4.5) make C. albicans unlikely. (B) Trichomonas vaginalis – Incorrect. T. vaginalis is a sexually transmitted protozoan that causes trichomoniasis, which presents with: Profuse, frothy, greenish-yellow vaginal discharge Strawberry cervix (punctate hemorrhages on cervix) Vaginal inflammation with pruritus, burning, and pain Motile, pear-shaped, flagellated organisms seen on wet mount microscopy This patient had no recent sexual activity, and her discharge is gray-white and thin, not frothy, making T. vaginalis unlikely. (C) Escherichia coli – Incorrect. E. coli is an intestinal gram-negative rod that can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) rather than vaginitis. Symptoms of UTI include: Dysuria (painful urination), urgency, and frequency Hematuria (blood in urine), suprapubic pain Positive urine culture for E. coli This patient has no UTI symptoms, and E. coli is not a typical cause of vaginitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pasteurella multocida: This 32-year-old man presents with fever and a painful, inflamed wound after a cat bite, with gram-negative bacteria found on wound scraping. The most likely cause is Pasteurella multocida, a facultatively anaerobic, Gram-negative coccobacillus commonly found in the mouths of cats and dogs. It is a leading cause of soft tissue infections following animal bites or scratches. Pasteurella rapidly invades tissues, leading to pain, erythema, swelling, and sometimes abscess formation within 24 hours of injury. It can also cause lymphadenopathy, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Penicillin (or amoxicillin-clavulanate) is the treatment of choice. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Aeromonas species Aeromonas is a Gram-negative rod associated with wound infections from freshwater exposure, such as injuries occurring in lakes or rivers. It does not typically cause infections from cat bites, making it an unlikely cause in this case. Option B: Campylobacter jejuni Campylobacter jejuni is a curved, Gram-negative rod that primarily causes gastroenteritis, not wound infections. It is transmitted through contaminated food (especially undercooked poultry), not animal bites. It does not match the patient’s history or symptoms, ruling it out. Option D: Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative rod that causes infections in burn wounds, diabetic ulcers, and immunocompromised patients. It is commonly associated with moist environments (e.g., hospitals, contaminated water sources) rather than animal bites. While Pseudomonas can infect bite wounds, Pasteurella is the most common cause in cat bites, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ureaplasma urealyticum Explanation of the Correct Answer: The 34-year-old truck driver presenting to an STD clinic with suspected nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) but testing negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis suggests an alternative bacterial etiology. The most likely causative organism is Ureaplasma urealyticum. Ureaplasma urealyticum is a pleomorphic, cell wall-less bacterium that belongs to the Mycoplasmataceae family. It is a common cause of NGU and is sexually transmitted. Clinical presentation includes: Dysuria (painful urination) Urethral discharge (clear to mucopurulent) Urinary discomfort without fever It thrives in urea-rich environments, producing urease, which helps it persist in the urogenital tract. Diagnosis is often confirmed using PCR-based detection or culture on specialized media (A7 agar). Treatment typically involves azithromycin or doxycycline, similar to Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Mycoplasma hominis – Incorrect Mycoplasma hominis is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), postpartum fever, and bacterial vaginosis, but it is not a primary cause of NGU. It is commonly found as part of the normal genital flora and is usually implicated in upper genital tract infections rather than urethritis. (C) Mycoplasma mycoides – Incorrect Mycoplasma mycoides is not a human pathogen; it primarily causes contagious bovine pleuropneumonia in cattle. It has no association with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or NGU. (D) Mycoplasma pneumoniae – Incorrect Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of atypical (\"walking\") pneumonia and respiratory tract infections, not genitourinary infections. It does not colonize the urogenital tract, making it an unlikely cause of NGU.",
