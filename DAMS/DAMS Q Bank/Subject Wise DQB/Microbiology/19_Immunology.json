      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypervariable region. The antigen-binding site in an immunoglobulin is primarily formed by the hypervariable regions of both the heavy and light chains of the antibody. These regions, also known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific antigens. There are three hypervariable regions (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) in each chain, which together form a unique three-dimensional structure that determines the antibody’s specificity. The high variability in amino acid sequences within these regions allows antibodies to recognize a vast range of antigens, making them crucial for immune defense. Incorrect Options: (A) Variable region – Incorrect: The variable region of an immunoglobulin consists of both the framework regions and hypervariable regions. While the variable region is important in antigen recognition, only the hypervariable regions within it directly interact with the antigen. The framework regions provide structural support but do not significantly contribute to antigen binding. (C) Constant region – Incorrect: The constant region of an immunoglobulin does not participate in antigen binding. Instead, it plays a role in determining the antibody’s class (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD) and mediates immune effector functions like complement activation and interaction with immune cells. (D) Idiotope – Incorrect: An idiotope refers to the unique antigenic determinant present in the variable region of an antibody, which can be recognized by another antibody in an anti-idiotypic immune response. While it is related to antigen recognition, the idiotope is not the actual binding site but rather an immunological feature of the variable region itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Capsulated bacteria. After splenectomy, the spleen's role in filtering the blood and supporting immune defense against certain pathogens is lost. This makes individuals more vulnerable to infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. These bacteria have a protective capsule that helps them evade the immune system, and without a functional spleen, the body has a reduced ability to clear them, leading to a higher risk of severe infections. Incorrect Options: (B) Uncapsulated bacteria – Incorrect: Uncapsulated bacteria are typically less able to evade the immune system compared to capsulated bacteria, as they lack the protective mechanism that capsules provide. The immune system, particularly phagocytes in the absence of the spleen, can usually target and clear unencapsulated bacteria more effectively. Thus, unencapsulated bacteria are not the most common pathogens following splenectomy. (C) Gram-positive sepsis – Incorrect: Although Gram-positive bacteria can cause infections, sepsis in this context is more commonly associated with capsulated bacteria rather than gram-positive bacteria in general. The specific risk after splenectomy involves encapsulated pathogens, which could include both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but the answer does not specifically target the type of bacteria responsible. (D) Gram-negative bacteria – Incorrect: While gram-negative bacteria can cause infections, the risk following splenectomy is more heavily associated with capsulated pathogens, which can be either gram-positive or gram-negative. The question specifically focuses on the type of bacteria that is most common after splenectomy, and capsulated bacteria include both groups, but the emphasis is on the capsule's role in immune evasion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgG. IgG is the only class of antibody that can cross the placenta from the mother to the fetus, providing passive immunity to the baby. This is crucial for the protection of the fetus during pregnancy, especially in the early months when the baby's immune system is still developing. The ability of IgG to cross the placenta is facilitated by specific receptors on the placenta, allowing the transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus, which helps in defending against infections. Incorrect Options: (A) IgA – Incorrect: IgA is primarily found in mucosal areas such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and in secretions like breast milk, saliva, and tears. While IgA plays an important role in mucosal immunity, it does not cross the placenta to protect the fetus. (C) IgD – Incorrect: IgD is found mainly on the surface of immature B cells and plays a role in initiating immune responses, but it is not involved in placental transfer and does not offer protection to the fetus. (D) IgM – Incorrect: IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an infection, but it is a large pentameric structure that cannot cross the placenta due to its size. While it is effective in immune responses, it does not provide passive immunity to the fetus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) C5a. C5a is a potent chemoattractant that plays a crucial role in the immune response by attracting immune cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, to the site of infection or inflammation. It is generated during complement activation and promotes chemotaxis, helping to recruit immune cells to areas where they are needed to fight infection. Incorrect Options: (A) C3a – Incorrect: Although C3a is also a chemoattractant, it is not as potent as C5a. C3a contributes to inflammation and can attract immune cells, but its role in chemotaxis is less pronounced than C5a's. (B) C4a – Incorrect: C4a is a fragment produced during the activation of the C4 component of the complement system. While it has some effects in inflammation, it is a much weaker chemoattractant compared to C5a. (D) C3b – Incorrect: C3b is not a chemoattractant. It is an important component for opsonization, which helps in the recognition and phagocytosis of pathogens by immune cells. It does not play a role in attracting cells to the site of infection.",

Plasma contains α- (alpha), β- (beta), and γ- (gamma) globulins.\" • Note that CRP is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation and is elevated in response to the presence of many organisms, not just S. pneumoniae. • Clinically, CRP in human serum is measured in the laboratory by its reaction(agglutination or precipitation) with the carbohydrate of S. pneumoniae. The medical importance of CRP is that an elevated CRP appears to be a better predictor of heart attack risk than an elevated cholesterol level.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) B cells have CD3 receptors. CD3 receptors are specific to T cells, not B cells. T cells express CD3 on their surface as a marker, which is essential for T cell receptor signaling. B cells, on the other hand, do not have CD3 receptors but express other surface markers, such as CD19 or CD20, and surface immunoglobulins. Incorrect Options: (A) T cells from Sheep-RBC rosette – Incorrect: This refers to the ability of T cells to form a rosette with sheep red blood cells (RBCs), which is a known test used for identifying T lymphocytes. T cells have a receptor that binds to the sheep RBCs, making this a characteristic used for differentiation. (B) B cells form EAC rosette – Incorrect: B cells are able to form an EAC (Erythrocyte-Antibody-Complement) rosette, a phenomenon where B cells bind to the sheep RBCs coated with antibody and complement. This is a well-known feature used for differentiating B cells from T cells. (D) B cells have surface immunoglobulins – Incorrect: Surface immunoglobulins (Ig) are a defining characteristic of B cells. B cells express IgM or IgD as their surface receptors, which are crucial for recognizing specific antigens and initiating an immune response. This is a key marker used to differentiate B cells from T cells.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Eosinophil. Major basic protein (MBP) is a protein found predominantly in the granules of eosinophils. It plays a role in the inflammatory response, particularly in allergic reactions and parasitic infections, where it is released during degranulation to help combat parasites and contribute to tissue damage. MBP is toxic to both parasites and host tissues, and its presence is a hallmark of eosinophil activity. Incorrect Options: (A) Lymphocyte – Incorrect: Lymphocytes, which include T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, do not produce major basic protein. Their primary functions are related to adaptive immunity, with T cells playing a role in cellular immunity and B cells in antibody production, but they are not involved in the release of MBP. (B) Basophil – Incorrect: Basophils do not produce major basic protein. Instead, they release substances like histamine and heparin during allergic responses. While both basophils and eosinophils are involved in immune responses, MBP is specific to eosinophils. (C) Neutrophil – Incorrect: Neutrophils are important in the innate immune response and are involved in phagocytosis and killing of bacteria, but they do not produce major basic protein. Neutrophils contain other types of granules, such as myeloperoxidase, that are involved in immune defense, but they do not release MBP.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schick test. The Schick test is a type of neutralization test used to assess immunity to diphtheria. In this test, a small amount of diphtheria toxin is injected into the skin, and the reaction is observed. If the individual is immune, no reaction (redness or swelling) occurs because the antibodies neutralize the toxin. If the person is not immune, a localized reaction occurs due to the active toxin, indicating a lack of protective antibodies. Incorrect Options: (A) Rose-Waaler – Incorrect: The Rose-Waaler test is not a neutralization test. It is a diagnostic test used to detect rheumatoid factor in the blood, which is associated with rheumatoid arthritis. It is based on the agglutination of sheep red blood cells, not neutralization of a pathogen or toxin. (B) Paul Bunnell test – Incorrect: The Paul Bunnell test is used for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (caused by the Epstein-Barr virus). It is a heterophile antibody test and not a neutralization test. It detects the presence of heterophile antibodies that react with sheep or horse red blood cells. (C) Widal test – Incorrect: The Widal test is used to diagnose typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi. It detects antibodies against S. typhi antigens (O and H antigens) in the patient's serum.

Incorrect Options: (A) Bovine serum – Incorrect: Bovine serum is a common component in cell culture media, providing essential nutrients and growth factors for various cell types. However, it does not directly stimulate T cell multiplication. It supports general cell growth but does not specifically activate or promote T cell proliferation. (C) Macrolin – Incorrect: Macrolin is not a substance known for stimulating T cell multiplication. It is not widely recognized or used in immunology for this purpose, making it unrelated to the process of T cell activation or division.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. The complement system is a crucial part of the immune response that helps defend the host against infections. It achieves this by performing several key functions: Mediating inflammation: Complement components like C3a and C5a promote inflammation by triggering the release of histamine and other mediators. Attracting phagocytic cells: Complement fragments, such as C3a and C5a, act as chemoattractants, guiding phagocytic cells (like neutrophils and macrophages) to the site of infection. Activating phagocytic cells: C3b acts as an opsonin, binding to pathogens and facilitating their recognition and ingestion by phagocytes. Additionally, the complement system can directly enhance the activity of phagocytes. Incorrect Options: (A) Mediating inflammation – Incorrect (but part of the correct answer): While the complement system does mediate inflammation (through components like C3a and C5a), this answer is incomplete because it doesn't capture the full range of complement system functions, such as attracting and activating phagocytic cells. (B) Attracting phagocytic cells – Incorrect (but part of the correct answer): The complement system does attract phagocytic cells by producing C3a and C5a, but this is only one function of the system. The full range of activities is better captured by the \"all of the above\" answer. (C) Activating phagocytic cells – Incorrect (but part of the correct answer): Although the complement system activates phagocytic cells, this is just one part of the overall immune defense provided by complement. The system also plays roles in inflammation and attracting immune cells, making \"all of the above\" the most comprehensive choice.",

Incorrect Options: (A) HLA-A – Incorrect: HLA-A is a class I molecule, and while it is important in presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells, it has not been strongly linked with the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Class II molecules like HLA-DR play a more direct role in the pathogenesis of RA. (B) HLA-B – Incorrect: HLA-B is also a class I molecule and is involved in the presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells. While certain HLA-B alleles are associated with other autoimmune diseases, HLA-B is not as strongly linked to rheumatoid arthritis as HLA-DR. (D) HLA-DP – Incorrect: HLA-DP is another class II molecule, but it has not been as strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis as HLA-DR. While it may play a role in immune responses, it is not the primary HLA type linked to RA. (E) HLA-DQ – Incorrect: Similar to HLA-DP, HLA-DQ is also a class II molecule involved in antigen presentation, but it is not as closely linked to the development of rheumatoid arthritis as HLA-DR.

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) C2, C4, and C3 decreased. In immunoinflammatory conditions, especially in classical complement pathway activation, C2 and C4 are often consumed because they are part of the early stages of the classical complement pathway. C3 is also involved in the downstream activation, and its levels may decrease as it is used up in the cascade of events. The consumption of these components is indicative of classical pathway activation, which occurs in response to immune complex formation in conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Incorrect Options: (B) C2 and C4 normal, C3 is decreased – Incorrect: This scenario is not typical in classical complement pathway activation. If C3 is decreased, it usually indicates activation of the complement pathway, which would also lead to a reduction in C2 and C4, as they are consumed early in the cascade. Therefore, C2 and C4 being normal while C3 is decreased would be an unusual pattern in classical pathway activation. (C) C3 normal and C2, C4 decreased – Incorrect: This option suggests C3 remains unaffected while C2 and C4 are decreased. While C2 and C4 are early components of the classical pathway, the normal levels of C3 in this scenario would be atypical in a condition where classical pathway activation occurs. If the classical pathway is activated, C3 typically becomes consumed as well. (D) C2, C4, C3 all are elevated – Incorrect: If C2, C4, and C3 are all elevated, it would indicate complement activation is not happening, or there is an acute-phase response where the liver produces more complement components. This is not characteristic of classical complement pathway activation, where the components are typically consumed rather than elevated. Elevated levels of these proteins are more indicative of an inflammatory state without direct complement activation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor. Hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE), also known as hereditary angioedema, is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a key regulatory protein in the complement system. This deficiency results in the excessive activation of the complement pathway, leading to the overproduction of bradykinin and anaphylatoxins (e.g., C3a and C5a). These molecules increase capillary permeability, causing fluid leakage and angioedema (swelling), particularly in tissues like the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and upper airways. Incorrect Options: (B) Deficiency of NADPH oxidase – Incorrect: A deficiency of NADPH oxidase leads to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a condition characterized by impaired phagocyte function and recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, not hereditary angioneurotic edema. It does not result in the overproduction of anaphylatoxins or cause increased capillary permeability. (C) Deficiency of MPO – Incorrect: A deficiency in myeloperoxidase (MPO) is associated with MPO deficiency, which leads to impaired neutrophil function and increased susceptibility to infections, particularly fungal infections. It does not cause the characteristic swelling and edema seen in hereditary angioneurotic edema, which is primarily due to dysregulation of the complement system. (D) Deficiency of properdin – Incorrect: Properdin is a positive regulator of the alternative complement pathway. A deficiency of properdin can lead to increased susceptibility to infections due to impaired immune responses but does not cause the specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic edema, such as the edema caused by capillary leakage from the overactive complement system.",

Incorrect Options: (B) IgG2 – Incorrect: IgG2 is the second most abundant IgG subclass, constituting about 20-30% of the total IgG in human serum. It is particularly important in the defense against bacterial polysaccharide antigens, but it is not as abundant as IgG1. (C) IgG3 – Incorrect: IgG3 is less abundant in serum, comprising about 5-10% of total IgG.

(D) IgG4 – Incorrect: IgG4 is the least abundant subclass, constituting about 1-4% of total IgG in human serum.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Covalent bond. In antigen-antibody reactions, the binding between the antigen and antibody is primarily due to non-covalent interactions. These interactions include van der Waals forces, electrostatic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. Covalent bonds, however, are not typically involved in antigen-antibody interactions because they are much stronger and more stable, whereas the reversible, weaker interactions allow for more dynamic antigen-antibody binding. Incorrect Options: (A) Van der Waals forces – Incorrect: Van der Waals forces are weak, non-covalent interactions that play a significant role in antigen-antibody binding. These forces arise from transient dipoles that occur in molecules and contribute to the overall affinity of the antigen-antibody interaction. (B) Electrostatic bond – Incorrect: Electrostatic bonds (also known as ionic bonds) are crucial in antigen-antibody reactions. These bonds occur between oppositely charged regions on the antigen and antibody, helping to stabilize the interaction. (C) Hydrogen bond – Incorrect: Hydrogen bonds are another important form of non-covalent interaction in antigen-antibody reactions. These bonds occur between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (such as oxygen or nitrogen) and another electronegative atom.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Antibody excess. The prozone phenomenon occurs when there is an excess of antibody in the testing system, leading to a false negative result in an antigen-antibody reaction, typically in serological tests. In this situation, the antibody concentration is so high that it prevents optimal antigen-antibody binding and formation of visible complexes. This prevents the formation of the lattice structure required for a positive result, causing the reaction to appear negative despite the presence of antigen. Incorrect Options: (A) Antigen excess – Incorrect: The prozone phenomenon is not caused by antigen excess; rather, it occurs due to antibody excess. When there is an excess of antigen, the result is more likely to be a postzone phenomenon, where an excess of antigen leads to the formation of large antigen-antibody complexes that are not easily detected, often resulting in a false negative. (C) False +ve reaction – Incorrect: The prozone phenomenon does not lead to a false positive result. Instead, it leads to a false negative result due to the inhibition of antigen-antibody complex formation caused by an excess of antibody. False positives in serological reactions are typically caused by factors such as non-specific binding or contamination. (D) False -ve reaction – Incorrect, but related: While prozone phenomenon does indeed lead to a false negative result due to antibody excess, this option is not specific enough in describing the cause (i.e., antibody excess) compared to option (B), which correctly highlights the underlying reason for the phenomenon.",

It involves the inhibition of the agglutination of red blood cells by the presence of antibodies, but it does not require any form of labeling for detection, unlike the other methods listed. Incorrect Options: (A) ELISA – Incorrect: ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) utilizes labeled antibodies, typically enzyme-conjugated antibodies, to detect the presence of antigens or antibodies in a sample. The enzyme label produces a color change when substrate is added, indicating the presence of the target molecule. (C) Radioimmunoassay – Incorrect: Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is a highly sensitive technique that uses radioactive isotopes as labels on antibodies or antigens to detect and quantify substances in a sample. The radioactivity emitted by the labeled molecules is measured to determine the concentration of the target analyte.

This test helps measure the concentration of CRP in the blood as an indicator of inflammatory conditions. Incorrect Options: (A) An antibody as a result of pneumococcal infection – Incorrect: CRP is not an antibody; it is an acute-phase protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation or infection. While CRP levels can rise during infections, including pneumococcal infections, it is not an antibody produced in response to the pathogen. Antibodies are produced by B cells, whereas CRP is part of the innate immune response. (B) Derived from pneumococci – Incorrect: CRP is not derived from pneumococci or any specific bacteria. It is a human protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation, and its levels can increase in various infections, including those caused by pneumococci, but it is not specifically derived from the bacteria. (D) Increased in pneumococcal infection – Incorrect: While CRP can increase in response to pneumococcal infection, this option does not directly explain what CRP is or how it is detected. The increase in CRP levels is a general response to inflammation, and not unique to pneumococcal infections alone.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Formed by epithelial cell of lining mucosa. The secretory component of the IgA molecule is produced by epithelial cells of the mucosal lining. This component helps in the transport of IgA across epithelial cells and is involved in protecting mucosal surfaces (like those in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts). The secretory component attaches to the IgA antibody, allowing it to be secreted onto mucosal surfaces in its active form, where it provides immunity against pathogens. Incorrect Options: (B) Formed by plasma cell – Incorrect: While plasma cells are responsible for the production of the IgA antibody, they do not produce the secretory component. The plasma cells secrete the antibody itself, but the secretory component is produced by epithelial cells. (C) Formed by epithelial cell and plasma cell – Incorrect: This is not entirely accurate. The secretory component is exclusively produced by epithelial cells that line the mucosal surfaces, not by plasma cells. Plasma cells produce the IgA antibody, but they do not contribute to the formation of the secretory component. (D) Secreted by bone marrow – Incorrect: The bone marrow is responsible for the production and maturation of immune cells, including plasma cells, but it does not secrete the secretory component of IgA. The secretory component is produced and secreted by epithelial cells, not by cells in the bone marrow.Formed by epithelial cell of lining mucosa. The secretory component of the IgA molecule is produced by epithelial cells of the mucosal lining. This component helps in the transport of IgA across epithelial cells and is involved in protecting mucosal surfaces (like those in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts). The secretory component attaches to the IgA antibody, allowing it to be secreted onto mucosal surfaces in its active form, where it provides immunity against pathogens. Incorrect Options: (B) Formed by plasma cell – Incorrect: While plasma cells are responsible for the production of the IgA antibody, they do not produce the secretory component. The plasma cells secrete the antibody itself, but the secretory component is produced by epithelial cells. (C) Formed by epithelial cell and plasma cell – Incorrect: This is not entirely accurate. The secretory component is exclusively produced by epithelial cells that line the mucosal surfaces, not by plasma cells. Plasma cells produce the IgA antibody, but they do not contribute to the formation of the secretory component. (D) Secreted by bone marrow – Incorrect: The bone marrow is responsible for the production and maturation of immune cells, including plasma cells, but it does not secrete the secretory component of IgA. The secretory component is produced and secreted by epithelial cells, not by cells in the bone marrow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) IgG. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta to provide passive immunity to the fetus. This occurs through specific receptors in the placenta that transport IgG from the maternal circulation to the fetal circulation, offering the newborn protection against infections during the early months of life before their immune system matures. Incorrect Options: (A) IgA – Incorrect: IgA does not cross the placenta effectively. It is primarily found in mucosal secretions, such as in saliva, tears, and breast milk, where it provides localized protection against pathogens at mucosal surfaces. While IgA is present in breast milk and plays a vital role in neonatal immunity, it does not cross the placenta. (B) IgM – Incorrect: IgM is the first antibody produced during an immune response and is primarily found in the bloodstream. It does not cross the placenta. Its size and structure prevent it from passing through the placental barrier to the fetus. (D) IgD – Incorrect: IgD is present in very small amounts in the bloodstream and on the surface of immature B cells.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All. Clonal selection is a process that occurs during the immune response where specific B or T cells are selected based on their ability to recognize a particular antigen. This process involves multiple features that are captured by the options provided. Specific: Clonal selection is specific because it involves the activation and proliferation of only those B or T cells that recognize a particular antigen, ensuring that the immune response is directed at the correct pathogen. Secondary response is rapid: The secondary immune response is rapid and more effective due to the formation of memory cells during the first exposure to the antigen. When the same antigen is encountered again, these memory cells quickly recognize it and produce a stronger and faster immune response. Generation of diversity of antibody specificity: Clonal selection leads to the generation of a diverse antibody repertoire. During this process, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, allowing for the production of antibodies with high specificity for a wide range of antigens.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Equivalence of antibody and antigen. Antigen-antibody precipitation occurs most effectively when there is an optimal ratio of antibody to antigen, known as the equivalence zone. At this point, there are enough antigen-binding sites on the antibody to form stable immune complexes with the antigens, resulting in visible precipitation. In this zone, the antigen and antibody are present in equal or near-equal amounts, maximizing the formation of these complexes. Incorrect Options: (A) Excess of antibody – Incorrect: When there is an excess of antibody, there are fewer antigens available for each antibody to bind to, leading to small immune complexes that do not precipitate well. In this case, the antibody is in excess and can no longer form the large, visible precipitate that occurs at the equivalence point. (B) Excess of antigen – Incorrect: Similarly, when there is an excess of antigen, there are not enough antibodies to bind to all the available antigen molecules. This results in small antigen-antibody complexes, and again, precipitation does not occur as efficiently. The optimal precipitation is seen when the amounts of both are roughly equal. (D) Antigen - Hapten interaction – Incorrect: An antigen-hapten interaction refers to a situation where a hapten (a small molecule that cannot elicit an immune response by itself) binds to a carrier protein, forming a complex that can trigger an immune response. However, this is not related to the optimal antigen-antibody precipitation, which is a result of the interactions between a full antigen and antibody.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Distal part of alpha chain. In the MHC class I complex, the antigen-presenting component is formed by the distal part of the alpha chain. This part of the alpha chain, along with the beta-2 microglobulin, forms the peptide-binding groove where antigens (usually fragments of proteins) are presented to CD8+ T cells. The groove holds the peptide in place, allowing the immune system to recognize and respond to pathogens or abnormal cells. Incorrect Options: (A) Between alpha and beta-2 microglobulin – Incorrect: This is not the correct part of the MHC I complex involved in antigen presentation. While the beta-2 microglobulin stabilizes the MHC I structure, it does not participate directly in forming the antigen-binding groove. The antigen-binding part is specifically in the distal part of the alpha chain. (C) Proximal part of alpha chain – Incorrect: The proximal part of the alpha chain primarily serves to anchor the MHC I complex to the cell membrane and does not form part of the antigen-presenting region. The antigen-binding groove is located at the distal part of the alpha chain, not the proximal portion.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgM. When a foreign antigen, such as ova albumin, is introduced into a rabbit (or any other animal), the initial antibody response is primarily IgM. This is because IgM is the first antibody produced during a primary immune response. It is secreted in large amounts during the initial exposure to the antigen and is the first line of defense. IgM is effective in neutralizing pathogens and forming complexes that activate the complement system, but it is usually replaced by IgG after a subsequent response (if exposure continues). Incorrect Options: (A) IgG – Incorrect: While IgG is the predominant antibody produced in later stages of the immune response, particularly in secondary responses, it is not produced initially upon the first exposure to an antigen. IgM is the first antibody produced, and IgG typically appears after IgM during the process of affinity maturation and class switching. (C) IgE – Incorrect: IgE is typically involved in allergic reactions and responses to parasitic infections. While it can be produced in response to certain allergens, it is not the first antibody produced in response to ova albumin, especially if the response is not allergic. Therefore, it would not be the initial antibody produced in this scenario. (D) IgD – Incorrect: IgD is found primarily on the surface of B cells and plays a role in the activation of B cells, but it is not the main antibody involved in the primary immune response to an antigen like ova albumin. Its role in antigen-specific immunity is minimal compared to IgM and IgG.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Granulomatous reaction. Granulomatous reactions are a classic example of Type IV hypersensitivity, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). This type of hypersensitivity is mediated by T cells (specifically, CD4+ T cells) and results in the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of macrophages and other immune cells. These reactions occur in response to chronic antigen exposure, such as in tuberculosis, leprosy, or certain autoimmune conditions. The delayed onset of these reactions, usually occurring 48-72 hours after exposure, is a hallmark of Type IV hypersensitivity. Incorrect Options: (B) Schwartzman reaction – Incorrect: The Schwartzman reaction is a form of Type III hypersensitivity, where immune complexes form and cause tissue damage, leading to vasculitis and tissue necrosis. This reaction is characterized by immune complex-mediated inflammation, not T cell-mediated responses. It is distinct from Type IV hypersensitivity. (C) Arthus reaction – Incorrect: The Arthus reaction is an example of Type III hypersensitivity, which involves the formation of immune complexes between antigen and antibodies. When these immune complexes deposit in tissues, they activate the complement system and cause inflammation and tissue damage. This is different from the T cell-mediated response seen in Type IV hypersensitivity. (D) Serum sickness – Incorrect: Serum sickness is also an example of Type III hypersensitivity. It occurs when antibodies form immune complexes with foreign antigens (typically from antiserum injections), leading to systemic inflammation and damage. This is distinct from Type IV hypersensitivity, which involves T cell-mediated immune responses rather than immune complexes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Schick test. The Schick test is based on the principle of neutralization and is used to test for diphtheria immunity. In this test, a small amount of diphtheria toxin is injected into the skin. If the individual has immunity (i.e., has been previously vaccinated or had the disease), the toxin will be neutralized by antibodies, and no reaction will occur. However, if the person is not immune, the toxin will cause a local reaction (redness and swelling). This test directly involves neutralization by antibodies. Incorrect Options: (A) Casoni test – Incorrect: The Casoni test is used to diagnose echinococcosis (hydatid disease). It involves injecting hydatid cyst fluid under the skin and observing for a reaction. It is a skin test for detecting antibodies, but it is not a neutralization reaction. The reaction here is more of an immunological response, not antibody-mediated neutralization. (B) Lepromin test – Incorrect: The Lepromin test is used to determine the type of leprosy and assess a person's immune response to Mycobacterium leprae. It involves injecting inactivated M. leprae into the skin and observing the reaction, which reflects the individual's immune status. However, this test is not based on neutralization; instead, it is based on delayed-type hypersensitivity (Type IV hypersensitivity) and the T cell-mediated immune response. (C) Tuberculin test – Incorrect: The Tuberculin test (also known as the Mantoux test) is used to determine whether a person has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It involves injecting purified protein derivative (PPD) from the tuberculosis bacterium into the skin. This is a delayed-type hypersensitivity (Type IV) reaction and is not a neutralization test. It evaluates the cellular immune response rather than antibody-mediated neutralization.",

The Paul Bunnell test is used to detect heterophile antibodies and is typically associated with infectious mononucleosis (caused by Epstein-Barr virus, EBV).

Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE antibodies and involves allergic reactions like anaphylaxis, hay fever, or asthma. Incorrect Options: (B) Lepromin test – Incorrect: The Lepromin test is an example of Type IV hypersensitivity, which is a cell-mediated immune response. It is used to assess the immune status in individuals infected with Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy. This test causes a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which is a hallmark of Type IV hypersensitivity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is a process that occurs in activated B cells after antigen exposure, primarily within germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, leading to the generation of antibodies with varying affinities for the antigen. Over time, B cells producing high-affinity antibodies are selected for survival through affinity maturation. This explains why the child in the scenario developed increased antibody affinity to diphtheria antigens following booster vaccination. The booster dose stimulates memory B cells, allowing further somatic hypermutation and selection of high-affinity antibodies, which enhances the immune response to the diphtheria antigen. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Isotype switching – Incorrect Isotype (class) switching is a process where B cells change the constant region of their antibody from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE without altering the antigen specificity. This process is mediated by cytokines and the enzyme AID (Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase). While class switching improves the functional capabilities of the antibody, it does not increase antigen-binding affinity, making it unrelated to the phenomenon described in the question. B. Combinatorial diversity – Incorrect Combinatorial diversity refers to the rearrangement of V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments during B cell development in the bone marrow. This process generates a vast repertoire of antigen receptors even before antigen exposure. However, it occurs before a mature B cell encounters an antigen, whereas affinity maturation (somatic hypermutation) occurs after antigen exposure. Thus, it does not explain the increased antibody affinity seen in the child after the booster dose. C. Junctional diversity – Incorrect Junctional diversity arises during V(D)J recombination due to the random addition or deletion of nucleotides at gene segment junctions. This process significantly contributes to antigen receptor diversity but occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, before antigen exposure. It does not affect the affinity of antibodies after a booster vaccination, making it an incorrect answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) They give help to B cells to produce immunoglobulins. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is closely associated with a Th2-dominant immune response. In this patient, stimulation of PBMCs with concanavalin A (ConA) led to the production of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, which are hallmark cytokines of T-helper 2 (Th2) cells. Th2 cells play a crucial role in humoral immunity by promoting B cell differentiation and antibody production, particularly IgE, which is heavily involved in allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis. IL-4 drives B cell class switching to IgE, a key factor in allergic reactions. IL-6 supports B cell proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. IL-10 acts as an immunomodulatory cytokine, enhancing B cell survival and function while suppressing excessive inflammation. The presence of these cytokines indicates that the patient's immune system is orchestrating a Th2-driven response, which helps B cells produce immunoglobulins, especially IgE, leading to allergic manifestations like eczema. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. They primarily secrete GCSF – Incorrect Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is primarily involved in the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils in response to infection or inflammation. It is not a signature cytokine of T-helper cells, particularly in the context of atopic dermatitis. The patient’s immune response is Th2-driven, which is characterized by IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, rather than G-CSF secretion. B. They suppress cytotoxic T-cell function – Incorrect While IL-10 has immunosuppressive properties and can dampen excessive immune responses, Th2 cells do not directly function to suppress cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells). Instead, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for suppressing cytotoxic T-cell function by secreting IL-10 and TGF-β. The primary role of Th2 cells in this scenario is enhancing B cell activity, not suppressing cytotoxic T cells. D. They primarily secrete IL-2 and IFN-γ – Incorrect IL-2 and IFN-γ are characteristic cytokines of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th1 cells activate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to combat viral and bacterial infections, but they are not the dominant players in atopic dermatitis. Since the patient’s immune response is Th2-skewed, with IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production, this answer is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD). Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme, which is essential for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in phagocytes. This defect impairs the ability of neutrophils and macrophages to produce the oxidative burst needed to kill intracellular and extracellular pathogens. As a result, patients with CGD are highly susceptible to infections by catalase-positive organisms, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Nocardia, and Serratia marcescens. In this case, the Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to assess the oxidative burst function of neutrophils. A defective NADPH oxidase results in an inability to reduce NBT, leading to a negative (colorless) test, confirming CGD. The presence of cotton ball densities in both lungs on the chest X-ray suggests pulmonary involvement, commonly seen in fungal infections like Aspergillus, which is a hallmark of CGD. Despite the infection, the white blood cell (WBC) count is normal, which aligns with CGD, as the problem is in phagocyte function rather than WBC production. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) – Incorrect Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) is caused by defects in integrins (CD18) or selectins, leading to impaired leukocyte migration from the bloodstream to infection sites. It typically presents with delayed umbilical cord separation, recurrent bacterial infections, severe neutrophilia, and poor wound healing. However, LAD does not affect the NBT test or NADPH oxidase activity, and fungal infections like Aspergillus are not a hallmark of the disease. C. Lymphocyte Adhesion Deficiency – Incorrect \"Lymphocyte Adhesion Deficiency\" is not a well-defined immunodeficiency. If the intent was to refer to a lymphocyte trafficking disorder, the more relevant condition would be a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) or Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. However, CGD is a phagocyte defect, not a lymphocyte disorder, and the presence of normal WBC counts and a defective NBT test makes lymphocyte adhesion deficiency an unlikely diagnosis. D. Factor H Syndrome – Incorrect Factor H syndrome refers to atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), which results from uncontrolled complement activation due to Factor H deficiency or dysfunction. It typically presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and renal failure, none of which are seen in this patient. Furthermore, Factor H does not play a role in NADPH oxidase activity or oxidative burst function, making this an incorrect answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hypersensitivity Type III. Type III hypersensitivity reactions occur when immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) form in circulation and deposit in various tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. In this case, the patient was incorrectly given ampicillin intravenously, which likely led to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes that deposited in small blood vessels, triggering an inflammatory response mediated by complement activation and neutrophils. The classic symptoms of fever, skin rashes, petechial hemorrhaging, edema, glandular enlargement, and joint pain within 24 hours are consistent with serum sickness, a prototypical Type III hypersensitivity reaction. Serum sickness occurs when circulating immune complexes deposit in small blood vessels, synovium (joints), and kidneys, leading to vasculitis, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Hypersensitivity Type I – Incorrect Type I hypersensitivity is IgE-mediated and involves an immediate allergic reaction to allergens such as pollen, food, or insect venom. Symptoms include urticaria (hives), anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, and hypotension. However, Type I reactions occur within minutes to hours after antigen exposure and do not involve immune complex deposition or systemic inflammation like serum sickness. Since the patient developed symptoms after 24 hours, Type I hypersensitivity is unlikely. B. Hypersensitivity Type II – Incorrect Type II hypersensitivity is antibody-mediated (IgG or IgM) and directed against cell surface antigens, leading to cytotoxicity via complement activation or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Examples include hemolytic anemia, Goodpasture syndrome, and Myasthenia Gravis. The patient’s presentation does not involve direct cell destruction or hemolysis, ruling out Type II hypersensitivity. D. Hypersensitivity Type IV – Incorrect Type IV hypersensitivity is T-cell mediated and delayed (24-72 hours after exposure). It involves cytokine release, macrophage activation, and tissue destruction, rather than immune complex deposition. Classic examples include contact dermatitis (poison ivy), tuberculin skin test (PPD), and graft-versus-host disease. While Type IV reactions are delayed like the patient’s symptoms, they do not typically present with immune complex-mediated vasculitis, joint pain, or glomerulonephritis, making this an incorrect answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Complement receptors. Complement receptors (CRs) are involved in the innate immune system, but they do not directly recognize conserved molecular patterns in microbial species. Instead, they function primarily by recognizing complement-coated pathogens and facilitating phagocytosis and immune complex clearance. For example, CR1, CR3, and CR4 bind complement components such as C3b and iC3b, helping immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils clear opsonized pathogens. While complement activation is crucial for innate immunity, complement receptors themselves do not function as primary pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect conserved microbial structures. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) – Incorrect Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are highly conserved across microbial species. Different TLRs recognize specific microbial components: TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria. TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 detect viral RNA and DNA. Since TLRs play a direct role in pathogen recognition and immune activation, they are correctly classified as innate immune receptors. B. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) – Incorrect Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immune receptor that recognizes mannose and fucose residues on microbial surfaces. It plays a key role in the lectin pathway of complement activation, which helps opsonize pathogens and facilitate their clearance by phagocytes. Since MBL directly binds to conserved microbial structures, it is a pattern recognition receptor and is not the correct answer. C. LPS-binding protein (LBP) – Incorrect LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein that binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by transferring LPS to TLR4 and CD14, triggering an immune response. Since LBP specifically binds a conserved microbial molecule (LPS) and enhances immune activation, it qualifies as an innate immune receptor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) High levels of antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA antibodies). The patient presents with malar rash (butterfly rash), joint pain, fatigue, photosensitivity, and proteinuria, which are classic signs of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nuclear components, leading to immune complex formation, complement activation, and tissue damage. A hallmark serologic finding in SLE is the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), with anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies being highly specific for the disease. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis, which can explain the proteinuria seen in the patient’s urinalysis. These antibodies contribute to immune complex deposition in the kidneys, leading to glomerulonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Decreased number of helper (CD4+) T cells – Incorrect While CD4+ T cells play a role in autoimmune diseases, including SLE, their absolute number is not typically reduced. Instead, SLE is characterized by dysregulated CD4+ T cell activity, which leads to excessive B cell activation and autoantibody production. Unlike conditions such as HIV/AIDS, which cause direct CD4+ T cell depletion, SLE does not primarily manifest with a decreased CD4+ T cell count. B. Low level of C1 inhibitor – Incorrect Low levels of C1 inhibitor are characteristic of hereditary angioedema (HAE), not SLE. C1 inhibitor deficiency results in uncontrolled complement activation, leading to recurrent episodes of angioedema without urticaria. SLE, on the other hand, is associated with low complement levels (C3 and C4) due to complement consumption, but not due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. D. Increased number of cytotoxic T cells – Incorrect Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) are primarily involved in viral infections and tumor immunity, rather than antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases like SLE. While CD8+ T cells may play a role in immune dysregulation, SLE is mainly driven by autoantibodies and immune complex deposition, rather than an increase in cytotoxic T cells.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) IgG. Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), also known as erythroblastosis fetalis, occurs due to maternal IgG antibodies targeting fetal red blood cells (RBCs). In this case, the Rh-negative mother was not treated with anti-Rh (RhoGAM) antibodies after delivering her first Rh-positive baby. During the first pregnancy, fetal Rh-positive RBCs may have entered the maternal circulation, leading to the development of IgG anti-Rh antibodies in the mother. During the next pregnancy, these maternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta and attack the fetal Rh-positive RBCs, causing hemolysis, anemia, jaundice, and hydrops fetalis in the fetus. IgG is the only immunoglobulin class that can cross the placenta, making it the key mediator of Rh incompatibility-related hemolysis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. IgM – Incorrect IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta due to their large pentameric structure. In primary immune responses, IgM is the first antibody produced against Rh antigens, but it does not mediate HDN because it cannot reach the fetal circulation. The severe hemolysis in erythroblastosis fetalis occurs in subsequent pregnancies, when a secondary immune response leads to IgG production. B. IgD – Incorrect IgD is primarily found on the surface of immature B cells and plays a role in B cell activation, but it has no role in Rh incompatibility or hemolytic disease of the newborn. Additionally, IgD does not cross the placenta in significant amounts. C. IgE – Incorrect IgE is associated with allergic reactions and parasitic infections, rather than hemolytic diseases. It mediates Type I hypersensitivity reactions via mast cells and basophils but does not contribute to Rh-mediated hemolysis. Additionally, IgE does not cross the placenta.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Eosinophils. Granuloma formation in tuberculosis (TB) is a hallmark of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Granulomas form when immune cells surround and attempt to contain persistent antigens that are difficult to eliminate. The core of a tuberculous granuloma consists of infected macrophages, epithelioid cells, and multinucleate giant cells, surrounded by lymphocytes and fibrosis. However, eosinophils are not typically involved in this granulomatous response. Eosinophils are primarily associated with parasitic infections and allergic reactions, rather than mycobacterial infections. Since tuberculosis granulomas are dominated by macrophages and T cells, eosinophils do not play a significant role in the response, making C the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Poorly degradable or persistent antigens – Incorrect Granulomas form in response to persistent antigens that are difficult for macrophages to degrade. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a waxy, lipid-rich cell wall that resists digestion, leading to chronic immune activation and granuloma formation. The continuous presence of mycobacterial antigens is a key driver of granulomatous inflammation. B. Specialized epithelioid cells – Incorrect Epithelioid cells are activated macrophages that undergo morphological changes, becoming elongated and resembling epithelial cells. These cells are crucial for granuloma formation, as they form a tight cluster around mycobacteria and secrete cytokines to maintain the immune response. Epithelioid cells are essential components of tuberculous granulomas. D. Multinucleate giant cells – Incorrect Multinucleate giant cells, such as Langhans giant cells, form by the fusion of macrophages and are a characteristic feature of granulomas in tuberculosis. These cells contain multiple nuclei arranged in a horseshoe pattern and play a role in sequestering the bacteria within granulomas. Their presence is a classic histological finding in TB.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) IL-1, IL-6. Fever is a systemic response to infection, mediated by endogenous pyrogens—cytokines that act on the hypothalamus to increase body temperature. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are key macrophage-derived cytokines that induce fever in response to bacterial infections, including Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. IL-1 is one of the primary pyrogenic (fever-inducing) cytokines, acting on the hypothalamus to increase prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, which raises the body’s temperature set point. IL-6 is another important pyrogenic cytokine, contributing to fever and promoting the acute-phase response in the liver. Both IL-1 and IL-6 play crucial roles in systemic inflammation and fever, making D the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. IFN-g, TNF-a – Incorrect Interferon-gamma (IFN-g) is primarily produced by T cells and NK cells and plays a key role in macrophage activation and the immune response to intracellular pathogens (e.g., tuberculosis, viral infections). However, it is not a primary mediator of fever. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) does contribute to systemic inflammation but is not the main cytokine responsible for fever. TNF-a is involved in septic shock and tissue damage rather than direct fever induction. B. TNF-a, IL-8 – Incorrect TNF-a has inflammatory effects and can induce fever, but it is not as potent as IL-1 in elevating body temperature. IL-8 is primarily a chemokine that recruits neutrophils to sites of infection. It does not play a significant role in fever induction. C. IFN-g, IL-6 – Incorrect IFN-g is important for activating macrophages but does not directly cause fever. IL-6 does contribute to fever, but fever induction primarily requires IL-1 along with IL-6. Since IFN-g does not have a major role in fever, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) INF-γ production, NK cell–mediated killing, T-cell immune response During a viral infection, the immune response follows a well-coordinated sequence of events: Interferon-gamma (INF-γ) production – Early in viral infection, infected cells and immune cells (such as macrophages and dendritic cells) produce interferons (INF-α, INF-β, and INF-γ). INF-γ plays a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication, enhancing antigen presentation, and activating natural killer (NK) cells. NK cell-mediated killing – NK cells are an essential part of the innate immune response. They recognize and destroy virus-infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules. This helps control the infection until the adaptive immune response is fully activated. T-cell immune response – The adaptive immune response kicks in as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells) recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells. Additionally, helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) enhance the immune response by supporting B-cell antibody production and macrophage activation. This sequence ensures effective viral clearance, making A the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. T-cell immune response, INF-γ production, ADCC The T-cell immune response occurs later, while INF-γ production is an early event in viral infections. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) relies on antibodies, which are produced later in the immune response. This sequence does not accurately reflect the natural order of events. C. Antibody synthesis, INF-γ production, NK cell ADCC Antibody synthesis is a late-stage response, requiring activation of B cells and class switching, making it unlikely to be the first event. INF-γ production occurs early, before antibodies are synthesized. NK cell activity occurs before antibody-mediated ADCC, as it is part of the innate response. D. INF-γ production, antibody synthesis, INF-γ production INF-γ production is an early event, but antibody synthesis is a later adaptive immune response that occurs only after T-cell activation and B-cell maturation. The repetition of INF-γ production does not fit into the proper immune response sequence. E. NK cell INF-γ production, INF-γ production, T-cell immune response NK cell activity and INF-γ production happen early, but this sequence lacks the intermediate step of NK cell-mediated killing, which is crucial before the T-cell immune response becomes effective. The redundancy of INF-γ production is also incorrect in this order.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bruton agammaglobulinemia is a congenital defect that becomes apparent at approximately 6 months of age, when maternal IgG is diminished. It occurs in males and is characterized by a defective btk gene, very small tonsils, low levels of all five classes of immunoglobulins, and no mature B cells. Thus, the child is unable to produce immunoglobulins and develops a series of bacterial infections characterized by recurrences and progression to more serious infections such as septicemia. The most common organisms responsible for infection are H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Treatment consists of pooled IgG. Cell- mediated immunity is not affected, and the child is able to respond normally to diseases that require this immune response for resolution, such as the measles virus, varicella-zoster virus, and M tuberculosis. The other diagnoses do not des cribe the specific clinical s cenario outlined in this case. Also, it is important to note that since the main defect in this child’s immunity is in the B-cell line, in that, the child is unable to produce immunoglobulins. The organism that would be most dangeous to the child is C. trachomatis because the B-cell line (antibodies) is typically responsible for its elimination from the host.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) Vaccine The BCG vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine derived from Mycobacterium bovis and is used to protect against tuberculosis (TB). In immunocompromised individuals, such as those with primary immunodeficiency disorders, live vaccines can cause severe or disseminated infections because their immune system cannot control the attenuated pathogen. The young girl has a history of recurrent Candida albicans and respiratory viral infections since infancy, suggesting a T-cell immunodeficiency, such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) or Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC). T-cell defects impair control of intracellular pathogens, making live vaccines, including BCG, highly dangerous. In such cases, live vaccines should be avoided to prevent vaccine-related disease. Instead, killed or subunit vaccines should be used. Incorrect Answers: B. Bordetella pertussis vaccine The acellular pertussis vaccine (part of the DTaP vaccine) is a killed subunit vaccine and safe for immunocompromised individuals. It contains inactivated pertussis toxins and proteins that stimulate an immune response without causing disease. C. Diphtheria toxoid The diphtheria toxoid vaccine is not a live vaccine, but a toxoid (inactivated toxin) that elicits an immune response without risk of infection. Safe for immunocompromised individuals. D. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) IPV is a killed vaccine and does not contain live viruses, making it safe for immunocompromised individuals. However, oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a live attenuated vaccine and is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Found on T and B Lymphocytes and All Nucleated Cells The diagram likely represents Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I, which is expressed on all nucleated cells, including T and B lymphocytes. MHC Class I molecules play a crucial role in the presentation of endogenous antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, allowing the immune system to recognize and eliminate virus-infected or cancerous cells. MHC Class I molecules consist of a heavy chain (α-chain) associated with β2-microglobulin and are responsible for antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells. They are present on all nucleated cells, but not on mature red blood cells (RBCs). This feature distinguishes them from MHC Class II, which is found only on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. Thus, the best answer is (C): Found on T and B lymphocytes and all nucleated cells. Incorrect Answers: A. Depicts the cell-membrane MHC product associated with narcolepsy Narcolepsy is associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02, which is an MHC Class II molecule, not MHC Class I. Since MHC Class II is only found on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and not all nucleated cells, this statement is incorrect. B. Essential for the transplacental passage of antibody IgG antibodies, not MHC molecules, are responsible for transplacental immunity. FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor) mediates the transfer of IgG across the placenta. MHC Class I and II molecules are not involved in this process, making this option incorrect. D. Present on macrophages but not neutrophils (Duplicate option in question) MHC Class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells, including macrophages and neutrophils. This statement would be true for MHC Class II, which is found on macrophages but not on neutrophils. However, since MHC Class I is on all nucleated cells, including neutrophils, this statement is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Corerct Answer (D) C5a is the Most Important Component for Chemotaxis C5a is the most potent chemotactic factor of the complement system. It plays a crucial role in attracting neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils to sites of infection and inflammation. C5a is generated during the complement cascade activation when C5 is cleaved into C5a and C5b. C5a binds to C5a receptors (C5aR) on immune cells, triggering migration toward the site of infection. It also enhances vascular permeability, allowing immune cells to reach infected tissues more effectively. Apart from chemotaxis, C5a also activates mast cells, leading to histamine release, which contributes to inflammation. Thus, C5a is the key complement component responsible for chemotaxis, making option D the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. C1q C1q is the first component of the classical complement pathway. It plays a role in immune complex clearance and pathogen recognition but has no role in chemotaxis. Since it does not attract immune cells to the site of infection, this option is incorrect. B. C3a C3a is an anaphylatoxin, meaning it triggers mast cell degranulation and promotes inflammation. While C3a can contribute to immune cell activation, it is much weaker than C5a in chemotaxis. C3a's primary role is in enhancing inflammation rather than directly attracting immune cells, making it an incorrect answer. C. C3b C3b is an opsonin, meaning it coats pathogens to enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. While it plays a vital role in immune defense, it does not function as a chemotactic factor. Since chemotaxis refers specifically to attracting immune cells, C3b is not the correct answer.",

SCID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by: Defective T-cell and B-cell development, leading to both cellular and humoral immune deficiencies. Recurrent infections from infancy, involving bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray, indicating a lack of T-cell development. Low or absent B lymphocytes, leading to severe antibody deficiency. Chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive, due to inability to mount an immune response. Opportunistic infections, such as candidiasis, herpes simplex virus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Rash at birth, which is often due to maternal T-cell engraftment in the absence of functional host T-cells. SCID is often caused by mutations in IL-2 receptor gamma chain (X-linked SCID) or adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency (autosomal recessive SCID). Without a bone marrow transplant, SCID is fatal in infancy due to overwhelming infections. Incorrect Answers: A. Ataxia-Telangiectasia Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by ATM gene mutation, leading to DNA repair defects. It presents with: Cerebellar ataxia (difficulty walking, poor coordination). Oculocutaneous telangiectasias (visible small blood vessels). Recurrent sinopulmonary infections due to IgA deficiency. Increased risk of malignancies. Unlike SCID, ataxia-telangiectasia does not present with absent thymic shadow or lack of B cells, making it an incorrect choice. B. Bruton Agammaglobulinemia (X-linked Agammaglobulinemia, XLA) Bruton agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked disorder caused by a mutation in the BTK gene, leading to defective B-cell maturation. It presents in males >6 months of age with recurrent bacterial infections (e.g., pneumonia, otitis media) but no viral or fungal infections. Lab findings: Absent B cells and low immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE). Normal thymic shadow (T-cell function is intact). SCID affects both B and T cells, whereas Bruton agammaglobulinemia only affects B cells, making SCID the correct diagnosis here. C. Chediak-Higashi Syndrome Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a defect in lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, leading to: Defective phagosome-lysosome fusion. Recurrent bacterial infections (especially Staphylococcus and Streptococcus). Oculocutaneous albinism (partial absence of pigment in skin, hair, and eyes). Neuropathy (tingling, numbness). Giant granules in neutrophils on blood smear. Unlike SCID, Chediak-Higashi does not cause absence of thymic shadow or B cells, making it incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Conjugative Plasmids The rapid and efficient transfer of tetracycline resistance among E. coli strains in this scenario is best explained by conjugative plasmids. Plasmids are small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can replicate independently of bacterial chromosomes. Conjugative plasmids contain genes for self-transfer, most notably the F (fertility) factor, which encodes a sex pilus. This pilus allows for direct cell-to-cell contact between a donor and a recipient bacterium, enabling the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes through a process called bacterial conjugation. In this case, the tetracycline resistance gene was likely present on a resistance (R) plasmid, which was transferred from resistant strains to susceptible ones via conjugation. This mechanism explains how all bacteria became tetracycline-resistant after co-culturing, making conjugative plasmids (C) the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. Cell Lysis and the Release of DNA from Donor Bacteria This describes transformation, where bacteria take up naked DNA fragments from lysed cells in the environment. However, E. coli is not naturally competent and does not efficiently undergo transformation without artificial induction. Additionally, transformation is much less efficient than conjugation and would not explain why all bacteria became resistant. Incorrect because transformation is not the primary method for spreading resistance in E. coli. B. Competent Cells Competency refers to a bacterium’s ability to take up exogenous DNA, usually in the process of transformation. While some bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) can naturally become competent, E. coli does not exhibit this property under normal conditions. Incorrect because E. coli does not efficiently acquire resistance genes via natural competence. D. Recombinase Enzymes Recombinase enzymes, such as RecA, mediate homologous recombination, where foreign DNA integrates into the bacterial chromosome. However, plasmids do not require recombinase enzymes for transfer, as they replicate independently. Incorrect because recombinase enzymes are not involved in plasmid-mediated conjugation.",

Incorrect Answers: A. 4,000 This number would be obtained if the bacteria only doubled twice (which would take just 1 hour, not 4). Incorrect because the bacteria double 8 times, not 2. B. 16,000 This would be the result of 4 doublings (i.e., 2 hours). Incorrect because the bacteria had 8 doubling cycles, not 4. C. 64,000 This would be the result of 6 doublings (i.e., 3 hours).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The girl has been likely exposed to poison ivy or poison oak (contact dermatitis) which is attributed to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. An Arthus reaction is a localized type of reaction mediated by aggregates of antibody and antigen and is characteristic of type III hypersensitivity reactions. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a type 4 or delayed-type hypersensitivity response (DTH) by an individual’s immune system to a small molecule (less than 500 daltons), or hapten, that contacts a sensitized individual’s skin. ACD accounts for 20% of contact dermatoses, and allergens differ greatly based upon geography, personal habits, and hobbies. Allergic contact dermatitis is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is caused by a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction. It results from the contact of an offending chemical or antigen with the skin, and the subsequent T-cell mediated response.[3] Morphology and location of the dermatitis are often the best indicators of the offending agent. For instance, when found around the wrist, it may indicate an allergic response to a bracelet or watchband. Poison ivy is a common cause of ACD and presents as linear streaks where the plant comes into contact with the skin. Nickel is another common cause of ACD and presents as dermatitis where necklaces and earrings containing nickel are worn. Rubber gloves are also a common cause of chronic dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Autograft: Allograft Explanation of the Correct Answer: In this scenario, the 38-year-old patient receives two units of blood during elective surgery: One unit is the patient's own blood, which was collected and preserved for future use. One unit is from the patient's 30-year-old brother (a donor). According to transplantation terminology: Autograft refers to tissue or organ transplantation within the same individual (e.g., the patient's own stored blood). Allograft refers to transplantation between two genetically different individuals of the same species (e.g., the brother's donated blood). Thus, the correct classification is: Patient’s own blood = Autograft Brother’s blood = Allograft Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Allograft: Allograft – Incorrect This option suggests that both units of blood came from different donors, which is incorrect because the patient’s own stored blood is not an allograft but an autograft. (B) Allograft: Autograft – Incorrect This suggests that the patient’s own blood is an allograft and the brother’s blood is an autograft, which is incorrect. The patient’s own blood is always considered an autograft. (D) Autograft: Autograft – Incorrect This would mean that both units of blood came from the same individual (the patient), which is not true since one unit was from the brother (making it an allograft).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Immunity to a disease is achieved through the presence of antibodies to that disease in a person’s system. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to neutralize or destroy toxins or disease-carrying organisms. Antibodies are disease-specific. For example, measles antibody will protect a person who is exposed to measles disease but will have no effect if he or she is exposed to mumps. There are two types of immunity: active and passive. Active Immunity results when exposure to a disease organism triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to that disease. Active immunity can be acquired through natural immunity or vaccine-induced immunity. Natural immunity is acquired from exposure to the disease organism through infection with the actual disease. Vaccine-induced immunity is acquired through the introduction of a killed or weakened form of the disease organism through vaccination. Either way, if an immune person comes into contact with that disease in the future, their immune system will recognize it and immediately produce the antibodies needed to fight it. Active immunity is long-lasting, and sometimes life-long. Passive immunity is provided when a person is given antibodies to a disease rather than producing them through his or her own immune system. A newborn baby acquires passive immunity from its mother through the placenta. People can also get passive immunity through antibody-containing blood products such as immune globulin, which may be given when immediate protection from a specific disease is needed. The major advantage to passive immunity is that protection is immediate, whereas active immunity takes time (usually several weeks) to develop. However, passive immunity lasts only for a few weeks or months. Only active immunity is long-lasting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Complement protects the host from pneumococcal infection through C1, C2, and C4 Explanation of the Correct Answer: The complement system is a crucial part of the innate immune response, consisting of a series of proteins that enhance the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens. The classical pathway of complement activation is initiated by C1, C2, and C4, which are activated when antibodies (IgG or IgM) bind to antigens. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an encapsulated bacterium that is effectively targeted by complement, particularly through the classical pathway (C1, C2, C4). The complement system opsonizes the bacteria, making them easier for phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) to engulf and destroy. Thus, C1, C2, and C4 help protect against pneumococcal infections by initiating complement activation, leading to opsonization and clearance of the bacteria. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Complement inhibits phagocytosis – Incorrect Complement does not inhibit phagocytosis; it enhances it. Complement proteins, especially C3b, serve as opsonins, marking pathogens for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. The membrane attack complex (MAC, formed by C5b-C9) also directly lyses pathogens. (B) Complement is activated by IgE antibody classes – Incorrect Complement is primarily activated by IgG and IgM, not IgE. IgE is involved in allergic reactions and defense against parasitic infections but does not activate complement. (C) Complement plays a minor role in the inflammatory response – Incorrect Complement plays a major role in inflammation by: Generating anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a), which promote vasodilation and recruit immune cells. Enhancing phagocytosis through opsonization. Forming the membrane attack complex (MAC), which lyses bacterial cells. Given its significant contribution to inflammation, opsonization, and direct bacterial killing, complement does not play a minor role in the inflammatory response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgE Explanation of the Correct Answer: This patient presents with generalized myalgia, low-grade fever, and eosinophilia following a history of consuming poorly cooked pork meat. A striated muscle biopsy revealing multiple cysts suggests Trichinella spiralis infection (trichinellosis), a parasitic infection that commonly affects muscle tissue. IgE is the primary immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against parasitic infections, particularly helminths (worms). It plays a crucial role in: Activating eosinophils through its Fc receptor, leading to degranulation and release of toxic mediators (e.g., major basic protein) that kill the parasite. Mediating mast cell activation, which releases histamine and other inflammatory mediators to enhance the immune response. Enhancing the immune response against helminths, which are too large to be phagocytosed directly. Since this patient has eosinophilia, which is strongly associated with IgE-mediated responses, IgE is the most relevant immunoglobulin in this case. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) IgG – Incorrect IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the blood and plays a major role in bacterial and viral infections by neutralizing pathogens and aiding in opsonization. While IgG does contribute to some parasitic immune responses, it is not the primary immunoglobulin in helminth infections. (C) IgM – Incorrect IgM is the first antibody produced during an acute immune response. It is mainly involved in early-stage infections, particularly bacterial infections, and is not specialized for parasitic defense. IgE, rather than IgM, is responsible for long-term defense against parasites like Trichinella spiralis. (D) IgD – Incorrect IgD is primarily found on the surface of immature B cells and plays a role in B cell activation. It has no significant role in parasitic infections.",
