      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Orchitis and Oophoritis. The most common complication of mumps is orchitis (inflammation of the testes) in males and oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries) in females. Mumps is caused by the Mumps virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and primarily affects the parotid glands, leading to parotitis. However, in post-pubertal males, orchitis occurs in up to 30-40% of cases, presenting with testicular swelling, pain, fever, and tenderness, and in some cases, it may lead to testicular atrophy and infertility. In females, oophoritis occurs in about 5% of post-pubertal cases, though it is usually less severe and does not commonly cause infertility. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Encephalitis: Incorrect. Mumps encephalitis is a possible but less common complication (occurring in about 0.1-0.2% of cases). While mumps can cause viral meningitis (which is more common than encephalitis), the severe inflammation of brain tissue leading to encephalitis is rare compared to orchitis and oophoritis. (C) Pneumonia: Incorrect. Mumps virus primarily affects the salivary glands, testes, and central nervous system, but it does not typically cause pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract involvement is very rare, and when present, it is usually mild and self-limiting. Other respiratory viruses, such as influenza or RSV, are far more commonly associated with pneumonia. (D) Myocarditis: Incorrect. Mumps-associated myocarditis is extremely rare and occurs in very few cases. While viral myocarditis can be caused by many different viruses (e.g., Coxsackievirus B), mumps virus is not a common cause. It is considered an exceptional complication rather than the most common one.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Mumps causes aseptic meningitis in children. Mumps virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, is a common cause of viral (aseptic) meningitis, particularly in children. Mumps-associated aseptic meningitis occurs in approximately 10% of cases and presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Unlike bacterial meningitis, aseptic meningitis caused by mumps is generally self-limiting and does not require antibiotic treatment. The presence of lymphocytic pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) helps confirm viral meningitis. This complication is more common in children than adults, but it can occur at any age. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Causes SSPE (Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis): Incorrect. SSPE is a late complication of measles virus infection, not mumps. It occurs years after an initial measles infection, leading to progressive neurological deterioration. Mumps virus does not cause SSPE. (C) Sublingual gland is involved commonly: Incorrect. Mumps primarily affects the parotid glands, leading to painful parotitis, which is the hallmark of the disease. While the submandibular and sublingual glands can be involved in some cases, parotid gland involvement is far more common. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. (D) All: Incorrect. Since options A and C are incorrect, option D cannot be the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rotavirus. Rotavirus vaccine has been associated with a small increased risk of intussusception, a condition where a segment of the intestine telescopes into itself, leading to bowel obstruction. The risk is highest within the first 1-2 weeks after the first dose of the vaccine, particularly in infants aged 6-12 weeks. This association was first noted with the RotaShield vaccine, which was withdrawn from the market in 1999 due to a significantly increased risk of intussusception. However, newer rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) have a much lower risk but still carry a small potential risk. Despite this, the benefits of rotavirus vaccination in preventing severe diarrhea and dehydration far outweigh the risks of intussusception. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Parvovirus: Incorrect. Parvovirus B19, which causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), is not associated with intussusception. It primarily affects red blood cell precursors, leading to aplastic crisis in individuals with hemolytic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease), but it does not have any known link to intussusception. Additionally, no vaccine exists for Parvovirus B19. (C) Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV): Incorrect. Polio vaccines (both oral and inactivated) are not associated with intussusception. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been linked to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in rare cases, but neither OPV nor IPV has been associated with intussusception. (D) Measles: Incorrect. The measles vaccine, commonly given as part of the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine, is not linked to intussusception. While the MMR vaccine can cause mild gastrointestinal symptoms, it has no established association with bowel obstruction or intussusception",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Rotavirus. Reassortment is a genetic phenomenon that occurs in segmented viruses, where segments of the viral genome can be exchanged between different strains during co-infection of the same host cell. Rotavirus, a member of the Reoviridae family, has a segmented, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome composed of 11 segments. When two different strains of rotavirus infect the same host cell, they can exchange genome segments, leading to the emergence of new viral strains with mixed genetic material. This reassortment plays a crucial role in viral evolution, contributing to antigenic diversity and the emergence of new strains that may evade pre-existing immunity, making it particularly important in vaccine design and epidemiology. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Herpesvirus: Incorrect. Herpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), belong to the Herpesviridae family and possess a linear, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. They do not have segmented genomes, meaning reassortment cannot occur. Instead, herpesviruses primarily evolve through recombination and mutations rather than reassortment. (B) Hepadnavirus: Incorrect. Hepadnaviruses, such as Hepatitis B virus (HBV), have a partially double-stranded DNA genome that replicates via reverse transcription. Since their genome is not segmented, reassortment is not a mechanism of genetic variation in these viruses. Instead, HBV evolves through mutations and recombination. (D) Astrovirus: Incorrect. Astroviruses are non-enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. Like other non-segmented RNA viruses, they lack the ability to undergo reassortment. Instead, they evolve primarily through point mutations and recombination.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Skin impression smear for immunofluorescence stain. The most reliable antemortem diagnostic test for rabies is direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing on a skin biopsy obtained from the nape of the neck (hair follicle-rich area). The rabies virus travels along peripheral nerves to the central nervous system and also replicates in hair follicle nerves, making skin biopsy from the neck an ideal site for viral detection. Immunofluorescence staining detects rabies viral antigen within nerve endings, allowing for early and accurate diagnosis before death. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Serum for antivirus IgG antibody: Incorrect. Serum antibody detection is not a reliable antemortem diagnostic tool because rabies virus suppresses the immune response, and antibodies typically appear late in the disease or after vaccination. Furthermore, detecting IgG alone cannot confirm active rabies infection, as it may indicate prior vaccination or exposure without disease. (C) CSF sample for viral culture: Incorrect. Rabies virus is rarely isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and viral culture is neither sensitive nor practical for antemortem diagnosis. CSF analysis may show nonspecific findings like mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, but it is not definitive for rabies diagnosis. (D) Giemsa stain on smear prepared from salivary secretions: Incorrect. Although rabies virus can be present in saliva, Giemsa staining is not a suitable method for detection. Rabies virus is best detected in saliva by RT-PCR, not by Giemsa staining. Additionally, viral shedding in saliva is intermittent, making saliva testing unreliable as a sole diagnostic method.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Start post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). In cases of unprovoked animal bites, especially from a neighbor’s dog whose rabies vaccination status is unknown, it is critical to immediately begin post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). An unprovoked bite (i.e., the dog attacked without being threatened or disturbed) is more concerning because rabid animals often exhibit aggressive and erratic behavior. Since rabies is nearly 100?tal once symptoms appear, prompt administration of rabies PEP—which includes rabies vaccination and possibly rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) depending on the exposure classification—is essential. Even if the dog appears healthy at the time of the bite, rabies can still be incubating, and delaying treatment could be life-threatening if the dog later develops symptoms. Hence, PEP should be initiated immediately, and if the dog remains healthy after 10 days of observation, PEP may be discontinued. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Test antibody level in the dog: Incorrect. Testing antibody levels in the dog is not a reliable method to determine whether the dog has rabies. Rabies diagnosis in animals is made through direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing on brain tissue post-mortem, not by checking antibodies. Serologic testing does not confirm active rabies infection, as vaccinated animals may have antibodies without being infected. (B) Withhold immunization and observe the dog for 10 days for signs of rabies: Incorrect. While 10-day observation is recommended for the dog, it should not delay starting PEP in the bitten individual, especially for an unprovoked bite. If the dog develops signs of rabies within the 10-day observation period, it confirms the risk of transmission, making early PEP critical. Delaying treatment could lead to a fatal outcome if the virus has already entered the nervous system. (D) Perform euthanasia for the dog: Incorrect. Euthanasia is not necessary for a healthy dog simply because it bit someone. Instead, the dog should be observed for 10 days for any signs of rabies. If the dog remains healthy, it was likely not infectious at the time of the bite, and PEP can be stopped if already started. However, if the dog shows signs of rabies, it should be euthanized and tested immediately.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Negri bodies. Negri bodies are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies found in the neurons of rabies-infected individuals, particularly in the hippocampus (pyramidal cells) and cerebellum (Purkinje cells). These inclusions represent sites of viral replication and are considered a histopathological hallmark of rabies infection. Negri bodies can be observed using standard histological stains, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Seller’s stain, but they are not always present in all cases. Definitive diagnosis of rabies is now typically done using direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing on brain tissue or RT-PCR for viral RNA detection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Guarneri bodies: Incorrect. Guarneri bodies are intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies found in epithelial cells in smallpox (Variola virus) and cowpox infections. They are not associated with rabies and are primarily seen in skin lesions of poxvirus infections. (C) Cowdry A bodies: Incorrect. Cowdry A bodies are intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies found in herpesvirus infections, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). They are not associated with rabies, as rabies virus is an RNA virus that forms cytoplasmic inclusions, not nuclear inclusions. (D) Bollinger bodies: Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) KFD is transmitted by ticks. Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral disease caused by the Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV), a flavivirus. It is transmitted primarily by the hard tick Haemaphysalis spinigera, which serves as both a vector and a reservoir. KFD is endemic to forest regions of India, particularly in Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. The disease manifests as high fever, hemorrhagic symptoms, myalgia, and neurological complications in severe cases. Rodents, monkeys, and shrews serve as reservoirs, and humans acquire the infection through tick bites. There is a KFD vaccine available for high-risk populations. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Yellow fever is endemic in India: Incorrect. Yellow fever is not endemic in India. The disease, caused by the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), a flavivirus, is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and South America. India has strict vaccination policies for travelers coming from yellow fever-endemic countries to prevent its introduction. Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) are the primary vectors of yellow fever. (B) Dengue viruses have only one serotype: Incorrect. Dengue virus (DENV) has four distinct serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. A person infected with one serotype develops lifelong immunity against that specific serotype but remains susceptible to infection by the other three serotypes. Secondary infections with a different serotype increase the risk of severe dengue (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome) due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). (D) Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by Aedes: Incorrect. Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), a flavivirus, is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes (Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui group), not Aedes. These mosquitoes breed in rice fields and stagnant water and primarily transmit JEV in rural areas of Asia. Pigs and water birds act as amplifying hosts, while humans are dead-end hosts.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by inhalation of rodent urine and feces. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a severe respiratory illness caused by Hantaviruses, which belong to the Bunyaviridae family. It is transmitted through inhalation of aerosols containing virus particles from rodent urine, feces, or saliva. The primary reservoir of hantaviruses includes deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), cotton rats, and rice rats, which shed the virus in their excretions. The disease progresses rapidly, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular collapse. Unlike many other viral diseases, there is no human-to-human transmission of HPS in most cases. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Kyasanur forest disease is caused by the bite of a wild animal: Incorrect. Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is not transmitted by wild animals but by the bite of infected hard ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera). KFD is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the KFD virus (a flavivirus), primarily found in forested areas of India. Monkeys and small mammals serve as reservoirs, but humans contract the disease through tick bites, not wild animal bites. (C) Lyssavirus is transmitted by ticks: Incorrect. Lyssavirus, which includes Rabies virus, is transmitted through the bite or saliva of infected mammals (e.g., dogs, bats, foxes), not ticks. Rabies is a neurotropic viral disease causing fatal encephalitis in humans and animals. The virus spreads through nerve pathways to the central nervous system (CNS), leading to hydrophobia, paralysis, and coma if untreated. Tick bites have no role in rabies transmission. (D) Lyssavirus is transmitted by ticks: Incorrect (repeated). As mentioned above, Lyssavirus (Rabies virus) is not transmitted by ticks but rather through infected animal bites, scratches, or exposure to saliva.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) IgM Capture ELISA. IgM Capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (MAC-ELISA) is the most specific and widely used serological test for diagnosing Dengue virus infection. It detects Dengue virus-specific IgM antibodies, which typically appear 3–5 days after symptom onset and remain elevated for weeks to months. This test is particularly useful for diagnosing primary Dengue infections, as IgM levels are higher compared to secondary infections (where IgG predominates). The high specificity and ease of testing make MAC-ELISA the gold standard for routine Dengue diagnosis in endemic regions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Tissue culture: Incorrect. While Dengue virus can be isolated in tissue culture using mosquito cell lines (e.g., C6/36 cells) or mammalian cell cultures (e.g., Vero cells), this method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not routinely used for diagnosis. Additionally, virus isolation requires a specialized biosafety level (BSL-2 or BSL-3) laboratory, making it impractical for rapid clinical diagnosis. (C) Complement Fixation Test (CFT): Incorrect. CFT is an older, less specific serological test that detects antibodies against Dengue virus. However, it is not commonly used due to low sensitivity and cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses (e.g., Zika, Japanese Encephalitis). Modern methods like ELISA and RT-PCR have largely replaced CFT for Dengue diagnosis. (D) Electron microscopy: Incorrect. Although electron microscopy (EM) can visualize Dengue virus particles, it is not a practical diagnostic tool because it requires expensive equipment, skilled personnel, and high viral loads in samples. EM is mainly used for research purposes rather than routine clinical diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Infection after 16 weeks of gestation results in major congenital defects, which is incorrect. Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is most severe when maternal infection occurs during the first trimester, particularly in the first 8–10 weeks of pregnancy. The risk of severe congenital abnormalities declines significantly after 16 weeks of gestation, and after 20 weeks, the risk of birth defects is minimal. Therefore, this statement is incorrect because major congenital defects are primarily associated with infection during the first trimester, not after 16 weeks. Explanation of Correct Options: (A) It is diagnosed when the infant has IgM antibodies at birth: Correct. Rubella-specific IgM antibodies in a newborn indicate congenital infection, as maternal IgM does not cross the placenta. IgM antibodies appear shortly after infection and persist for a few months in the infant, making them a reliable marker of congenital rubella syndrome. (B) It is diagnosed when IgG antibodies persist for more than 6 months: Correct. While maternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta and are present in all newborns of rubella-immune mothers, these antibodies typically decline within 6 months. However, in congenital rubella, IgG antibodies persist beyond 6 months due to ongoing viral replication in the infant, confirming the diagnosis of CRS. (C) Most common congenital defects are deafness, cardiac malformations, and cataracts: Correct. The classic triad of congenital rubella syndrome includes sensorineural deafness, congenital heart disease (especially patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis), and cataracts. Other manifestations include microcephaly, mental retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenic purpura (\"blueberry muffin rash\"), and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Deafness is the most common defect and may occur even if maternal infection occurs later in pregnancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis in infants and young children, particularly in those under 2 years of age. The classic presentation includes wheezing, cough, respiratory distress, and bilateral crepitations, which are hallmarks of lower respiratory tract involvement. RSV primarily affects the bronchioles, leading to mucus plugging, airway inflammation, and obstruction, which causes wheezing—a distinguishing feature from typical bacterial pneumonia. Severe cases can lead to respiratory failure, especially in premature infants or those with underlying cardiopulmonary conditions. RSV is highly contagious, spreads via droplets and fomites, and peaks in winter months. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Pneumonia: Incorrect. While bacterial pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) and viral pneumonia (e.g., influenza, adenovirus) can present with respiratory distress and crepitations, wheezing is not a prominent feature in bacterial pneumonia. Instead, pneumonia typically presents with fever, tachypnea, and focal signs like unilateral crackles or bronchial breathing. (B) Adenovirus: Incorrect. Adenovirus can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, but it is less common than RSV in infants. Adenoviral infections are often more severe, with a longer duration of symptoms, high fever, and multisystem involvement (e.g., conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis). Unlike RSV, adenovirus is more likely to cause necrotizing pneumonia. (D) Rhinovirus: Incorrect. Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold and can also trigger wheezing episodes, especially in children with a history of asthma or atopy. However, rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis is less severe compared to RSV, and it is not the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Transmitted by mites. However, this statement is incorrect, as CCHF is actually transmitted by Hyalomma ticks, not mites. The disease is caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. Transmission occurs through tick bites, contact with infected animal blood, or human-to-human transmission via bodily fluids. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Zoonosis – Correct statement, but the question asks for the false option. CCHF is a zoonotic disease, meaning it is naturally transmitted from animals to humans. The virus is maintained in nature through a tick-animal-tick cycle, primarily affecting livestock such as cattle, goats, and sheep. Humans become infected through tick bites or direct contact with infected animal blood or tissues during slaughter. (B) Develops petechial rashes – Correct statement, but the question asks for the false option. Patients with CCHF often develop petechial rashes due to vascular damage and thrombocytopenia. The disease progresses from a febrile phase to a hemorrhagic phase, characterized by petechiae, ecchymosis, mucosal bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This severe bleeding tendency contributes to high mortality rates (10–40%) in infected individuals. (D) Recently, disease has been reported in Gujarat – Correct statement, but the question asks for the false option. CCHF has been reported in Gujarat, India, with sporadic outbreaks occurring since 2011. The disease is endemic in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and South Asia. Cases in Gujarat have been linked to animal exposure, slaughterhouse workers, and healthcare settings due to human-to-human transmission.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) All 4 types, as all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) have been reported in India. Dengue virus belongs to the Flavivirus genus and is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In India, multiple serotypes co-circulate, leading to both endemic and epidemic outbreaks. The presence of multiple serotypes increases the risk of severe dengue (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome) due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where a secondary infection with a different serotype can trigger a more severe immune response. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Types I and 1 – Incorrect There is no such classification as “Type I and 1”. The four correct serotypes are DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. This option appears to be a typographical error and is incorrect. (B) Types 1 and 3 – Incorrect Although DENV-1 and DENV-3 are commonly reported in India, DENV-2 and DENV-4 are also present. DENV-2 is often associated with severe outbreaks and has been a major cause of dengue hemorrhagic fever in India. Therefore, this option is incomplete. (C) Types 2 and 4 – Incorrect While DENV-2 and DENV-4 have been detected in India, this option ignores DENV-1 and DENV-3, both of which are also present. DENV-1 is associated with classical dengue fever, whereas DENV-3 has been linked to severe epidemics. Since all four serotypes circulate in India, this answer is incorrect. (D) Type 1 only – Incorrect DENV-1 is one of the serotypes detected in India, but it is not the only one. The circulation of all four serotypes has been documented, and outbreaks have involved multiple serotypes. DENV-2 and DENV-3, in particular, have been responsible for severe outbreaks.",

This is recommended for individuals at high risk of rabies exposure, such as veterinarians, animal handlers, laboratory personnel working with the rabies virus, and travelers to rabies-endemic areas. The standard pre-exposure schedule involves intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID) administration of the rabies vaccine on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. This regimen stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies, providing long-term protection.

However, in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), the Essen regimen involves 4 doses of the vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 (when rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is given). The 4-dose schedule is not applicable for pre-exposure vaccination. (C) 5 doses – Incorrect The 5-dose regimen (Essen regimen: days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28) is used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in individuals who have never been vaccinated against rabies before. This is not the standard regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis, making this answer incorrect. (D) 6 doses – Incorrect A 6-dose schedule is not recommended for rabies vaccination. Older regimens such as the Milwaukee protocol involved prolonged treatment, but they are not used for routine pre-exposure prophylaxis. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Decreased absorption by villi, as rotavirus infection primarily causes destruction and dysfunction of small intestinal enterocytes (villi cells), leading to malabsorption diarrhea. The virus infects and damages the mature absorptive cells in the tips of the villi in the small intestine, reducing the ability to absorb water and nutrients. This results in osmotic diarrhea, where undigested nutrients and fluids accumulate in the intestinal lumen, leading to profuse watery diarrhea. Additionally, the loss of absorptive cells disrupts the brush border enzymes, further impairing digestion and absorption, worsening the diarrhea. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Increased intestinal hypermotility – Incorrect Rotavirus infection does not primarily cause diarrhea through increased gut motility. While some viral infections may influence motility, the main mechanism in rotavirus is villous atrophy and malabsorption, not hypermotility. (C) Increased secretion by villi – Incorrect Although some degree of secretory diarrhea occurs due to viral enterotoxin (NSP4 protein), the dominant mechanism is malabsorption due to villous destruction. Unlike bacterial infections like cholera, which cause diarrhea mainly through active secretion, rotavirus diarrhea is more osmotic in nature. (D) None of the above – Incorrect Since decreased absorption by villi (option B) is the correct explanation, this option is incorrect.",

HDCV is a highly purified and inactivated vaccine derived from human diploid cell cultures, making it safe and effective for both pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). It is administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) and helps in inducing long-term immunity against rabies. HDCV is part of the modern cell culture-based rabies vaccines, replacing older nerve tissue-derived vaccines, which were associated with severe side effects. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) DPT – Incorrect DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus) vaccine is used to protect against bacterial infections caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordetella pertussis, and Clostridium tetani. It has no role in rabies prevention, making this option incorrect. (B) MMR – Incorrect MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine is used to prevent viral infections caused by measles virus, mumps virus, and rubella virus.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), as it is the most common cause of bronchiolitis in infants and young children. RSV is a highly contagious RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family. It primarily affects the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation, mucus production, and airway obstruction in small bronchioles. Bronchiolitis typically presents with cough, wheezing, tachypnea, and respiratory distress. Severe cases may require hospitalization, oxygen therapy, or ventilatory support, especially in premature infants and those with underlying conditions. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenovirus can cause respiratory infections, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia, but it is a less common cause of bronchiolitis compared to RSV. While adenovirus infections can contribute to bronchiolitis-like symptoms, they are not the leading cause. (C) Influenza – Incorrect Influenza virus primarily causes influenza (flu), a systemic illness with fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue. Although influenza virus can cause lower respiratory tract infections, it is not the most common cause of bronchiolitis in infants. (D) Herpesvirus – Incorrect Herpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), typically cause vesicular skin and mucosal infections rather than bronchiolitis. HSV can cause severe pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, but it is not a common cause of bronchiolitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Primary infectious pneumonia is less common than secondary bacterial pneumonia. Influenza virus primarily infects the respiratory tract, leading to acute viral pneumonia, but secondary bacterial pneumonia is more common and a major cause of mortality in influenza patients. Secondary pneumonia occurs after initial viral infection when bacterial pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae invade the compromised lungs, leading to severe illness, high fever, productive cough, and respiratory distress. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) It is caused by an enveloped DNA virus – Incorrect Influenza virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and is an enveloped, single-stranded, segmented RNA virus, not a DNA virus. The genome segmentation allows for genetic reassortment, which leads to antigenic shifts and drifts, contributing to seasonal flu outbreaks and pandemics. (B) Laboratory studies may show neutropenia early in the course of disease – Incorrect Influenza infection primarily induces a viral response, leading to an increase in lymphocytes rather than neutropenia. While some patients may develop mild leukopenia or a transient drop in neutrophils, neutropenia is not a typical hallmark of influenza infection. (D) Antiviral agents given early prevent complications – Incorrect While antiviral drugs such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and Zanamivir can reduce disease severity and duration if given early (within 48 hours of symptom onset), they do not completely prevent complications, especially in high-risk individuals. Patients with comorbidities, elderly individuals, or those with weakened immunity may still develop pneumonia, ARDS, or other complications, despite early antiviral treatment.",

Negri bodies are eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic inclusions found in neurons of the brain, specifically in the hippocampus (pyramidal cells) and cerebellum (Purkinje cells) of patients infected with the Rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae family). These inclusions are diagnostic of rabies and result from viral replication within neurons. The detection of Negri bodies using immunofluorescence or histopathology is an important postmortem diagnostic tool for rabies infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Poliovirus – Incorrect Poliovirus, a member of the Picornaviridae family, primarily infects motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, leading to poliomyelitis and flaccid paralysis. However, it does not produce Negri bodies. Instead, perivascular inflammation and neuronal degeneration are seen in affected tissues. (C) Herpesvirus – Incorrect Herpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), cause intranuclear Cowdry type A inclusion bodies rather than Negri bodies. HSV infections can lead to herpes encephalitis, but their cytopathic effects differ from those of rabies.

This vaccine was first tested successfully on Joseph Meister, a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a rabid dog. Pasteur’s pioneering work in vaccination laid the foundation for modern preventive immunology. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Robert Koch – Incorrect Robert Koch was a German physician and microbiologist known for discovering the causative agents of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), cholera (Vibrio cholerae), and anthrax (Bacillus anthracis). While Koch made significant contributions to bacteriology and disease control, he did not develop a vaccine for rabies. (C) Edward Jenner – Incorrect Edward Jenner, an English physician, is credited with developing the first successful vaccine in history—the smallpox vaccine—in 1796. He used material from cowpox lesions to immunize against smallpox, but his work was unrelated to rabies.

Unlike reoviruses, they do not have a double-layered capsid structure or a dsRNA genome. They commonly cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and conjunctival infections in humans. (C) Herpes virus – Incorrect Herpesviruses are enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses belonging to the Herpesviridae family. They have a single capsid surrounded by a lipid envelope, which contains glycoproteins essential for viral entry into host cells. Examples include Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1, HSV-2), Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). (D) Myxovirus – Incorrect Myxoviruses refer to Orthomyxoviruses (e.g., Influenza viruses) and Paramyxoviruses (e.g., Measles, Mumps, Respiratory Syncytial Virus). These viruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses and do not have double-stranded RNA or a two-layered capsid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Infantile diarrhea. Rotaviruses are the leading cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children, particularly those under the age of 5 years. The virus affects the small intestine, leading to villous atrophy and a decrease in intestinal absorption, resulting in profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. It spreads primarily via the fecal-oral route, with outbreaks commonly occurring in childcare centers, nurseries, and hospitals. Rotavirus infection is a major cause of hospitalization due to dehydration in infants and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in adults – Incorrect While rotaviruses can cause gastroenteritis, they primarily affect infants and young children. Infections in adults are less common and usually mild, as most adults have developed immunity due to prior exposure. Norovirus, rather than rotavirus, is the more frequent cause of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in adults. (C) Teratogenic effects – Incorrect Rotavirus infection does not cause teratogenic effects. Teratogenic viruses are those that cause birth defects when a fetus is exposed during pregnancy. Examples include rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Zika virus, but rotavirus is not among them. (D) Respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised individuals – Incorrect Rotavirus primarily targets the gastrointestinal tract, not the respiratory system. While some studies have suggested that rotavirus RNA may be detected in the respiratory tract, it is not a recognized cause of respiratory infections, even in immunocompromised individuals. Instead, viruses such as RSV, influenza, and adenoviruses are more commonly associated with respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All. Rabies virus is highly susceptible to inactivation by various physical and chemical agents, including phenol, UV radiation, and beta-propiolactone (BPL). These agents disrupt the viral lipid envelope and nucleic acid, rendering the virus non-infectious. Phenol is a widely used chemical disinfectant that denatures viral proteins, leading to irreversible inactivation. It is used in laboratory settings and vaccine production. UV radiation inactivates the rabies virus by inducing thymine dimer formation in its RNA genome, preventing replication and infectivity. Beta-propiolactone (BPL) is a chemical sterilizing agent used in vaccine preparation. It modifies nucleic acids, making the virus non-viable while maintaining its antigenic properties, which is essential for vaccine efficacy. Since all of these agents effectively inactivate the rabies virus, the correct answer is (D) All. Explanation of Incorrect Options: There are no incorrect options in this case, as all the listed agents are valid methods for inactivating the rabies virus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Fixed virus. Antirabies vaccines are prepared using fixed viruses, which are laboratory-adapted strains of the rabies virus that have been attenuated (weakened) or inactivated to ensure safety and immunogenicity. Fixed viruses are used in modern rabies vaccines such as Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV), Purified Vero Cell Rabies Vaccine (PVRV), and Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCECV). These vaccines stimulate an immune response without causing disease. The process of fixing involves serial passage of the virus in controlled laboratory conditions, which stabilizes its characteristics and makes it suitable for vaccine production. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Street virus: The term \"street virus\" refers to naturally occurring wild-type rabies viruses found in infected animals. These viruses are highly virulent and cannot be used for vaccine production because they would cause disease rather than prevent it. (C) Line virus: There is no recognized classification of rabies virus called \"line virus.\" This option is incorrect as it does not refer to any known strain used in vaccine development. (D) Wild virus: Wild viruses are naturally circulating strains of rabies found in infected animals such as dogs, bats, foxes, and raccoons. These viruses are dangerous and not attenuated, making them unsuitable for vaccine production. Instead, fixed strains derived from wild viruses are used after attenuation or inactivation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) H1N1. Swine flu is caused by the H1N1 strain of the Influenza A virus. This virus was responsible for the 2009 pandemic, which led to widespread illness globally. The H1N1 virus originated from pigs but mutated and gained the ability to spread among humans, causing seasonal flu outbreaks. It is a single-stranded RNA virus with segmented genome and is characterized by two surface glycoproteins—Hemagglutinin (H) and Neuraminidase (N), which play a crucial role in its infectivity. The symptoms of H1N1 flu include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, and, in severe cases, pneumonia and respiratory failure. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) H5N1: H5N1 is the avian influenza virus, also known as bird flu. It primarily affects birds and has a high fatality rate in humans when transmitted through direct contact with infected birds, but it does not cause swine flu. (C) H3N1: H3N1 is an influenza subtype that has been detected in animals, but it is not a common cause of human flu outbreaks, including swine flu. (D) H2N3: H2N3 is another influenza A subtype that has been detected in swine but is not known to cause significant human infections or swine flu outbreaks.",

They are small (pico) RNA viruses, hence the name. This group includes important human pathogens such as Poliovirus, Rhinovirus, Hepatitis A virus (HAV), and Enteroviruses. Because they lack an envelope, they are more resistant to desiccation, detergents, and harsh environmental conditions, allowing them to survive in external environments and spread easily, especially via the fecal-oral route or respiratory droplets. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Poxvirus: Poxviruses (e.g., Variola virus, which causes smallpox) are enveloped DNA viruses, not ssRNA viruses. They are among the largest DNA viruses and replicate in the cytoplasm, unlike most DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus. (C) Retrovirus: Retroviruses (e.g., HIV, HTLV) are enveloped RNA viruses that contain single-stranded RNA but have a reverse transcriptase enzyme, allowing them to transcribe their RNA into DNA for integration into the host genome. (D) Bunyavirus: Bunyaviruses (e.g., Hantavirus, Rift Valley Fever virus) are enveloped, negative-sense ssRNA viruses that typically have a segmented genome.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Dengue fever is caused by four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) of the Dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the Flavivirus genus. Among these, DENV-2 is considered the most virulent and is more frequently associated with severe dengue (formerly called Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome). Studies have shown that DENV-2 infection leads to higher viral loads, more severe vascular leakage, and increased mortality compared to other serotypes. Additionally, individuals with secondary infection with a different serotype, especially DENV-2, after a primary infection with another serotype, are at higher risk for severe dengue due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1): While DENV-1 is widespread and can cause severe disease, it is generally less virulent than DENV-2. However, it has been associated with major outbreaks and high transmission rates in certain regions. (C) Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3): DENV-3 can cause severe disease, particularly in secondary infections, but it is usually not as virulent as DENV-2. Some studies have reported DENV-3 to be responsible for large outbreaks, but it is not the most commonly linked serotype to fatal cases. (D) Dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4): DENV-4 is generally the least virulent serotype, often associated with mild dengue fever rather than severe complications. It has lower epidemic potential compared to DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Result from genetic recombination. Antigenic shift is a major genetic change that occurs in influenza A viruses due to genetic reassortment (recombination) when two different strains infect the same host cell. This results in the formation of a new subtype with novel hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) proteins, which the human immune system has little to no prior immunity against. This process can lead to the emergence of pandemic influenza strains that spread rapidly due to a lack of pre-existing immunity in the population. A well-known example is the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which arose from the reassortment of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Occurs every 2-3 years: This statement describes antigenic drift, not antigenic shift. Antigenic shift is unpredictable and occurs less frequently, usually every few decades, leading to pandemics. In contrast, antigenic drift occurs continuously over time and leads to seasonal flu outbreaks. (B) Gradual change over time: This describes antigenic drift, which is the slow accumulation of point mutations in viral genes encoding HA and NA proteins. Antigenic shift, on the other hand, is a sudden and drastic change due to genetic reassortment. (D) Occurs in all influenza viruses: Antigenic shift occurs only in influenza A viruses because they can infect multiple species (humans, birds, pigs, etc.), allowing reassortment between different strains. Influenza B and C viruses do not undergo antigenic shift because they primarily infect humans and do not have multiple host reservoirs for reassortment.",

Coxsackie A virus spreads via fecal-oral and respiratory droplet transmission and is most commonly seen in children, especially during summer and early fall. The infection presents with sudden onset of high fever, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and small vesicles that rupture to form ulcers in the posterior oropharynx. It is self-limiting, and treatment is mainly supportive, focusing on hydration and fever management. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Rhinoviruses: Rhinoviruses are a major cause of common cold and do not typically cause vesicular or ulcerative lesions in the oropharynx. They primarily infect the nasal mucosa, leading to rhinorrhea, sneezing, and mild sore throat but not herpangina. (C) Myxovirus: The Myxovirus group includes influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses (such as measles, mumps, and parainfluenza viruses), none of which cause herpangina. Influenza viruses mainly affect the respiratory tract, while measles can cause Koplik’s spots, which are different from the vesicular lesions of herpangina. (D) Rabies virus: Rabies virus, a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, causes rabies, a fatal neurological disease, and does not present with oral vesicular lesions. Rabies symptoms include hydrophobia, agitation, and progressive paralysis, which are unrelated to herpangina.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ebola virus. Ebola virus is a member of the Filoviridae family and is one of the most well-known causes of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). It leads to Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), which is characterized by high fever, severe hemorrhagic manifestations, multi-organ failure, and high mortality rates. The virus primarily affects endothelial cells, immune cells, and hepatocytes, leading to widespread vascular damage, coagulation abnormalities, and shock. Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with body fluids (such as blood, saliva, vomit, urine, or feces) of an infected person or contaminated surfaces. Outbreaks are most common in Central and West Africa and are associated with high case fatality rates (up to 90%). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) West Nile fever: West Nile virus (WNV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus and is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites (Culex species). While it can cause encephalitis and meningitis, it is not a significant cause of hemorrhagic fever. The majority of WNV infections are asymptomatic or mild, presenting with flu-like symptoms, rash, and neurological complications in severe cases. (B) Sandfly fever: Sandfly fever, also known as Phlebotomus fever, is caused by a Bunyavirus (Toscana virus, Naples virus, and Sicilian virus) and is transmitted by sandflies (Phlebotomus species). It typically causes a self-limiting febrile illness with symptoms like fever, headache, and myalgia, but it does not cause severe hemorrhagic fever.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Retinitis because retinitis is not a classic feature of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Instead, CRS is classically associated with a triad of cataracts, congenital heart disease (CHD), and sensorineural deafness. While rubella can affect the retina, the more characteristic ocular finding is salt-and-pepper retinopathy, rather than true retinitis. Explanation of Correct Options: (A) Cataract – Correct Congenital cataracts are one of the most common manifestations of CRS. They result from viral-induced damage to the developing lens during early gestation, leading to lens opacification and visual impairment. (B) Deafness – Correct Sensorineural deafness is the most common and often the most debilitating consequence of CRS. The rubella virus affects the cochlea, leading to permanent hearing loss, which is why rubella vaccination is crucial in pregnant women. (D) CHD (Congenital Heart Disease) – Correct Congenital heart defects, particularly patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary artery stenosis, are hallmark findings of CRS. The rubella virus disrupts normal cardiovascular development in utero, leading to these defects. Explanation of Incorrect Option: (C) Retinitis – Incorrect While CRS can cause salt-and-pepper retinopathy, this is not the same as retinitis. Retinitis refers to active retinal inflammation, which is not a typical feature of CRS. Instead, the retinal changes in CRS are atrophic and pigmentary rather than inflammatory.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Retrovirus because retroviruses are the most common oncogenic RNA viruses. These viruses integrate their genetic material into the host genome via the enzyme reverse transcriptase, leading to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation, which can result in cancer development. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a well-known oncogenic retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Another example is HIV, which, although not directly oncogenic, leads to immunosuppression and increases the risk of virus-induced malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma (caused by HHV-8). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Picornavirus – Incorrect Picornaviruses are non-enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that include poliovirus, rhinovirus, and enteroviruses. These viruses do not have any known oncogenic potential. They mainly cause acute infections, such as poliomyelitis and hand-foot-mouth disease, rather than chronic oncogenic transformation. (C) Orthomyxovirus – Incorrect Orthomyxoviruses include the influenza viruses, which cause seasonal flu outbreaks. While influenza infections can lead to secondary bacterial infections and severe complications, they are not oncogenic. They lack mechanisms such as integration into the host genome that are necessary for oncogenesis. (D) Paramyxovirus – Incorrect The paramyxovirus family includes viruses such as measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus. These viruses primarily cause respiratory and systemic infections but have no known role in cancer development. Measles virus, for example, is associated with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) but not malignancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dengue Virus because Dengue virus is an enveloped virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). The presence of a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane makes Dengue virus susceptible to detergents and lipid solvents, which can disrupt its infectivity. The envelope contains E (envelope) glycoproteins, which are crucial for viral entry into host cells by binding to receptors and mediating membrane fusion. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Norwalk Virus – Incorrect Norwalk virus (now known as Norovirus) is a member of the Calicivirus family and is non-enveloped. It is a small, round, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that primarily causes acute gastroenteritis (viral diarrhea). Unlike enveloped viruses, Norovirus is highly resistant to disinfectants and harsh environmental conditions, making it difficult to eliminate from surfaces and contaminated food sources. (C) Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) – Incorrect Hepatitis A virus belongs to the Picornaviridae family (Hepatovirus genus) and is also a non-enveloped virus. It has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, commonly through contaminated food and water. Due to its lack of an envelope, HAV is resistant to bile acids and detergents, allowing it to survive in the gastrointestinal tract. (D) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenoviruses belong to the Adenoviridae family and are double-stranded DNA viruses that lack an envelope. They are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses known for causing respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. Since adenoviruses do not have a lipid envelope, they are highly resistant to disinfectants and environmental stress, making them more persistent on surfaces.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Culex Mosquito Explanation of the Correct Answer: The Culex mosquito, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus, is the primary vector of Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), which is a flavivirus responsible for Japanese Encephalitis (JE). Transmission Cycle: Culex mosquitoes become infected when they feed on birds and pigs, which serve as the natural reservoirs of JEV. The virus then multiplies within the mosquito and is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. Humans are dead-end hosts because they do not develop high enough viremia to continue the transmission cycle. Epidemiology: JEV is endemic in parts of Asia and the Western Pacific. It is more common in rural and agricultural areas, particularly where rice fields and pig farming provide ideal breeding grounds for Culex mosquitoes. Clinical Features of Japanese Encephalitis: Most infections are asymptomatic. Severe cases present with high fever, headache, vomiting, seizures, and altered mental status, potentially leading to coma and death. Neurological sequelae are common in survivors. Prevention: Mosquito control measures (eliminating breeding sites, insecticides, nets). Vaccination is available and recommended for travelers to endemic areas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Negri Bodies Explanation of the Correct Answer: Negri bodies are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions found in neurons of the central nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus (pyramidal cells) and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. They are pathognomonic for Rabies virus infection, caused by Lyssavirus (Rhabdoviridae family). Rabies Diagnosis: Negri bodies can be detected in brain tissue post-mortem using histopathology and immunofluorescence staining. Direct Fluorescent Antibody Test (DFA) is the gold standard for confirming Rabies virus in CNS tissues. RT-PCR and Serology (detecting anti-rabies antibodies in CSF) are used for antemortem diagnosis. Skin biopsy (nuchal region) and saliva testing can also help diagnose Rabies. Rabies Clinical Features: Furious Rabies: Hydrophobia, aerophobia, agitation, hypersalivation, spasms. Paralytic Rabies: Flaccid paralysis, confusion, coma, death. Once symptoms appear, rabies is nearly 100% fatal. Treatment & Prevention: No effective treatment once symptoms appear. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): Rabies vaccine + Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) if exposure is severe. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): Rabies vaccine for high-risk groups (veterinarians, animal handlers). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Guarneri Bodies – Incorrect Guarneri bodies are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions seen in smallpox (Variola virus) infections. These inclusions are found in epithelial cells of skin lesions in smallpox. (C) Cowdry A Bodies – Incorrect Cowdry A bodies are intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions seen in Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) infections. Found in infected cells of the brain and skin lesions, they are NOT associated with Rabies. (D) Cowdry B Bodies – Incorrect Cowdry B bodies are basophilic intranuclear inclusions seen in Poliovirus and Adenovirus infections.

It is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, specifically: Aedes aegypti (urban areas) Aedes albopictus (rural and semi-urban areas) The virus causes Chikungunya fever, which is characterized by: High fever, polyarthritis/polyarthralgia (often severe and persistent), maculopapular rash, and myalgia. Joint pain can last for weeks to months, mimicking rheumatoid arthritis. There is no specific antiviral treatment; management is supportive with hydration, analgesics, and rest. Prevention relies on mosquito control measures and personal protective measures. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Yellow fever is endemic in India – Incorrect Yellow fever virus (YFV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus and is transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. It is NOT endemic in India because India has strict quarantine and vaccination policies preventing its spread. Yellow fever is endemic in Africa and South America. Travelers to endemic areas must get the yellow fever vaccine (live-attenuated 17D strain). (B) Dengue has only one serotype – Incorrect Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus and has four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity to that serotype but not to the others. Secondary infection with a different serotype increases the risk of severe dengue (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome) due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). (C) KFD was first identified in West Bengal – Incorrect Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the KFD virus (KFDV), a Flavivirus. It was first identified in 1957 in Karnataka (Kyasanur Forest, Western Ghats, India), not in West Bengal. KFD is transmitted by Haemaphysalis ticks and is associated with monkeys as reservoir hosts. Prevention includes the KFD vaccine and tick bite precautions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Rotavirus Explanation of the Correct Answer: Rotavirus belongs to the Reoviridae family and is a segmented, double-stranded RNA virus. Genetic reassortment occurs in viruses that have segmented genomes, where segments from different strains can mix when co-infection happens in the same host cell. This process leads to the emergence of new viral strains, which can contribute to antigenic shift and increased virulence. Rotavirus has an 11-segmented genome, making it capable of genetic reassortment when two different strains infect the same cell. This reassortment plays a significant role in the evolution of rotaviruses, leading to new antigenic variants that may escape immune detection. Rotavirus is a major cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, leading to dehydration and hospitalization. The development of live-attenuated vaccines (Rotarix, RotaTeq) has been instrumental in reducing the disease burden. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Hepadnavirus – Incorrect Hepadnaviruses, such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), have a partially double-stranded DNA genome and do not undergo genetic reassortment. HBV undergoes reverse transcription but does not have a segmented genome required for reassortment. (B) Parvovirus – Incorrect Parvoviruses, including Parvovirus B19, have a single-stranded DNA genome and do not have segments, meaning reassortment is not possible. Instead of reassortment, parvoviruses replicate using host cell DNA polymerase. (D) Astrovirus – Incorrect Astroviruses are non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, meaning they cannot undergo reassortment. They primarily cause mild gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised individuals.-",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Poliovirus Explanation of the Correct Answer: Chlorination is a widely used method for disinfecting water, effectively killing or inactivating most bacteria and many viruses. However, poliovirus is highly resistant to chlorination, requiring higher doses and longer exposure times to be completely inactivated. Enteroviruses, including poliovirus, have a strong protein coat (capsid) that makes them more resistant to chlorination compared to other microorganisms. Standard chlorination levels used in drinking water treatment may not always be sufficient to eliminate poliovirus. Additional water purification steps, such as filtration or ultraviolet (UV) treatment, may be needed to ensure complete removal. Thus, poliovirus is not effectively eliminated by normal chlorination, making option (D) the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Salmonella – Incorrect Salmonella is a gram-negative bacterium that is highly sensitive to chlorination. Even at standard chlorine levels used in water treatment, Salmonella is effectively killed, making chlorination an important control measure for preventing typhoid fever and salmonellosis. (B) Shigella – Incorrect Shigella, another gram-negative bacterial pathogen, is also highly susceptible to chlorination. Proper chlorination in water systems effectively destroys Shigella, reducing the risk of shigellosis (bacillary dysentery) outbreaks. (C) HIV – Incorrect HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is an enveloped RNA virus, making it extremely sensitive to disinfectants, including chlorine. Even low levels of chlorine are enough to completely inactivate HIV, preventing transmission through water sources.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rotavirus Explanation of the Correct Answer: Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. Rotavirus primarily affects children aged 6 months to 2 years and is a major cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants. It is a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Reoviridae family and spreads through the fecal-oral route. Clinical Features: Watery diarrhea (without blood or mucus). Vomiting and fever (common initial symptoms). Severe dehydration (leading to hospitalization in many cases). Pathogenesis: The virus infects and destroys the intestinal villi, leading to malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea. It also produces the NSP4 enterotoxin, which increases chloride secretion and further contributes to diarrhea. Diagnosis: Rapid antigen detection test (ELISA) in stool RT-PCR for viral RNA detection Prevention: Rotavirus vaccine (part of routine immunization in many countries) Improved sanitation and handwashing Thus, Rotavirus is the most likely cause of diarrhea in this 9-month-old infant presenting with dehydration. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Entamoeba histolytica – Incorrect Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic dysentery, which is more common in older children and adults rather than infants. It typically causes bloody diarrhea with mucus (dysentery) rather than watery diarrhea. It is a protozoan parasite transmitted via contaminated water or food. Complications: Amoebic liver abscess Ulceration of the intestinal mucosa Since this infant has watery diarrhea without blood, E. histolytica is unlikely. (C) Giardia lamblia – Incorrect Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes chronic diarrhea rather than acute, severe dehydration. Symptoms: Foul-smelling, greasy stools (steatorrhea) Malabsorption and weight loss No fever or severe dehydration More common in older children and adults, especially those exposed to contaminated water. Since the infant has acute diarrhea with dehydration, Giardia is not the most likely cause. (D) Shigella – Incorrect Shigella causes bacterial dysentery (Shigellosis), which is characterized by: Bloody, mucus-containing diarrhea (not purely watery diarrhea). Severe abdominal cramps and high fever. It is more common in toddlers and preschool children rather than infants. Shigella invades the colonic mucosa, leading to inflammation and tissue destruction. Complications: Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (especially with Shigella dysenteriae). Since this infant has watery diarrhea with dehydration (not bloody diarrhea), Shigella is unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Central Nervous System Explanation of the Correct Answer: Echoviruses are members of the Enterovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. These viruses are cytopathogenic (meaning they cause cell damage) and primarily affect the central nervous system (CNS). They are one of the leading causes of aseptic meningitis, especially in children. Other neurological manifestations include encephalitis and paralysis, though these are less common. Echoviruses spread through the fecal-oral route and initially replicate in the gastrointestinal tract before spreading systemically via the bloodstream (viremia), allowing CNS invasion. Thus, echoviruses primarily infect the CNS, making option (C) the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Bladder and urinary tract – Incorrect Echoviruses do not have a primary affinity for the bladder or urinary tract. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are typically caused by bacteria such as E. coli and not by enteroviruses. (B) Blood and lymphatic system – Incorrect While echoviruses do enter the bloodstream (viremia) to reach target organs, they do not primarily infect or replicate in the blood or lymphatic system. Their main targets are the CNS, heart (myocarditis), skin (rash), and GI tract. (D) Respiratory system – Incorrect Echoviruses do not primarily target the respiratory system.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Is preventable by immunization Explanation of the Correct Answer: Mumps is caused by the Mumps virus, a Paramyxovirus that spreads via respiratory droplets and primarily affects the parotid glands. Infection is characterized by fever, malaise, and painful parotitis. Mumps is preventable through immunization with the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine, which contains a live attenuated form of the virus. The MMR vaccine is administered in two doses (first at 12-15 months, second at 4-6 years), providing long-lasting immunity. Due to widespread vaccination, mumps has become rare in many parts of the world. Thus, vaccination is the key preventive measure, making option (C) the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Is apt to recur periodically in many affected persons – Incorrect Mumps does not typically recur because infection (or vaccination) induces long-lasting immunity. Unlike herpesviruses, which establish latency and reactivate periodically, mumps does not persist in the body after infection. (B) Is maintained by a large canine reservoir – Incorrect Mumps is a human-specific virus and has no animal reservoir, including dogs or other canines. The virus spreads exclusively from human to human via respiratory droplets. (D) Usually produces severe systemic manifestations – Incorrect Mumps is usually self-limiting and resolves without complications. However, in some cases, it can cause complications like orchitis (testicular inflammation in males), meningitis, pancreatitis, and deafness. Despite potential complications, severe systemic disease is not the norm. (E) Belongs to Orthomyxovirus – Incorrect The Mumps virus belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. Orthomyxoviruses include Influenza viruses, which have a different genetic structure (segmented RNA genome) and a different mode of replication.",

Characteristic features of croup include: Inspiratory stridor (a harsh, high-pitched sound due to airway obstruction) Barking cough (often compared to a seal’s bark) Hoarseness due to vocal cord inflammation \"Steeple sign\" on X-ray (narrowing of the subglottic region of the trachea) Parainfluenza virus is the leading cause of viral croup in young children, making it the correct answer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Adenovirus – Incorrect Adenoviruses cause respiratory infections, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis, but they are not the primary cause of croup. Unlike Parainfluenza virus, Adenovirus does not typically cause the barking cough and stridor seen in croup. (B) Group B Coxsackievirus – Incorrect Group B Coxsackieviruses are known to cause pleurodynia (Bornholm disease), myocarditis, and pericarditis, rather than croup. Coxsackievirus A, not Group B, is associated with herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. (D & E) Rhinovirus – Incorrect Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold and can cause upper respiratory infections. However, it does not typically cause croup, as it does not induce significant laryngotracheal inflammation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vaccination offers lifelong protection Explanation of the Correct Answer: Influenza A virus is known for its high genetic variability, which makes lifelong protection from a single vaccination impossible. The influenza vaccine needs to be updated annually due to: Antigenic drift – Small genetic mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins lead to gradual changes, making previous immunity ineffective over time. Antigenic shift – A sudden and major genetic reassortment in the virus, creating a completely new strain that can lead to pandemics. Because of these changes, influenza vaccines provide only temporary protection (typically for one flu season), and annual vaccination is recommended. Hence, option (C) is incorrect and is the correct answer to this \"except\" question. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) May cause antigenic shift and antigenic drift – Correct ? Influenza A virus undergoes both: Antigenic drift – Minor genetic mutations occur frequently, leading to seasonal flu outbreaks. Antigenic shift – A major genetic reassortment between different influenza strains (often between human and animal strains), which can result in pandemics (e.g., H1N1 in 2009). Since Influenza A is the only type capable of antigenic shift, this statement is correct. (B) May cause pandemics – Correct ? Influenza A is responsible for all major flu pandemics due to its ability to undergo antigenic shift. Examples include: 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1) 1957 Asian flu (H2N2) **1968 Hong Kong flu (H3",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) May be prevented by vaccination. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections are not effectively prevented by a universally available vaccine. While monoclonal antibodies such as Palivizumab are available for high-risk infants to prevent severe RSV infections, they are not traditional vaccines that induce long-term immunity. Several RSV vaccines are under development, but they are not yet widely available for routine immunization. This makes option C the correct exception. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) May cause bronchiolitis – Correct RSV is a leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children. It infects the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation, mucus production, and airway obstruction, leading to difficulty in breathing, wheezing, and cough. (B) Is an RNA virus – Correct RSV is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. Like other RNA viruses, it relies on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for replication. (D) Belongs to Paramyxovirus – Correct RSV is classified under the Paramyxoviridae family, Pneumoviridae subfamily, along with other respiratory pathogens like human metapneumovirus. It shares structural and replication characteristics with other paramyxoviruses, such as fusion proteins that facilitate viral entry into host cells.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Rotaviruses. Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute infantile diarrhea worldwide, particularly in children under 5 years of age, with the highest incidence in infants between 6 months and 2 years old. It is a double-stranded RNA virus from the Reoviridae family and is highly contagious, spreading primarily through the fecal-oral route. Rotavirus infects and damages the small intestinal villi, leading to malabsorption and secretory diarrhea due to the action of NSP4 enterotoxin, which increases chloride secretion. The illness typically presents with watery diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, and can lead to severe dehydration, which is a major cause of childhood mortality in developing countries. Vaccination (e.g., Rotarix, RotaTeq) has significantly reduced its burden, but outbreaks still occur. Incorrect options: (A) Enteroviruses – Incorrect. Enteroviruses (e.g., Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, Poliovirus) are members of the Picornaviridae family and primarily cause illnesses such as herpangina, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, viral meningitis, and myocarditis. While some enteroviruses can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, they are not the leading cause of acute infantile diarrhea. (C) Noroviruses – Incorrect. Noroviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis, especially in older children and adults. They are responsible for outbreaks in closed communities (e.g., cruise ships, schools, nursing homes). Although norovirus can cause diarrhea in infants, rotavirus remains the predominant cause in this age group. (D) Enteric adenoviruses – Incorrect. Enteric adenoviruses (types 40 and 41) can cause diarrhea in children, but they are a less common cause compared to rotavirus. Adenovirus-related diarrhea is typically less severe and prolonged compared to rotavirus and lacks the characteristic seasonal outbreaks associated with rotavirus infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) NS1 Antigen detection. In dengue infection, NS1 (Non-Structural Protein 1) antigen detection is the preferred test for diagnosing dengue within the first 5 days of illness (acute phase). NS1 is a viral protein secreted into the bloodstream by actively replicating dengue virus, making it an early marker of infection. It is detectable in serum from day 1 to day 5 before the appearance of antibodies. NS1 antigen ELISA or rapid immunochromatographic (ICT) tests are commonly used for early dengue diagnosis. Incorrect options: (B) MAC ELISA – Incorrect. MAC ELISA detects IgM antibodies against dengue, which typically appear after 4–5 days of illness. Since it is an antibody-based test, it is not useful for very early detection in the first few days of infection. (C) ICT test to detect IgM – Incorrect. IgM detection by ICT (Immunochromatographic Test) is similar to MAC ELISA in that it detects IgM antibodies. Since IgM levels rise after 5 days of infection, this test is not useful for early diagnosis. (D) None of the above – Incorrect. NS1 antigen detection is the best option for early dengue diagnosis, so choosing \"None of the above\" would be incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) It is due to immunity selection to the group of viruses existing in the community. Antigenic drift is a gradual, continuous process that occurs due to point mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the influenza virus. These mutations accumulate over time due to immune pressure from the host population, allowing the virus to evade pre-existing immunity and cause seasonal epidemics. Since antigenic drift involves minor genetic changes, it leads to gradual changes in the viral antigens, necessitating frequent updates to seasonal flu vaccines. Incorrect options: (A) It occurs once in 10-20 years – Incorrect. Antigenic drift is a continuous and gradual process occurring every year, leading to small changes in the virus. In contrast, antigenic shift (a different mechanism) occurs at irregular intervals (often 10-20 years) and leads to major changes. (B) It is responsible for pandemics – Incorrect. Antigenic drift leads to seasonal epidemics, not pandemics. Pandemics occur due to antigenic shift, which involves the introduction of a novel influenza strain to which the human population has little or no immunity. (C) It is seen only in influenza type A virus – Incorrect. Antigenic drift occurs in both influenza A and influenza B viruses, as both undergo gradual mutations in their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. However, only influenza A undergoes antigenic shift, which is responsible for pandemics. (D) Results from genetic recombination of human with animal – Incorrect. Genetic recombination between human and animal influenza strains is a feature of antigenic shift, not antigenic drift. Antigenic shift occurs when a new subtype of influenza A emerges from reassortment between human and animal (e.g., avian, swine) influenza strains, leading to pandemics.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is transmitted by ticks. Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV), a Flavivirus. It is endemic to India, particularly in the forested regions of Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. The primary vector responsible for transmitting KFD is ticks, mainly Haemaphysalis spinigera. The disease is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks and can also spread through contact with infected animals such as monkeys, rodents, and cattle. The symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, bleeding tendencies, and neurological complications in severe cases. Incorrect options: (A) Yellow fever is endemic in India – Incorrect. Yellow fever, caused by the Yellow Fever Virus (a Flavivirus) and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is not endemic in India. While it is prevalent in Africa and South America, India has never reported a case of yellow fever due to strict vaccination and quarantine regulations for travelers from endemic areas. (B) Dengue virus has only one serotype – Incorrect. Dengue virus (DENV) actually has four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity against that specific serotype but only partial and temporary protection against the others. Subsequent infections with a different serotype can lead to severe complications, including Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). (D) Mosquito of Culex vishnui complex is the vector of dengue fever – Incorrect. Dengue fever is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, not Culex mosquitoes. Culex vishnui complex (Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex vishnui, and Culex pseudovishnui) is responsible for Japanese Encephalitis (JE) transmission. (E) Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by Aedes – Incorrect. Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), a Flavivirus, is transmitted primarily by Culex mosquitoes, especially Culex tritaeniorhynchus, not Aedes. JEV is endemic in many parts of Asia, including India, and causes viral encephalitis, leading to neurological complications in severe cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Japanese B encephalitis because human-to-human transmission is not seen in this disease. Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus, which is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes (especially Culex tritaeniorhynchus). Humans are dead-end hosts, meaning that even if an infected mosquito bites a human, the virus does not reach high enough levels in human blood to allow further transmission to another mosquito. Hence, JBE does not spread from one human to another. Incorrect Options: (A) SARS – Incorrect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS-CoV coronavirus, spreads readily from human to human through respiratory droplets, close contact, and contaminated surfaces (fomites). (C) H5N1 – Incorrect H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that primarily infects birds. However, limited human-to-human transmission has been reported in close-contact settings, such as family clusters. The risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low, but it is still possible.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bat because the natural reservoir of the Hendra virus (HeV) is fruit bats (flying foxes) of the Pteropodidae family. Hendra virus is a zoonotic paramyxovirus that was first identified in 1994 in Australia. While bats do not show symptoms of the disease, they shed the virus in their urine, saliva, feces, and birthing fluids, which can contaminate the environment and infect other animals, particularly horses. Horses serve as an intermediate host and can transmit the virus to humans through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. Human infections are rare but can be fatal, causing severe respiratory and neurological diseases. Incorrect Options: (A) Horse – Incorrect Horses are not the natural reservoir of Hendra virus; they act as an intermediate host. The virus spreads from bats to horses and then may be transmitted to humans through close contact. (B) Man – Incorrect Humans are accidental hosts and can contract the infection through contact with infected horses, but they do not act as a reservoir for the virus. (D) Pig – Incorrect Pigs are not associated with Hendra virus transmission. However, a closely related virus, Nipah virus, also found in bats, has been transmitted through pigs in past outbreaks. (E) Duck – Incorrect Ducks and other birds are not involved in Hendra virus transmission or reservoir maintenance. The virus is primarily bat-borne with secondary transmission through horses.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) There is a single serotype causing infection, which is incorrect. Poliovirus has three distinct serotypes: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Each serotype is antigenically different, meaning infection with one serotype does not provide immunity against the others. Among them, Type 1 is the most commonly associated with paralytic polio, while Type 2 has been eradicated globally. The presence of multiple serotypes makes vaccine development and immunization efforts more complex, requiring trivalent or bivalent vaccines for protection against all circulating strains. Incorrect Options (True Statements): (A) Poliovirus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route – True Poliovirus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, especially in areas with poor sanitation. The virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract, spreads through contaminated food, water, or hands, and can then reach the central nervous system, leading to poliomyelitis. (B) Asymptomatic infections are common in children – True The majority of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic, particularly in children. Only about 1% of cases progress to paralytic poliomyelitis, while most individuals develop immunity without noticeable symptoms. Some may experience mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, or gastrointestinal upset. (D) Live attenuated vaccine produces herd immunity – True The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), a live attenuated vaccine, induces both mucosal and systemic immunity. By replicating in the intestines, it helps prevent viral shedding and transmission, thereby providing herd immunity. This is a key advantage over the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which primarily provides individual protection without stopping transmission as effectively.",

Enteroviruses belong to the Picornaviridae family and primarily cause diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, heart, and respiratory system. While enteroviruses can cause a wide range of clinical syndromes, they are not typically associated with hemorrhagic fever. Hemorrhagic fevers are caused by viruses such as Dengue virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lassa virus, which primarily lead to vascular leakage, bleeding tendencies, and multi-organ failure, unlike enteroviruses. Incorrect Options (True Statements): (A) Myocarditis – True Enteroviruses, particularly Coxsackie B virus, are well-known causes of viral myocarditis, which leads to inflammation of the heart muscle. It can present with chest pain, arrhythmias, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death, especially in young adults. (B) Pleurodynia – True Also known as Bornholm disease or Devil’s grip, pleurodynia is caused by Coxsackie B virus. It presents with severe, sudden-onset chest or abdominal pain, worsened by breathing or movement, and is due to inflammation of the intercostal muscles and pleura. (C) Herpangina – True Herpangina is a viral illness caused by Coxsackie A virus, characterized by painful vesicular lesions in the oropharynx, fever, and sore throat. It primarily affects children and is highly contagious.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inactivated vaccine given I/M. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is given via the intramuscular (I/M) or subcutaneous (S/C) route. It contains killed poliovirus strains of all three serotypes and is used in many countries as part of routine immunization programs. IPV induces systemic immunity by stimulating the production of serum antibodies, which prevent the virus from spreading to the central nervous system and causing paralysis. It is an important component of polio eradication efforts, especially in areas where the oral polio vaccine (OPV) carries the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus. Incorrect Options (False Statements): (A) Most cases are symptomatic – False Contrary to this statement, most polio infections are asymptomatic. Approximately 90-95% of polio cases are subclinical, meaning infected individuals do not show symptoms. Only 1% of cases progress to paralytic polio, while the remaining cases may have mild flu-like symptoms. (C) Inactivated polio vaccines are given to children less than 3 years of age – False IPV is part of childhood immunization schedules, but it is not exclusively given to children under 3 years. It is administered as a series of doses (at 2, 4, and 6–18 months, followed by a booster at 4–6 years) and can also be given to adults in high-risk situations. (D) Only one type exists – False There are three serotypes of poliovirus (Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3). While Type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015, and Type 3 in 2019, Type 1 still circulates in some regions. This diversity is why polio vaccines must contain all three serotypes to ensure full protection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Explanation for the Correct Answer: The most likely causative agent in this case is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as the patient's presentation suggests malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa (MOE), a severe infection of the external auditory canal that extends to the skull base. Risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus and immunocompromised states. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen responsible for MOE, accounting for more than 90% of cases. The infection typically presents with severe ear pain, purulent otorrhea, and tenderness over the mastoid. If untreated, it can progress to osteomyelitis of the skull base and cranial nerve involvement. Due to its strong virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, and ability to thrive in moist environments, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of severe external ear infections in elderly diabetic patients. Explanation for Incorrect Options: (A) Haemophilus influenzae – Incorrect H. influenzae is a common cause of otitis media in children but not malignant otitis externa. It is usually associated with upper respiratory tract infections and is not the primary pathogen in diabetic patients with severe ear infections. (B) Klebsiella pneumoniae – Incorrect Klebsiella pneumoniae is more commonly associated with pneumonia and urinary tract infections. It is not a typical cause of malignant otitis externa. (C) Mucor spp. – Incorrect Mucor species cause mucormycosis, an opportunistic fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. Although diabetic patients are at risk for rhinocerebral mucormycosis, the typical presentation includes facial necrosis, sinus involvement, and black eschar, not ear pain and purulent drainage. Fungal infections like mucormycosis do not typically cause MOE.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: (B) Mumps virus. Mumps virus, a paramyxovirus, is the causative agent of mumps, a viral infection that primarily affects the salivary glands, especially the parotid glands. The hallmark of mumps is painful parotitis, which presents as unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid glands accompanied by fever, headache, and malaise. Since this patient was unvaccinated, she was susceptible to the infection, as the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine provides effective protection. A notable complication of mumps in postpubertal individuals is oophoritis (in females) or orchitis (in males), which presents with pelvic pain and tenderness in females, as seen in this patient. Other complications include meningitis, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Cytomegalovirus (CMV): CMV infection can cause fever, malaise, and organ involvement, but it does not typically cause parotitis or oophoritis. In immunocompromised individuals, CMV can lead to retinitis, pneumonia, or hepatitis, none of which are described in this case. (C) Rabies virus: Rabies presents with severe neurological symptoms such as hydrophobia, agitation, hypersalivation, and paralysis, rather than parotid swelling and pelvic pain. Rabies is transmitted through animal bites and has a long incubation period, making it an unlikely cause in this case. (D) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): RSV primarily affects the respiratory tract, causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children. It does not cause parotid gland swelling or oophoritis, making it an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dengue fever virus. Dengue fever virus has not been implicated in the development of human cancer. Dengue primarily causes acute febrile illness with symptoms like fever, rash, muscle pain, and sometimes hemorrhagic complications. It does not have a known link to oncogenesis or the development of cancer in humans. Therefore, it is the exception in this list of viruses that are associated with cancer. Incorrect Options: (B) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with several types of human cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and stomach cancer. EBV is a herpesvirus that can immortalize infected B cells and has been implicated in the development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, it is correctly included as a virus linked to cancer. (C) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a well-established carcinogen and is strongly linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary liver cancer. Chronic infection with HBV can lead to liver cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer. The HBV virus integrates into the host genome, promoting mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Hence, HBV is rightly listed as a cancer-causing virus. (D) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is also associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in individuals with chronic HCV infection. Chronic inflammation caused by HCV infection can lead to liver cirrhosis, which is a precursor to liver cancer. Therefore, HCV is correctly identified as a cancer-causing virus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) It will decrease the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia. The varicella-zoster vaccine (also known as the shingles vaccine) is recommended for adults over the age of 60 to reduce the risk of shingles (herpes zoster) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a debilitating nerve pain that can persist for months or years after a shingles outbreak. Studies have shown that vaccination significantly lowers the incidence of PHN by about 67%, making it an essential preventive measure for older adults. Incorrect Options: (A) It is a killed virus vaccine, so it is safe in immunocompromised patients Incorrect. The traditional zoster vaccine (Zostavax) is a live-attenuated virus vaccine, meaning it contains a weakened form of the virus. Live vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, as they can cause disseminated infection. However, the newer Shingrix vaccine is a recombinant (non-live) vaccine and is safe for use in immunocompromised individuals. (B) It is not recommended for patients in this age group Incorrect. The CDC and other health authorities recommend the varicella-zoster vaccine for individuals aged 50 and older, with a strong recommendation for those over 60 to help prevent shingles and its complications. (D) It will not decrease the risk of developing shingles Incorrect. The shingles vaccine significantly reduces the risk of developing shingles. The live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax) reduces the risk by about 50%, while the new recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) is more than 90% effective in preventing shingles.",

Rhinoviruses are the most common virus causing the common cold and are found in about 50% of cases. The second most commonly isolated viruses are coronaviruses. These viruses are more common in the late fall, winter, and early spring, primarily at times when rhinoviruses are less active. Other causes of common cold in children are adenoviruses, whereas these viruses are uncommon in adults with the exception of outbreaks in individuals living in close quarters such as military recruits. Although human respiratory syncytial virus characteristically causes pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young children, the virus can cause common cold and pharyngitis in adults. Parainfluenza virus is another virus classically associated with croup in children, but it causes common cold in adults. Enteroviruses most often cause an undifferentiated febrile illness.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The majority of influenza infections are clinically mild and self-limited. Treatment with overthe-counter cough suppressants and analgesics such as acetaminophen is often adequate. Patients who are younger than the age of 18 years are at risk of developing Reye’s syndrome if they are exposed to salicylates such as aspirin. The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir have activity against influenza A and B. They can be used within 2 days of symptom onset and have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms by 1 or 2 days. This patient has had symptoms for more than 48 hours, so neither drug is likely to be effective. The patient’s history of asthma is an additional contraindication to zanamivir because this drug can precipitate bronchospasm. The M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine have activity against influenza A only. However, since 2005, more than 90% of A/H3N2 viral isolates demonstrated resistance to amantadine, and these drugs are no longer recommended for use in influenza A.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Incubation period is typically 5 to 7 days. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Norwalk virus (Norovirus) is one of the leading causes of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide. However, the statement that its incubation period is typically 5 to 7 days is incorrect. The incubation period for Norovirus is much shorter, typically 12 to 48 hours, rather than 5 to 7 days. This short incubation period contributes to the rapid spread of outbreaks, particularly in closed environments like cruise ships, schools, and nursing homes. Symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea, usually last for 1 to 3 days and resolve without long-term complications. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Fever is common Correct statement. Although Norovirus infection is primarily characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, low-grade fever is commonly observed in infected individuals. Other systemic symptoms such as headache, malaise, and myalgias can also occur. (C) Infection is common worldwide Correct statement. Norovirus is a highly infectious virus and is responsible for millions of cases of gastroenteritis globally each year. It is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, contaminated food or water, and direct person-to-person contact. Hand hygiene and proper sanitation are essential for prevention. (D) It is a major cause of nonbacterial diarrhea outbreaks in the United States Correct statement. Norovirus is one of the most common causes of viral gastroenteritis in the United States and is responsible for a significant number of foodborne illness outbreaks. It is particularly notorious for causing outbreaks in crowded settings, such as daycare centers, hospitals, cruise ships, and military barracks.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Enteroviruses are not transmitted via blood transfusions and insect bites. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Enteroviruses, which include poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, enteroviruses, and echoviruses, are primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route or through respiratory droplets. They are not typically transmitted via blood transfusions or insect bites, making option B correct. Enteroviruses are found in the gastrointestinal tract and can spread through contaminated water or food and close contact with an infected person. Transmission through blood transfusions and insect bites is not a recognized or common route for enteroviral infections. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Among children infected with poliovirus, paralysis is common. Incorrect. While poliovirus can cause paralysis, especially in severe cases, the majority of individuals infected with poliovirus do not develop paralysis. It is estimated that only about 0.5% to 1% of poliovirus infections lead to paralytic disease. Most infections are asymptomatic or cause mild flu-like symptoms. Thus, paralysis is not common among children infected with poliovirus. (C) In utero exposure to maternal enteroviral antibodies is not protective. Incorrect. In fact, maternal antibodies to enteroviruses, acquired during pregnancy, do provide some protection to the fetus and newborn. These antibodies can help protect the infant in the early months of life, before their own immune system is fully developed. The presence of maternal antibodies can reduce the severity or likelihood of infection, especially in the first few months after birth. (D) Infections are most common in adolescents and adults, although serious illness is most common in young children. Incorrect. Enterovirus infections are actually more common in young children, especially infants and toddlers, as they have not yet developed immunity to these viruses. While serious illness can occur in young children, including conditions like viral meningitis or myocarditis, enterovirus infections are prevalent in both children and adults. However, the severity of illness tends to be more pronounced in infants and young children, especially those with compromised immune systems.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Clean the wound with a 20% soap solution, administer tetanus toxoid, administer human rabies immune globulin IM, and administer human diploid cell vaccine. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Rabies is a potentially fatal viral infection that is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, typically via bites. Bats, along with foxes and skunks, are known carriers of rabies, making the potential exposure in this case concerning. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies consists of a combination of rabies immune globulin (RIG) and a series of rabies vaccinations to prevent the onset of the disease after an exposure. In this case, the patient was bitten by a bat, an animal associated with rabies in the region, and has not received prior rabies vaccination. Given the risk of rabies transmission, the patient should receive human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) for immediate passive immunity, along with the human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) for active immunity. The wound should also be thoroughly cleaned to reduce the risk of infection. Additionally, tetanus toxoid is indicated because the patient is unsure of her vaccination history and the wound was caused by an animal bite, which can introduce tetanus spores. Tetanus prophylaxis is essential for all animal bite wounds. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Clean the wound with a 20% soap solution. Incorrect. While cleaning the wound is necessary, it is insufficient by itself to address the potential rabies exposure. The patient requires both rabies immune globulin and the rabies vaccination in addition to wound cleaning. This answer overlooks the critical need for rabies PEP. (B) Clean the wound with a 20% soap solution and administer tetanus toxoid. Incorrect. This option only addresses wound care and tetanus prophylaxis, but it does not address the rabies exposure. Rabies is a life-threatening condition, and post-exposure prophylaxis (including both HRIG and the rabies vaccine) is critical after a potential exposure to rabid animals. (C) Clean the wound with a 20% soap solution, administer tetanus toxoid, and administer human rabies immune globulin intramuscularly. Incorrect. While this option includes rabies immune globulin, it does not include the rabies vaccine itself. For rabies prophylaxis, both the HRIG and the rabies vaccine are required to provide appropriate post-exposure treatment. Administering just the HRIG, without the vaccine, would be incomplete prophylaxis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) After resolution, he has lifelong immunity. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The patient described is likely suffering from dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV). While dengue fever typically results in immunity against the infecting serotype, this immunity is not lifelong. Dengue virus has four distinct serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4), and infection with one serotype provides immunity only against that specific serotype. Subsequent infections with a different serotype can lead to more severe forms of the disease, including hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome due to immune enhancement (antibody-dependent enhancement). Therefore, the statement that \"he has lifelong immunity\" is incorrect. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) A second infection could result in hemorrhagic fever. Correct. A second infection with a different serotype of dengue virus can indeed lead to more severe forms of the disease, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The phenomenon is due to antibody-dependent enhancement, where pre-existing antibodies from a prior infection enhance the entry of the virus into cells, potentially leading to more severe disease. (C) IgM ELISA may be diagnostic. Correct. An IgM ELISA is often used for diagnosing dengue fever, especially early in the infection. The IgM antibodies appear in the blood within 4-5 days of infection and remain detectable for about 2-3 months, making it a useful diagnostic tool in the acute phase of the disease. (D) In equatorial areas, year-round transmission occurs. Correct. Dengue fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including equatorial areas like Southeast Asia, where transmission occurs year-round due to the presence of Aedes mosquitoes (the vector for the dengue virus), which are active throughout the year in these climates. (E) The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes. Correct. Dengue virus is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. The mosquitoes become infected when they bite a person already infected with the virus, and they can then spread the virus to other individuals.",

      "solution": "Correct answer (D) Rabies virus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The symptoms described—high fever, rigidity, difficulty swallowing liquids, drooling, disorientation, and rapid progression to death—are classic signs of rabies. The fact that the ornithologist was bitten by an unusually aggressive bat in a region where rabies is endemic strongly suggests the diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of Negri bodies on postmortem biopsy of the brain is pathognomonic for rabies infection, confirming the viral cause. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, and bats, especially in South America, are known to be common vectors of the disease. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) California encephalitis virus. Incorrect. California encephalitis virus typically causes febrile illness, headache, and encephalitis, but it does not present with the characteristic rapid neurological decline, rigidity, difficulty swallowing, or drooling seen in rabies. The lack of Negri bodies and the presence of a bat bite further differentiate California encephalitis from rabies. (B) Hantaan virus. Incorrect. Hantaan virus causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), which presents with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and kidney dysfunction, rather than the neurological symptoms described in this case. There is no association with bat bites, and Negri bodies would not be present. Hantaan virus is transmitted via rodent urine and feces, not through bat bites. (C) Ebola virus. Incorrect. Ebola virus infection can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and hemorrhagic symptoms, but it does not cause the neurological signs seen in this case, such as rigidity, difficulty swallowing, and drooling. Ebola also tends to cause more generalized hemorrhagic features, and while it can be fatal, it does not lead to the rapid onset of neurological signs seen in rabies. Furthermore, Ebola is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, not bat bites.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Lyssavirus The most likely causative agent in this case is Lyssavirus, specifically the rabies virus. The patient's symptoms, including mental confusion, malaise, headache, fever, and progressive body pain, strongly suggest an evolving neurological disease. The history of a dog bite with subsequent behavioral changes is highly suggestive of rabies, a disease caused by Lyssavirus. Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to encephalitis and ultimately death if untreated. A key feature of rabies is the presence of a strong CD8+ T cell response, which is consistent with the lab findings in this case. The virus travels retrogradely via peripheral nerves to the CNS, leading to symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations, hydrophobia, and ultimately coma. Without prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), rabies is nearly always fatal. Incorrect Options: (A) Papillomavirus – This virus primarily causes skin and mucosal infections, such as warts and cervical cancer (HPV-16, HPV-18). It does not cause encephalitis, fever, or a strong CD8+ T cell response, nor is it associated with animal bites. (B) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) – CMV can cause encephalitis, but it is more commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients. CMV encephalitis does not present with a history of an animal bite or such a strong CD8+ response. (C) Coxsackievirus – This enterovirus can cause viral meningitis, encephalitis, and myositis, but it is typically associated with outbreaks in children and does not have a strong link to animal bites. Additionally, it does not typically cause the profound neurological deterioration seen in rabies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) The most likely cause of this infant’s severe respiratory infection is human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). hMPV is a major cause of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in infants, young children, and immunocompromised individuals. The child presents with fever, rhinorrhea, cough, dyspnea, and wheezing, which are hallmark symptoms of viral bronchiolitis or pneumonia. RSV is the most common cause of severe bronchiolitis in infants, but in this case, multiple tests for RSV and other common respiratory viruses were negative, making hMPV the most likely culprit. hMPV presents similarly to RSV and is often misdiagnosed due to limited routine testing availability. Premature infants are at higher risk for severe respiratory infections due to immature lung development and weaker immune defenses. hMPV typically causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections, with symptoms ranging from mild colds to severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation, as seen in this case. Thus, hMPV is the best answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) – Incorrect. CMV is a herpesvirus that can cause congenital infections and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts, but it is not a common cause of acute respiratory failure in otherwise healthy infants. CMV pneumonia is usually chronic, affecting premature neonates and immunosuppressed individuals, such as transplant recipients. The acute presentation in this case is more suggestive of hMPV rather than CMV. (B) HSV type 1 – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can cause severe respiratory disease, but this is rare in immunocompetent children. Neonatal HSV infections usually present with encephalitis, disseminated disease, or skin/mucosal lesions, rather than isolated severe respiratory distress. Additionally, no mention of vesicular skin lesions or maternal HSV infection was provided, making HSV an unlikely cause. (D) Parvovirus B19 – Incorrect. Parvovirus B19 primarily causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children and aplastic crisis in individuals with hemolytic anemia. It does not typically cause severe bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Parvovirus B19 is not a common cause of acute respiratory distress in infants, making it an unlikely culprit in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rabies virus: This patient developed pain, itching, and numbness at the site of an old cat bite wound after 60 days, followed by paralysis, fever, headache, and anxiety. These are classic symptoms of rabies, which has a long incubation period (weeks to months) and typically presents with neurological symptoms once the virus reaches the central nervous system (CNS). Rabies is caused by Rabies virus (a Lyssavirus, Rhabdoviridae family) and is transmitted through bites or scratches from infected animals (e.g., dogs, cats, bats, raccoons). After entering the body, the virus travels retrograde along peripheral nerves to the CNS, causing encephalitis. The nuchal skin biopsy showed viral inclusion bodies (Negri bodies in neurons) and direct fluorescent antibody positivity, confirming rabies. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is nearly always fatal, which is why post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin is crucial immediately after a bite. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) CMV is a herpesvirus that typically causes asymptomatic infection or mononucleosis-like symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. It does not cause bite-related infections or progressive neurological disease like rabies. CMV encephalitis typically occurs in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients) and presents differently from rabies. Option B: Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) EEEV is an arbovirus transmitted by mosquito bites, not animal bites. It causes encephalitis, but symptoms develop within a few days rather than weeks to months like rabies. It does not present with bite-site pain, itching, or localized neurological symptoms before progressing. Option C: Echovirus Echovirus belongs to the Picornaviridae family and is a common cause of viral meningitis and mild febrile illnesses. It is not associated with animal bites, nor does it cause progressive paralysis or Negri bodies. Unlike rabies, echovirus infections usually resolve without severe neurological complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Explanation of the Correct Answer: The 3-month-old infant presents with fever, severe cough, wheezing, and rapid breathing, which are characteristic symptoms of bronchiolitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by an immunofluorescent assay that detects a respiratory virus, and the patient is promptly started on ribavirin, an antiviral used in severe RSV cases. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants under 6 months of age. Clinical features of RSV infection: Low-grade fever Severe cough, wheezing Tachypnea (rapid breathing) and respiratory distress Hypoxemia in severe cases Apnea in high-risk infants (e.g., premature babies, infants with congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease) Diagnosis: Confirmed by immunofluorescent assay or RT-PCR detecting RSV antigens in nasopharyngeal secretions. Treatment: Supportive care is the mainstay (oxygen, hydration, nebulized saline). Ribavirin is used in severe RSV cases in high-risk infants. Palivizumab (monoclonal antibody) is given prophylactically to high-risk infants to prevent RSV infections. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Coxsackievirus A – Incorrect Coxsackievirus A is an enterovirus that does not cause bronchiolitis. It is associated with: Herpangina (fever, sore throat, vesicular lesions in the oropharynx). Hand, foot, and mouth disease (vesicular rash on hands, feet, and oral mucosa). It does not require ribavirin treatment and is not detected via immunofluorescence. (C) HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) – Incorrect HSV primarily causes: Gingivostomatitis in young children. Neonatal herpes in newborns infected during birth. HSV pneumonia is rare and occurs in immunocompromised individuals. HSV is not a common cause of bronchiolitis in infants, and it is diagnosed using PCR or Tzanck smear, not immunofluorescence. (D) Parvovirus – Incorrect Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), which presents with: Fever and “slapped-cheek” rash in children. Aplastic anemia in patients with sickle cell disease. Hydrops fetalis in pregnant women. It does not cause respiratory distress or bronchiolitis and is not treated with ribavirin.",
