      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Plasmodium falciparum, as it is the most virulent species causing malaria. P. falciparum is responsible for the majority of severe and fatal malaria cases worldwide due to its ability to cause complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anemia, metabolic acidosis, and multi-organ failure. It has a high replication rate, leading to heavy parasitemia and sequestration of infected red blood cells in small blood vessels, which can cause organ dysfunction. Additionally, P. falciparum exhibits drug resistance, making treatment challenging in many endemic regions. Its high mortality rate, particularly among young children and pregnant women, underscores its virulence compared to other Plasmodium species. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Plasmodium vivax – (Incorrect) P. vivax is less virulent than P. falciparum, as it usually causes a relapsing but milder form of malaria. However, it can still lead to complications such as severe anemia and splenic rupture, especially in vulnerable populations. Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax has dormant liver stages (hypnozoites), which can reactivate and cause recurrent infections, but it is not as lethal. C. Plasmodium ovale – (Incorrect) P. ovale is the least common of the human-infecting Plasmodium species and typically causes a mild and self-limiting form of malaria. Like P. vivax, it can form hypnozoites in the liver, leading to relapses, but it is not associated with severe complications or high mortality. D. Plasmodium malariae – (Incorrect) P. malariae causes a chronic but relatively mild form of malaria, with low parasitemia and slow replication rates. However, it has been linked to long-term complications such as nephrotic syndrome, but it does not cause the severe acute complications seen with P. falciparum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Giardiasis, as it does not cause brain lesions. Giardiasis is an intestinal protozoal infection caused by Giardia lamblia, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract. It leads to diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss, but it does not invade the bloodstream or cause CNS involvement. Unlike other pathogens listed, Giardia does not form cysts or granulomas in the brain, making it unrelated to brain lesions. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Tuberculosis – (Incorrect) Tuberculosis (TB) can cause brain lesions in the form of tuberculomas or tuberculous meningitis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can spread hematogenously to the brain, leading to granulomatous lesions that may cause seizures, neurological deficits, or increased intracranial pressure. TB meningitis is a severe and potentially fatal condition. C. Cysticercosis – (Incorrect) Neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval stage of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), is a major cause of brain lesions. The larvae form cystic lesions in the brain, leading to seizures, hydrocephalus, and focal neurological symptoms. It is a common cause of epilepsy in endemic regions. D. Bacteroides – (Incorrect) Bacteroides species are anaerobic bacteria that can cause brain abscesses when they spread from infections such as sinusitis, otitis media, or dental infections. These abscesses can lead to neurological deficits, increased intracranial pressure, and altered mental status.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Isospora (now known as Cystoisospora belli), as it is a well-recognized cause of chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and fever in HIV/AIDS patients. Cystoisospora belli is an intracellular coccidian parasite that causes prolonged, watery diarrhea, especially in immunocompromised individuals. A key diagnostic feature is that its oocysts stain acid-fast positive, distinguishing it from other causes of diarrhea in HIV patients. The infection is typically acquired via ingestion of contaminated food or water, and it can lead to severe dehydration and weight loss. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Giardia – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia is a common cause of malabsorption and diarrhea, but it is not an acid-fast organism. It is diagnosed using stool microscopy to detect cysts or trophozoites or via antigen testing. Unlike Cystoisospora, Giardia does not cause fever and is typically associated with greasy, foul-smelling stools rather than severe chronic diarrhea in HIV patients. B. Microsporidia – (Incorrect) Microsporidia (Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis) are intracellular spore-forming parasites that cause chronic diarrhea in HIV patients, but they do not stain acid-fast. Instead, they are detected using modified trichrome stains or PCR. They are significant causes of malabsorption but are not acid-fast positive like Cystoisospora. D. Entamoeba histolytica – (Incorrect) E. histolytica causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscesses, but it is not an acid-fast organism. It typically leads to bloody diarrhea (dysentery) rather than the chronic, watery diarrhea seen in Cystoisospora infections in HIV patients. Diagnosis is made by detecting trophozoites or cysts in stool or serological testing for amoebic liver abscesses.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Avidity testing must be done to differentiate between IgA & IgM. This statement is false because avidity testing is primarily used to differentiate between recent and past infections based on IgG antibodies, not to distinguish between IgA and IgM. Avidity testing assesses the binding strength of IgG antibodies, with low avidity indicating recent infection and high avidity suggesting past infection. IgA and IgM, on the other hand, are both markers of recent infection, but they are detected separately using specific immunoassays rather than avidity testing. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Diagnosed by detection of IgM in cord blood – (True) Congenital toxoplasmosis is often diagnosed by detecting Toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies in cord blood or neonatal serum. Since IgM does not cross the placenta, its presence in the newborn indicates in utero infection. However, IgM testing alone is not entirely reliable because it may persist for months, and false positives or negatives can occur. Therefore, additional serologic and molecular tests, such as PCR, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. B. IgA is more sensitive than IgM for detection – (True) IgA antibodies are considered more sensitive than IgM for diagnosing congenital toxoplasmosis. This is because IgA can persist longer and may be detected in cases where IgM is undetectable. Studies have shown that combining IgA and IgM testing improves diagnostic sensitivity, reducing the chances of missing an infected newborn. C. Dye test is the gold standard for IgG – (True) The Sabin-Feldman dye test is considered the gold standard for detecting Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies. It measures the ability of patient serum to lyse live T. gondii tachyzoites in the presence of complement. A positive IgG result indicates past or chronic infection, but further testing (such as IgG avidity) is needed to determine the timing of infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) L. donovani, as it is the causative agent of Post-Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL). PKDL is a complication of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), which is caused by Leishmania donovani. The condition is characterized by dermatological manifestations such as maculopapular rashes, hypopigmented spots, or nodules, appearing after the visceral infection has been treated. It occurs as a result of immunological responses following the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, and it primarily affects individuals who have been previously infected with L. donovani. Explanation of the Other Options: A. L. tropica – (Incorrect) Leishmania tropica primarily causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, which presents with localized skin ulcers, typically in the Middle East and parts of Asia. It is not associated with PKDL, as it does not cause visceral leishmaniasis. B. L. infantum – (Incorrect) Leishmania infantum (also known as L. chagasi in the Americas) is responsible for visceral leishmaniasis, particularly in the Mediterranean, South America, and parts of Asia. While it causes visceral disease, it does not typically lead to PKDL, which is more commonly associated with L. donovani. C. L. major – (Incorrect) Leishmania major is another species responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Africa. Like L. tropica, it does not cause PKDL, as it is not linked to visceral leishmaniasis or its post-treatment dermatological manifestations.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vertical Transmission, as amoebiasis is not transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth. Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebiasis, is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route by ingestion of cysts from contaminated food, water, or surfaces. There is no evidence that vertical transmission (from mother to fetus) plays a role in the spread of this infection. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Faeco-oral – (Incorrect) Fecal-oral transmission is the most common route of transmission for amoebiasis. It occurs when a person ingests cysts of Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food, water, or surfaces, or through direct contact with feces. This is the primary mechanism by which the parasite spreads. C. Cockroach – (Incorrect) Cockroaches can act as mechanical vectors for amoebiasis, as they may carry cysts on their bodies or legs after coming into contact with contaminated feces or food. They can indirectly contaminate food, making them a potential route for transmission, although not a primary one. D. Oral – (Incorrect) Oral transmission refers to the consumption of contaminated food or water, and this is a key route by which amoebiasis is transmitted. The cysts of Entamoeba histolytica are ingested orally, often through contaminated hands or food that has been contaminated by infected water or poor sanitation.",

These flies and bugs act as the vectors, not mosquitoes. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Filariasis – (Incorrect) Filariasis is caused by filarial worms (such as Wuchereria bancrofti), and it is transmitted by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are the vectors that carry the larvae, which they inject into the human bloodstream during a blood meal. Filariasis can lead to conditions such as lymphatic filariasis and elephantiasis. C. Dengue – (Incorrect) Dengue fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These mosquitoes spread the dengue virus, causing symptoms like high fever, severe headache, joint pain, and rash. Dengue is a major mosquito-borne disease in tropical and subtropical regions. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Toxoplasmosis, as the Sabin-Feldman dye test is a diagnostic method used specifically to detect Toxoplasma gondii infection, which causes toxoplasmosis. This test involves measuring the presence of specific antibodies against T. gondii by using a dye that binds to the parasite, helping to confirm the diagnosis of active or recent infection. It is considered a gold standard for diagnosing toxoplasmosis, particularly in cases of congenital infection. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Filariasis – (Incorrect) Filariasis is caused by filarial worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. Diagnosis is usually based on the identification of microfilariae in blood samples, not the Sabin-Feldman dye test. Common diagnostic methods include microscopic examination of blood smears or the antigen detection test. C. Histoplasmosis – (Incorrect) Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It is diagnosed through methods such as serology, culture, and PCR testing. The Sabin-Feldman dye test is not used for fungal infections like histoplasmosis. D. Ascariasis – (Incorrect) Ascariasis is caused by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. Diagnosis is primarily based on the detection of eggs or larvae in stool samples through microscopic examination, and sometimes through imaging for heavier infections. The Sabin-Feldman dye test is not applicable in diagnosing ascariasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hard ticks, as Babesiosis is transmitted primarily through the bite of hard ticks (Ixodes species, particularly Ixodes scapularis). These ticks serve as vectors for the protozoan parasite Babesia, which infects red blood cells and causes symptoms like fever, anemia, and fatigue. The tick becomes infected when it feeds on an infected animal, and then transmits the parasite to humans or other animals when it bites. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Dogs – (Incorrect) While dogs can be infected with Babesia and may serve as reservoir hosts, they are not the vectors that transmit the disease to humans. The parasite is passed to humans through tick bites, not directly from dogs. B. Jackals – (Incorrect) Jackals can also act as reservoir hosts for Babesia, similar to dogs. However, they are not involved in direct transmission of the parasite to humans. The vector for transmission remains the tick, not the jackals themselves. D. Monkeys – (Incorrect) While monkeys in some regions can be infected with Babesia, they are not the primary hosts or vectors of the disease. Ticks remain the primary mode of transmission, regardless of whether the infected host is a monkey or another animal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Toxoplasmosis, as cranial calcifications are a common finding in congenital toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. In infected infants, calcifications often occur in the brain, particularly in the intracranial spaces and cortex, and they are visible on imaging such as CT scans or MRIs. This can be a key diagnostic feature when assessing congenital infections. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Syphilis – (Incorrect) While syphilis, particularly congenital syphilis, can cause a variety of neurological and developmental problems, it does not typically cause cranial calcifications. Syphilis-related neurological damage may include hydrocephalus, seizures, and developmental delay, but calcifications are not a hallmark feature. C. Rubella – (Incorrect) Rubella, or German measles, can cause congenital rubella syndrome, which may involve sensorineural deafness, heart defects, and cataracts. However, cranial calcifications are not a typical feature of congenital rubella. The primary concerns are more related to hearing and vision impairments, rather than brain calcifications. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cryptosporidium, as Cryptosporidium is a common cause of watery, nonbloody diarrhea in patients with AIDS. This parasitic infection is particularly notorious for causing chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. The infection is caused by the protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum and is typically transmitted through contaminated water or food. In AIDS patients, Cryptosporidium can lead to severe, prolonged diarrhea, sometimes lasting weeks, which is a hallmark of opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Acid-fast bacilli – (Incorrect) Acid-fast bacilli typically refers to Mycobacterium species, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. While mycobacterial infections can cause diarrhea in AIDS patients, the presentation is usually more chronic and associated with weight loss, fever, and malaise. Acid-fast bacilli infections typically lead to more systemic or pulmonary manifestations, rather than just isolated diarrhea. B. Enterocytozoon – (Incorrect) Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a microsporidian parasite that can cause diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS. However, Cryptosporidium is more common in presenting with acute, watery diarrhea in these patients, whereas Enterocytozoon infection tends to cause a more chronic and indolent course. D. Yeast – (Incorrect) Candida is a type of yeast that can cause oral thrush, esophagitis, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, in immunocompromised individuals. However, Candida is more likely to cause invasive disease (e.g., candidemia or esophagitis) than to present as isolated watery diarrhea in the absence of other signs of infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acanthamoeba, as Acanthamoeba keratitis is a known cause of corneal infection in individuals who improperly store contact lenses, especially in tap water. This free-living amoeba is found in natural water sources, including tap water, swimming pools, and hot tubs. When the amoeba comes into contact with the eye, it can cause severe keratitis, leading to pain, blurred vision, and potential vision loss if left untreated. This infection is more common in individuals who wear contact lenses, especially if they store them improperly, such as in water rather than a disinfecting solution. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Babesia – (Incorrect) Babesia is a protozoan parasite transmitted by ticks, causing babesiosis, which typically presents with fever, anemia, and fatigue, not with keratitis. It does not cause eye infections like Acanthamoeba does. C. Entamoeba coli – (Incorrect) Entamoeba coli is a non-pathogenic amoeba that typically resides in the human colon. While Entamoeba histolytica can cause intestinal infections, E. coli does not cause keratitis or eye infections. Thus, it is not relevant to the patient's presentation. D. Naegleria – (Incorrect) Naegleria fowleri is another free-living amoeba, but it causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which is a severe brain infection. Although it is found in warm water environments, it typically infects the brain through the nasal passages and does not cause keratitis. E. Pneumocystis – (Incorrect) Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungus that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), typically in immunocompromised individuals. It does not cause keratitis or eye infections, making it irrelevant to the patient's condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Except in infections with very high parasitaemia, only ring forms of early trophozoites and the gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. This is a key diagnostic feature of Plasmodium falciparum. In low parasitaemia, P. falciparum infections typically present with ring forms of early trophozoites and gametocytes in the peripheral blood smear, while mature schizonts and trophozoites are not commonly seen. This is due to the rapid progression of the parasite lifecycle, where it quickly destroys red blood cells, limiting the number of mature stages found in the blood. Explanation of the Other Options: A. An important diagnostic feature is the irregular appearance of the edges of the infected red blood cell – (Incorrect) This characteristic is not specific to Plasmodium falciparum. While some other malaria species (like Plasmodium vivax) can cause irregularities in the shape of infected red blood cells, P. falciparum typically does not cause this feature. P. falciparum is often characterized by ring forms and crescent-shaped gametocytes, not irregular cell edges. B. A period of 72 hours is required for the development of the mature schizont, which resembles a rosette with only 8 to 10 oval merozoites – (Incorrect) This statement is more accurate for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, not Plasmodium falciparum. In P. falciparum, the schizont maturation period is shorter (usually about 48 hours), and it is typically associated with 12 to 24 merozoites rather than 8 to 10. Furthermore, P. falciparum schizonts do not resemble rosettes. D. Schuffner stippling is routinely seen in red blood cells that harbor parasites – (Incorrect) Schuffner stippling is a diagnostic feature of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale infections, not Plasmodium falciparum. P. falciparum is not typically associated with Schuffner stippling. Instead, P. falciparum can be identified by its ring forms and crescent-shaped gametocytes. E. The signet ring-shaped trophozoites are irregular in shape with amoeboid extensions of the cytoplasm – (Incorrect) While P. falciparum does feature signet ring-shaped trophozoites, they are not typically irregular in shape with amoeboid extensions of the cytoplasm. The signet ring form is characteristic of early trophozoites, but the amoeboid extension description better fits other species like Plasmodium vivax.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Giardiasis, as Giardia lamblia infection is a common cause of non-bloody, foul-smelling, fatty diarrhea in children, especially in day care settings. Giardiasis is a protozoan infection often transmitted through contaminated water, food, or contact with infected individuals, making day care centers a common place for outbreaks. The hallmark symptoms include steatorrhea (fatty stools), which results from impaired fat absorption, along with a lack of fever. This infection is frequently seen in young children and can cause chronic diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Amebiasis – (Incorrect) Amebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, typically presents with bloody diarrhea and sometimes fever, which is not consistent with the symptoms described in this case. The diarrhea in amebiasis is often accompanied by mucus and blood, which differentiates it from the non-bloody, fatty stools seen in giardiasis. B. Ascariasis – (Incorrect) Ascariasis, caused by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and intestinal obstruction, but it does not typically present with non-bloody, fatty stools. Ascariasis is not commonly associated with the characteristic foul-smelling stools or malabsorption seen in giardiasis. C. Balantidiasis – (Incorrect) Balantidiasis, caused by the ciliate Balantidium coli, is a rare parasitic infection. While it can cause diarrhea, it is more commonly associated with bloody diarrhea and is typically seen in individuals who work with pigs or are in close contact with pigs.

In the chronic stage of Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, the main lesions are typically observed in the heart and digestive tract. Chronic Chagas disease can lead to cardiomyopathy, which may result in heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular issues. The digestive tract can also be affected, causing megaesophagus (dilated esophagus) and megacolon (dilated colon), both of which result from the degeneration of the muscles of the esophagus and colon due to chronic infection.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Direct fluorescent antibody microscopy. Pneumocystis jirovecii is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients, and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) microscopy is considered the method of choice for detecting P. jirovecii in respiratory specimens. This method involves using antibodies that are directly conjugated to fluorescent dyes. When applied to a sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample, these antibodies specifically bind to the P. jirovecii organisms, allowing them to be visualized under a fluorescent microscope. This technique is both sensitive and relatively quick, making it ideal for diagnosing Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised patients. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Culture in rat lung cells – (Incorrect) While culturing Pneumocystis jirovecii in rat lung cells is a method that has been used historically, it is not practical or routinely used for diagnosing P. jirovecii infection in clinical settings. Culturing P. jirovecii is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often yields delayed results, making it less favorable compared to rapid diagnostic methods like DFA microscopy. C. Indirect fluorescent antibody microscopy – (Incorrect) Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) microscopy involves using antibodies that are not directly conjugated to a fluorescent dye, requiring a secondary antibody to detect the antigen. This method is typically less sensitive and takes longer than direct methods, making it a less preferred option for detecting P. jirovecii in respiratory specimens compared to direct fluorescent antibody microscopy. D. Methenamine-silver stain – (Incorrect) While methenamine-silver stain is a staining technique used to identify P. jirovecii in tissue specimens, it is not the primary method for detecting P. jirovecii in respiratory specimens such as sputum or BAL samples. This stain is more commonly used in histological or cytological specimens, and although it can be effective, it is less commonly used in routine clinical practice for diagnosing Pneumocystis pneumonia. E. Toluidine blue stain – (Incorrect) Toluidine blue stain is generally used for detecting fungal organisms, but it is not the method of choice for diagnosing P. jirovecii. While it may be used in certain diagnostic settings, it lacks the specificity and sensitivity of direct fluorescent antibody microscopy for detecting P. jirovecii in respiratory specimens.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) Trichomonas vaginalis. Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that exists in only the trophozoite stage during its life cycle. Unlike many other protozoa, it does not form cysts or other forms of resistance. The trophozoite is the active, motile form of the parasite that is responsible for causing trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI). This parasite is typically found in the genitourinary tract, where it causes symptoms like vaginitis, urethritis, and prostatitis. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Balantidium coli – (Incorrect) Balantidium coli is a ciliate protozoan that exists in two stages: the trophozoite and the cyst stage. The cyst form is responsible for transmission, and the trophozoite is the active, motile form. Therefore, it does not exist in the trophozoite stage only. B. Entamoeba histolytica – (Incorrect) Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebiasis, also has both trophozoite and cyst stages in its life cycle. The cyst stage is the infectious form, while the trophozoite causes tissue damage in the intestines. Thus, it does not exist solely in the trophozoite stage. C. Giardia lamblia – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia (also known as Giardia intestinalis) exists in both the trophozoite and cyst stages. The cyst is the infectious form that is passed in feces and can survive in the environment, while the trophozoite is the active, motile form that inhabits the intestines. It does not exist only as a trophozoite. D. Toxoplasma gondii – (Incorrect) Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle involving several stages: tachyzoite (active stage), bradyzoite (latent stage), and oocyst (infectious stage). While tachyzoites are the form that cause acute infection, the parasite does not exist only in this stage, as it also forms cysts (bradyzoites) in tissues.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bancroftian filariasis. Bancroftian filariasis, caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, is a mosquito-borne parasitic infection. The transmission occurs when an infected mosquito (usually Culex, Anopheles, or Aedes) bites a person, injecting microfilariae into the bloodstream. These microfilariae then mature into adult worms, causing lymphatic filariasis. Mosquitoes are essential for the life cycle of the parasite, making Bancroftian filariasis the only infection in this list that requires a mosquito for transmission. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Babesiosis – (Incorrect) Babesiosis is caused by Babesia protozoa, which is primarily transmitted by ticks, not mosquitoes. It is often transmitted through the bite of an Ixodes tick (the same type of tick that transmits Lyme disease). While Babesia can be transmitted via blood transfusions and congenitally, it does not require mosquitoes for its transmission. C. Dog tapeworm – (Incorrect) The dog tapeworm (Echinococcus granulosus) does not involve mosquitoes in its transmission. This tapeworm is typically transmitted to humans via direct contact with infected dogs or by ingesting eggs from contaminated soil, water, or food. The lifecycle involves canine hosts and intermediate hosts like livestock, not mosquitoes. D. Guinea worm – (Incorrect) Guinea worm disease (caused by Dracunculus medinensis) is transmitted through contaminated drinking water, not by mosquitoes. People ingest water contaminated with water fleas (the intermediate host), which harbor the larvae of the Guinea worm. The worms then mature and cause symptoms as they emerge from the body, typically from the skin. E. Leishmaniasis – (Incorrect) Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of an infected sandfly, not a mosquito. The sandfly introduces Leishmania parasites into the skin during a bite, leading to either cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis does not involve mosquitoes in its transmission cycle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C And E) ELISA and E. Sigmoidoscopy and aspiration of mucosal lesions. C. ELISA (Correct) Entamoeba histolytica infection can be effectively diagnosed using the ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). This diagnostic method detects specific antigens released by the parasite, offering a sensitive and specific way to confirm the infection. ELISA is especially useful for detecting E. histolytica in stool samples, particularly when the parasite is not shedding cysts or trophozoites, which can complicate diagnosis by traditional methods. E. Sigmoidoscopy and aspiration of mucosal lesions (Correct) In cases where there is suspected invasive amebiasis, sigmoidoscopy can be performed to visualize mucosal lesions in the colon. Aspiration of these lesions can help confirm the diagnosis by identifying trophozoites of E. histolytica in the tissue. This method is particularly useful in severe cases of amebic dysentery or amoebic colitis, where the parasite has invaded the intestinal mucosa. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Baermann technique – (Incorrect) The Baermann technique is used to detect nematode larvae, particularly Strongyloides or other hookworms, in fecal samples or other biological specimens. It is not relevant for diagnosing E. histolytica infection, which is a protozoan infection. B. Dilution followed by egg count – (Incorrect) This method is typically used for counting parasitic eggs (such as in helminth infections like Ascaris or Trichuris), but it is not applicable to the diagnosis of E. histolytica infection. E. histolytica produces cysts, not eggs, and its diagnosis is not based on egg counting. D. Examination of a cellophane tape swab – (Incorrect) The cellophane tape swab is used for detecting pinworm infections (Enterobius vermicularis), not E. histolytica. In this technique, the tape is applied to the anal region and examined for the presence of pinworm eggs, which is not relevant for diagnosing E. histolytica.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) Vaginal secretions. Jerky motility is a characteristic feature of the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, which is commonly found in vaginal secretions. Trichomonas vaginalis exhibits a distinctive jerky, twitching motility when observed under a microscope, due to the rapid movement of its flagella. This protozoan causes trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection, and is typically diagnosed by examining vaginal or urethral secretions, where the motility can be easily observed. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Biopsied muscle – (Incorrect) While muscle biopsies can be used to diagnose certain parasitic infections, such as trichinosis (caused by Trichinella spiralis), the motility of the parasite is not jerky. Trichinella larvae encyst in muscle tissue, and while they may be observed in tissue samples, they do not exhibit jerky motility. B. Blood – (Incorrect) There are protozoans in the blood, such as Plasmodium (which causes malaria), Trypanosoma species (such as Trypanosoma brucei or Trypanosoma cruzi), and Leishmania, but none of these display jerky motility. Instead, they either have a characteristic shape or movement pattern, such as the circular motion of Trypanosoma or the no motility of Plasmodium when in the blood stage. C. Duodenal contents – (Incorrect) Infections such as Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica may be found in the duodenal contents, but these organisms do not exhibit jerky motility. Giardia has a distinctive falling leaf-like motility, and E. histolytica typically exhibits amoeboid movement rather than jerky motion. D. Sputum – (Incorrect) Although protozoa like Entamoeba histolytica and Acanthamoeba can sometimes be found in the respiratory tract, they do not exhibit jerky motility. Acanthamoeba may move with amoeboid movement, but jerky motility is not characteristic of these organisms when observed in sputum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cerebrospinal fluid. Naegleria fowleri, a free-living amoeba that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is diagnosed primarily through the examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When an individual is infected with Naegleria fowleri, the amoeba travels through the nasal passages into the brain, causing severe inflammation and tissue destruction. The CSF obtained via lumbar puncture is analyzed for the presence of Naegleria fowleri through various methods, including microscopic examination, culture, and molecular testing. The amoeba may be visible in CSF samples, and PCR can confirm the diagnosis. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Corneal scraping – (Incorrect) Corneal scraping is typically used to diagnose infections caused by Acanthamoeba, another free-living amoeba that can cause keratitis, not Naegleria fowleri. While Acanthamoeba can infect the cornea, Naegleria fowleri causes an infection of the brain and not the eyes. C. Blood – (Incorrect) Infections with Naegleria fowleri do not primarily manifest in the bloodstream, so blood samples are not the typical specimens used for diagnosis. The infection typically causes meningoencephalitis, which affects the central nervous system (CNS), and diagnosis relies on CSF rather than blood. D. Urine – (Incorrect) Urine samples are not used to diagnose Naegleria fowleri infections. As the infection predominantly affects the brain and CNS, urine is not relevant for diagnosing Naegleria fowleri. The focus is on analyzing CSF to detect the amoeba.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The baby may be LBW (Low Birth Weight). P. vivax malaria in pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, can lead to complications such as low birth weight (LBW). This is because malaria can cause placental infection, leading to reduced nutrient and oxygen supply to the fetus. LBW is a common consequence of maternal malaria infection, as it is associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, and other pregnancy-related complications. Explanation of the Other Options: A. There is a high chance of her baby developing malaria – (Incorrect) Although maternal malaria can have adverse effects on the pregnancy, including complications like LBW, it does not necessarily mean the baby will develop malaria. The transmission of P. vivax from mother to fetus is not as common as vertical transmission of other types of infections like HIV or rubella. Malaria does not always cross the placenta to infect the baby, and in many cases, the baby remains uninfected despite maternal malaria. B. The drug of choice is artesunate – (Incorrect) While artesunate is the preferred treatment for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, it is not typically the first-line treatment for P. vivax malaria in pregnancy. Chloroquine or quinine combined with clindamycin is generally the recommended treatment for P. vivax malaria in pregnant women. Artesunate is reserved for cases of severe falciparum malaria, which this case does not mention. C. She can develop complications – (Incorrect) Although complications can occur with malaria during pregnancy, the phrase \"she can develop complications\" is too vague and not specific to the question. Low birth weight (LBW) is a specific and likely outcome of this infection, while general complications such as anemia, preterm labor, or fetal distress could occur, but the focus on LBW makes it the most appropriate answer here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) DNA PCR. DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) can be used to detect specific DNA sequences in Entamoeba species, but it is not specifically designed to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of Entamoeba. While PCR is useful for identifying the presence of the organism, it doesn’t always differentiate between pathogenic (E. histolytica) and non-pathogenic (E. dispar or E. moshkovskii) strains without further specialized analysis. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Hematophagous trophozoite – (Incorrect) This refers to the trophozoite stage of the pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica, which can feed on blood. This characteristic is found in pathogenic strains and is not observed in non-pathogenic strains of Entamoeba. This difference is used to identify and differentiate the pathogenic from the non-pathogenic species. B. Zymodeme analysis – (Incorrect) Zymodeme analysis is a technique used to study the enzymatic patterns of Entamoeba species. This method can help differentiate between pathogenic (E. histolytica) and non-pathogenic (E. dispar, E. moshkovskii) species, as the patterns of enzyme activity differ between them. Therefore, this method is useful for identifying pathogenic strains. C. Nested PCR – (Incorrect) Nested PCR is a more specific form of PCR that is used to amplify DNA sequences with a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity. It is often employed to detect specific genetic markers that can differentiate pathogenic from non-pathogenic strains of Entamoeba (especially E. histolytica versus E. dispar). This technique can provide a highly accurate method for distinguishing between pathogenic and non-pathogenic species.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Except in infections with very high parasitemia, only ring forms of the early trophozoites and the gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. This statement best describes the diagnostic characteristics of Plasmodium falciparum. Infections with P. falciparum tend to show a predominance of the ring-shaped trophozoites and gametocytes in the peripheral blood. High parasitemia may show more mature forms, but the hallmark of P. falciparum infections is the presence of these early ring forms and gametocytes in the blood smear. Schuffner stippling is not seen in P. falciparum (it is seen in P. vivax and P. ovale), and the irregular shape of trophozoites and amoeboid extensions of the cytoplasm are more characteristic of other species, like P. malariae. Explanation of the Other Options: A. An important diagnostic feature is the irregular appearance of the edges of the infected RBC – (Incorrect) This characteristic is not typically seen in Plasmodium falciparum. While P. falciparum can infect red blood cells (RBCs), it does not produce the distinct irregular edges seen in the RBCs infected with Plasmodium malariae, which often has a characteristic \"band\" form. This statement is not relevant to P. falciparum and is more associated with other species. C. Schuffner stippling is routinely seen in RBCs that harbor parasites – (Incorrect) Schuffner stippling is a feature of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, not Plasmodium falciparum. It appears as fine dots within the infected RBCs, which is useful in distinguishing these species from P. falciparum. P. falciparum does not display Schuffner stippling; instead, its infected RBCs tend to appear without such markings. D. The signet ring-shaped trophozoites are irregular in shape with amoeboid extensions of the cytoplasm – (Incorrect) While P. falciparum does form ring-shaped trophozoites, they do not typically display the amoeboid extensions of the cytoplasm or the irregular shapes described in the answer choice. This feature is more characteristic of Plasmodium malariae or certain stages of P. vivax, not P. falciparum. The rings are usually round and may be more compact in appearance, making this description less accurate for P. falciparum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Patients without a spleen. Babesiosis is most commonly seen in individuals who lack a spleen (asplenic individuals). The spleen plays a crucial role in filtering blood and removing infected cells, including those infected with Babesia parasites. People who have had their spleen removed (due to trauma, surgery, or other medical conditions) are more susceptible to infections like babesiosis. In these individuals, the body is less able to effectively clear the parasite, leading to more severe disease progression. Explanation of the Other Options: A. AIDS patients – (Incorrect) While Babesia infections can occur in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with AIDS, it is not the most common group affected. The risk of babesiosis is higher in individuals without a spleen or those living in endemic areas where the Ixodes tick, which transmits the parasite, is common. AIDS patients, due to their overall immune system compromise, can be at higher risk for a variety of infections, but babesiosis is not the primary concern. B. Foresters – (Incorrect) Foresters and individuals who spend time in wooded, tick-infested areas are indeed at higher risk for babesiosis because Babesia is transmitted through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. However, this group is not the most commonly affected, compared to asplenic individuals who are at greater risk for severe illness when infected. D. Transfusion recipients – (Incorrect) Babesia infection can be transmitted through blood transfusions, but this is a relatively less common route of transmission compared to tick bites. Transfusion recipients, especially those receiving blood from donors who have been exposed to Babesia, can contract the infection, but it is still more common in asplenic individuals or those living in endemic areas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Macrolides is the treatment of choice. Cryptosporidium infection, which is likely causing the patient's symptoms, is not typically treated with macrolides. Instead, the primary treatment for cryptosporidiosis is nitazoxanide for immunocompetent individuals, and supportive care is used for immunocompromised individuals. While macrolides are used to treat certain bacterial infections, they are not the first-line treatment for Cryptosporidium. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Autoinfection is seen – (Correct) Cryptosporidium infection can involve autoinfection, especially in immunocompromised individuals like those with AIDS. Autoinfection occurs when the oocysts that are excreted in the stool can potentially reinfect the host by further developing into infective forms within the intestines, leading to continuous or recurrent infections. C. Pulmonary involvement may occur – (Correct) Although Cryptosporidium primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, it can also cause pulmonary involvement, especially in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS. Respiratory cryptosporidiosis is less common but can occur, causing symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. D. Ag detection in stool and direct fluorescence testing are alternative methods of detection – (Correct) For diagnosing Cryptosporidium infections, antigen detection in stool and direct fluorescence microscopy are common diagnostic methods. These tests are sensitive and can help confirm the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in stool samples, which is important for accurate diagnosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Naegleria fowleri. Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba that is known to cause primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare but rapidly fatal infection of the central nervous system. It typically infects individuals who have been exposed to contaminated freshwater, often through the nose, and it causes acute meningoencephalitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying motile unicellular organisms in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via wet mount microscopy. The amoeba is distinctive for its rapid movement and trophozoite form. Explanation of the Other Options: B. Acanthamoeba castellani – (Incorrect) While Acanthamoeba castellani is another free-living amoeba that can cause infections of the brain (e.g., granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, GAE) and the cornea, it is typically associated with chronic rather than acute presentations. In the case of acute meningoencephalitis, Naegleria fowleri is the more likely cause. Acanthamoeba infections often develop over a longer period of time and do not present with the rapid onset of symptoms typically seen with Naegleria fowleri. C. Entamoeba histolytica – (Incorrect) Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amoebic dysentery and extraintestinal amoebiasis (e.g., liver abscess). While it is a motile unicellular organism, it does not cause meningoencephalitis. The infection primarily affects the gastrointestinal system and, if untreated, may spread to other organs, but it does not present with the acute neurological symptoms typical of Naegleria fowleri. D. Trypanosoma cruzi – (Incorrect) Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, which is transmitted by the Triatomine bug. While it can affect the heart, esophagus, and colon, it does not typically cause acute meningoencephalitis. Trypanosoma cruzi does not present as a motile unicellular organism in the CSF, so it is not the most likely organism in this case. E. Toxoplasma gondii – (Incorrect) Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, often leading to cerebral toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients). However, Toxoplasma gondii does not typically present as a motile unicellular organism in the CSF. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is typically made through serology or PCR, not by identifying motile organisms in a wet mount of CSF.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Winterbottom’s sign is a characteristic clinical feature of African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, which is caused by Trypanosoma brucei. It refers to the presence of posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, where there is swelling of the lymph nodes at the back of the neck. This sign is considered an early diagnostic feature of the disease and is indicative of the systemic spread of the parasite, which typically occurs during the early stages of infection. Explanation of the Other Options: A. Unilateral conjunctivitis – (Incorrect) Unilateral conjunctivitis is not associated with Winterbottom's sign. While Trypanosoma brucei infections can cause eye symptoms, conjunctivitis is not the hallmark feature of sleeping sickness. In contrast, Winterbottom's sign specifically refers to posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. C. Narcolepsy – (Incorrect) Narcolepsy refers to a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks. While sleeping sickness can cause disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, narcolepsy is not directly associated with Winterbottom's sign. The hallmark feature of sleeping sickness is the posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, not narcolepsy. D. Transient erythema – (Incorrect) Transient erythema, or a temporary rash, is not related to Winterbottom’s sign. In sleeping sickness, skin changes or rashes may occur, but they are not the key diagnostic feature. The posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is the defining characteristic for Winterbottom’s sign. E. Arthralgia – (Incorrect) Arthralgia, or joint pain, is a general symptom that can be seen in many infections and conditions, but it is not a specific sign of sleeping sickness or associated with Winterbottom's sign. Winterbottom’s sign specifically refers to the swollen lymph nodes in the neck (posterior cervical lymphadenopathy).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgG antibodies are diagnostic in congenital toxoplasmosis. While IgG antibodies are a significant marker of past infection with Toxoplasma gondii, they are not diagnostic for congenital toxoplasmosis. In congenital toxoplasmosis, IgM antibodies in the infant, as well as PCR testing of amniotic fluid, are more commonly used to diagnose active infection in the neonate. IgG antibodies are typically found in infants due to passive transfer from the mother during pregnancy, but they do not necessarily indicate an active infection. Explanation of the Other Options: A. In adults toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic – (Correct) In healthy adults, toxoplasmosis is typically asymptomatic or causes only mild flu-like symptoms. The immune system in immunocompetent individuals usually controls the infection without significant symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose based solely on clinical presentation. C. Is an anthroponotic disease – (Correct) Toxoplasmosis is considered an anthroponotic disease, meaning humans can serve as both definitive and intermediate hosts in the transmission cycle. Humans become infected through ingestion of oocysts from contaminated food or water or consumption of undercooked meat, making the infection primarily human-to-human in terms of exposure. D. Encephalitis is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals – (Correct) Encephalitis due to Toxoplasma gondii is rare in immunocompetent individuals. However, in those with weakened immune systems, such as in HIV/AIDS patients, the infection can progress to toxoplasmic encephalitis, which can be fatal if untreated. E. The incidence of transplacental infection is highest in third trimester but the infant is not severely affected – (Correct) In congenital toxoplasmosis, the transplacental transmission of the parasite is indeed highest in the third trimester. However, the severity of the disease is lower in the third trimester compared to earlier stages of pregnancy. Infants infected during the first trimester may experience more severe manifestations, such as hydrocephalus, retinochoroiditis, and severe developmental delay.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E) All of the above. The pathogenicity of Entamoeba histolytica can be indicated by a combination of various diagnostic factors. Here's how each option relates to the pathogenicity: A. Zymodeme pattern – (Correct) The zymodeme pattern refers to the genetic variation found within Entamoeba histolytica strains, which helps to differentiate between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms of the parasite. Some zymodemes are associated with more virulent strains capable of causing invasive disease, including amebic dysentery or amebic liver abscesses. B. Nuclear pattern – (Correct) The nuclear pattern of the trophozoites and cysts can also indicate the pathogenicity of E. histolytica. Pathogenic strains of E. histolytica typically show a distinctive nuclear pattern that can be identified under the microscope, which helps differentiate them from non-pathogenic species like Entamoeba dispar. C. ELISA test – (Correct) The ELISA test is commonly used to detect antigens or antibodies specific to Entamoeba histolytica. It can provide a quick and accurate way to identify the presence of pathogenic E. histolytica infection. The test detects galactose-specific lectins or other specific antigens expressed by the parasite. D. Hematophagous trophozoite – (Correct) The hematophagous trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica are directly responsible for the pathogenesis of the infection. These trophozoites can invade the intestinal mucosa, causing ulceration, tissue necrosis, and the hemorrhaging that results in bloody diarrhea. This capability is a hallmark of the pathogenic strains of E. histolytica.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Common variable immunodeficiency. Giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia, is more frequently observed in individuals with immunodeficiencies. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is one such condition where the immune system does not function properly, making individuals more susceptible to infections, including giardiasis. In CVID, there is a deficiency in immunoglobulin production, which leads to a weakened immune response, allowing for persistent or recurrent infections like giardiasis. Incorrect Options: B. C1 esterase deficiency – (Incorrect) C1 esterase deficiency is most commonly associated with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling, not with an increased susceptibility to Giardiasis. It is related to problems in the complement system, not a general immunodeficiency that predisposes to parasitic infections. C. C8 deficiency – (Incorrect) C8 deficiency is part of a deficiency in the complement system, which can increase susceptibility to Neisseria infections, but it is not directly related to an increased risk of giardiasis. The complement system is essential for immune defense against bacterial infections, but Giardia is more of a concern in individuals with immunodeficiencies affecting the humoral immune response. D. Anaemia – (Incorrect) While anaemia can be associated with many infections, it is not a defining or direct consequence of giardiasis. Giardiasis primarily causes gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, malabsorption, and bloating, rather than a direct cause of anemia. However, chronic malabsorption could lead to nutrient deficiencies and secondary anemia. E. Autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia – (Incorrect) Agammaglobulinemia refers to a condition where there is a deficiency of immunoglobulins, leading to recurrent bacterial infections. While this condition can predispose individuals to infections, Giardia is more often associated with humoral immunodeficiencies like CVID, rather than agammaglobulinemia specifically. Giardiasis is more common in individuals with immunoglobulin deficiencies rather than total immunoglobulin absence.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Diagnosed by trophozoite in CSF. Acute primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare, life-threatening infection of the central nervous system, caused by the protozoan Naegleria fowleri. The diagnosis of PAM is confirmed by identifying the trophozoite stage of Naegleria fowleri in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The trophozoites are typically motile and can be observed under a microscope, which is the hallmark of the diagnosis. Incorrect Options: A. Meningitis caused by Acanthamoeba species is acute in nature – (Incorrect) While Acanthamoeba can cause meningitis, it is typically associated with a chronic infection rather than an acute presentation. Acanthamoeba infections tend to progress more slowly, and it is typically Acanthamoeba keratitis (an eye infection) that is more commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, not acute primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. C. Caused by feco-oral transmission – (Incorrect) The transmission of Naegleria fowleri, the causative organism of acute primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, is not fecal-oral. It is typically acquired through nasal passages when contaminated water (usually from warm freshwater sources like lakes or hot springs) enters the nose. The amoeba then travels to the brain, causing severe meningoencephalitis. Fecal-oral transmission is more relevant to other infections like Amoebiasis (caused by Entamoeba histolytica). D. More common in tropical climate – (Incorrect) While Naegleria fowleri is found in warm freshwater sources, it is not limited to tropical climates. It can occur in various regions with warm or temperate climates, including both tropical and non-tropical regions. It is more commonly found in stagnant, warm waters rather than being restricted to a particular geographic location.Explanation: The correct answer is B. Diagnosed by trophozoite in CSF.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A, C, D A. Caused by E. histolytica: This is correct because Entamoeba histolytica is the protozoan parasite responsible for causing amoebic colitis. It infects the intestines, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and the formation of ulcers in the colon. C. Flask-shaped ulcers are present: This is correct. One of the distinctive features of amoebic colitis is the formation of flask-shaped ulcers in the colon. These ulcers are caused by the trophozoites of E. histolytica invading the mucosal lining of the intestines, leading to tissue destruction and ulceration. These ulcers have a narrow neck and wider base, resembling a flask, which is characteristic of this infection. D. Cecum is most commonly affected: This is also correct. While the sigmoid colon and rectum are commonly involved in amoebic colitis, the cecum can be significantly affected, especially in more severe or chronic cases. The cecum is rich in blood supply, which makes it more susceptible to infection. In some cases, it can be the most affected region, especially in certain geographical areas or with more aggressive infections. Incorrect Options: B. Cyst contains 8 nuclei: This is incorrect. The mature cyst of E. histolytica typically contains 4 nuclei, not 8. When the cyst undergoes encystation, it forms a quadrinucleated cyst, which is the infectious form that can be passed through the stool and ingested by a new host. If the cyst contained 8 nuclei, it would not match the typical life cycle and morphology of E. histolytica. E. Is premalignant: This is incorrect. Amoebic colitis itself is not considered a premalignant condition. While chronic or untreated amoebic colitis can cause severe inflammation and complications such as intestinal perforation or secondary bacterial infections, it does not directly lead to malignancy. There is no strong evidence to suggest that amoebic colitis is associated with the development of cancer, making this statement inaccurate.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Giardia lamblia. Giardia lamblia, also known as Giardia intestinalis, is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, often characterized by loose, bulky stools (steatorrhea), abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. It is one of the most common causes of chronic diarrhea in children, especially in endemic areas. The diarrhea can last for weeks, and the stools often appear fatty and pale due to malabsorption, a common feature of giardiasis. Incorrect Responses: A. Entamoeba histolytica – (Incorrect) Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis, which typically presents with bloody diarrhea or dysentery, rather than the loose, bulky stools seen in giardiasis. The infection may also be associated with symptoms such as fever, abdominal tenderness, and in severe cases, liver abscess. While E. histolytica can cause chronic diarrhea, it is less likely to present with the fatty stools and prolonged diarrhea characteristic of giardiasis. C. Cryptosporidium – (Incorrect) Cryptosporidium is another protozoan parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis, which can lead to watery diarrhea, but it is usually associated with more severe infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. In immunocompetent children, the infection is typically self-limiting and doesn't present with the same characteristics of loose, bulky stools seen in giardiasis. The stool examination for cryptosporidiosis would show oocysts, typically diagnosed with acid-fast staining. D. E. coli – (Incorrect) While certain strains of Escherichia coli (especially enteropathogenic or enterotoxigenic strains) can cause diarrhea, E. coli infections are more commonly associated with watery diarrhea or, in some cases, bloody diarrhea (as with enterohemorrhagic E. coli). However, the presentation of loose, bulky stools with pain, as described in the case, is more typical of Giardia lamblia infection, not E. coli.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Giardiasis. Giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia, is often diagnosed by identifying motile protozoa in stool samples, especially on wet mount microscopy. The typical presentation includes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and fatty stools. The key feature in this case is the motile protozoa without RBCs and pus cells in the stool, which is characteristic of giardiasis. Giardiasis usually does not cause an inflammatory response, hence the absence of red blood cells (RBCs) and pus cells in the stool sample. Incorrect Responses: A. Balantidium Coli – (Incorrect) Balantidium coli is a ciliated protozoan that can cause balantidiasis, leading to dysentery with bloody diarrhea and the presence of pus cells (due to the inflammatory nature of the infection). A stool sample from an infected patient typically shows trophozoites that may contain red blood cells and pus cells. The absence of these cells in this case makes Balantidium coli an unlikely diagnosis. C. Trichomonas hominis – (Incorrect) Trichomonas hominis is a non-pathogenic protozoan that can be found in the human intestines. It may appear in stool samples, but it typically does not cause significant disease. Unlike Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas hominis does not cause diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and it is not typically associated with fatty stools or malabsorption. The motility observed in the stool sample may be due to Trichomonas hominis, but the absence of significant gastrointestinal symptoms and the nature of the protozoa (without RBCs or pus cells) suggests Giardiasis. D. Entamoeba histolytica – (Incorrect) Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic dysentery, characterized by bloody diarrhea and the presence of pus cells and red blood cells in the stool due to inflammation in the intestinal lining. The stool examination in E. histolytica infections typically shows trophozoites with ingested RBCs, which are not observed in this case. The absence of bloody diarrhea or inflammatory cells makes E. histolytica unlikely in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Angiostrongylus cantonensis, also known as the rat lungworm, typically causes eosinophilic meningoencephalitis rather than encephalitis. This parasite is primarily associated with the central nervous system (CNS) and its larvae migrate to the brain, leading to meningeal inflammation (meningitis) rather than encephalitis. The primary clinical manifestation is headache, neck stiffness, and other symptoms of meningitis, but it is not typically associated with encephalitis (inflammation of the brain itself). Incorrect Responses: A. Entamoeba histolytica – (Incorrect) Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that can cause amoebic brain abscesses in immunocompromised individuals. In rare cases, E. histolytica can cause brain abscesses, leading to encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. The trophozoites invade the CNS, leading to abscess formation, so it is capable of causing encephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. B. T. gondii – (Incorrect) Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that is known to cause toxoplasmic encephalitis, especially in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. In these patients, the parasite can cause inflammation of the brain, resulting in symptoms such as headache, confusion, and seizures, which are characteristic of encephalitis. D. T. cruzi – (Incorrect) Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is capable of affecting the nervous system, including the brain, leading to meningoencephalitis. Although the hallmark of Chagas disease is cardiomyopathy, the parasite can also invade the central nervous system, especially in acute and chronic stages, leading to inflammation and possible encephalitis.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Giardia lamblia. Giardia lamblia, a protozoan parasite, is one of the most common causes of malabsorption. It infects the small intestine, leading to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and fat malabsorption. The presence of Giardia interferes with normal intestinal absorption by disrupting the structure of the intestinal mucosa, leading to malabsorption syndrome. This can result in weight loss and steatorrhea (fatty stools), especially when the infection is chronic or untreated. Incorrect Responses: B. Ascaris lumbricoides – (Incorrect) Ascaris lumbricoides, a roundworm, typically causes intestinal obstruction rather than malabsorption. The adult worms can block the intestines, leading to abdominal pain and nausea, but it does not usually cause significant malabsorption. However, heavy infections may contribute to nutritional deficiencies due to competition for nutrients, but malabsorption is not a primary feature. C. Necator americanus – (Incorrect) Necator americanus, the hookworm, primarily causes anemia through blood loss due to the larvae attaching to the intestinal wall and feeding on blood. Although hookworms can contribute to nutritional deficiencies, they do not cause significant malabsorption directly. Anemia due to iron deficiency is a more prominent symptom in hookworm infection. D. Ancylostoma duodenale – (Incorrect) Like Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale is another hookworm species. It also causes anemia through blood loss at the site of attachment in the intestines. Although the infestation may lead to general weakness and nutritional deficiencies, it does not lead to direct malabsorption of nutrients in the same way Giardia lamblia does.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C And D) Antimonial are useful drugs and D. Diagnosed by blood smear. C. Antimonial are useful drugs: Visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) is commonly treated with antimonial drugs, specifically sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate. These drugs are effective in treating the infection by inhibiting the parasite Leishmania within the host. Antimonials remain the first-line treatment for visceral leishmaniasis despite the emergence of some drug resistance. D. Diagnosed by blood smear: Visceral leishmaniasis is commonly diagnosed through the detection of Leishmania parasites in blood smears. A bone marrow aspirate can also be used to confirm the diagnosis, but blood smear examination can provide a quick diagnostic tool, particularly when the parasite is circulating in the bloodstream during the active phase of infection. Incorrect Responses: A. Caused by L. tropica – (Incorrect) While Leishmania tropica causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis is most commonly caused by Leishmania donovani or Leishmania infantum. Leishmania tropica is typically associated with more localized skin lesions and does not cause the systemic, often fatal, effects seen in visceral leishmaniasis. B. Post-leishmaniasis dermatitis is common – (Incorrect) Post-leishmaniasis dermatitis is a complication more commonly associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis, not visceral leishmaniasis. In cutaneous leishmaniasis, the skin lesions can lead to scarring, which may develop into dermatitis after the healing of the primary skin lesions. Visceral leishmaniasis is a systemic infection that primarily affects internal organs like the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, and dermatitis is not a hallmark feature of this form of leishmaniasis. E. Vector is Phlebotomus sergentii – (Incorrect) The vector for visceral leishmaniasis is typically a species of sandfly from the genus Phlebotomus, but Phlebotomus sergentii is more commonly associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The principal vectors for visceral leishmaniasis are Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus argentipes, depending on the geographic location. Therefore, Phlebotomus sergentii is not the primary vector for visceral leishmaniasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) L. braziliensis. A. L. braziliensis: Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is primarily caused by Leishmania braziliensis. This species typically leads to mucocutaneous lesions that affect both the skin and mucous membranes, particularly the nose, mouth, and throat. The infection often begins as cutaneous lesions but can progress to involve the mucosal tissues, leading to significant tissue destruction if untreated. This form of leishmaniasis is more commonly found in parts of Central and South America. Incorrect Responses: B. L. tropica – (Incorrect) Leishmania tropica is responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes localized skin lesions. This species does not typically lead to mucosal involvement or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. It is more common in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Asia. C. L. donovani – (Incorrect) Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar), not mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. L. donovani infects internal organs, particularly the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, leading to systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and organ enlargement. D. L. orientalis – (Incorrect) Leishmania orientalis is not typically associated with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. It causes cutaneous leishmaniasis and is found in parts of Southeast Asia. While it leads to skin lesions, it does not commonly cause mucosal involvement as seen in mucocutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Trophozoites and cysts are seen in man. B. Trophozoites and cysts are seen in man: Giardia lamblia (also called Giardia intestinalis) is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis. It exists in two forms in humans: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the motile, vegetative form that causes the symptoms of giardiasis, while the cyst is the infectious form, which is shed in the stool and can survive in the environment. Both forms can be detected in stool samples, making them key diagnostic features. Incorrect Responses: A. CFT is diagnostic – (Incorrect) The CFT (Complement Fixation Test) is not typically used for diagnosing Giardia infections. Instead, stool microscopy, antigen tests (like ELISA), or molecular methods such as PCR are more commonly employed to identify Giardia. CFT is used for other parasitic infections, such as toxoplasmosis, but not for Giardia. C. Lives in lower intestine – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia primarily inhabits the upper small intestine, not the lower intestine. The jejunum and duodenum are the typical sites of colonization. It can cause malabsorption and diarrhea due to its effect on the intestinal mucosa, but its main residence is in the upper parts of the small intestine. D. Invades normal mucosa – (Incorrect) Unlike some other enteric pathogens, Giardia does not invade the intestinal mucosa. It adheres to the epithelial cells of the small intestine, causing damage by disrupting normal absorption, but it does not invade or penetrate the intestinal tissue. The infection leads to symptoms like watery diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal cramps, but it does not cause tissue invasion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Arthralgia, sore throat and abdominal pain are the most common manifestation. D. Arthralgia, sore throat and abdominal pain are the most common manifestation – (Incorrect) The most common manifestations of toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent individuals are generally mild and flu-like symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, fever, and headache, rather than arthralgia, sore throat, and abdominal pain. These specific symptoms (arthralgia, sore throat, and abdominal pain) are not the hallmark signs of the infection. In immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV, toxoplasmosis can cause more severe complications like encephalitis. Incorrect Responses: A. Oocyst in freshly passed cat's feces is not infective – (Correct) This statement is true. Freshly passed oocysts in cat feces are not immediately infective. They must undergo a maturation process in the environment for about 1-5 days before they become infective. After maturation, the oocysts can infect other animals or humans if ingested. B. May spread by organ transplantation – (Correct) This statement is true. Toxoplasmosis can be transmitted through organ transplantation, particularly if the donor is infected with the parasite. It is important to screen organ donors for Toxoplasma to prevent transmission, especially in immunocompromised recipients. C. Maternal infection after 6 months has high risk of transmission – (Correct) This statement is true. Toxoplasmosis transmission from mother to fetus increases in later stages of pregnancy. Maternal infection that occurs after the first trimester (especially after the 6-month mark) carries a higher risk of fetal infection, although the severity of the disease in the baby may still vary. Earlier in pregnancy, the risk of transmission is lower, but the severity of the disease in the fetus is more severe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Accolé forms are seen. B. Accolé forms are seen – (Correct) Plasmodium falciparum is characterized by the presence of accolé forms, which are a distinct stage of the parasite seen during microscopic examination of blood smears. In this form, the trophozoite of P. falciparum adheres to the edge of the red blood cell, forming a \"rosette\" or \"accolé\" shape, where the parasite appears to be positioned at the edge of the infected RBC. This is a characteristic feature used for identification of P. falciparum in blood smears. Incorrect Responses: A. James dots are seen – (Incorrect) James dots are not associated with P. falciparum. Instead, they are observed in Plasmodium vivax. These are small, fine, chromatin dots found in the trophozoites of P. vivax. They are used as a diagnostic feature for P. vivax, not P. falciparum. C. Relapses are frequent – (Incorrect) Relapses are more commonly associated with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, which have dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that can reactivate and cause malaria relapses. In contrast, Plasmodium falciparum does not form hypnozoites and, thus, relapses are not frequent. P. falciparum typically causes acute, severe malaria but does not have the ability to relapse once treated. D. Longest incubation period – (Incorrect) P. falciparum does not have the longest incubation period. The incubation period for P. falciparum is generally around 9-14 days after infection. On the other hand, Plasmodium malariae has the longest incubation period, typically ranging from 18-40 days. The incubation period for P. vivax and P. ovale is also longer than that of P. falciparum due to the development of hypnozoites in the liver.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IgM antibodies against Toxoplasma in the fetus. B. IgM antibodies against Toxoplasma in the fetus – (Correct) The best method to confirm toxoplasmosis in the fetus is to detect IgM antibodies against Toxoplasma in the fetus. These antibodies indicate an acute infection and their presence in fetal blood or amniotic fluid can confirm congenital toxoplasmosis. Since IgM antibodies are produced by the fetus in response to an infection, their detection is the most specific and direct way to diagnose toxoplasmosis in the fetus itself. Incorrect Responses: A. IgM antibodies against Toxoplasma in the mother – (Incorrect) While IgM antibodies in the mother can suggest a recent infection with Toxoplasma, this does not confirm fetal infection. IgM antibodies in the mother indicate acute maternal infection, but further testing is needed to confirm whether the infection has been transmitted to the fetus. C. IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma in the mother – (Incorrect) IgG antibodies in the mother indicate past exposure or immune response to Toxoplasma, but they do not provide information about whether the fetus has been infected. IgG antibodies can persist for months or years after an infection, making them less helpful for diagnosing acute fetal infection. D. IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma in the fetus – (Incorrect) The detection of IgG antibodies in the fetus would indicate that the fetus has been exposed to Toxoplasma, but it is not as diagnostic as IgM antibodies. IgG antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus, even if the fetus was not infected, meaning that IgG antibodies alone cannot definitively confirm fetal infection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Plasmodium vivax. B. Plasmodium vivax – (Correct) Plasmodium vivax is characterized by the presence of schizonts with a size of about 20 microns and 14-20 merozoites per cell. The yellow-brown pigment (malarial pigment) is also consistent with P. vivax. In P. vivax, the schizonts typically contain a large number of merozoites, which are often arranged in a rosette pattern. These features are distinctive in identifying P. vivax. A. Plasmodium falciparum – (Incorrect) While P. falciparum can also present with high-grade fever, its schizonts are usually smaller (less than 10 microns) and typically contain only 8-12 merozoites, not 14-20 as seen in this case. Additionally, the presence of all stages of parasites, including ring forms, is common in P. falciparum, but the schizonts described here do not match the characteristics of P. falciparum, which also does not typically show yellow-brown pigment in the same manner as P. vivax. C. Plasmodium malariae – (Incorrect) In Plasmodium malariae, the schizonts are generally smaller, usually around 10-12 microns, and contain fewer merozoites (6-12 merozoites per schizont). The presence of 14-20 merozoites and the size of the schizont here are more typical of P. vivax rather than P. malariae. The pigment in P. malariae also differs and tends to be less pronounced compared to the yellow-brown pigment seen in P. vivax. D. Plasmodium ovale – (Incorrect) Plasmodium ovale can cause malaria with similar symptoms, but its schizonts are typically smaller than those of P. vivax, usually around 12-15 microns. The merozoites in P. ovale tend to be fewer in number (around 8-12 per schizont) and do not exhibit the same large, rosette-like arrangement as those in P. vivax. The yellow-brown pigment may also not be as prominent in P. ovale as in P. vivax.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B, C) Due to ingestion of oocyst from cat's feces and C. Spiramycin given in pregnancy. B. Due to ingestion of oocyst from cat's feces – (Correct) Toxoplasmosis is primarily transmitted through the ingestion of oocysts, which are shed in the feces of infected cats. These oocysts can contaminate food, water, or soil, and when ingested, they can lead to an infection. The ingestion of undercooked meat from infected animals can also be a source of infection, but the oocyst transmission from cat feces is the more common route, especially in the environment. C. Spiramycin given in pregnancy – (Correct) Spiramycin is commonly used in the treatment of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, especially in the case of primary infection. It is considered to reduce the risk of congenital transmission of the parasite to the fetus, and it is the preferred treatment because it has a better safety profile in pregnant women. If the infection is diagnosed during pregnancy, spiramycin is given to reduce the risk of fetal infection and complications. A. Due to ingestion of sporocyst with meat – (Incorrect) While ingestion of undercooked or raw meat (especially pork, lamb, or goat) containing Toxoplasma cysts can lead to toxoplasmosis, the option of ingestion of sporocysts (which refers to a stage of the parasite in other species) is not correct here. The transmission is typically through the ingestion of tissue cysts (not sporocysts) in undercooked meat. Therefore, this option is misleading as the primary route involves cysts rather than sporocysts. D. Due to bite of Anopheles mosquito – (Incorrect) This option is completely incorrect. The transmission of toxoplasmosis is not related to mosquito bites. Anopheles mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of malaria (Plasmodium species), not toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is caused by a protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, and its transmission is related to ingestion of oocysts (from cat feces), contaminated food, or congenital transmission, not by mosquitoes. E. Mostly symptomatic – (Incorrect) In most cases, Toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic, especially in healthy individuals. When symptoms do occur, they are often mild and flu-like, including fever, fatigue, and muscle aches. It is more concerning for individuals who are immunocompromised (such as those with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients) and pregnant women, as it can cause severe complications. Therefore, toxoplasmosis is not usually symptomatic in the majority of healthy individuals.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Gametocyte. A. Gametocyte – (Correct) The infective stage for the mosquito in the case of Plasmodium vivax is the gametocyte. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected human, it ingests the gametocytes (the sexual form of the parasite) from the blood. Inside the mosquito’s stomach, the gametocytes mature into gametes, which then fertilize to form a zygote. The zygote then develops into an ookinete, which eventually transforms into an oocyst, and the sporozoites are produced in the oocyst. These sporozoites migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands, ready to be transmitted to another human during a subsequent bite. B. Sporozoite – (Incorrect) The sporozoite is the infective form of Plasmodium for humans, not mosquitoes. When a mosquito bites a human, it injects sporozoites into the bloodstream. These sporozoites travel to the liver, where they mature into merozoites, which later infect red blood cells. So, the sporozoite is the infective form for humans, but not for mosquitoes. C. Zygote – (Incorrect) The zygote is formed after the fertilization of the gametes inside the mosquito’s digestive system. However, it is not the infective stage for the mosquito. The zygote develops into an ookinete which then penetrates the mosquito's stomach wall and forms an oocyst. Therefore, the zygote is an intermediate form in the mosquito's lifecycle but not the infective stage. D. Merozoite – (Incorrect) The merozoite is the form of the parasite that infects human red blood cells, not the mosquito. After the sporozoites infect the liver, they mature and release merozoites into the bloodstream. These merozoites then invade red blood cells, causing the clinical symptoms of malaria. Thus, the merozoite is not the infective stage for mosquitoes.",

They lack mitochondria, and their life cycle involves a unique polar tubule that injects the infectious material into host cells. So, fungal classification is currently accepted. Incorrect Options: B. It is a protozoa Explanation: Microsporidia were once classified as protozoa due to their microscopic size and intracellular parasitism. However, they are no longer considered protozoa. Genetic evidence places them within or close to the fungal kingdom. C. It is a bacteria Explanation: Microsporidia are eukaryotic, not prokaryotic like bacteria. They have a nucleus, which bacteria lack. So they are not bacteria in any sense. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Protozoa. A. Protozoa – (Correct) Malaria is caused by a group of protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium. The specific species that cause malaria in humans are Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. These protozoans are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The malaria parasite goes through complex stages of development in both the human host and the mosquito vector. B. Mosquito – (Incorrect) The mosquito is not the causative agent of malaria but rather the vector that transmits the malaria-causing protozoan. Female Anopheles mosquitoes carry the malaria parasite in their salivary glands, and when they bite a human, they inject the parasite into the bloodstream. While mosquitoes are essential in the transmission of malaria, they are not the direct cause of the disease. C. Bacteria – (Incorrect) Malaria is not caused by bacteria. Bacteria are microorganisms that are different from protozoans, which are eukaryotic organisms. Although bacterial infections can cause a range of diseases, malaria is specifically caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. D. Virus – (Incorrect) Malaria is not caused by a virus. While viruses, bacteria, and protozoans are all types of pathogens that can cause diseases, malaria is specifically caused by protozoan parasites. A virus would typically cause a disease through different mechanisms, such as replication within host cells, which does not apply to malaria.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Trypanosome. A. Trypanosome – (Correct) Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is responsible for megaesophagus in humans. Chagas disease, which is transmitted by the triatomine bug (also known as the \"kissing bug\"), can lead to a condition known as Chagasic megasyphagus. This occurs due to the parasitic invasion and destruction of the autonomic nervous system, particularly the nerve ganglia in the esophagus. Over time, the loss of nerve function causes the esophagus to dilate, leading to swallowing difficulties, and can contribute to megaesophagus. Chagas disease is endemic to areas of Latin America. B. Ameba – (Incorrect) While Ameba (such as Entamoeba histolytica) causes amoebic dysentery and other intestinal diseases, it does not cause megaesophagus. Amebiasis is an intestinal infection and primarily leads to gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dysentery. It does not typically affect the esophagus or lead to its enlargement. C. Giardia – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia is a protozoan that causes giardiasis, a gastrointestinal infection characterized by diarrhea, cramping, and bloating. It infects the small intestine, but it does not lead to megaesophagus. Giardiasis does not have a direct effect on the esophagus or the nervous system in the same way that T. cruzi does. D. Gnathostoma – (Incorrect) Gnathostoma is a genus of parasitic nematodes, not protozoa. It causes a condition called gnathostomiasis, which is characterized by migrating larvae that can affect various tissues such as the skin, muscles, eyes, and sometimes the central nervous system. However, it is not associated with megaesophagus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chorioretinitis. A. Chorioretinitis – (Correct) Toxoplasma gondii infection in children, particularly those with congenital toxoplasmosis, is most commonly associated with chorioretinitis, an inflammation of the retina and choroid in the eye. This condition can lead to vision problems and, if untreated, potentially blindness. Chorioretinitis is a key clinical feature of congenital toxoplasmosis, often detected during routine pediatric screenings for children born to mothers with toxoplasmosis. B. Conjunctivitis – (Incorrect) While conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva) can occur due to many infectious agents, it is not a hallmark of Toxoplasma gondii infection. Toxoplasmosis more commonly causes chorioretinitis rather than conjunctivitis, which involves the deeper layers of the eye rather than the superficial conjunctiva. C. Keratitis – (Incorrect) Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) is not typically caused by Toxoplasma gondii. While keratitis is an inflammatory condition of the eye that can result from viral or bacterial infections, toxoplasmosis predominantly affects the retina and choroid rather than the cornea. Therefore, keratitis is not a common manifestation in children with Toxoplasma infection. D. Papillitis – (Incorrect) Papillitis, inflammation of the optic disc, is also not commonly associated with Toxoplasma gondii infection. Instead, the primary ocular manifestation of toxoplasmosis is chorioretinitis, which involves inflammation of both the retina and choroid.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Only cyst is infective. A. Only cyst is infective – (Correct) In Giardiasis, the infective stage of the parasite Giardia lamblia is the cyst. The cysts are hardy and can survive in the environment for long periods, allowing for transmission via contaminated water, food, or surfaces. When a person ingests the cysts, they pass through the stomach and then release the trophozoites in the small intestine, which can cause the symptoms of giardiasis, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and bloating. B. Reside in caecum – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia primarily resides in the small intestine, not the caecum. The parasites attach to the intestinal wall, typically in the duodenum and jejunum, where they can cause malabsorption and gastrointestinal distress. While some of the trophozoites may occasionally move into the large intestine, they do not specifically reside in the caecum. C. Only man to man transmission – (Incorrect) While Giardia lamblia can indeed spread through person-to-person contact, it is not limited to this route of transmission. The parasite is most commonly transmitted via fecal-oral routes, particularly through contaminated water. People can also contract giardiasis by ingesting cysts from contaminated food or surfaces, making waterborne transmission one of the most common methods of infection. D. Exists in one phase – (Incorrect) Giardia lamblia exists in two stages: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the active, motile stage that causes symptoms by attaching to the intestinal lining, while the cyst is the dormant, infective stage that can survive outside the host in the environment. Therefore, the parasite exists in two phases, not just one.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Absence of nuclear membrane. Explanation: A. Absence of nuclear membrane: Prokaryotes are characterized by the lack of a defined nucleus. Their genetic material, typically a single circular chromosome, is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane (unlike eukaryotes, where the nucleus is membrane-bound). This is a key distinguishing feature of prokaryotic cells. Incorrect responses: B. Presence of microvilli on its surface: Microvilli are specialized protrusions found on the surface of certain eukaryotic cells, such as epithelial cells, to increase surface area for absorption. Prokaryotes, on the other hand, do not have microvilli. They may have other surface structures like pili or flagella, but not microvilli. C. Presence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum: Prokaryotic cells do not possess membrane-bound organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is a structure found in eukaryotic cells involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification. Prokaryotes do not have a compartmentalized structure like the SER. D. All of the above: Since options B and C are incorrect, option D is also incorrect. Only A accurately describes a characteristic feature of prokaryotes.",

The most commonly used technique for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar) is a rapid immunochromatographic test for recombinant antigen rK39 from Leishmania infantum. This is widely available, rapid, and safe, requiring only a fingerprick of blood with results available in approximately 15 minutes. Although splenic aspiration with demonstration of amastigotes in tissue smear is the gold standard for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis and culture may increase the sensitivity, the test is invasive and may be dangerous in inexperienced hands. Polymerase chain reaction for the leishmaniasis nucleic acid is only available at specialized laboratories and is not routinely used clinically. Leishmaniasis is not diagnosed via stool analysis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Giardia lamblia The most likely causative organism in this case is Giardia lamblia, a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, a common waterborne diarrheal disease. The patient's symptoms, including foul-smelling, watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and steatorrhea (fatty deposits in stool), without fever or blood, are characteristic of giardiasis. The absence of fever suggests a non-inflammatory diarrheal process, and the presence of steatorrhea indicates malabsorption, which is a hallmark of Giardia infection. Giardiasis is acquired by ingesting cysts from contaminated water, particularly in campers, hikers, and those drinking untreated water. The trophozoites attach to the small intestinal mucosa, causing malabsorption and fatty diarrhea. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting trophozoites or cysts in stool via stool microscopy, antigen testing, or PCR. The treatment of choice is metronidazole. Incorrect Options: (A) Toxoplasma gondii – Incorrect. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite associated with toxoplasmosis, which primarily affects immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients) and can cause encephalitis, chorioretinitis, and congenital infections. It does not typically cause watery diarrhea with steatorrhea. (B) Enterococcus faecalis – Incorrect. Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium that is part of the normal gut flora but can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), endocarditis, and intra-abdominal infections. It does not typically cause foul-smelling, fatty diarrhea. (C) Shigella sonnei – Incorrect. Shigella sonnei is a cause of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis), which typically presents with bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps due to its invasive nature. Unlike Giardia, it does not cause steatorrhea or malabsorption.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cryptosporidium Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis, a gastrointestinal illness characterized by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, and low-grade fever. The infection is highly associated with contaminated water sources, including swimming pools, water parks, and recreational water bodies, making it a common cause of travel-related diarrhea. Why is Cryptosporidium the Correct Answer Mode of Transmission: Cryptosporidium is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, often through ingestion of contaminated water in pools, lakes, or drinking water. It is resistant to chlorine, which allows it to survive in well-maintained swimming pools. Clinical Presentation: Symptoms appear 7–10 days post-exposure (consistent with the family's timeline). It causes self-limiting diarrhea in immunocompetent individuals but can be severe and prolonged in immunocompromised patients. Ova and Parasite (O & P) Examination Findings: The stool sample was preserved in 10% formalin and concentrated using the formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) method, which is used to detect parasitic cysts, eggs, and oocysts. Modified Acid-Fast Staining: The image description suggests the presence of rounded, acid-fast-stained oocysts measuring 4.5–5.5 micrometers, which is characteristic of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Small size (4.5–5.5 µm) distinguishes Cryptosporidium from other protozoa. Incorrect Options and Explanations: (A) Acid-Fast Bacilli – Incorrect Acid-fast bacilli (AFB), such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are rod-shaped bacteria, not rounded oocysts. AFB staining is used for tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria, not for identifying protozoan parasites in stool samples. The given case involves diarrhea after swimming, which is not typical of tuberculosis. (B) Enterocytozoon – Incorrect Enterocytozoon (Enterocytozoon bieneusi) is a microsporidian parasite, which is an intracellular spore-forming fungus, not a protozoan. Microsporidia are best detected using modified trichrome staining, not acid-fast staining. They are also significantly smaller (1–2 µm) than Cryptosporidium and primarily cause chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised hosts. (D) Entamoeba histolytica – Incorrect Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic dysentery, characterized by bloody diarrhea, fever, and liver abscesses—not the watery diarrhea seen in cryptosporidiosis. Trophozoites and cysts of E. histolytica are larger (10–20 µm) and do not stain acid-fast. Diagnosis is confirmed by wet mount examination or trichrome staining, not modified acid-fast staining.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Plasmodium vivax Plasmodium vivax is a protozoan parasite that causes malaria, transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. The athlete, who declined malaria prophylaxis, developed fever, chills, and headache after returning from a malaria-endemic region (Brazil), which strongly suggests malaria. Blood smear examination using Wright’s stain is a crucial diagnostic tool for malaria. The key microscopic findings characteristic of P. vivax include: Enlarged infected RBCs with Schüffner’s dots (fine granules in the cytoplasm). Ring forms and ameboid trophozoites inside RBCs. Developing schizonts with 12–24 merozoites (a diagnostic feature of P. vivax). Round gametocytes (distinct from P. falciparum, which has crescent-shaped gametocytes). The incubation period for P. vivax is usually 10–17 days, but symptoms can appear earlier in some cases. This fits with the athlete experiencing symptoms two days after returning from the trip. Incorrect Answers: A. Plasmodium falciparum P. falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria. The blood smear typically shows multiple ring forms per RBC, banana-shaped gametocytes, and no Schüffner’s dots. P. falciparum does not cause RBC enlargement, unlike P. vivax. The athlete survived without mention of severe complications (such as cerebral malaria), which is more typical of P. vivax. C. Schistosoma mansoni S. mansoni is a trematode (fluke) that causes intestinal schistosomiasis, not malaria. It is diagnosed by detecting large, oval eggs with a lateral spine in stool samples, not blood smears. Symptoms of S. mansoni infection include diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and portal hypertension, not fever and chills shortly after travel. D. Trypanosoma gambiense T. gambiense causes African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), transmitted by the tsetse fly, not mosquitoes. Blood smears show flagellated trypomastigotes, which are extracellular, unlike the intracellular ring forms of Plasmodium. Symptoms develop over weeks to months, whereas this patient developed acute symptoms within days.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cryptosporidium: This 35-year-old AIDS patient with CD4 count < 200/µL presents with 2 weeks of watery, non-bloody diarrhea. The presence of oocysts in stool detected by acid-fast staining strongly suggests Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite that causes severe, chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium species (mainly C. parvum and C. hominis) are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water. In healthy individuals, infection is self-limiting, but in HIV/AIDS patients, it can cause prolonged, life-threatening diarrhea with malabsorption and dehydration. Diagnosis is confirmed using acid-fast staining, which reveals round oocysts in stool samples. Treatment includes nitazoxanide in immunocompetent patients, but in AIDS patients, antiretroviral therapy (ART) to improve immune function is key. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Acid-fast bacilli (AFB, e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium avium complex - MAC) Acid-fast bacilli refer to Mycobacteria, which do not present as oocysts in stool. MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex) can cause diarrhea in AIDS patients, but it is diagnosed by blood cultures or intestinal biopsy, not stool examination. Mycobacteria are rod-shaped bacteria, not oocysts, making this an incorrect answer. Option B: Enterocytozoon (Microsporidia: Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon spp.) Microsporidia are obligate intracellular fungi, also seen in AIDS patients with chronic diarrhea, but they are detected using modified trichrome stain, not acid-fast stain. Their spores are smaller than Cryptosporidium oocysts and do not match the described acid-fast positive oocysts in stool. Though microsporidiosis is a differential, Cryptosporidium is the most likely cause given the staining method used. Option D: Entamoeba histolytica E. histolytica causes amoebic dysentery, characterized by bloody diarrhea with flask-shaped ulcers in the colon, which is not seen here. Trophozoites or cysts of E. histolytica are identified in stool via wet mount or trichrome staining, not acid-fast stain. It does not form acid-fast oocysts, making it an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Giardiasis: This 5-year-old child presents with frequent, malodorous, mushy, and greasy stools (steatorrhea) along with abdominal pain but no fever. These symptoms strongly suggest malabsorption syndrome, which is characteristic of Giardia lamblia infection (Giardiasis). Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that infects the small intestine, leading to fat malabsorption due to damage to the intestinal brush border and disruption of bile salt function. It is transmitted via fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water sources, daycares, or poor hygiene. Common features of Giardiasis include: Foul-smelling, greasy diarrhea (steatorrhea) due to fat malabsorption No fever (Giardia does not invade the intestinal mucosa) Abdominal cramping, bloating, and flatulence Weight loss and nutritional deficiencies in chronic cases Diagnosis is made by detecting Giardia cysts or trophozoites in stool (via microscopy, antigen testing, or PCR). Metronidazole is the treatment of choice. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica) Entamoeba histolytica causes bloody diarrhea (dysentery) with mucus due to its invasive nature, leading to flask-shaped ulcers in the colon. It does not cause steatorrhea or significant fat malabsorption. This child’s lack of fever and absence of bloody stools makes amebiasis unlikely. Option C: Balantidiasis (Balantidium coli) Balantidium coli is a large, ciliated protozoan that causes balantidiasis, typically associated with pigs as a reservoir. It presents with bloody, mucoid diarrhea, similar to amebiasis, but not fatty, malodorous stools. This child has steatorrhea rather than bloody diarrhea, making this an incorrect choice. Option D: Enterobiasis (Enterobius vermicularis – pinworm infection) Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm) infection causes perianal itching, especially at night, but it does not cause diarrhea or fat malabsorption. The hallmark symptom is nocturnal pruritus ani, not greasy, malodorous stools. Since this patient’s main issue is malabsorption, Enterobius is not a likely cause.",
