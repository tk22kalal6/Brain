      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Vaccines sterilized by filtration Vaccines are often sterilized by filtration. This method is particularly used for heat-sensitive substances, such as vaccines, where heat sterilization could damage the components. Filtration allows the removal of microorganisms (including bacteria and fungi) by passing the liquid through a filter with a pore size small enough to trap these pathogens. This is a common method to sterilize biologically active substances like vaccines without altering their efficacy. Incorrect Options: A. Spores are destroyed by drying: Spores are very resilient structures, and drying alone is not an effective method for destroying them. Spores require much harsher conditions, such as high temperature (in an autoclave) or chemical sterilization to be completely eradicated. Drying would not provide sufficient destruction of spores. B. Soiled dressing is sterilized by hot air oven: Soiled dressings are not typically sterilized by a hot air oven. Hot air ovens are generally used for sterilizing dry instruments and glassware that are not sensitive to heat, not for soiled, moist materials like dressings. Autoclaving (steam sterilization) is the more commonly used method for sterilizing soiled dressings. C. Surgical instruments are sterilized by boiling: Boiling is not an ideal method for sterilizing surgical instruments. Boiling may kill most bacteria, but it does not ensure the complete destruction of more resistant organisms like spores. Autoclaving (steam sterilization at high pressure and temperature) is the standard and preferred method for sterilizing surgical instruments, as it guarantees thorough sterilization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cationic Cationic surface active disinfectants (also known as quaternary ammonium compounds or quats) are the most important and widely used disinfectants. They are effective in killing a wide range of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Their effectiveness comes from the positive charge on the cationic molecule, which interacts with the negatively charged bacterial cell membranes, disrupting them and causing cell death. This makes cationic compounds the most important class of surface-active disinfectants. Incorrect Options: A. Anionic: Anionic surfactants (e.g., soaps) are primarily used for cleaning purposes, as they help reduce surface tension and remove dirt and grease. While they have some antimicrobial properties, they are not as effective as cationic disinfectants in terms of killing microorganisms. Anionic surfactants are not considered the most important surface-active disinfectants. C. Non-ionic: Non-ionic surfactants are used in a variety of cleaning and detergent products but do not possess strong antimicrobial activity compared to cationic disinfectants. They are mainly used for their cleaning and emulsifying properties, rather than as primary disinfectants. D. Amphoteric compounds: Amphoteric surfactants have both positive and negative charges and can act as either cationic or anionic depending on the pH of the solution. While they have some disinfectant properties, they are generally less potent than cationic surfactants and are not considered the most important surface-active disinfectants.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 1% Phenol is bactericidal at a concentration of 1%. Phenol, also known as carbolic acid, is one of the earliest disinfectants used in medical practice, famously introduced by Joseph Lister to reduce surgical infections. At a concentration of 1%, phenol exhibits bactericidal properties, meaning it can effectively kill bacteria. It works by denaturing proteins and disrupting cell membranes, leading to leakage of cellular contents and eventual cell death. Lower concentrations may have bacteriostatic effects (inhibiting bacterial growth) but are not sufficient to achieve full bactericidal activity. This is why phenol’s effective use as a disinfectant relies on maintaining an adequate concentration, typically around 1% or higher. Incorrect Options: A. 0.1%: This concentration is too low to be bactericidal. At 0.1%, phenol may have minimal antimicrobial activity, but it is insufficient to kill bacteria. It might slow bacterial growth but won't achieve complete disinfection. B. 0.25%: Although slightly more concentrated than 0.1%, 0.25% phenol still lacks the potency needed for bactericidal action. It may show some bacteriostatic effects but is inadequate for eliminating bacterial populations effectively. C. 0.5%: At 0.5%, phenol demonstrates improved antimicrobial activity compared to lower concentrations, potentially causing some bacterial damage. However, it still falls short of the threshold required for consistent bactericidal effects. This concentration may partially inhibit bacterial growth but not completely kill the organisms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 2% w/v chlorhexidine 2% w/v chlorhexidine is considered the most ideal disinfectant for skin preparation prior to the insertion of a central venous catheter. This concentration, often combined with alcohol (e.g., 70% isopropyl alcohol), has been shown to be highly effective in reducing skin microbial flora and preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). Chlorhexidine has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. It disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to leakage of cellular contents and cell death. Additionally, chlorhexidine has residual activity, meaning it continues to inhibit microbial growth even after application, providing prolonged protection. This makes it superior to other antiseptics in critical care settings where infection control is paramount. Incorrect Options: A. Povidone iodine and alcohol: While povidone-iodine has broad antimicrobial activity, its efficacy is inferior to chlorhexidine, especially in preventing CRBSIs. It requires a longer contact time to be effective and lacks the prolonged residual activity that chlorhexidine provides. Moreover, its effectiveness can be reduced if not allowed to dry completely before catheter insertion. B. 0.4% w/v chlorhexidine: Although chlorhexidine is effective, a 0.4% concentration is too low to provide optimal antimicrobial action for invasive procedures. Higher concentrations, like 2%, offer better efficacy in reducing skin flora and preventing infections, particularly for central line insertions. D. Chlorhexidine and cetrimide: Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium compound with antiseptic properties, but when combined with chlorhexidine, its efficacy is not as well-documented for central venous catheter preparation compared to 2% chlorhexidine with alcohol. This combination lacks the strong evidence base that supports the use of 2% chlorhexidine-alcohol solutions for reducing CRBSI rates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The performance of steam sterilizer The Bowie-Dick test is specifically designed to assess the performance of a steam sterilizer, particularly its ability to remove air and allow steam penetration effectively. It is a type of chemical indicator test used in pre-vacuum (high-vacuum) steam sterilizers to detect issues like inadequate air removal, steam penetration failure, or the presence of air leaks. The test typically consists of a pack containing chemical indicator sheets that change color uniformly if the steam has properly penetrated the entire pack. Uneven color changes indicate poor air removal or steam distribution, signaling that the sterilizer may not be performing optimally. This makes the Bowie-Dick test an essential tool for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of sterilization cycles in healthcare settings. Incorrect Options: A. The efficiency of a steam sterilizer: While the Bowie-Dick test evaluates the performance of a steam sterilizer, it does not directly measure its efficiency in terms of sterilization outcomes (i.e., killing microorganisms). Instead, it focuses on the sterilizer's mechanical functions, such as air removal and steam penetration, which are prerequisites for effective sterilization but not a direct measure of microbial kill efficacy. C. The efficiency of a hot air oven: This is incorrect because the Bowie-Dick test is not designed for hot air ovens, which rely on dry heat for sterilization. Hot air ovens do not involve steam or vacuum processes, making the Bowie-Dick test irrelevant in assessing their efficiency. D. None: This option is incorrect because the Bowie-Dick test does serve a specific purpose—assessing the performance of steam sterilizers. It is widely used in hospitals and laboratories to ensure sterilizers are functioning correctly before processing medical instruments.",

These spores are highly resistant to moist heat, making them ideal for challenging the sterilization process. The principle behind using biological indicators is that if the sterilization cycle can kill these highly resistant spores, it will also be effective against less resistant microorganisms, ensuring proper sterilization. After exposure to the sterilization cycle, the spores are incubated to check for growth. No growth indicates successful sterilization, while any growth suggests sterilization failure. G. stearothermophilus is specifically suited for steam sterilizers due to its thermophilic nature, meaning it thrives at high temperatures, making it an accurate marker for steam-based processes. Incorrect Options: B. Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger: This organism (now reclassified as Bacillus atrophaeus) is used as a biological indicator for dry heat sterilization and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization, not steam sterilization. Its spores are more resistant to dry conditions, making them unsuitable for moist heat validation. C. Bacillus cereus: Although Bacillus cereus forms spores, it is not used as a biological indicator in sterilization processes. Its spores do not have the standardized resistance profiles required for reliable monitoring of sterilization efficacy. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Manual cleaning, disinfecting, rinsing Endoscopes should be disinfected through a process of manual cleaning, disinfecting, and rinsing. The cleaning process is critical to removing organic debris (such as blood or tissue) from the instrument. After cleaning, endoscopes must be thoroughly disinfected to ensure that any remaining microorganisms are killed or inactivated. The final step of rinsing ensures that all disinfectant residues are removed, preventing chemical damage or irritation to patients during subsequent use. This multi-step process is necessary because endoscopes come into direct contact with mucous membranes and bodily tissues, requiring thorough disinfection to prevent the transmission of infections. Incorrect Options: B. Manual cleaning and autoclaving: While manual cleaning is essential, autoclaving is generally not recommended for endoscopes because the high heat and pressure can damage the delicate components of the instrument, such as lenses, fibers, and seals. Endoscopes are usually disinfected via high-level disinfectants, not autoclaving, to preserve their functionality. C. 70% alcohol and rinsing: 70% alcohol is effective at disinfecting surfaces but is not sufficient to achieve high-level disinfection for medical instruments like endoscopes, especially when organic matter is present. Alcohol also does not penetrate biofilms or organic material effectively, and it should be part of a larger cleaning process that includes manual cleaning and appropriate disinfectants rather than being used alone. D. Sonication and rinsing: Sonication (using high-frequency sound waves to loosen debris) can be a useful adjunct in cleaning endoscopes, but it is not sufficient as the primary disinfection method. Sonication lacks the microbial kill necessary for high-level disinfection. It should be paired with manual cleaning and a chemical disinfectant for complete decontamination.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Practice proper hand washing Proper hand washing is the best method to prevent cross-infection in a post-operative care unit. Hand hygiene is the most effective way to reduce the transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. Healthcare workers' hands are often the primary vectors for transferring bacteria from one patient to another, especially after handling infected wounds or contaminated equipment. Practicing proper hand washing before and after patient contact, as well as after touching potentially contaminated surfaces, is critical to preventing the spread of infection to other patients in the ward. Hand hygiene is a cornerstone of infection control practices and is far more effective than other interventions in reducing the spread of hospital-associated infections. Incorrect Options: A. Give antibiotics to all other patients in the ward: While antibiotics are important for treating infections, indiscriminate use of antibiotics in all patients in the ward is not an appropriate measure. Antibiotic use should be targeted based on the specific infection, and overuse can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, antibiotics do not address the primary route of infection transmission, which is often through contaminated hands or surfaces. B. Fumigate the ward: Fumigation is not a suitable method for preventing the spread of infections in a hospital setting. It is unlikely to reach the specific areas of contamination, such as patient beds or medical equipment, and can be harmful to both patients and healthcare staff. The primary goal should be infection control through hygiene and barrier methods, such as proper cleaning and hand washing, rather than fumigation. C. Disinfect the ward with sodium hypochlorite: While disinfecting the ward with sodium hypochlorite can help kill bacteria on surfaces, it is not as effective in preventing cross-infection as proper hand hygiene. Sodium hypochlorite will not address the primary method of transmission, which is typically via healthcare workers' hands. Surface disinfection should be combined with hand hygiene and other practices, not used in isolation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Phenol usually requires organic matter to act This statement is incorrect because phenol is typically effective in the absence of organic matter. Phenol is a powerful disinfectant with broad-spectrum activity, and it does not rely on the presence of organic matter to exert its antimicrobial effects. While some disinfectants may have reduced efficacy in the presence of organic matter (such as blood, feces, or pus), phenol remains effective even when organic matter is present, which is one of the reasons it has historically been used as a standard disinfectant. Incorrect Options: A. Glutaraldehyde is sporicidal: Glutaraldehyde is indeed sporicidal, meaning it can kill bacterial spores. It is a high-level disinfectant that is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including spores of certain bacteria. This makes it suitable for disinfecting medical instruments that require high-level disinfection. B. Hypochlorites are virucidal: Hypochlorites, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach), are indeed virucidal. They are effective against a broad range of viruses, including enveloped viruses and many non-enveloped viruses. Hypochlorites are commonly used as disinfectants in healthcare settings because of their virucidal properties and ability to eliminate many types of pathogens. C. Ethylene glycol is intermediate disinfectant: Ethylene glycol is classified as an intermediate disinfectant because it has moderate germicidal activity. It is effective against some bacteria and viruses but is not as powerful as high-level disinfectants like glutaraldehyde or hydrogen peroxide. Intermediate disinfectants are typically used for disinfection of surfaces and instruments that do not require high-level disinfection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Internal sterilizing agent such as uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) The best way to prevent contamination of the PCR process is through the use of uracil N-glycosylase (UNG). This enzyme degrades any contaminating PCR products that contain uracil, which is incorporated into PCR products during the amplification process. By adding UNG to the PCR reaction mixture, any carryover DNA from previous amplifications that might contain uracil will be eliminated before amplification begins, thus preventing contamination and false positives. This is considered a highly effective method for ensuring clean and accurate PCR results. Incorrect Options: A. Use of biosafety cabinet: While a biosafety cabinet is important for preventing contamination in general laboratory procedures, it is not specific to preventing contamination in PCR. The biosafety cabinet is more of a safety measure to prevent exposure to hazardous materials or biohazards but does not address the issue of carryover contamination in PCR reactions. C. Use universal precautions: Universal precautions are intended for safety in handling biological samples and are important for infection control and preventing the spread of pathogens. However, they do not specifically address the issue of PCR contamination, which is a concern of false positives from carryover DNA or cross-contamination between samples. D. Clean the area with 1% sodium hypochlorite: 1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is indeed an effective disinfectant, and it is commonly used for cleaning surfaces to reduce contamination risks. However, while it can help reduce surface contamination, it does not address the specific issue of contamination in PCR reactions caused by carryover products. The use of UNG directly addresses the internal contamination of the PCR process.",

Phenol is classified as a membrane-disrupting agent, and it is commonly used as a disinfectant because of its ability to break down the lipid bilayer of cell membranes in a wide range of microorganisms. Incorrect Options: A. Formic acid: Formic acid is a type of organic acid that is more commonly known for its ability to lower pH, which can disrupt microbial cellular processes. While it can be bactericidal at high concentrations, it does not primarily function by interfering with membrane functions, so it is not the correct answer in this case. B. Hydrogen peroxide: Hydrogen peroxide works by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative damage to various cellular components, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. It does not primarily affect microbial cell membranes but instead leads to oxidative stress, making it less relevant to the mechanism described in the question. C. Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is a strong alkylating agent that inactivates proteins and nucleic acids by cross-linking them. Its primary mechanism of action is not by disrupting the membrane but by altering the structure of cellular proteins and nucleic acids. While formaldehyde is a potent disinfectant, it works through a different mode of action than membrane disruption. E. Ethylene oxide: Ethylene oxide is a gas used as a sterilant that works by alkylating DNA and proteins. It does not primarily act on the cell membrane but instead interferes with the genetic material and cellular functions by forming covalent bonds with the nucleophilic groups on biomolecules.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prion The correct answer is B because prions are the most resistant to antiseptics and standard disinfection methods. Prions are misfolded proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Unlike other infectious agents, prions lack nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), which makes them highly resilient to conventional sterilization techniques, including heat, radiation, and chemical disinfectants. Even methods that effectively destroy bacteria, viruses, and spores often fail against prions. Specialized protocols, such as prolonged exposure to sodium hypochlorite, strong alkalis, or autoclaving at higher temperatures and longer durations, are required to inactivate prions effectively. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Spore – Incorrect While bacterial spores (e.g., from Bacillus or Clostridium species) are extremely resistant to heat, desiccation, and chemicals due to their thick protective coats, they are less resistant than prions. Autoclaving and strong disinfectants like glutaraldehyde can effectively destroy spores under proper conditions. C. Cyst – Incorrect Cysts, such as those of protozoa (Giardia, Entamoeba), are resistant to harsh environments, including disinfectants like chlorine. However, they are still susceptible to higher concentrations of disinfectants and prolonged exposure, making them less resistant than prions and spores. D. Fungus – Incorrect Fungi and fungal spores are relatively easy to eliminate with common antiseptics like alcohols, iodine, and antifungal agents. They lack the protective structures seen in bacterial spores or cysts, making them the least resistant among the options provided.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 2% Glutaraldehyde for 20 min The correct answer is B because 2% glutaraldehyde is the most appropriate disinfectant for high-level disinfection (HLD) of semi-critical instruments like bronchoscopes. Semi-critical devices come into contact with mucous membranes or non-intact skin and require disinfection that eliminates all microorganisms, except high levels of bacterial spores. Glutaraldehyde is a potent chemical disinfectant that can effectively kill bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses within 20 minutes of exposure. It is widely used for flexible endoscopes because it does not damage delicate equipment and is effective against resistant organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. 70% Alcohol for 5 min – Incorrect This option is incorrect because 70% alcohol (usually ethanol or isopropanol) is effective as an intermediate-level disinfectant. It works well for disinfecting surfaces and small instruments but is not sufficient for semi-critical devices like bronchoscopes, as it cannot reliably kill all viruses, mycobacteria, or bacterial spores. C. 2% Formaldehyde for 10 min – Incorrect This is incorrect because although formaldehyde is a strong disinfectant and sterilant, it is not preferred for endoscopes due to its toxic fumes, carcinogenic potential, and longer exposure times required for effective disinfection. It is also less compatible with delicate medical equipment compared to glutaraldehyde. D. 1% Sodium Hypochlorite for 15 min – Incorrect This option is incorrect because 1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is effective against a broad range of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, but it is corrosive to metal and sensitive instruments like endoscopes. It can damage the delicate structure of bronchoscopes and is typically used for surface disinfection or decontaminating blood spills rather than for medical equipment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ethylene Oxide Gas The correct answer is D because ethylene oxide (EO) gas is the most effective method for sterilizing heat-labile instruments, which cannot withstand high temperatures used in traditional sterilization methods like autoclaving. Ethylene oxide is a potent sterilizing agent that works by alkylating the DNA and proteins of microorganisms, effectively killing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and even spores. It is ideal for sterilizing delicate medical equipment, including plastics, electronics, and complex devices with lumens, without causing any heat-related damage. Although it requires proper aeration post-sterilization to remove toxic residues, it remains the gold standard for sterilizing heat-sensitive surgical instruments. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Absolute Alcohol – Incorrect This option is incorrect because absolute alcohol (usually 95-100% ethanol) is not a sterilizing agent. It can act as a disinfectant, effectively killing bacteria and some viruses, but it does not destroy bacterial spores or provide complete sterilization, which is essential for surgical instruments. B. 2% Glutaraldehyde for 2 hrs – Incorrect While 2% glutaraldehyde is a high-level disinfectant and can achieve sporocidal activity with prolonged exposure, it is generally considered a chemical disinfectant rather than a sterilizing agent. It does not guarantee complete sterilization, especially for critical instruments used in surgical procedures, where sterility is mandatory. C. Chlorine Releasing Compounds – Incorrect This option is incorrect because chlorine-releasing compounds (like sodium hypochlorite) are effective disinfectants, primarily used for surface disinfection and decontamination of spills. They are corrosive to metals and can damage delicate surgical instruments. Moreover, they are not reliable for sterilization, as they may not eliminate all spores and microorganisms on medical devices.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 49–63°C The correct answer is B because the operating temperature during the warm cycle of ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization typically ranges between 49–63°C. This temperature range is optimal for enhancing the penetration and activity of EO gas, ensuring effective sterilization of heat-labile medical equipment. EO sterilization relies not only on temperature but also on factors like gas concentration, humidity, and exposure time. The warm cycle facilitates faster microbial inactivation, including bacterial spores, while still being safe for delicate instruments that cannot tolerate the higher temperatures used in steam sterilization. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. 20–35°C – Incorrect This option is incorrect because temperatures in the 20–35°C range are considered part of the “cold cycle” EO sterilization, which is less commonly used due to its longer exposure time and reduced efficiency. While EO can still be effective at lower temperatures, it is not the standard for the warm cycle. C. 68–88°C – Incorrect This option is incorrect because temperatures between 68–88°C are too high for EO sterilization, especially when dealing with heat-sensitive instruments. Such high temperatures may compromise the integrity of delicate medical devices and are unnecessary for EO’s sterilizing action. D. 92–110°C – Incorrect This option is incorrect because temperatures in this range approach the conditions used in steam sterilization (autoclaving), which EO sterilization is specifically designed to avoid. EO is chosen for its effectiveness at lower temperatures, making this range unsuitable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Radiation The correct answer is B because radiation, specifically gamma radiation, is the most appropriate method for sterilizing catgut sutures. Catgut is a natural, absorbable suture material derived from the intestines of sheep or cattle, making it sensitive to heat and moisture. Gamma radiation provides effective sterilization by causing irreversible damage to the DNA of microorganisms, ensuring the elimination of bacteria, viruses, and spores without compromising the mechanical strength, flexibility, or absorption properties of the suture. This method is widely used in the medical industry for sterilizing disposable medical supplies, including sutures, syringes, and surgical instruments. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Steam – Incorrect This option is incorrect because steam sterilization (autoclaving) involves high temperatures (121–134°C) and pressure, which can damage the protein structure of catgut, leading to loss of tensile strength and altered absorption properties. Catgut is heat-labile, making steam sterilization unsuitable. C. Boiling – Incorrect This option is incorrect because boiling is not a reliable method for sterilization. It may kill vegetative bacteria but is ineffective against bacterial spores and some viruses. Additionally, boiling can weaken the catgut fibers, affecting their performance as sutures. D. Burning – Incorrect This option is clearly incorrect because burning would completely destroy the catgut suture material. It is not a sterilization technique but rather a method of incineration, which is used for the disposal of waste, not for preparing surgical materials for use.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bronchoscope The correct answer is C because radiation sterilization (typically gamma radiation) is not suitable for delicate instruments like a bronchoscope. Although radiation can be effective for sterilizing single-use items or heat-sensitive materials (e.g., sutures, bone grafts), it is not recommended for complex medical devices such as a bronchoscope due to the risk of damaging sensitive components like lenses, electronics, and flexible fibers. The high energy from radiation can affect the structural integrity and functionality of such delicate instruments, making them unsuitable for subsequent clinical use. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Bone Graft – Correct Bone grafts are radiation-sterilized in the medical field because gamma radiation can effectively sterilize them without compromising their biological properties. It is commonly used to sterilize allografts (donor bone tissue) before implantation, ensuring they are free of pathogens without affecting their viability. B. Suture – Correct Sutures, particularly absorbable sutures like catgut or synthetic materials, are routinely sterilized using gamma radiation because it is non-thermal, which prevents damage to the sutures' mechanical properties. It is an ideal method for sterilizing single-use surgical products. D. Artificial Tissue Graft – Correct Artificial tissue grafts (such as vascular grafts or skin substitutes) can also be sterilized using radiation because it allows for thorough sterilization without the risks associated with heat-based methods.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chlorhexidine The correct answer is D because Chlorhexidine is not used for sputum disinfection. While it is an effective antiseptic for cleaning wounds and for skin disinfection, it is not effective for disinfecting sputum. Sputum contains a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and mycobacteria, and requires stronger disinfectants or sterilization methods to ensure the pathogens are effectively killed. Chlorhexidine does not have the necessary sporocidal properties or effectiveness against all respiratory pathogens found in sputum. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Autoclaving – Correct Autoclaving is a highly effective method for sterilizing biological materials like sputum. It uses high-pressure steam at temperatures of around 121°C, which can kill all microorganisms, including bacteria, spores, and viruses. Autoclaving is the preferred method for sterilizing items that are contaminated with sputum, particularly in clinical settings. B. Cresol – Correct Cresol, a phenolic compound, is a strong disinfectant and is effective for disinfecting biological waste, including sputum. It can eliminate a wide range of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Cresol is commonly used in healthcare settings for surface disinfection and for treating biological waste. C. Boiling – Correct Boiling sputum in water is an effective method for disinfection. Boiling for 10–20 minutes can kill most vegetative bacteria and viruses, though it may not eliminate all spores. It is a practical method for decontaminating sputum in environments where autoclaving is not available, but it is less effective for complete sterilization compared to autoclaving.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Geobacillus stearothermophilus The correct answer is B because Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as the biological indicator for autoclave sterilization. This bacterium is highly resistant to heat, making it an ideal organism to test the effectiveness of the autoclaving process. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are designed to survive high temperatures that are normally used in autoclaves, and if the autoclave successfully sterilizes the load, the spores are killed. The presence or absence of bacterial growth in a culture medium after autoclaving indicates whether sterilization conditions were met. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Clostridium tetani – Incorrect Clostridium tetani is the causative agent of tetanus, and while it is a spore-forming bacterium, it is not used as a standard biological indicator in autoclaving. The spores of Clostridium tetani are not as resistant to heat as Geobacillus stearothermophilus, which makes it less reliable for testing autoclave efficacy. C. Bacillus pumilus – Incorrect Bacillus pumilus is a spore-forming bacterium but is typically used for testing dry heat sterilization rather than autoclaving. It is not the standard organism for autoclave validation because it is not as heat-resistant at 121°C as Geobacillus stearothermophilus. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ethylene Oxide The correct answer is B because ethylene oxide (EO) is the most commonly used method for sterilizing disposable plastic syringes. Ethylene oxide is a gas sterilization method that is particularly effective for heat-sensitive and moisture-sensitive materials, such as plastic syringes. This method works by penetrating the material and effectively killing microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and spores, without the risk of damaging the plastic. EO sterilization is widely used for medical devices like syringes, catheters, and implants that cannot withstand the high temperatures of autoclaving. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Formaldehyde – Incorrect Formaldehyde is a chemical sterilant that can be used for sterilizing some medical equipment, but it is less commonly used for syringes due to its toxicity and potential for residue. While effective, it is not preferred for sterilizing disposable syringes, as it requires careful handling and ventilation. Ethylene oxide is a safer and more efficient choice for these types of devices. C. Hexachloride – Incorrect Hexachloride, particularly hexachlorophene, is an antimicrobial agent but is not used for sterilizing syringes. It is a disinfectant used in certain cleaning agents but does not offer the full sterilization needed for medical devices. It's not suitable for deep sterilization or treating equipment like syringes that need to be completely free of all microorganisms. D. UV Radiation – Incorrect UV radiation is effective for surface sterilization and disinfection but is not ideal for sterilizing syringes. UV light has limited penetration power, which means it cannot effectively sterilize the entire volume of a syringe or reach inner surfaces that may harbor pathogens. While useful for some applications like air or water purification, UV radiation is not suitable for thorough sterilization of medical devices like syringes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Steam at 121°C for 15 minutes, 15 lb pressure The correct answer is C because autoclaving is performed using steam at 121°C for 15 minutes under 15 lb pressure (approximately 2 bar). This combination of temperature, pressure, and time ensures that microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and spores, are effectively killed through moist heat. The high pressure allows the steam to reach and maintain a higher temperature than boiling water, which is essential for sterilization. Autoclaving is the most common and reliable method used for sterilizing medical equipment and laboratory tools. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Dry air at 121°C and 15 lb pressure – Incorrect This option is incorrect because dry heat is not used for autoclaving. Autoclaving relies on moist heat (steam), which is more effective at killing microorganisms. Dry heat sterilization at 121°C would require much longer exposure times, and it is less efficient than steam sterilization. B. Steam at 100°C for 30 minutes – Incorrect While steam is used in autoclaving, 100°C is not sufficient for sterilization. At 100°C, steam is not under pressure, and the time required to achieve sterilization would be much longer than 30 minutes. In autoclaving, steam is at 121°C, and sterilization at this temperature is achieved much faster, usually within 15 minutes. D. Dry air at 160°C for 30 minutes – Incorrect This describes dry heat sterilization, not autoclaving. While dry heat at 160°C can be effective for sterilizing certain materials, it is not used in the autoclaving process, which relies on steam at 121°C under pressure. Dry heat sterilization is typically used for materials that cannot withstand moisture, like powders or certain glassware, and usually requires longer exposure times (e.g., 2 hours at 160°C).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Autoclaving The correct answer is A because autoclaving is the most common and reliable method for sterilizing culture media. Autoclaving uses steam under pressure at 121°C for 15-20 minutes to achieve sterilization. This process is highly effective in killing bacteria, fungi, and spores without altering the chemical composition or effectiveness of the culture medium. It is routinely used in laboratories for sterilizing agar-based media, broths, and other materials that need to be sterile for microbiological cultures. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Radiation – Incorrect Radiation is a method of sterilization that is typically used for heat-sensitive materials, such as plastic equipment, medical devices, and certain pharmaceuticals. However, culture media are usually sterilized with heat, as they are not typically susceptible to radiation, and autoclaving is far more effective for ensuring sterility in media. Radiation is not the standard for sterilizing culture media. C. Hot air oven – Incorrect The hot air oven sterilization method is used primarily for dry heat sterilization and is not commonly used for culture media, especially those that contain agar or other moisture-sensitive components. The hot air oven works at temperatures of 160-180°C and is better suited for sterilizing items like glassware and metal tools, which can withstand dry heat. Culture media are typically sterilized through moist heat (autoclaving) rather than dry heat. D. Tyndallisation – Incorrect Tyndallisation is a process involving intermittent steaming at temperatures of about 100°C, followed by cooling, and repeated for 3 days. It is primarily used for sterilizing liquids or media that cannot withstand the high temperatures of autoclaving. However, it is a less efficient and more time-consuming method than autoclaving, which is why it is not routinely used for sterilizing culture media in modern microbiology labs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hot air oven The correct answer is B because glassware and syringes (especially those that are heat-resistant) are typically sterilized using a hot air oven. This method involves dry heat sterilization at temperatures ranging from 160°C to 180°C for a duration of 1-2 hours. It is particularly effective for sterilizing materials that can withstand high temperatures without degrading, such as glassware, metal instruments, and certain plastic items. The hot air oven is ideal for items that cannot tolerate moisture (as in autoclaving) and provides thorough sterilization without the risk of damage. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Autoclave – Incorrect Although the autoclave is a widely used sterilization method, it is typically used for moist heat sterilization, which is effective for most liquid media, surgical instruments, and heat-resistant plastic. However, it is not the ideal choice for glassware and syringes that could potentially be damaged by the moisture and pressure in an autoclave. Dry heat sterilization in a hot air oven is the preferred method for such items. C. Ethylene oxide – Incorrect Ethylene oxide (EO) is a gas sterilization method used for heat-sensitive and moisture-sensitive medical devices, such as plastics, electronic equipment, and some surgical instruments. While it is effective for sterilizing items that cannot withstand high heat, it is not used for glassware and syringes, as they are typically sterilized by dry heat or autoclaving, depending on the material's resistance to moisture. D. Irradiation – Incorrect Irradiation is another sterilization method that uses gamma rays or electron beams to kill microorganisms. It is typically used for sterilizing single-use items like surgical dressings or plastics but is not commonly used for sterilizing glassware and syringes. Hot air oven sterilization is more practical for these items, especially when they are resistant to heat.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Absence of pathogenic microbes The correct answer is A because asepsis refers to the absence of pathogenic microorganisms in a specific area or on an object, ensuring that no harmful microbes are present to cause infection. It is a key concept in medical and surgical settings to maintain a sterile environment and prevent infection. Asepsis is achieved through methods like sterilization, disinfection, and maintaining clean practices to avoid contamination by harmful microorganisms. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Disinfection of the surface – Incorrect Disinfection of the surface refers to cleaning or treating surfaces with disinfectants to reduce or eliminate pathogens. While important for infection control, disinfection does not necessarily achieve the complete absence of all microorganisms, especially spores. Asepsis involves a broader concept of preventing pathogenic microbes from being present, not just reducing their numbers on surfaces. C. Prevention of infection – Incorrect Prevention of infection is a general term that refers to practices and strategies aimed at avoiding infections, such as using antiseptics, vaccines, and antibiotics. While aseptic techniques contribute to infection prevention, asepsis specifically means the absence of pathogens, which is a more specific goal in maintaining sterility. Asepsis is one of the methods used to prevent infection, but it is not synonymous with the broader concept of infection prevention. D. Destroying all forms of microorganisms – Incorrect This option describes sterilization, which involves the complete destruction or removal of all forms of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores. While asepsis helps maintain a pathogen-free environment, it does not necessarily involve the complete destruction of all microorganisms as sterilization does. Asepsis focuses more on ensuring the absence of pathogenic microbes rather than total eradication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Plastic Syringes The correct answer is A because gamma radiation is commonly used for sterilizing heat-sensitive items, such as plastic syringes and medical devices that cannot withstand the high temperatures of autoclaving or dry heat sterilization. Gamma radiation is effective in killing microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and spores, without damaging the material of the syringe. This method of sterilization is preferred for items made of plastic, which are sensitive to heat. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Cystoscopes – Incorrect Cystoscopes, which are used for endoscopic procedures, are typically sterilized using methods such as autoclaving or ethylene oxide gas, as these instruments are more complex and often require thorough cleaning and sterilization techniques that preserve their delicate components. Gamma radiation is generally not used for sterilizing surgical instruments like cystoscopes, as they are typically designed for reusability and can tolerate high temperatures or gas sterilization. C. Dressing aprons – Incorrect Dressing aprons, often made from fabric or protective materials, are typically disinfected or laundered rather than sterilized with gamma radiation. The primary concern for these items is cleaning rather than sterilization, as they do not usually come into contact with sterile fields or directly with patients' internal tissues. Autoclaving or disinfecting with chemical agents is more common for this type of item. D. Metal instruments – Incorrect Metal instruments, such as scalpels or forceps, are typically sterilized using methods like autoclaving or dry heat. These sterilization methods are suitable because metal instruments can withstand high temperatures and pressures. Gamma radiation is not usually applied to metal instruments as they do not require the low-temperature sterilization that radiation offers, and other methods are more commonly used for ensuring the instruments are fully sterilized.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sterilization The correct answer is D because sterilization is the process that involves the complete destruction or removal of all microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores. Sterilization ensures that no viable microorganisms remain on an object or surface, making it completely sterile. This process can be achieved through various methods such as autoclaving, gamma radiation, dry heat, or the use of ethylene oxide gas. It is the highest level of microbial control. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Disinfection – Incorrect Disinfection is a process that reduces the number of pathogenic microorganisms to a level that is not harmful to health, but it does not eliminate all microbes, especially not spores. Disinfection is typically used for cleaning surfaces or non-critical instruments and is less thorough than sterilization. It cannot guarantee the destruction of all microbial life. B. Antisepsis – Incorrect Antisepsis refers to the process of applying antiseptics (substances that prevent the growth or kill microorganisms) to living tissue such as skin or mucous membranes to prevent infection. Antisepsis does not guarantee the complete destruction of all microorganisms, particularly spores, and is not as thorough as sterilization, which is used for inanimate objects. C. Disinfestation – Incorrect Disinfestation is the process of removing or destroying pests, such as insects or rodents, rather than microorganisms. It does not refer to the destruction of microbes but rather to the elimination of larger organisms that can cause contamination or harm. Thus, disinfestation is not related to microbial control in the same way as sterilization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dry heat is the best method of sterilization of liquid paraffin The correct answer is A because dry heat is the most suitable method for sterilizing liquid paraffin. Liquid paraffin is heat stable but can be damaged by moisture, which makes dry heat sterilization preferable. Dry heat effectively sterilizes substances that are sensitive to moisture, and it works by causing oxidation and denaturation of microbial proteins, leading to the destruction of microorganisms, including spores, without altering the properties of the liquid paraffin. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. All glass syringes are best sterilized by boiling at 100°C – Incorrect Boiling at 100°C is not the most effective method for sterilizing glass syringes. Autoclaving, which uses steam under pressure at temperatures of 121°C for 15 minutes, is the preferred method for sterilizing glass syringes. Boiling does not reach the high enough temperatures to ensure complete sterilization, especially for spores or more resistant microorganisms. C. Bacterial vaccines are best sterilized by ethylene oxide – Incorrect Ethylene oxide is used for sterilizing heat-sensitive medical devices (e.g., plastics and delicate instruments), but it is not the preferred method for sterilizing bacterial vaccines. Vaccines are typically sterilized by filtration or other methods that do not involve exposure to potentially toxic gases like ethylene oxide, which can interfere with the vaccine’s integrity and effectiveness. D. Pasteurization of milk by flash method is done by heating at 63°C for 30 minutes – Incorrect The flash pasteurization method involves heating milk to 72°C for 15-20 seconds, not 63°C for 30 minutes. The lower temperature and longer time described in this option is more typical of the low-temperature, long-time (LTLT) method. Flash pasteurization is designed to kill harmful microorganisms while preserving the milk’s flavor and nutrients, and it is typically achieved at a higher temperature for a much shorter duration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Inspissation The correct answer is D because inspissation is a method used to sterilize culture media containing serum. This method involves slow heating of the media at a temperature of about 80°C for several hours, allowing the serum to retain its integrity while also sterilizing the medium. This is a gentler process compared to autoclaving, which could denature the proteins in the serum due to the higher temperatures and pressure involved. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Autoclaving – Incorrect Autoclaving involves high pressure and temperature (usually 121°C for 15 minutes), which can denature proteins, including those found in serum. Therefore, autoclaving is not suitable for sterilizing culture media containing serum, as it can compromise the nutrient quality and effectiveness of the medium. B. Micropore filter – Incorrect While micropore filtration is effective for sterilizing solutions that do not contain heat-sensitive components, it cannot sterilize media with serum. Filtration removes microorganisms by physically trapping them, but it does not remove viruses or some bacteria, and it may not be effective for the complex components found in serum, which could still harbor microorganisms or degrade over time. C. Gamma radiation – Incorrect Gamma radiation is used for sterilizing items that are sensitive to heat, such as plastics, but it is not commonly used for sterilizing culture media with serum. The radiation could affect the serum proteins, and although effective for sterilizing, it is generally more expensive and less frequently used than other methods such as inspissation or filtration for this particular purpose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Glutaraldehyde The correct answer is A because glutaraldehyde is commonly used for the sterilization of fiber optic bronchoscopes. These delicate medical instruments are heat-sensitive, and autoclaving would damage the fibers. Glutaraldehyde is a cold sterilizing agent that can effectively disinfect or sterilize medical equipment without using heat. It is particularly suitable for fiber optic devices that may be damaged by high temperatures or steam. The instrument is usually immersed in a 2% glutaraldehyde solution for a required period to ensure complete sterilization. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Chlorine – Incorrect Chlorine is a strong disinfectant, but it is not typically used for sterilizing fiber optic bronchoscopes. It can be too harsh and corrosive for such sensitive instruments, leading to potential damage to the fibers or other delicate components. Therefore, chlorine is not an appropriate choice for sterilization of these types of medical equipment. C. Autoclave – Incorrect An autoclave uses high temperature and pressure (usually 121°C) to sterilize instruments. However, fiber optic bronchoscopes are heat-sensitive and can be damaged by the intense heat and pressure of the autoclave. Autoclaving is therefore not suitable for sterilizing these devices, as it could render them unusable. D. Phenol – Incorrect Phenol is a disinfectant and can be used to disinfect certain surfaces, but it is not typically used for sterilizing fiber optic bronchoscopes. Phenol may not provide the level of sterilization required for delicate medical instruments, and it can be toxic or corrosive to some materials. Moreover, it is less commonly used than other disinfectants like glutaraldehyde for this purpose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hot air oven The correct answer is B because glassware is best sterilized using a hot air oven. The hot air oven operates by dry heat at a temperature of around 160–180°C for a specific period (usually 1-2 hours), which is effective for sterilizing glassware. Glass can withstand high temperatures, and the dry heat ensures that any microbial life, including bacterial spores, is completely eliminated without damaging the glassware. This method is particularly suitable for heat-stable items that do not contain moisture. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Boiling – Incorrect Boiling at 100°C is not sufficient to sterilize glassware because it does not reach the necessary sterilization temperature or provide enough time to kill all microbial organisms, particularly spores. Boiling can disinfect, but it does not meet the rigorous standards for sterilization, which require higher temperatures and more controlled conditions. C. Heating – Incorrect Heating by itself is an unspecified method and can be ineffective in ensuring complete sterilization. For sterilization, a specific method like hot air or autoclaving is required to reach temperatures that reliably kill microbial life. Simply heating glassware without a defined temperature or time frame will not ensure proper sterilization. D. None – Incorrect The statement \"None\" is incorrect because there is a well-established method for sterilizing glassware: hot air oven sterilization. Therefore, \"None\" cannot be considered a correct option.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ethylene oxide The correct answer is B because ethylene oxide is commonly used to sterilize disposable plastic syringes. Ethylene oxide is a gas sterilization method that is effective for sterilizing heat-sensitive items, such as plastic syringes. It is able to penetrate materials without damaging them, making it ideal for sterilizing plastic and other delicate items that cannot withstand the high temperatures required for methods like autoclaving. This method is also widely used in the medical industry due to its effectiveness and ability to sterilize in a relatively short time. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Formaldehyde – Incorrect Formaldehyde can be used as a disinfectant, but it is not commonly used for the sterilization of disposable plastic syringes. It can be toxic and irritating, which makes it unsuitable for direct contact with medical equipment that comes in contact with patients. Moreover, ethylene oxide is more effective and widely accepted for sterilizing disposable plastics. C. Hexachloride – Incorrect Hexachloride is not a recognized sterilizing agent and is not used for sterilizing medical equipment like plastic syringes. It may be a disinfectant for specific uses but is not appropriate for the sterilization of medical devices. D. UV radiation – Incorrect UV radiation can be used for disinfection, but it does not provide the necessary sterilization for medical items like disposable syringes. UV radiation is often limited to surface sterilization and cannot penetrate materials like plastic thoroughly enough to ensure full sterilization, especially for items that will be used in medical procedures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Autoclave + Sodium hydroxide The correct answer is C because prions are highly resistant to standard sterilization methods like autoclaving or chemical disinfectants. However, the combination of autoclaving at 134°C with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is effective in killing prions. Sodium hydroxide is a strong alkaline substance that aids in denaturing prion proteins, and when used in combination with high-temperature autoclaving, it is able to break down the prions, which are normally resistant to conventional disinfection methods. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Autoclaving at 121°C – Incorrect Autoclaving at 121°C alone is not sufficient to destroy prions. Prions are known for their resilience and require higher temperatures (typically 134°C) for effective inactivation. Standard autoclaving at 121°C may not break down the prions completely. B. 5% formalin – Incorrect Formalin (a solution of formaldehyde in water) is an effective disinfectant for many microorganisms, but it does not reliably kill prions. Prions are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants like formalin and require more aggressive methods (like autoclaving with sodium hydroxide) for complete destruction. D. Sodium hypochlorite – Incorrect While sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is effective against many bacteria, viruses, and fungi, it is not reliable for destroying prions. Prions are much more resistant to chemical agents like sodium hypochlorite, and therefore, stronger decontamination procedures, such as autoclaving with sodium hydroxide, are needed.",
