      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pulsatile tinnitus. Meniere’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear caused by endolymphatic hydrops (excessive accumulation of endolymph in the cochlea and vestibular system). The tinnitus associated with Meniere’s disease is typically low-pitched, roaring, or buzzing, and non-pulsatile. Pulsatile tinnitus, on the other hand, is often associated with vascular disorders (e.g., arteriovenous malformations, carotid artery stenosis, or glomus tumors) and is not a characteristic feature of Meniere’s disease. Incorrect Options: A. Sensorineural Deafness Meniere’s disease leads to progressive sensorineural hearing loss due to damage to the cochlea. Initially, hearing loss is fluctuating and affects low frequencies, but as the disease progresses, it may become permanent and involve all frequencies. B. Vertigo Episodic vertigo is a hallmark of Meniere’s disease. The vertigo episodes are spontaneous, last from 20 minutes to several hours, and are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The episodes are due to excessive endolymph affecting the vestibular system. D. Fluctuating Deafness Hearing loss in Meniere’s disease is fluctuating, meaning it can worsen and improve over time, especially in the early stages. This fluctuation is a key distinguishing feature from other causes of sensorineural hearing loss, such as presbycusis or noise-induced hearing loss, which are typically progressive and non-fluctuating.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Low-frequency sensorineural deafness is often seen in pure-tone audiogram. A classical feature of Meniere’s disease is low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which can be identified on a pure-tone audiogram (PTA). In the early stages, hearing loss is fluctuating and primarily affects low frequencies (250 Hz–1000 Hz) due to endolymphatic hydrops affecting the cochlear basal turn. As the disease progresses, hearing loss may become permanent and involve all frequencies, but early cases show a distinctive upward-sloping audiogram (better hearing at high frequencies). This distinguishes Meniere’s disease from presbycusis or noise-induced hearing loss, which typically affect high frequencies first. Incorrect Options: A. Carhart’s Notch is a characteristic feature in pure-tone audiogram – Incorrect Carhart’s notch is a dip at 2000 Hz in bone conduction audiometry, seen in otosclerosis, not Meniere’s disease. It occurs due to fixation of the stapes at the oval window, affecting bone conduction at this specific frequency. Meniere’s disease, on the other hand, presents with sensorineural (not conductive) hearing loss, making Carhart’s notch irrelevant. B. Schwartz’s Sign is usually present in the tympanic membrane – Incorrect Schwartz’s sign is a reddish hue on the tympanic membrane due to increased vascularity of the promontory, seen in otosclerosis. Meniere’s disease does not involve the tympanic membrane, so this sign is not present. D. Decompression of the Fallopian Canal is the Treatment of Choice – Incorrect The fallopian canal contains the facial nerve, and its decompression is done in facial nerve palsy (e.g., Bell’s palsy or traumatic facial nerve injury). It has no role in Meniere’s disease. Instead, lifestyle modifications, diuretics, vestibular suppressants, intratympanic steroids, or endolymphatic sac decompression surgery are used in severe cases. In refractory cases, vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy may be performed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Meniere’s disease. A typical audiogram of Meniere’s disease shows low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the early stages. This is characterized by a rising or upward-sloping audiometric curve, where hearing loss is more pronounced at low frequencies (250–1000 Hz) while higher frequencies remain relatively preserved. This pattern distinguishes Meniere’s disease from other causes of hearing loss. As the disease progresses, hearing loss can become flat or involve all frequencies, eventually leading to permanent sensorineural hearing loss. This low-frequency hearing loss is due to endolymphatic hydrops, which affects the cochlear duct and vestibular system, leading to episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness—the classic tetrad of Meniere’s disease. Incorrect Options: A. CSOM (Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media) CSOM typically causes conductive hearing loss due to perforation of the tympanic membrane and ossicular damage. In cases of cholesteatoma, there may be a mixed hearing loss, but the audiogram predominantly shows air-bone gaps indicating conductive impairment, which is absent in Meniere’s disease. B. Otosclerosis Otosclerosis is a conductive hearing loss disorder due to stapes fixation at the oval window. A classical audiogram in otosclerosis shows: Carhart’s notch (a dip at 2000 Hz in bone conduction). Air-bone gap indicating conductive hearing loss. Since Meniere’s disease presents with sensorineural hearing loss without an air-bone gap, otosclerosis is ruled out. C. Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) presents with a high-frequency notch at 3000–6000 Hz, known as the “noise notch”, sparing lower frequencies. The hearing loss in NIHL is typically bilateral and symmetrical due to prolonged exposure to loud noise, unlike Meniere’s disease, which affects low frequencies initially and is often unilateral.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lermoyez Syndrome. Lermoyez syndrome is a rare variant of Meniere’s disease, characterized by a reverse sequence of symptom progression compared to typical Meniere’s disease. The classical pattern in this condition is: Progressive sensorineural hearing loss over a period of time (in this case, 1 year). Vertigo develops later (in this case, after 6 months). Tinnitus appears last, just before an improvement in hearing (in this case, last week). This is the opposite of Meniere’s disease, where hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus usually occur together, with fluctuating hearing loss. The tuning fork test findings are consistent with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL): Weber lateralized to the normal ear ? Suggests unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. Rinne test positive bilaterally ? Indicates that air conduction is better than bone conduction, which is normal in sensorineural hearing loss (not conductive hearing loss). Incorrect Options: A. Meniere’s Disease Meniere’s disease typically presents with episodic vertigo, fluctuating low-frequency SNHL, tinnitus, and aural fullness. In contrast, Lermoyez syndrome has an initial progressive hearing loss, followed by vertigo, then tinnitus. In Meniere’s, hearing does not usually improve after vertigo, but in Lermoyez syndrome, hearing improves post-vertigo episode. B. Otosclerosis Otosclerosis primarily causes conductive hearing loss due to fixation of the stapes. Carhart’s notch at 2000 Hz and an air-bone gap would be present on audiometry. Weber lateralization to the worse ear is seen in conductive hearing loss, but in this case, it lateralized to the normal ear, ruling out otosclerosis. D. Lateral Sinus Thrombophlebitis Lateral sinus thrombosis is a complication of middle ear infections (CSOM) and presents with headache, fever, papilledema, and neurological signs. Sensorineural hearing loss is not a primary feature. The given history does not suggest a preceding middle ear infection or any septic signs, making this diagnosis unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Donaldson Line. The Donaldson Line is an imaginary landmark used in otologic surgery, particularly in posterior tympanotomy and labyrinthectomy, to identify the endolymphatic sac in relation to the posterior semicircular canal. It is drawn along the plane of the posterior semicircular canal and helps in locating the endolymphatic sac, which lies just inferior to this line in the posterior fossa dura. This landmark is critical during endolymphatic sac decompression surgery, a procedure used in Meniere’s disease, to ensure precise dissection and avoid damage to surrounding structures. Incorrect Options: A. Lateral Semicircular Canal The lateral (horizontal) semicircular canal is a bony structure seen as a prominent bulge in the medial wall of the middle ear (promontory). It is often used as a landmark in mastoid and middle ear surgeries, but it is not related to the Donaldson Line. B. Superior Semicircular Canal The superior semicircular canal is located in the petrous temporal bone and is involved in balance and spatial orientation. It is sometimes dehiscent (Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence Syndrome – SSCD), but it is not related to Donaldson’s Line. C. Facial Recess The facial recess is an important surgical landmark in posterior tympanotomy (cochlear implant surgeries). It is bounded by the facial nerve (medially), chorda tympani nerve (superiorly), and fossa incudis (laterally). While important in middle ear surgeries, it has no connection to the Donaldson Line.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Microwick-assisted transtympanic Gentamicin injection. In patients with intractable Meniere’s disease who do not respond to medical treatment and have developed severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), intratympanic Gentamicin injection is a widely used treatment option. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that selectively damages vestibular hair cells while sparing the cochlear function in some cases. It is injected transtympanically (through the tympanic membrane) using a microwick, which allows gradual diffusion into the inner ear. The goal is to reduce vertigo episodes by ablating vestibular function while minimizing systemic side effects. Since the patient already has severe SNHL, the risk of further hearing loss is not a concern, making this a viable treatment choice. Incorrect Options: A. Cody Tack Procedure Cody Tack procedure is not a recognized treatment for Meniere’s disease. It seems to be a misnomer or a mix-up with other vestibular procedures like endolymphatic sac decompression or vestibular neurectomy. Not relevant in the given scenario. B. Particle Repositioning Maneuver Particle repositioning maneuvers (e.g., Epley, Semont maneuvers) are used to treat Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), a condition caused by displaced otoconia in the semicircular canals. Meniere’s disease is not caused by canalithiasis, so these maneuvers are not effective. D. Middle Ear Ventilation Tube Middle ear ventilation tubes (grommets) are used primarily in otitis media with effusion (OME) or Eustachian tube dysfunction, not in Meniere’s disease. Although some studies have suggested that ventilation tubes may help with pressure regulation in early Meniere’s, they are not the treatment of choice in advanced cases with severe SNHL.",
