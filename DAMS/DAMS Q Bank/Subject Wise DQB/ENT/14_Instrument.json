      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Trephination The instrument is Rose’s sinus douching cannula. It is used in irrigation of the maxillary sinus, which should already have a nasoantral window due to intranasal antrostomy or Caldwell Luc operation. The direction of the tip is indicated by the hook outside. Rose's sinus douching cannula is a medical instrument primarily used for irrigation or cleansing of the sinuses during certain procedures. It is used to irrigate the sinus cavities, ensuring that they are cleared of debris or infected material. Let’s break down the options: A. Intranasal antrostomy: In intranasal antrostomy, a surgical procedure is performed to create an opening between the maxillary sinus and the nasal cavity, usually to allow for drainage or to treat chronic sinusitis. Rose’s sinus douching cannula is often used for irrigation after such procedures to help cleanse the sinus and ensure proper drainage. Therefore, the cannula would be used in this procedure. B. Caldwell-Luc operation: The Caldwell-Luc operation is a procedure used to access the maxillary sinus through the maxillary bone to treat conditions like chronic sinusitis, remove polyps, or drain abscesses. Rose's sinus douching cannula is often used in post-operative care to irrigate the sinus, ensuring that it is clear of any residual material. Hence, the cannula would also be used in this procedure. C. Trephination: Trephination refers to a procedure where a hole is made in the skull or a sinus to relieve pressure, often for conditions like abscesses, or to allow drainage. However, this procedure does not typically involve irrigation through a cannula like Rose's sinus douching cannula, especially if the procedure is focused on draining a fluid collection. Therefore, the cannula would not be used in this procedure.",
