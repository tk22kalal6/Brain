      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aspiration of Septal Swelling The child presents with nasal blockage and swelling around the nose following trauma, which suggests a septal hematoma. Septal hematoma is a medical emergency because it can lead to cartilage necrosis, saddle nose deformity, and infection (septal abscess) if not treated promptly. Immediate aspiration or drainage is required to prevent complications. Incorrect Options: (B) Anterior Nasal Packing Nasal packing is useful for epistaxis but is not the primary treatment for a septal hematoma. If used alone without draining the hematoma, it can worsen the condition by increasing pressure on the cartilage. (C) Start Intravenous Steroids Steroids have no role in the immediate management of septal hematoma. While they can reduce inflammation in conditions like allergic rhinitis, they do not address the underlying problem of a hematoma. (D) Start Topical Corticosteroid Nasal Spray Topical corticosteroids are used for allergic and inflammatory nasal conditions but are not effective for traumatic septal hematoma.",

Nasal involvement is rare in secondary syphilis. Nasal syphilis is more commonly associated with congenital syphilis (early stage) and tertiary syphilis (late stage with gumma formation). Incorrect Options: (A) Perforation occurs in the septum In tertiary syphilis, gummatous destruction leads to perforation of the nasal septum, particularly affecting the bony part rather than the cartilaginous part. (B) Saddle nose deformity may occur Saddle nose deformity results from collapse of the nasal bridge due to severe destruction of nasal cartilage and bone, typically seen in congenital syphilis or advanced tertiary syphilis.

Untreated or inadequately managed septal hematoma can result in necrosis of the septal cartilage, causing the \"saddle\" appearance. Incorrect Options: (A) Syphilis Congenital syphilis can cause saddle nose deformity, but it is not the most common cause. The Hutchinson triad (interstitial keratitis, notched incisors, and sensorineural hearing loss) is often associated with congenital syphilis. (C) Tuberculosis (T.B.) Rare cause of nasal destruction, usually affecting the bone rather than cartilage. Typically leads to granulomatous lesions and ulceration rather than septal collapse.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Iliac Crest (Best for Saddle Nose Correction Involving Both Cartilage and Bone) The iliac crest is a preferred graft source for saddle nose deformity involving both cartilage and bone loss because: It provides both cortical and cancellous bone, ensuring structural stability. It has high biocompatibility, reducing the risk of rejection. It can be shaped easily to reconstruct the nasal dorsum and septum. Incorrect Options: (A) Silicone Not ideal for severe saddle nose deformity involving bone loss because: It is a synthetic material, which may cause foreign body reactions or infection. It lacks osteogenic properties (does not integrate with bone). It is better suited for mild nasal augmentation rather than extensive reconstruction. (B) Teflon Similar to silicone, Teflon is a synthetic material that can cause foreign body reactions, extrusion, and infection. It lacks vascularization potential and is not widely used in modern nasal reconstruction. (D) 11th Rib Costal cartilage (rib grafts) is useful for cartilage-only defects, but: It is less ideal for bone reconstruction compared to the iliac crest. Rib cartilage can be used in severe cartilage loss cases, but rib bone is rarely used for nasal reconstruction. There is a risk of warping with cartilage grafts from the rib.",

Incorrect Options: (A) Saddle Nose This occurs due to collapse of the nasal dorsum, leading to a depressed nasal bridge. Causes include trauma, syphilis, tuberculosis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and cocaine abuse. It does not present as a curved midline dorsum, but rather as a flattened or concave appearance. (B) Hump Nose A hump nose (dorsal hump) presents as a bony or cartilaginous prominence over the nasal dorsum, rather than a curved midline. It is commonly hereditary or due to trauma. (D) Deviated Nose A deviated nose refers to an asymmetry of the nasal structure, often due to septal deviation.

The deviation affects both aesthetic appearance and nasal airflow, often leading to nasal obstruction and breathing difficulties. Correction often requires septorhinoplasty to address both the septal deformity and external nasal deviation. Incorrect Options: (A) Septum A deviated nasal septum (DNS) alone does not necessarily cause a crooked nose, although it can contribute to internal nasal obstruction. Crooked nose also involves external deformity, making this option incomplete. (B) Dorsum Deviation of the nasal dorsum alone (without septal involvement) can cause a hump nose or C-shaped deformity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Nasal Valve Cottle’s test is a clinical test used to determine whether nasal obstruction is due to nasal valve collapse. The nasal valve is the narrowest part of the nasal airway and is a common site of obstruction. The test is performed by pulling the cheek laterally while the patient inhales through the nose. Positive Cottle Test → If nasal breathing improves, it indicates nasal valve collapse as the cause of obstruction. Negative Cottle Test → No improvement suggests obstruction is not at the nasal valve but elsewhere in the nasal cavity. Incorrect Options: (A) Choanal Choanal obstruction (e.g., choanal atresia) affects the posterior nasal passage, not the nasal valve. Cottle’s test does not assess choanal patency. A nasal endoscopy or CT scan is needed for evaluation. (C) Attic The attic refers to the epitympanic recess in the middle ear, not the nasal cavity. Cottle’s test has no role in evaluating ear-related conditions. (D) Turbinate Turbinate hypertrophy (e.g., inferior turbinate hypertrophy) can cause nasal obstruction. However, Cottle’s test does not evaluate turbinate function. Instead, decongestant sprays or direct nasal endoscopy are used for assessment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hump Nose Reduction rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to reduce the size of the nasal structures, particularly in cases of a hump nose (dorsal hump deformity). A hump nose is characterized by an excessive bony-cartilaginous prominence on the nasal dorsum. During the procedure, excess bone and cartilage are removed to create a smoother, straighter nasal profile. This improves both the aesthetic and functional aspects of the nose. Incorrect Options: (B) Narrow Nose A narrow nose may require augmentation rhinoplasty or spreader grafts rather than reduction rhinoplasty. Reduction rhinoplasty removes tissue, which would worsen a narrow nose instead of correcting it. (C) Crooked Nose A crooked nose results from deviation of the nasal septum and/or nasal bones. Septorhinoplasty or corrective rhinoplasty is the preferred procedure to straighten the nose, not reduction rhinoplasty. (D) Saddle Nose Saddle nose deformity is characterized by a collapsed nasal dorsum, often due to trauma, infection, or diseases like syphilis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Augmentation rhinoplasty using cartilage grafts (e.g., iliac crest, rib, or septal cartilage) is the treatment of choice, not reduction rhinoplasty",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Late Syphilis Upper respiratory gummas are destructive granulomatous lesions that occur in tertiary (late) syphilis. These gummas erode nasal cartilage, bone, and soft tissues, leading to septal and palatal perforations. The destruction can cause saddle nose deformity and oronasal fistulae, significantly affecting function and appearance. Late syphilis typically manifests years to decades after initial infection if untreated. Incorrect Options: (A) Primary Syphilis Primary syphilis is characterized by a painless chancre at the site of Treponema pallidum entry, typically in the genital area. It does not cause gummas or nasal destruction. (B) Secondary Syphilis Secondary syphilis presents with systemic symptoms, including rash (involving palms and soles), mucous patches, and condyloma lata. There are no gummas in secondary syphilis. (D) None This is incorrect, as late (tertiary) syphilis is a well-known cause of nasal and palatal perforations due to gummas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Reduction Rhinoplasty Reduction rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure performed to reshape and reduce the size of the nose, particularly in cases of hump nose or nasal dorsum prominence. This surgery typically involves: Dorsal hump reduction (removal of bone or cartilage from the nasal bridge). Osteotomies to narrow the nasal bones. Tip refinement to achieve a more balanced nasal structure. It is commonly performed for cosmetic or functional reasons. Incorrect Options: (A) Submucous Resection (SMR) SMR is a functional procedure aimed at correcting a deviated nasal septum by removing a portion of the cartilage and bone. It is not primarily intended for external nasal shape modification. (B) Augmentation Rhinoplasty Augmentation rhinoplasty is the opposite of reduction rhinoplasty. It is performed to increase the nasal height or projection, often using cartilage grafts (e.g., from the rib, iliac crest, or ear). It is commonly done in saddle nose deformity. (D) Le Fort I Fracture Reduction Le Fort I fracture involves a horizontal fracture of the maxilla. Its treatment focuses on repositioning and stabilizing the fractured maxilla using plating and fixation, not nasal reshaping.",
