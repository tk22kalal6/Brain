      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most common congenital anomaly of the larynx is laryngomalacia (Option B). Laryngomalacia is a condition characterized by the collapse of the supraglottic structures during inspiration due to inadequate cartilage development. This leads to airway obstruction and stridor, typically presenting in the first few weeks of life. It is the most frequent cause of congenital stridor and accounts for nearly 60-75% of all congenital laryngeal anomalies. The hallmark symptom is inspiratory stridor that worsens with activity, feeding, or crying and improves in the prone position. Most cases resolve spontaneously by 12–24 months as the cartilage strengthens. Severe cases may require surgical intervention, such as supraglottoplasty. Incorrect Options: (A) Laryngeal Web: Laryngeal webs are congenital or acquired membranous structures that partially obstruct the laryngeal airway, typically at the level of the vocal cords. They are much rarer than laryngomalacia and usually present with hoarseness or weak crying rather than inspiratory stridor. (C) Laryngeal Stenosis: Congenital laryngeal stenosis results from incomplete recanalization of the laryngeal lumen during fetal development. It is less common than laryngomalacia and generally presents with persistent respiratory distress or biphasic stridor, depending on the severity of the obstruction. (D) Vocal Cord Palsy: Congenital vocal cord palsy is another rare condition that may cause stridor, weak cry, or respiratory distress, often associated with neurological disorders. It is less frequent than laryngomalacia and typically diagnosed with laryngoscopy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) (B) Glottic During fetal development, the larynx undergoes temporary occlusion around the 8th week, followed by recanalization by the 10th week to form the vocal cords and airway. If this recanalization process is incomplete, it leads to glottic anomalies such as laryngeal web or congenital glottic stenosis, which can present with aphonia (absence of voice) or a weak cry due to the involvement of the vocal cords. Additionally, obstruction at the glottic level causes inspiratory stridor, which is a hallmark feature of congenital laryngeal obstruction. Since the glottis plays a crucial role in phonation, a defect here most significantly affects the voice, leading to aphonia or a weak cry at birth, as seen in the given case. The presence of stridor further supports glottic involvement, as narrowing at this level leads to airway resistance during inspiration. Incorrect Options: (A) Supraglottic: Supraglottic anomalies, such as laryngomalacia, are common causes of congenital stridor, but they typically present with high-pitched inspiratory stridor that worsens with feeding or agitation rather than aphonia or a weak cry. Since the case specifically suggests incomplete recanalization, which primarily affects the glottic region, supraglottic involvement is less likely. (C) Subglottic: Subglottic stenosis is a narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords and is a known cause of congenital airway obstruction. However, subglottic involvement usually leads to biphasic stridor (both inspiratory and expiratory) rather than purely inspiratory stridor. Additionally, subglottic lesions do not typically cause aphonia, making this a less likely site of the defect in this case. (D) Hypopharynx: The hypopharynx is primarily involved in swallowing and directing food into the esophagus rather than phonation. A defect in this region would more likely present with feeding difficulties and aspiration rather than aphonia or inspiratory stridor",

Incorrect Options: (A) Grade I: This grade is defined as <50% narrowing of the subglottic lumen. Since the given case has 80% narrowing, it exceeds this threshold, making Grade I incorrect. (B) Grade II: Grade II is defined as 50–70% subglottic narrowing. Since 80% is above this range, the stenosis is more severe, ruling out Grade II. (D) Grade IV: Grade IV subglottic stenosis refers to 100% obstruction, meaning there is complete occlusion of the airway. The child in the question has an 80% narrowing, which does not reach complete obstruction, making Grade IV incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) (A) Grades I and II Endoscopic management, including CO? or KTP laser excision with dilation, is primarily considered for mild to moderate cases of congenital subglottic stenosis, specifically Grade I (<50%) and Grade II (50–70%). In these cases, the stenosis is not severe enough to require open surgical procedures, and endoscopic treatment offers a minimally invasive option with good success rates. For Grade I and II, laser excision helps remove excess tissue, and balloon or bougie dilation can be used to expand the narrowed airway. These interventions are usually effective in improving airway patency without the need for more aggressive surgical procedures. Incorrect Options: (B) Grades I, II, and III: While Grade I and II can be managed endoscopically, Grade III (71–99% narrowing) is usually too severe for endoscopic treatment alone. Patients with Grade III stenosis often require open surgical procedures, such as laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) or cricotracheal resection (CTR), as endoscopic methods have a high failure rate in these cases. (C) Only Grade I: Although Grade I stenosis can be managed endoscopically, Grade II is also successfully treated with laser excision and dilation. Thus, limiting treatment to only Grade I is incorrect. (D) Grade IV: Grade IV stenosis is defined as complete airway obstruction (100%). Endoscopic management is not possible in these cases, and major open surgical interventions such as cricotracheal resection or tracheostomy are required.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (D) Hoarse Voice Laryngomalacia is the most common congenital cause of inspiratory stridor, caused by immature and floppy supraglottic structures that collapse during inspiration. It typically presents in the first few weeks of life with intermittent inspiratory stridor, which worsens with activity (feeding, crying) and improves in certain positions (e.g., prone). However, hoarse voice is not a typical feature of laryngomalacia. Hoarseness suggests vocal cord involvement, which is more commonly seen in conditions like congenital vocal cord paralysis, laryngeal web, or subglottic hemangioma, rather than laryngomalacia. Incorrect Options: (A) Intermittent Inspiratory Stridor: This is a classic feature of laryngomalacia. The floppy supraglottic structures (arytenoid cartilages, epiglottis) collapse dynamically during inspiration, leading to intermittent high-pitched inspiratory stridor that is more noticeable during increased airflow demand (crying, feeding). (B) Stridor that Improves in Prone Position: Laryngomalacia-related stridor is often position-dependent and typically improves in the prone position. This occurs because prone positioning stabilizes the floppy supraglottic tissues, reducing airway collapse and alleviating stridor. (C) Stridor that Worsens with Feeding: Feeding increases airflow demand and laryngeal activity, making laryngomalacia-related stridor worse. Additionally, gastroesophageal reflux (often associated with laryngomalacia) can contribute to further airway irritation and stridor during feeding.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Radiation (Correct Answer) Radiation therapy is not a part of the treatment for subglottic hemangioma because it poses significant risks, including damage to growing tissues, fibrosis, and long-term airway complications. Given that infantile hemangiomas naturally regress over time, radiation is not recommended, especially in young children. Incorrect Options: (B) Steroids: Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., oral or intravenous dexamethasone or prednisolone) have been a traditional first-line treatment for subglottic hemangiomas. They help reduce the size of the lesion by decreasing vascular proliferation, thereby relieving airway obstruction. However, with the advent of beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) as a preferred therapy, steroids are now used less frequently. (C) Tracheostomy: Severe cases of subglottic hemangioma causing life-threatening airway obstruction may require a tracheostomy to secure the airway until the lesion regresses. This is usually considered in cases where other medical or surgical treatments fail to provide adequate airway patency. (D) Carbon Dioxide Laser Treatment: Carbon Dioxide laser therapy is an effective option for debulking the hemangioma when it causes significant airway obstruction. Laser excision helps restore airway patency while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue. It is often considered in cases where medical therapy alone is insufficient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cry is normal in the patient (Correct Answer) Laryngeal web is a congenital or acquired condition in which a thin membrane partially obstructs the laryngeal airway, usually at the level of the anterior glottis. Since it involves the vocal cords, it typically leads to a weak, hoarse, or absent cry rather than a normal cry. Newborns with significant webbing may also present with stridor and respiratory distress, especially if the web is large. Incorrect Options: (A) Congenital anomaly: Laryngeal webs are most commonly congenital and result from incomplete recanalization of the larynx during embryonic development (10th week of gestation). However, webs can also be acquired due to trauma, intubation injury, or infections. (C) CO2 Laser is helpful in its management: CO2 laser excision is an effective method for treating laryngeal webs, particularly in thin or mild-to-moderate webs. The laser helps precisely excise the web while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. (D) McNaught Keel is used to prevent reformation of the web after surgery: After surgical removal of a laryngeal web, there is a risk of web reformation due to scarring. To prevent this, a McNaught keel (a thin silastic or metal stent) is placed between the vocal cords to keep them separated during healing.",
