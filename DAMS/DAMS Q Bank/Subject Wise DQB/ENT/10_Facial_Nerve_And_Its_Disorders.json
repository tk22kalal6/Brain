      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Common with transverse fracture Facial nerve palsy is more common in transverse fractures of the temporal bone. Transverse fractures typically occur due to frontal or occipital blunt trauma and run perpendicular to the long axis of the petrous temporal bone. These fractures frequently involve the otic capsule, leading to higher rates of facial nerve injury (50% or more cases) because the fracture line directly transects the facial nerve canal in the internal auditory canal or labyrinthine segment. Incorrect Options: (A) Common with longitudinal fracture: Longitudinal fractures of the temporal bone are more common (~80%) and usually result from lateral head trauma (temporal or parietal impact). While they can cause facial nerve injury, the incidence is much lower (10–20%) compared to transverse fractures. When facial nerve palsy does occur in longitudinal fractures, it is usually incomplete or delayed, rather than immediate and complete. (C) Always associated with CSF otorrhoea: While CSF otorrhoea (leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the ear) is a possible feature of temporal bone fractures, it is not always present in cases of facial nerve palsy. CSF otorrhoea is more commonly associated with longitudinal fractures, which often involve the tegmen tympani, leading to CSF leakage into the middle ear and external auditory canal. However, transverse fractures are less likely to cause CSF otorrhoea but more commonly result in sensorineural hearing loss and facial nerve damage. (D) Complete nerve palsy: Facial palsy following a longitudinal fracture is typically incomplete and delayed, whereas transverse fractures are more likely to cause immediate and complete facial palsy due to direct nerve transection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Immediate decompression Facial nerve palsy following head trauma, especially with mastoid fracture, suggests direct nerve compression or transection. In cases where facial nerve function is completely lost immediately after trauma, it indicates nerve transection or severe compression by bone fragments, necessitating immediate surgical decompression. Surgical decompression involves exposing the facial nerve via mastoidectomy or middle fossa approach to relieve pressure and prevent permanent nerve damage. If an actual nerve transection is confirmed intraoperatively, nerve grafting (e.g., greater auricular or sural nerve graft) may be required. Incorrect Options: (B) Wait and watch: Observation is appropriate for delayed or incomplete facial palsy, where nerve function gradually worsens over hours to days, as this suggests nerve edema or ischemia rather than direct transection. However, in cases of immediate and complete paralysis following trauma, waiting can lead to permanent nerve dysfunction, making this option incorrect in this scenario. (C) Facial sling: A facial sling (used to support the face in chronic facial palsy) is a rehabilitative option for long-standing or irreversible facial nerve palsy. It is not a first-line intervention for acute traumatic facial nerve palsy. (D) Steroids: Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) are beneficial in cases of Bell’s palsy or inflammatory causes of facial nerve palsy. However, in traumatic nerve injury with bony compression or transection, steroids alone are insufficient. They may be used postoperatively to reduce inflammation but do not replace surgical decompression in cases of nerve entrapment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Labyrinthine segment of facial nerve The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve is the proximal-most portion after the nerve exits the brainstem and passes through the internal auditory canal (IAC) before reaching the geniculate ganglion. It contains fibers responsible for lacrimation, taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and stapedius muscle function. An injury at this level results in: Decreased lacrimation (due to involvement of the greater petrosal nerve, which carries parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland). Impaired taste sensation (due to damage to the chorda tympani, which carries taste fibers from the anterior 2/3 of the tongue). Absent stapedial reflex (due to involvement of the nerve to stapedius, leading to hyperacusis). This combination of symptoms strongly localizes the lesion to the labyrinthine segment, making Option A correct. Incorrect Options: (B) Horizontal segment of the facial nerve: The horizontal segment (tympanic segment) runs along the medial wall of the middle ear. While stapedial reflex and taste sensation may be affected, lacrimation is preserved since the greater petrosal nerve has already branched off at the geniculate ganglion. Since the patient has decreased lacrimation, this cannot be the correct answer. (C) Extratemporal part of the facial nerve: The extratemporal (peripheral) segment is located after the nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen and branches into facial muscles. At this level, lacrimation, taste, and stapedial reflex remain intact, as all their fibers have already branched off within the temporal bone. Only motor deficits would be seen, ruling out this option. (D) Vertical segment of the facial nerve: The vertical (mastoid) segment extends from the pyramidal eminence to the stylomastoid foramen. Damage here can affect stapedial reflex and taste sensation, but lacrimation remains unaffected because the greater petrosal nerve has already exited at the geniculate ganglion",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Continue with steroids and repeat assessment (Correct Answer) Bell’s palsy is an idiopathic, acute, unilateral facial nerve palsy that usually improves with corticosteroid therapy (e.g., prednisolone) within 3–6 weeks. However, some patients may show delayed improvement despite initial treatment. Since electroneuronography (ENoG) does not show significant nerve degeneration, this indicates that the nerve is still functional, and spontaneous recovery is likely. In such cases, the best course of action is to continue steroid therapy, monitor the patient, and reassess after a few more weeks before considering surgical intervention. Incorrect Options: (A) Acyclovir should be added to treatment: Antiviral therapy (e.g., acyclovir or valacyclovir) is sometimes used in Bell’s palsy when a viral etiology (e.g., herpes simplex virus) is suspected. However, studies show that antivirals do not significantly improve outcomes when added to steroids. Since the patient has already been treated with steroids for 3 weeks, adding acyclovir at this stage is unlikely to provide further benefit. (C) Facial nerve decompression: Surgical facial nerve decompression is considered only in cases of severe nerve degeneration (ENoG showing >90% degeneration within 14 days) and persistent, complete paralysis. Since this patient’s ENoG shows no significant degeneration, surgery is unnecessary at this stage. (D) Transtympanic dexamethasone: Intratympanic (transtympanic) dexamethasone injection is used primarily for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) rather than Bell’s palsy. While some studies suggest it may have a role in refractory facial palsy, there is no strong evidence supporting its routine use in Bell’s palsy, especially in a patient with intact nerve function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Fundus of IAC to geniculate ganglion The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve extends from the fundus of the internal auditory canal (IAC) to the geniculate ganglion. It is the shortest and narrowest segment of the facial nerve, measuring about 3-4 mm in length. This segment runs within the temporal bone, close to the cochlea and vestibule, making it vulnerable to injuries from temporal bone fractures or infections. It also carries the greater petrosal nerve, which is responsible for lacrimation. Incorrect Options: (A) Brainstem to internal auditory canal (IAC): This describes the cisternal segment, which extends from the brainstem (pontomedullary junction) to the internal auditory canal. This segment is located in the posterior cranial fossa, before the nerve enters the temporal bone. (B) Meatal foramen of the IAC to the fundus of IAC: This refers to the meatal segment of the facial nerve, which runs within the internal auditory canal (IAC) along with the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). It extends from the meatal foramen to the fundus of the IAC, before continuing as the labyrinthine segment.
