      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The paraglottic and pre-epiglottic spaces are continuous. The paraglottic space and the pre-epiglottic space are contiguous anatomical spaces in the larynx, and they communicate with each other. The paraglottic space lies around the laryngeal framework, and the pre-epiglottic space is located in front of the epiglottis. This continuity is significant in the spread of infections or tumors in the laryngeal region. Incorrect Options: (A) The rima glottidis is the interval between the false cords The rima glottidis refers to the space between the true vocal cords (vocal folds), not the false cords. The false vocal cords (also known as the ventricular folds) do not directly define the rima glottidis, which is important for airway function and phonation. (B) Keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium lines the true cords The true vocal cords (vocal folds) are lined by non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, not keratinizing epithelium. The keratinized epithelium is typically found in areas exposed to harsher mechanical stresses like the skin and oral cavity, but not in the vocal folds, which are designed for phonation and smooth movement. (C) The posterior part of the ventricular sinus contains the mucus secreting saccule The ventricular sinus is the space between the false vocal cords (ventricular folds) and the true vocal cords. However, the mucus-secreting saccule is located anteriorly in the larynx, not posteriorly. It is important for lubricating the vocal cords to facilitate smooth movement during phonation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) III branchial arch. The greater horn and the lower portion of the hyoid bone develop from the third branchial arch. During embryonic development, the branchial arches give rise to the bones, muscles, and nerves of the head and neck. Specifically, the third branchial arch forms the greater horn and the lower body of the hyoid bone. The third arch is also associated with the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Incorrect Options: (A) II branchial arch – Incorrect: The second branchial arch primarily gives rise to the lesser horn and the upper portion of the hyoid bone, as well as other structures like the styloid process of the temporal bone and muscles of facial expression. The greater horn and lower portion of the hyoid are not derived from the second arch. (C) IV branchial arch – Incorrect: The fourth branchial arch contributes to the development of structures in the larynx and pharynx, including the cricoid cartilage and muscles of the pharynx and larynx, but it does not form the hyoid bone. (D) V/VI branchial arch – Incorrect: The fifth and sixth branchial arches contribute to the development of the laryngeal cartilages (like the arytenoid and cricoid cartilages) and muscles involved in swallowing and speech. They do not form the hyoid bone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Posterior Cricoarytenoid. The posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle is the only vocal fold abductor. It is responsible for abducting the vocal cords, which opens the rima glottidis (the space between the vocal cords) during respiration, allowing air to pass into the lungs. The PCA muscle originates from the posterior part of the cricoid cartilage and inserts into the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. When it contracts, it pulls the arytenoid cartilages backward and laterally, leading to the opening of the vocal cords. Incorrect Options: (B) Lateral Cricoarytenoid The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle is a vocal fold adductor, meaning it brings the vocal folds together. It works to close the vocal cords, contributing to phonation and the production of sound. (C) Thyroarytenoid The thyroarytenoid muscle is primarily involved in shortening and relaxing the vocal cords, which affects tension and pitch. While it contributes to phonation, it does not abduct the vocal cords. (D) Cricothyroid The cricothyroid muscle adjusts the tension of the vocal cords by tilting the thyroid cartilage forward, thereby increasing the pitch of the voice. It does not abduct the vocal cords.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Area below vocal is supplied by internal laryngeal nerve. The area below the vocal cords (subglottic region) is not supplied by the internal laryngeal nerve. The internal laryngeal nerve is a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and innervates the mucosa above the vocal cords, specifically in the laryngeal vestibule. The area below the vocal cords, or the subglottic area, is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is also a branch of the vagus nerve. Incorrect Options: (A) They are covered with a mucosa that is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve The vocal folds are indeed covered by a mucosa that is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve gives rise to both the superior laryngeal nerve (which innervates the mucosa above the vocal cords) and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which innervates the mucosa below the vocal cords). (B) They are abducted during respiration by contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles are the only abductors of the vocal cords. When they contract, they pull the arytenoid cartilages backward, which widens the glottis and allows air to pass through the vocal cords for breathing. (C) They are adducted during swallowing by contraction of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles The lateral cricoarytenoid muscles are responsible for adducting the vocal cords, bringing them together. This action is important during swallowing to prevent aspiration by closing off the airway",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cricothyroid. The cricothyroid muscle is the chief pitch-changing muscle of the larynx. It works by tensing and elongating the vocal cords. When the cricothyroid muscle contracts, it tilts the thyroid cartilage forward, which increases the tension on the vocal cords, leading to a higher pitch. This is a key muscle for controlling vocal pitch during speech and singing. Incorrect Options: (A) Posterior Cricoarytenoid The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is the only abductor of the vocal cords, responsible for opening the vocal cords during breathing. It does not play a direct role in pitch control. (B) Lateral Cricoarytenoid The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle is an adductor of the vocal cords, meaning it brings the vocal cords together during phonation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Trieceous Cartilage. The triticeous cartilage is a small piece of cartilage found in the thyrohyoid ligament. It is often a normal anatomical variation, but when it becomes calcified, it may appear on an X-ray as a foreign body. The calcification of the triticeous cartilage can sometimes be mistaken for an external object in the neck due to its appearance and position near the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. Incorrect Options: (A) Cricoid The cricoid cartilage is a prominent cartilage in the larynx, but it is much larger and more centrally located. It is unlikely to be mistaken for a foreign body, even when calcified. (C) Corniculate Cartilage The corniculate cartilages are small paired cartilages located on the apex of the arytenoid cartilages. They are too small and generally do not calcify in a manner that would be confused with a foreign body on an X-ray.

These layers consist of elastic fibers, which provide the necessary tension and support for the vocal cords during phonation. Together, they form a strong, flexible structure that is essential for sound production. The vocal ligament runs between the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages and the anterior commissure of the thyroid cartilage. Incorrect Options: (A) Squamous epithelium and superficial layer of the lamina propria The squamous epithelium covers the vocal cords, but it does not contribute to the formation of the vocal ligament. The superficial layer of the lamina propria, also known as the Reinke's space, is more involved in the flexibility of the vocal folds, but it is not part of the vocal ligament itself. (C) Superficial and intermediate lamina propria The superficial layer and intermediate layer of the lamina propria both contribute to the vocal fold's flexibility and vibration, but the vocal ligament specifically involves the intermediate and deep layers of the lamina propria, as they provide the structural strength necessary for the ligament's function.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Laryngospasm is mediated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This statement is incorrect because laryngospasm is actually mediated by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, not the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve carries sensory fibers to the mucosa above the glottis, and stimulation of this nerve can trigger a reflex leading to laryngospasm. The recurrent laryngeal nerve primarily provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid) and sensory innervation below the glottis, but it does not directly mediate laryngospasm. Incorrect Options: (A) Internal Branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the laryngeal mucosa above the glottis The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the mucosa above the glottis, including the epiglottis and the supraglottic area. (B) Muscles are supplied by recurrent laryngeal nerve except cricothyroid which is supplied by external branch of superior laryngeal nerve The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, including the posterior cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, and thyroarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscle, however, is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. (D) Recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the laryngeal mucosa inferior to the glottis The recurrent laryngeal nerve provides sensory innervation to the mucosa below the glottis, including the subglottic region and the trachea.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Stratified squamous epithelium. The vocal cords (also known as the vocal folds) are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is well-suited to withstand the mechanical stresses and friction caused by vibration during phonation. This type of epithelium provides a protective barrier and helps maintain the integrity of the vocal cords during speech and other activities like coughing. Incorrect Options: (A) Stratified columnar epithelium Stratified columnar epithelium is not typically found in the vocal cords. This type of epithelium is more commonly found in certain parts of the urethra and the conjunctiva of the eye, but not in the vocal cords. (B) Pseudociliated columnar epithelium The pseudociliated columnar epithelium is typical of the respiratory epithelium found in the trachea and larger airways, but it does not line the vocal cords. The vocal cords need a more durable, protective epithelium like stratified squamous. (D) Cuboidal epithelium Cuboidal epithelium is not found in the vocal cords either. It is more characteristic of areas like glandular tissues or the renal tubules but is not appropriate for the vocal cords, which require more durable epithelium due to the constant vibration during phonation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 1.5 mm from midline. During strong whispering, the vocal cords are positioned slightly apart but are still close to each other. This creates a small space through which air can pass, producing a whispering sound. The vocal cords are typically positioned around 1.5 mm from the midline during this action. This small separation allows for air to pass through and create sound, but the vocal cords do not fully abduct (move apart) as they would during normal breathing or phonation. Incorrect Options: (B) 3.5 mm from midline While the vocal cords are separated during whispering, they are not typically as far apart as 3.5 mm. This separation is more typical for normal phonation or louder speech, not whispering. (C) 7 mm from midline 7 mm from the midline would be more typical for normal breathing or situations where the vocal cords need to be open to allow for a larger volume of air to pass through. This distance is too wide for whispering. (D) 9.5 mm from midline A separation of 9.5 mm would indicate an even wider gap, likely for maximum airflow during normal breathing, but it is much too wide for whispering. During whispering, the vocal cords are only slightly apart, usually around 1.5 mm.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Subglottic space. In infants, the subglottic space is the narrowest part of the upper airway. This area is located just below the vocal cords and above the trachea. The narrowness of this space is a significant anatomical feature in infants, and it can contribute to increased difficulty in managing airway obstruction or other respiratory issues compared to older children and adults, where the glottis is typically the narrowest part. Incorrect Options: (A) Carina The carina is the point at which the trachea bifurcates into the left and right mainstem bronchi. While it is an important landmark in the airway, it is not the narrowest portion in infants. The carina is located lower in the airway and is wider than the subglottic space. (B) Glottic The glottis, which includes the vocal cords and the space between them, is not the narrowest part of the airway in infants. In infants, the glottis is relatively wide compared to the subglottic region. (D) Supra glottic The supraglottic area, which includes the epiglottis and the area above the vocal cords, is not the narrowest part of the airway in infants.

The conus elasticus is part of the intrinsic structure of the larynx and is involved in the vocal fold mechanism, not in the boundaries of the pre-epiglottic space. Incorrect Options: (A) Hyoid bone The hyoid bone is located superior to the pre-epiglottic space, contributing to the superior boundary of the space.
