      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid (Correct Answer) The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone is a thin, midline structure that forms part of the nasal septum and extends superiorly to articulate with the cribriform plate. The cribriform plate is highly susceptible to fractures in cases of facial trauma, especially blunt trauma to the nose and forehead. Since the cribriform plate contains multiple small foramina for the passage of olfactory nerve fibers, trauma can lead to a direct communication between the subarachnoid space and the nasal cavity, causing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (CSF rhinorrhea). This makes the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid one of the most vulnerable structures for CSF leaks, which can increase the risk of meningitis if left untreated. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Vomer The vomer is another bone forming part of the nasal septum, but it is located posteroinferiorly and does not articulate with the cribriform plate. Since it is not in direct contact with the cranial base, trauma to the vomer is unlikely to cause CSF leakage. (C) Perpendicular Plate of the Palatine Bone The perpendicular plate of the palatine bone forms part of the lateral nasal wall and posterior part of the nasal cavity, extending upward to articulate with the sphenoid bone. Although fractures of this bone may cause nasal obstruction or bleeding, they are not directly associated with CSF leakage since they do not connect with the anterior cranial fossa. (D) Premaxilla The premaxilla (anterior part of the maxilla) forms the front portion of the hard palate and upper jaw. Trauma to the premaxilla may result in dental injuries or midfacial fractures, but it does not involve the skull base or the meninges, making CSF leakage unlikely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cribriform plate of ethmoidal bone • CSF discharging from the nose is known as CSF rhinorrhoea. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear colorless fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord, cushioning them against trauma. • In fact in literal terms the brain and spinal cord floats in the cerebrospinal fluid. The specific gravity of brain is only 4% of that of CSF, hence it could float easily in the CSF. • The high pressure leaks are commonly encountered in the cribriform area. This is due to the fagility and unique anatomy in this area i.e. (prolongation of the subarachnoid space along the olfactory filaments). • The leak during these conditions functions as a safety valve alleviating the increased intracranial pressure. These high pressure leaks are associated with slow growing tumors and 1/4 of them have hydrocephalus. • Pituitary neoplasms are the most common type of intracranial tumor found, next common are the posterior cranial fossa lesions. Direct invasion of the skull base is not the usual mechanism of this leak. • Closure of these leaks may worsen the condition of the patient if the causative lesion is left untreated.",

The patient is asked to place the chin over their chest. The patient must stay in that position for one full minute. Clear fluid dripping from the nose is CSF. • Handkerchief test: Discharge from the nose is blown into a handkerchief and is allowed to dry. If the discharge is CSF the handherchief will not stiffen, if the discharge is secretions from the nose the handkerchief stiffens due to the presence of mucin in the nasal secretions.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Front A Jarjaway fracture of the nasal septum occurs due to a direct frontal blow to the nose. This impact causes the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and the vomer to fracture, leading to displacement of the nasal septum. Such injuries are commonly seen in sports-related trauma, falls, or physical assaults. Patients typically present with nasal obstruction, deformity, epistaxis (nosebleed), and possible CSF rhinorrhea if the cribriform plate is also involved. Incorrect Options: (B) Below A force from below would more likely result in nasal bone fractures or displacement of the nasal dorsum rather than a septal fracture. This type of impact is less commonly associated with Jarjaway fractures. (C) Medial side A blow from the medial side (inside the nasal cavity) is unlikely to produce a significant septal fracture since it lacks the necessary external force required to displace the ethmoid and vomer bones. (D) Lateral side A lateral impact usually causes a nasal bone fracture rather than a Jarjaway fracture of the septum. Lateral forces tend to displace the nasal bones to one side, leading to asymmetry and deviation but not a true septal fracture pattern described by Jarjaway.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Below A Chevallet fracture of the nasal septum occurs due to a blow from below, often directed upward towards the nasal septum. This force causes a transverse fracture of the nasal septum, primarily affecting the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and the vomer. Such fractures are commonly seen in cases of falls onto the chin, upward blows (e.g., fist punches from below), or accidents where the nose strikes an object from underneath. This type of fracture can result in nasal obstruction, deviation, and difficulty in breathing through the nose. Incorrect Options: (A) Front A frontal impact more commonly leads to a Jarjaway fracture rather than a Chevallet fracture. Frontal blows tend to cause vertical fractures of the nasal septum rather than transverse fractures. (C) Medial Side A force from the medial side is unlikely to generate enough impact to cause a fracture of the nasal septum. Medial pressure may cause septal deviation rather than a distinct fracture pattern. (D) Lateral Side A lateral blow to the nose generally causes nasal bone fractures with displacement, rather than a Chevallet fracture of the septum.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) CSF discharge stiffens the handkerchief (Incorrect Statement – Correct Answer) Unlike mucous secretions, CSF does not contain mucin or proteins that cause fabric stiffening when dried. In contrast, nasal mucus contains glycoproteins that can stiffen a handkerchief when dry. This is an important clinical distinction between CSF rhinorrhea and simple nasal secretions. Incorrect Options: (B) Glucose level > 30 mg% is confirmatory (True Statement) CSF normally contains glucose, whereas nasal secretions do not. A glucose level of >30 mg/dL in a clear nasal discharge strongly suggests CSF rhinorrhea. However, this test is not completely specific because blood or contaminated secretions may also contain glucose. (C) Intrathecal 5% fluorescein stains the CSF bright yellow-green (True Statement) In cases where the source of a CSF leak is unclear, intrathecal injection of 5% fluorescein can help identify the leak site. The CSF, when mixed with fluorescein, appears bright yellow-green under UV light and can be detected as it leaks from the nose or ear. (D) Discharge is thin, watery, and clear (True Statement) CSF rhinorrhea presents as a thin, watery, and clear nasal discharge. Unlike infected nasal secretions, it does not appear thick or cloudy unless it becomes secondarily infected. The \"halo sign\" or \"double-ring sign\" (a central red spot surrounded by a clear ring on filter paper) is another distinguishing feature of CSF leakage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Traumatic CSF Leak (Correct Answer) The target sign (also called the halo sign or double-ring sign) is seen in a blot test performed on nasal discharge to differentiate CSF rhinorrhea from normal nasal secretions or blood. When a drop of fluid is placed on a piece of filter paper or gauze, CSF forms a clear outer ring, while blood (if present) stays in the center, creating a bullseye or target-like appearance. Traumatic CSF leaks occur due to skull base fractures, particularly involving the cribriform plate or temporal bone, leading to nasal or otorrheal CSF leakage. Incorrect Options: (B) Fracture Mastoid A mastoid fracture can lead to CSF otorrhea (CSF leakage from the ear), rather than nasal discharge. The target sign is typically used for nasal CSF leaks, making this less relevant for mastoid fractures. (C) Spontaneous CSF Leak Spontaneous CSF leaks occur due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or congenital skull base defects, often without a history of trauma. While a target sign can still be seen in these cases, it is most commonly associated with traumatic leaks, making Option A the better choice. (D) Meningoencephalocele A meningoencephalocele is a herniation of brain tissue and meninges through a skull defect, which can cause intermittent CSF leakage.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Open reduction after 3 weeks In cases of fractures involving the facial bones, particularly the zygoma, orbit, or maxilla, open reduction timing is crucial. Waiting for 3 weeks allows for initial swelling to subside, making surgical correction more precise and reducing complications. After 3 weeks, fibrous union may begin, but complete bony healing has not yet occurred, making reduction still possible without extensive osteotomy. This approach is often recommended for zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures, nasal fractures, and mandibular fractures in select cases. Incorrect Options: (A) Open reduction immediately Immediate surgery is only considered in cases of severe displacement, ocular involvement (diplopia, enophthalmos), or airway compromise. Otherwise, early surgery may be difficult due to severe edema, which can obscure surgical landmarks. (B) Open reduction after 3 days Three days is often too early, as swelling may still be significant, leading to difficulties in precise fracture reduction. Surgeons usually prefer to wait 7–10 days for swelling to improve before performing open reduction. (D) Open reduction after 3 months Three months is too late, as bony healing and remodeling would have progressed, making reduction much more difficult. At this stage, osteotomies and more extensive surgical intervention may be required.",
