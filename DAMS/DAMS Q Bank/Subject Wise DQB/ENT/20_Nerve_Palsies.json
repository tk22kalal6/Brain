      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Paramedian. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is a branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) and supplies all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle (which is supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve). When the RLN is paralyzed, the vocal cord is unable to move properly. The position of the paralyzed vocal cord depends on whether the lesion is unilateral or bilateral: In unilateral RLN paralysis, the vocal cord typically rests in the paramedian position (slightly near the midline). This occurs because the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (the only abductor of the vocal cords) is paralyzed, while the cricothyroid muscle (which tenses the vocal cords) remains functional, keeping the cord near the midline. The other vocal cord compensates, often leading to hoarseness but not complete aphonia. Incorrect Options: A. Gentle Abduction If the vocal cord were in a gently abducted position, it would suggest some level of function in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. However, in RLN paralysis, this muscle is completely paralyzed, preventing abduction. C. Intermediate An intermediate position (halfway between abduction and adduction) is more commonly seen in combined superior and recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries, but not in isolated RLN paralysis. D. Full Abduction Full abduction is controlled by the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, which is completely non-functional in RLN paralysis. If the RLN were fully functioning, the vocal cord could abduct fully during respiration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vocal cord medialization. Type I Thyroplasty (Medialization Thyroplasty) is a surgical procedure used to push a paralyzed or weakened vocal cord toward the midline to improve voice function. It is commonly performed in cases of unilateral vocal cord paralysis or paresis, where the affected cord fails to close properly, leading to hoarseness, breathy voice, and aspiration risk. The procedure involves inserting an implant (e.g., Gore-Tex, Silastic, Titanium, or Hydroxyapatite) to medialize the affected vocal fold, restoring glottic closure and improving phonation and swallowing. Incorrect Options: B. Vocal Cord Lateralization Type II Thyroplasty is used for lateralization, which means widening the glottic gap. It is performed in spasmodic dysphonia or hyperadduction disorders, where excessive tension needs to be relieved. C. Vocal Cord Shortening Type III Thyroplasty is used for shortening and relaxation of the vocal cords, lowering the pitch of the voice. It is used in conditions like puberphonia or high-pitched voice disorders. D. Vocal Cord Lengthening Type IV Thyroplasty is used for lengthening and tensing the vocal cords, which results in a higher-pitched voice. It is used in singers, transgender voice surgeries, or congenital high-pitched voice cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bilateral abductor palsy. Bilateral abductor palsy occurs when both posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscles (the only vocal cord abductors) are paralyzed due to bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. This leads to airway obstruction because the vocal cords remain in a paramedian position, causing stridor and respiratory distress. The Kashima operation (also called Endoscopic Posterior Cordotomy) involves removing a part of the posterior vocal cord (arytenoid cartilage or vocal process) to create a larger airway while preserving voice quality as much as possible. It is a minimally invasive alternative to tracheostomy for managing airway compromise in bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Incorrect Options: A. Bilateral Adductor Palsy In bilateral adductor palsy, the vocal cords remain open, leading to breathy voice and aspiration risk, but there is no airway obstruction. The treatment involves voice therapy or medialization procedures (e.g., Type I thyroplasty), not Kashima operation. C. Phonasthenia Phonasthenia is vocal fatigue or weakness due to excessive voice use or functional voice disorders. It is managed with voice therapy and vocal hygiene, not surgery. D. Laryngeal Papillomatosis Laryngeal papillomatosis (caused by HPV) leads to multiple papillomas in the larynx, causing hoarseness and airway obstruction. It is treated with microlaryngeal surgery (laser excision, microdebrider) and antiviral therapy (Cidofovir, HPV vaccination).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Injection of Teflon. Explanation for the Correct Answer (C – Injection of Teflon is NOT Used for Lateralization): Injection of Teflon (or other injectable materials like fat or hyaluronic acid) is used for medialization, not lateralization. It is performed in cases of unilateral vocal cord paralysis to improve glottic closure by bulking up the paralyzed vocal cord. Lateralization procedures are required in cases of bilateral abductor paralysis (where the cords are stuck in a midline position and obstruct the airway). Incorrect Options: A. Cordectomy Cordectomy involves the removal of part or all of a vocal cord, usually for airway widening in cases of bilateral vocal cord paralysis or for treating early-stage laryngeal carcinoma. This helps to laterally reposition the remaining vocal cord, improving airway patency. B. Nerve Muscle Implant Reinnervation procedures or nerve muscle implants can help restore muscle function or achieve lateralization in specific cases of vocal cord paralysis. D. Arytenoidectomy Arytenoidectomy involves the removal of the arytenoid cartilage, which helps widen the airway by preventing excessive vocal cord closure.
