      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vth nerve (Trigeminal Nerve). Acoustic neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma) is a benign tumor arising from the Schwann cells of the vestibular division of the VIIIth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve). As the tumor grows, it compresses adjacent cranial nerves in a predictable sequence. The earliest nerve to be involved (after the VIIIth nerve) is the Vth cranial nerve (Trigeminal Nerve) due to its anatomical proximity. Trigeminal nerve involvement leads to: Facial numbness (most commonly in the V2/V3 distribution). Loss of corneal reflex (afferent limb affected). Mild facial pain or paresthesia in some cases. This occurs because the trigeminal nerve is located anterior to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), where acoustic neuromas typically grow. Incorrect Options: B. VIIth Nerve (Facial Nerve) The facial nerve (VII) is also in close proximity but is typically affected after the trigeminal nerve. When involved, it leads to facial weakness, hemifacial spasms, or loss of taste sensation on the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. However, since the trigeminal nerve is larger and more medially positioned, it is affected earlier. C. XIth Nerve (Spinal Accessory Nerve) The spinal accessory nerve (XI) is located lower in the brainstem, supplying the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It is affected late in large tumors when there is significant brainstem compression. D. XIIth Nerve (Hypoglossal Nerve) The hypoglossal nerve (XII) controls tongue movements and is affected very late in the course of an expanding acoustic neuroma. Involvement leads to tongue deviation and atrophy, but this occurs only in large tumors compressing the brainstem and lower cranial nerves.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypoesthesia of the posterior meatal wall. Hitzelberger’s sign is a clinical finding seen in patients with acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma). It refers to hypoesthesia (reduced sensation) of the posterior meatal wall due to the involvement of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The facial nerve gives a sensory branch (auricular branch or Ramsay Hunt branch) that supplies the posterior wall of the external auditory canal. As an acoustic neuroma enlarges, it compresses the facial nerve, leading to sensory loss over the posterior meatal wall. This is often one of the earliest signs of facial nerve involvement, even before the onset of facial weakness or paralysis. Incorrect Options: A. Reduced Corneal Sensitivity Corneal sensation is mediated by the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (V). In acoustic neuroma, trigeminal nerve involvement can occur (causing loss of corneal reflex), but this is not called Hitzelberger’s sign. C. Paraesthesia of the Face Facial paraesthesia (tingling, numbness) is caused by trigeminal nerve (V) compression, which is not part of Hitzelberger’s sign. However, facial numbness in the V2/V3 region can occur in larger tumors due to trigeminal involvement. D. Delayed Blink Reflex The blink reflex involves both the trigeminal (afferent) and facial (efferent) nerves. While acoustic neuroma can cause a delayed blink reflex, this is not known as Hitzelberger’s sign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ptosis. Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) is caused by dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) or the sympathetic nervous system (Horner’s syndrome). However, acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) does not affect the oculomotor nerve, as it primarily arises from the vestibular division of the VIIIth cranial nerve in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). Since cranial nerve III is located in the midbrain, it is not commonly compressed by an acoustic neuroma, making ptosis an unlikely feature. Incorrect Options: A. Vertigo Acoustic neuroma arises from the vestibular nerve, which controls balance. Early symptoms often include episodic vertigo, unsteadiness, and dizziness, which can worsen as the tumor grows. C. Unilateral Deafness Unilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common early symptom of acoustic neuroma. This occurs due to compression of the cochlear nerve (VIIIth cranial nerve). Patients often complain of difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments. D. Loss of Corneal Reflex Acoustic neuroma can compress the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), leading to loss of corneal reflex (afferent limb is affected). This occurs when the tumor grows large enough to involve the cerebellopontine angle. The Hitzelberger’s sign (hypoesthesia of the posterior meatal wall) is another trigeminal nerve-related symptom.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inferior vestibular division of the 8th nerve. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells of the vestibular division of the 8th cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve). Most commonly, it originates from the inferior vestibular division of the vestibulocochlear nerve. This division runs through the internal acoustic meatus and enters the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), where the tumor enlarges and compresses adjacent cranial nerves. The tumor initially causes vestibular symptoms (imbalance, vertigo) and later leads to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and tinnitus due to cochlear nerve compression. Incorrect Options: A. Superior Vestibular Division of the 8th Nerve While some acoustic neuromas may arise from the superior vestibular division, the inferior vestibular division is the more common site of origin. The superior vestibular nerve supplies the superior and lateral semicircular canals and the utricle, contributing to balance. C. Cochlear Nerve The cochlear nerve (auditory nerve) is responsible for hearing, and while acoustic neuroma affects it secondarily (causing SNHL and tinnitus), it is not the primary site of origin. D. Facial Nerve The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) runs in close proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the internal acoustic meatus, but acoustic neuroma does not originate from it. Facial nerve involvement (causing facial weakness or hypoesthesia of the posterior meatal wall – Hitzelberger’s sign) occurs in later stages due to tumor compression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Recruitment is present (which is false in retrocochlear hearing loss). Recruitment is an abnormal increase in perceived loudness with only a small increase in sound intensity. It is a feature of cochlear hearing loss (sensory hearing loss), commonly seen in conditions like Meniere’s disease and presbycusis. In retrocochlear hearing loss (caused by lesions beyond the cochlea, such as acoustic neuroma, vestibular schwannoma, or central auditory pathway disorders), recruitment is absent because the issue is neural dysfunction rather than damage to the hair cells. Instead of recruitment, patients experience poor speech discrimination and adaptation issues due to neural fatigue. Incorrect Options: A. Tone Decay is Faster Tone decay refers to the inability to sustain hearing a continuous tone due to neural dysfunction. In retrocochlear lesions, neurons fail to maintain the auditory signal, leading to a rapid decline in sound perception (positive tone decay test). C. Roll-Over Phenomenon is Present The roll-over phenomenon refers to a decrease in speech discrimination at higher intensity levels, seen in retrocochlear pathology. In normal and cochlear hearing loss, speech discrimination improves with louder sounds, but in retrocochlear hearing loss, it deteriorates due to neural damage. D. Poor Speech Discrimination Score Speech discrimination is disproportionately worse in retrocochlear hearing loss compared to the degree of hearing loss. This is because the lesion affects neural processing rather than just sound detection. Speech audiometry typically shows poor word recognition scores even when the sound is audible",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Superior vestibular and facial nerves. Explanation for the Correct Answer (D – Bill’s Bar Separates the Superior Vestibular and Facial Nerves): Bill’s Bar is a bony crest located inside the internal auditory canal (IAC). It serves as an important anatomical landmark that separates: Superiorly → Facial nerve (CN VII) Inferiorly → Superior vestibular nerve (a branch of CN VIII, vestibulocochlear nerve) This anatomical division is important in surgical approaches to acoustic neuroma, helping surgeons differentiate the facial nerve from vestibular structures. Incorrect Options: A. Superior and Inferior Vestibular Nerves – Incorrect The superior and inferior vestibular nerves are separated by a horizontal crest (falciform crest), not by Bill’s bar. The superior vestibular nerve innervates the utricle, superior semicircular canal, and lateral semicircular canal, while the inferior vestibular nerve supplies the saccule and posterior semicircular canal. B. Facial and Cochlear Nerves – Incorrect The facial nerve (CN VII) and cochlear nerve (CN VIII) are separated laterally within the IAC, but Bill’s bar does not divide them. Instead, they are divided by the falciform crest and nerve arrangement in the IAC. C. Inferior Vestibular and Singular Nerves – Incorrect The singular nerve is a small branch from the inferior vestibular nerve, supplying the posterior semicircular canal.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Acoustic neuroma (which does not typically cause Tullio's phenomenon). Tullio’s phenomenon refers to sound-induced vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance due to abnormal communication between the middle and inner ear or abnormal inner ear function. It occurs when loud sounds create an abnormal vestibular response, typically seen in conditions affecting the semicircular canals or inner ear fluid dynamics. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) does NOT typically cause Tullio’s phenomenon because: It is a slow-growing tumor affecting the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), leading to gradual hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance issues, but not sound-induced vertigo. The tumor compresses the nerve, rather than causing abnormal sound transmission to the vestibular system. Incorrect Options: A. Perilymph Fistula – Correct (Causes Tullio’s Phenomenon) A perilymph fistula is an abnormal connection between the middle ear and inner ear (usually at the oval or round window). Loud sounds can cause fluid shifts, stimulating the vestibular system and triggering dizziness or vertigo. B. Meniere’s Syndrome – Correct (Can Cause Tullio’s Phenomenon) Meniere’s disease is characterized by endolymphatic hydrops (fluid overload in the inner ear). Sound-induced dizziness can occur due to increased inner ear pressure affecting vestibular function. C. Post-Fenestration Surgery – Correct (Can Cause Tullio’s Phenomenon) Fenestration surgery (an older procedure for otosclerosis) creates an artificial opening in the inner ear, which can lead to abnormal fluid dynamics. This can result in sound-induced vertigo, similar to a perilymph fistula.",
