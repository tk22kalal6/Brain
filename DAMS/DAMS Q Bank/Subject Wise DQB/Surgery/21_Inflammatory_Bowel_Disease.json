      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) There are no differences in the recurrence rates or resection with a 2-cm margin or a 12-cm margin from gross disease. The additional bowel lost may contribute to eventual short gut syndrome in a patient who requires multiple resections, so minimizing bowel loss is a priority. There is no benefit to achieving frozen section negative margins in the resection of Crohn’s strictures; positive margin resections have the same recurrence rate as negative margin resections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The liver is a common site for extracolonic disease in inflammatory bowel disease. Fatty infiltration of the liver is present in 40 to 50% of patients, and cirrhosis is found in 2 to 5%. Primary sclerosing cholangiitis is a progressive disease characterized by intra- and extrahepatic bile duct strictures. Bile duct carcinoma is a rare complication of long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. Arthritis also is a common extracolonic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, and the incidence is 20 times greater than in the general population. Erythema nodosum is seen in 5 to 15% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and usually coincides with clinical disease activity. Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon but serious condition that occurs almost exclusively in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Up to 10% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease will develop ocular lesions. These include uveitis, iritis, episcleritis, and conjunctivitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Typically, a fissure from Crohn disease is particularly deep or broad and perhaps better described as an anal ulcer. These fissures are often multiple and located in a lateral position rather than anterior or posterior midline as seen in an idiopathic fissure in ano. A classic-appearing fissure in ano located laterally should raise the suspicion of Crohn disease",
