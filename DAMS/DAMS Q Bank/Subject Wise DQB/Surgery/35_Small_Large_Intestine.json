      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) For a 30-year-old lady presenting with acute pain abdomen, constipation, and vomiting, strongly suspecting acute intestinal obstruction, the X-ray abdomen (typically including erect and supine postures) is considered the initial investigation of choice. This is due to its widespread availability, low cost, and ability to rapidly confirm the presence of intestinal obstruction by revealing characteristic findings such as dilated bowel loops and multiple air-fluid levels (especially visible on the erect film). These findings are crucial for a presumptive diagnosis of obstruction, allowing for prompt initiation of management, such as fluid resuscitation, nasogastric tube decompression, and surgical consultation. Why other options are incorrect or less preferred as the initial investigation of choice: B. Barium enema: This involves administering barium contrast rectally to visualize the large bowel. It is generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in suspected acute intestinal obstruction, especially if there's a risk of bowel perforation or if the obstruction is in the small bowel. Introducing contrast can worsen the obstruction or lead to severe peritonitis if leakage occurs. Therefore, it is not an appropriate initial investigation in this acute setting. C. USG (Ultrasonography): While USG is non-invasive and doesn't involve radiation, its utility in diagnosing intestinal obstruction is limited compared to X-ray or CT. Bowel gas often obscures visualization, making it difficult to assess the entire length of the bowel and pinpoint the exact site or cause of obstruction accurately. While it might show dilated loops or free fluid, it lacks the comprehensive detail needed for definitive diagnosis and management planning in obstruction. D. CT scan: A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is indeed the most accurate and comprehensive imaging modality for diagnosing, characterizing, and identifying the cause and complications of intestinal obstruction. It can provide detailed information crucial for guiding definitive management. However, in many clinical algorithms and for the initial rapid assessment in an emergency setting, plain X-rays are often performed first. The question asks for the \"investigation of choice,\" which, especially in the context of older AIIMS questions, often refers to the initial, rapid diagnostic tool before more advanced imaging (like CT) is performed for detailed characterization. In many emergency departments, a plain X-ray is the very first imaging step after clinical evaluation for suspected obstruction.",

This should be divided and the remaining adhesions left in situ unless severe angulation is present. Division of these adhesions will only cause further adhesion formation. • When obstruction is caused by an area of multiple adhesions, the adhesions should be freed by sharp dissection. • To prevent recurrence, the bare area should be covered with omental grafts. • Laparoscopic adhesiolysis may be considered in highly selected cases of chronic subacute obstruction.",

Option D is not the answer as appendicitis typically presents as a pain in right iliac fossa.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery594.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Small intestine function generally normalizes first, often within several hours of surgery. Gastric motility usually returns to normal within 24-48 hours after surgery. The colon is usually the final portion of the GI tract to regain normal motility, which usually occurs within 48-72 hours after surgery. Motility normalizes in the proximal colon first and then progresses to the transverse and left colon.

Option C is wrong as meckel’s diverticulum is almost always a single diverticula arising from the antimesenteric border.

Option B is false as diverticulitis is never asymptomatic it is always symptomatic, diverticulosis can be asymptomatic and can be incidentally detected. Option C Is false as the natural course of diverticulitis tends to be more aggressive in older individual . Option D is correct as diverticulitis is more common on left side with sigmoid colon being the most common site. Option E is also correct as we do not require operation in all the stages of diverticulitis, stages I and II can be managed conservatively or percutaneous interventions and higher stages need operative intervention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Option B is the answer in this question as hartman’s procedure is a proctosigmoidectomy, procedure is the surgical resection of the rectosigmoid colon with closure of the anorectal stump and formation of an end colostomy. It was used to treat colon cancer or inflammation (proctosigmoiditis, proctitis, diverticulitis, etc.). Currently, its use is limited to emergency surgery when immediate anastomosis is not possible, or more rarely it is used palliatively in patients with colorectal tumours Option A is wrong as the stoma which is made in colorectal carcinoma is a diversion colostomy and not the defunctioning colostomy. Option C and D that is total colectomy or hemicolectomy are the procedures which are rarely done in emergency setting.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/668018700.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Serial measurement of CEA levels is an accepted and widely used screening tool for detecting recurrence of colon cancer, especially in patients who have undergone curative resection. Rising CEA levels can be an early indicator of recurrence, even before clinical or radiological signs appear. Incorrect options: A. Screening sigmoidoscopy While sigmoidoscopy is a valid method for detecting initial colorectal cancer, especially in the distal colon, it is not typically used to monitor for recurrence, particularly in patients who have had a prior full evaluation and treatment for colon cancer. B. Screening the stool for occult blood Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is useful for initial screening in asymptomatic individuals but is not reliable for detecting recurrence in patients already treated for colon cancer. It lacks the sensitivity and specificity needed for surveillance. C. Stool cytology Stool cytology is not a recommended or reliable method for screening or monitoring colon cancer. It has low diagnostic accuracy and is rarely used in clinical practice for this purpose.",

Our main aim in old frill patients is not the complete cure of the disease in emergency setting as they will not be able to withstand the operation but our main aim is to find a proper diversion for the stool and relieve constipation. Option B is wrong as Abdominal perineal resection is never performed in an emergency setting it is performed always as a planned procedure. Option C is also wrong as resection and primary anastomosis if done in emergency setting there is a high chance that it will leak . So obstruction in emergency setting is best managed by performing a stoma formation, Hartman’s procedure or laser recanalization which are palliative treatment options.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Indeed, the IMA is frequently occluded in conditions requiring aortic surgery, and in such circumstances, transection of the IMA does not require reimplantation. However, in this situation, the left colon is dependent on collateral blood supply, and transient hypotension at the time of the vascular procedure or immediately after surgery may result in ischemic injury to the vulnerable colonic mucosa. In aortic surgeries, the IMA is assessed for backbleeding. If there is strong backbleeding (stump pressure > 40 mm Hg), the IMA is ligated close to the aorta or oversewn from within the sac. Poor backbleeding from the IMA is a sign of insufficient collateral circulation to the sigmoid colon, and reimplantation of the IMA with a patch of the aorta into the aortic limb is warranted.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The caecum is most frequently a retroperitoneal structure, and therefore not susceptible to twisting. However, in up to 20% of individuals there is congenital incomplete peritoneal covering of the caecum with formation of a 'mobile' caecum on a mesentery, such that it no longer lies in the right iliac fossa. This is a normal variant but is associated with increased incidence of folding or twisting of the caecum (caecal volvulus), which may be complicated by obstruction, vascular compromise, or perforation. On Xray it shows up as a comma shaped caecum . Sigmoid Volvulus: The coffee-bean sign (also known as the kidney bean sign or bent inner tube sign ) is a sign on an abdominal plain radiograph of a sigmoid volvulus although some authors have also used the term to refer to closed loop small bowel obstructions.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/1077568A.21.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Retroperitoneal sarcomas are rare tumours accounting for only 1–2% of all solid malignancies (10–20% of all sarcomas are retroperitoneal). The peak incidence is in the fifth decade of life. The most frequently encountered cell types are:liposarcoma ,leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) Patients with sarcomas present late, because these tumours arise in the large potential spaces of the retroperitoneum and can grow very large without producing symptoms. Moreover, when symptoms do occur, they are non-specific, such as abdominal pain and fullness. Detailed multiplanar imaging (CT + MRI) with reconstructions is required not only for tumour detection, staging and surgical planning, but also for guiding percutaneous or surgical biopsy of these tumours. Such biopsies have a greater role than for other sarcomas. The definitive treatment of primary retroperitoneal sarcomas is surgical resection. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy without surgical debulking have rarely been beneficial, when used alone or in combination. The most common types of vascular involvement precluding resection are involvement of the proximal superior mesenteric vessels or involvement of bilateral renal vessels.",

Because the lymphatics of the colon accompany the main arterial supply, the length of bowel resected depends on which vessels are supplying the segment involved with the cancer. Any adjacent organ or tissue, such as the omentum, that has been invaded should be resected en bloc with the tumor. If the metastatic disease is low volume (isolated or potentially resectable liver lesions) and the resection of the primary tumor is straight forward (segmental abdominal colectomy), it is probably reasonable to proceed with resection. On the other hand, if the metastatic disease is high volume (carcinomatosis), especially if the primary tumor is minimally symptomatic, the operation should be aborted in order to facilitate early systemic chemotherapy.",

This syndrome is usually seen in young asthenic females with predisposing conditions of weight loss, scoliosis or corrective surgery for it, supine mobilization, and placement of a body cast. The diagnosis is usually made with either a barium upper GI series or a CT, with oral and intravenous (IV) contrast enhancement demonstrating a dilated duodenum and stomach with an abrupt or nearly complete cutoff of contrast agent at the third portion of the duodenum and minimal flow into the jejunum. Conservative management consisting of nutritional supplementation can be tried initially. In patients who fail medical management, the operative treatment of choice is duodenojejunostomy",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Most fistulas are iatrogenic and result from anastomotic leakage, inadvertent injury to the bowel during the operation, laceration of the bowel during an abdominal closure, or retained foreign bodies. Less than 2% of fistulas are the result of diseased bowel. When they are, the most common contributing factors are preoperative radiation therapy, intestinal obstruction, and inflammatory bowel disease. Although small bowel fistulas occasionally lead to generalized peritonitis, they most commonly produce a walled-off abscess manifested as an infection of the operative incision. The initial drainage may be purulent, but if the infection is caused by anastomotic leakage of the small bowel, the drainage becomes enteric within 1 to 2 days.",
