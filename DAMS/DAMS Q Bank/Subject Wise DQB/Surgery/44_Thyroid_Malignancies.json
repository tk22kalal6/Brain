      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Once you have operated on a patient of papillary carcinoma of thyroid we need to provide thyroxine externally as we have removed the thyroid tissue and it also helps to suppress any part of thissue which has been left inside. Then after about 4-6 weeks patient becomes euthyroid and then we discontinue thyroxine and put the patient on RAI so that the remaining of the tissue which is left inside is ablated by RAI. And after that we restart thyroxine and use thyroglobulin as a marker of recurrence. Bone scan is done if patient has any symptoms, like bone pain. CECT does not help to access any residual disease after thyroidectomy.",
