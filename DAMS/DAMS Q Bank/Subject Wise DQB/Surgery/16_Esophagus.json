It occurs in elderly patients and those who have carcinoma of esophagus. Option A. Primary achalasia is a condition where we have loss of ganglion cells in the lower part of esophagus. Option B. Secondary achalasia develops in chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which leads to destruction of the ganglion cells. Option D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) POEM : Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy is a treatment option for achalasia cardia POEM represents a new paradigm for achalasia treatment. It combines the minimally invasive benefit of endoscopy with the durability of a surgical myotomy. First performed in 2008, POEM uses a flexible upper endoscope to create a small incision into the mucosa of the esophagus. The endoscope is then tunneled into the esophageal wall and an endoscopic myotomy is performed (analogous to one performed during a traditional Heller myotomy). Once complete, the esophageal mucosal incision is closed using clips. Option A. GERD is managed by medical drugs which prevent the acid reflux and in later stage we need to do a fundoplication for GERD. Option C. Leiomyoma of esophagus is managed by enucleation Option D. Barrett's esophagus can be managed by ablation of the mucosa followed by fundoplication.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/42628964.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) In eosinophilic esophagitis, a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the lining of esophagus. This buildup, which is a reaction to foods, allergens or acid reflux, can inflame or injure the esophageal tissue. Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or cause food to get stuck when you swallow. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic immune system disease. Endoscopically, ridges, furrows, or rings may be seen in the esophageal wall. Sometimes, multiple rings may occur in the esophagus, leading to the term \"corrugated esophagus\" or \"feline esophagus\" due to similarity of the rings to the cat esophagus. Presence of white exudates in esophagus is also suggestive of the diagnosis. Radiologically, the term \"ringed esophagus\" has been used for the appearance of eosinophilic esophagitis on barium swallow studies to contrast with the appearance of transient transverse folds sometimes seen with esophageal reflux (termed \"feline esophagus”) Option B . In hiatal hernia we see Cameron's ulcer in the fundus . Options C and D . These are not associated with feline esophagus.",

LPR may play a role in other diseases, such as sinusitis, otitis media, and rhinitis,and can be a comorbidity of asthma. Laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) cases are common in clinical practice and usually neglected for want of a definitive diagnosis.

In some cases, it may cause symptoms such as chest pain, similar to heart disease. The cause of DES remains unknown. Certain abnormalities on x-ray imaging are commonly observed in DES, such as a \"corkscrew\" or \"rosary bead esophagus\", although these findings are not unique to this condition. Specialized testing called manometry can be performed to evaluate the motor function of the esophagus, which can help identify abnormal patterns of muscle contraction within the esophagus that are suggestive of DES. The treatment of DES consists primarily of medications, such as acid suppressing agents (like proton pump inhibitors), calcium channel blockers, hyoscine butylbromide, or nitrates. Option A.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Achalasia is characterized by difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation, and sometimes chest pain. Diagnosis is reached with esophageal manometry and barium swallow radiographic studies. Various treatments are available, although none cures the condition. Certain medications or Botox may be used in some cases, but more permanent relief is brought by esophageal dilatation and surgical cleaving of the muscle (Heller myotomy). The most common form is primary achalasia, which has no known underlying cause. It is due to the failure of distal esophageal inhibitory neurons. However, a small proportion occurs secondary to other conditions, such as esophageal cancer, Chagas disease (an infectious disease common in South America) or Triple-A syndrome. Achalasia affects about one person in 100,000 per year. There is no gender predominance for the occurrence of disease.",

The diagnosis is made by esophagography demonstrating a classic picture of a corkscrew esophagus. Manometry will show simultaneous multipeaked contractions similar to those seen in achalasia; however, the LES will have normal receptive relaxation. A variant of achalasia in which amplitude pressure is normal or elevated is also known as vigorous achalasia. Pharmacotherapy (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors) aimed at smooth muscle relaxation is the first-line treatment of DES. Bougie or pneumatic dilations are used with variable results for severe dysphagia with documented LES hypertension. Surgery, which involves a long esophagomyotomy from the level of the aortic arch to the LES, is reserved for patients who fail pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prolonged measurement of pH is now accepted as the most accurate method for the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is particularly useful in patients with atypical reflux symptoms, those without endoscopic oesophagitis and when patients respond poorly to intensive medical therapy. A small pH probe is passed into the distal oesophagus and positioned 5 cm above the upper margin of the LOS, as defined by manometry. The probe is connected to a miniature digital recorder that is worn on a belt and allows most normal activities. Patients mark symptomatic events such as heartburn. A 24-hour recording period is usual, and the pH record is analysed by an automated computer program. An oesophageal pH <4 at the level of the pH electrode is conventionally considered the cut-off value and, in most oesophageal laboratories, the total time when pH is <4 in a 24-hour period does not exceed 4% in a healthy adult. Patterns of reflux and the correlation between symptoms and oesophageal pH <4 can be calculated. Most laboratories use a scoring system (Johnson–DeMeester) to create a numerical value, above which reflux is considered pathological.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The mechanism of a Mallory-Weiss tear is similar to that of an esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome), but differs in that the injury is not full thickness (A). It is the result of forceful vomiting or coughing, such as after an alcohol drinking binge. The classic description is retching followed by vomiting of blood. The presence of a hiatal hernia is a predisposing factor and is found in a majority of patients. This situation exposes the LES to high pressures, which results in a partial-thickness mucosal tear and bleeding most commonly 3 to 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction on the left side (B). Boerhaave syndrome results in a full-thickness tear causing esophageal perforation (A). These patients often present in sepsis with air in the mediastinum and a pleural effusion. Severe sepsis in the setting of esophageal perforation mandates surgical intervention (C). Most bleeding from Mallory-Weiss tears stops spontaneously with nonsurgical management",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A Zenker diverticulum is a false, esophageal diverticulum that does not contain all layers of the esophagus; it is also a type of pulsion diverticulum (A). A pulsion diverticulum forms at a point of weakness and is due to alterations in luminal pressure. Conversely, a traction diverticulum is from external pulling on the esophageal wall, such as from inflamed lymph nodes with tuberculosis. Zenker diverticulum is the most common type of esophageal diverticulum. It usually presents in older patients (>60 years). It characteristically arises at a point of weakness, most commonly at the Killian triangle, which is formed by the inferior fibers of the inferior constrictor muscle and the superior border of the cricopharyngeus muscle. Patients typically present with dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, halitosis, episodes of aspiration, and salivation (C). With the characteristic history, the first diagnostic study is a barium swallow. In the absence of other pathology (such as an irregular mucosa), endoscopy is not needed (B).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dysphagia lusoria (dysphagia by a freak of nature) refers to difficulty in swallowing due to compression of the esophagus by an aberrant right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery arises distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery in the descending thoracic aorta, traverses the mediastinum posterior to the esophagus and trachea, and then follows the course of the normal artery into the right upper extremity. It is usually asymptomatic. The most common associated symptom is dysphagia associated with compression of the esophagus between the trachea and the artery.",

In South America, chronic infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas’ disease, which has marked clinical similarities to achalasia. Oesophageal motility disorders are currently best classified by incorporation of the Chicago classification developed for use with high-resolution manometry. The classic physiological abnormalities are a non-relaxing LOS and absent peristalsis in the body of the oesophagus. The Chicago classification identifies three variants. Although most patients have almost no recognisable contractions (type I), some patients continue to exhibit pressurisation throughout the oesophagus (type 2), whereas in others the oesophagus is of normal calibre and exhibits high-pressure contractile (although non-peristaltic) activity (spastic oesophagus, vigorous achalasia). The two main methods are forceful dilatation of the cardia and laparoscopic cardiomyotomy (conventionally performed together with a partial fundoplication), although in recent years there has been growing interest in the use of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).",

This presence of goblet cells in the columnar epithelium is a hallmark of Barrett's esophagus, distinguishing it from other types of epithelium that might contain mucus-secreting foveolar cells. The key feature of Barrett's esophagus is the transformation of the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus into this specialized columnar type.",
