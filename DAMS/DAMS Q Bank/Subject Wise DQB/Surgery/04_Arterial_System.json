This increased blood flow to to the skin will help in treating distal ischemia affecting the skin of the toes. Option A is wrong as presence of intermittent claudication is a contraindication for lumbar sympathectomy. The reason for this is when a person is subjected to lumbar sympathectomy the blood flow is redistributed and redirected from the deeper muscle tissue to superficial skin, this increases the symptoms of intermittent claudication as it increases the ischemia to the underlying muscles and so we do not do lumbar sympathectomy if the patient has intermittent claudication. Option C Lumbar sympathectomy has nothing to do with arteriovenous fistula. Treatment of small AV Fistula is embolization and Large AV Fistula is excision. Option D Lumbar Sympathectomy has role to play in the treatment of back pain. Back pain can be because of number of reasons and we should try to find out the cause of back pain and treat accordingly.",

Option A is wrong and for erection we need parasympathetic outflow and if we perform lumbar sympathectomy it will not lead to impotence.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta occurs in the poorly controlled hypertension. The episode resembles an MI, with sudden onset of extremely severe, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back and migrates down shortly after its onset. There may be unequal pulses in the upper extremities, and chest x-ray shows a widened mediastinum. Definitive diagnosis should be sought by noninvasive means such as CTA or MRA, but TEE is useful as well. Option B. Myocardial infarction(MI) is a differential diagnosis of dissecting aortic aneurysm. ECG and cardiac enzymes should be done to rule out an MI. Option C. Pulmonary embolism (PE) typically occurs around postoperative day 7 in elderly and/or immobilized patients. The pain is pleuritic, sudden onset, and is accompanied by shortness of breath. The patient is anxious, diaphoretic, and tachycardic, with prominent distended veins in the neck and forehead (a low CVP virtually excludes the diagnosis) Option D. Acute pancreatitis should be suspected in the alcoholic who develops an “upper” acute abdomen. The classic picture has rapid onset for an inflammatory process (a few of hours), and the pain is constant, epigastric, radiating straight through to the back, with nausea, vomiting, and retching. Physical findings are relatively modest, but there may be vaguely localized discomfort in the epigastrium.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/21072a.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Fogarty catheter is used to remove fresh emboli in the arterial system. It consists of a hollow tube with an inflatable balloon attached to its tip. The catheter is inserted into the blood vessel through a clot. The balloon is then inflated to extract it from the vessel. It is available in different lengths and sizes, and is often colour coded by size. Because it is less invasive than ordinary surgery, it reduces the chance of postoperative complications.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/34476791.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

It is classically associated with early-stage peripheral artery disease, and can progress to critical limb ischemia unless treated or risk factors are modified. Option A. Rest pain is a feature of critical limb ischemia. Intermittent claudication is never present on first step. If pain is present on first step it is usually of Osteo-arthritis Neurogenic claudication varies with posture- More on standing erect but less on bending forward.

As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes, but can last several hours. Episodes are often triggered by cold or emotional stress The two main types are primary Raynaud's, when the cause is unknown, and secondary Raynaud's, which occurs as a result of another condition. Secondary Raynaud's can occur due to a connective-tissue disorder, such as scleroderma or lupus, injuries to the hands, prolonged vibration, smoking, thyroid problems, and certain medications, such as birth control pills.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Allen test is a medical sign used in physical examination of arterial blood flow to the hands. Allen test, one hand is examined at a time: 1. The hand is elevated and the patient is asked to clench their fist for about 30 seconds. 2. Pressure is applied over the ulnar and the radial arteries so as to occlude both of them. 3. Still elevated, the hand is then opened. It should appear blanched (pallor may be observed at the finger nails). 4. Ulnar pressure is released while radial pressure is maintained, and the colour should return within 5 to 15 seconds. If color returns as described, Allen's test is considered to be normal. If color fails to return, the test is considered abnormal and it suggests that the ulnar artery supply to the hand is not sufficient. This indicates that it may not be safe to cannulate or needle the radial artery. Option B. Adson’s test is a provocative test used to diagnose Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Options C and D. Trendelenburg test and Schwartz test is used for varicose vein.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery82.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

The arm may be supplied by blood flowing in a retrograde direction down the vertebral artery at the expense of the vertebrobasilar circulation. This is called the subclavian steal.
