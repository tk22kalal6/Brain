      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pierre Robin sequence 1. Key Features in the Scenario: o The infant presents with a midline defect in the hard and soft palate, consistent with cleft palate. o Feeding difficulties and nasal regurgitation are common in cleft palate due to lack of separation between the oral and nasal cavities. 2. Associated Anomalies: o Pierre Robin sequence is commonly associated with cleft palate and includes: o Micrognathia (small jaw) o Glossoptosis (posterior displacement of the tongue) o Cleft palate o Hearing loss (B) can occur due to eustachian tube dysfunction, but it is not the most common associated anomaly. o Congenital heart disease (A) and other anomalies are less frequently associated compared to syndromic causes like Pierre Robin sequence. 3. Management: o Address feeding issues with specialized bottles. o Surgical repair is typically performed around 9–12 months of age.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Palatal shelves 1. Embryological Basis: o The palatal shelves, which are outgrowths of the maxillary processes, normally elevate and fuse to form the hard and soft palate. o Failure of fusion of the palatal shelves leads to a cleft palate. 2. Differentiating Other Structures: o Medial nasal processes (A) and lateral nasal processes (B) are involved in the formation of the nose and upper lip. o Maxillary processes (C) contribute to the upper jaw and anterior part of the palate but do not directly cause cleft palate if they fail to fuse. 3. Clinical Significance: o Understanding embryology helps guide the timing and techniques of surgical repair.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hypernasality 1. Key Features in the Scenario: o Cleft palate leads to velopharyngeal insufficiency, where the soft palate cannot adequately separate the oral and nasal cavities during speech. o This results in hypernasality, a nasal quality in the voice due to air escaping through the nose during speech. 2. Differential Diagnoses: o Articulation disorder (A) can occur in cleft palate but is less common than hypernasality. o Stuttering (C) are unrelated to cleft palate anatomy. o Mutism (D) is unrelated to the structural defect. 3. Management: o Surgical repair of the palate and speech therapy are essential to correct the defect and improve speech quality.",

Risk Factors for Cleft Palate: o Anticonvulsant medications, such as phenytoin or valproic acid, are strongly associated with craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate. Other risk factors: o Maternal smoking (A): Associated with cleft lip more than cleft palate. o Folic acid deficiency (B): Linked to neural tube defects, not cleft palate. o Maternal diabetes (C): May increase risk but are less strongly associated than anticonvulsants. 2. Prevention: o Women on anticonvulsants should consult their physician to balance seizure control with teratogenic risks. o Preconception folic acid supplementation is recommended to reduce overall congenital anomaly risk.",
