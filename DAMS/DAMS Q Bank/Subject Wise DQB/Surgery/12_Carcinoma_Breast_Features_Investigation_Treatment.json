      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Whenever you start the workup of a breast lesion first investigation is always a radiological investigation in the form of mammography because if you do a needle biopsy or FNAC it hampers the tissue architecture and can hamper the results of mammography. In this particular case even though patient has a palpable mass still you will subject the patient to mammography to rule out any other non palpable lesion in the same or contralateral breast. FNAC can be performed after mammography as a screening test, it can help you differentiate benign from malignant but it can not give you the definitive diagnosis and can not comment on the ER PR and Her2 neu status. FNAC cannot distinguish follicular adenoma from follicular carcinoma. Only role of USG in case of a breast lesion is to differentiate between a solid and a cystic lesion. USG can not make the diagnosis of breast carcinoma. Best diagnostic method for a breast lump is excision biopsy, tissue diagnosis is the best method to reach the diagnosis of breast carcinoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) MRI is the investigation of choice for high risk breast cancer like the one who have a familial risk with BRCA gene mutation and those with strong family history of breast carcinoma. The reason being MRI can detect even the early lesions in these patients and help in making the diagnosis at a early stage. Role of PET CT in a patient of breast carcinoma is to look for metastasis and not for diagnosis. Mammography helps as a screening tool in general population and starts at the age of 40 years but it is less sensitive in high risk patients when compared with efficacy of MRI. Only role of USG in case of a breast lesion is to differentiate between a solid and a cystic lesion. USG can not make the diagnosis of breast carcinoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Most sensitive imaging for DCIS of breast is MRI. MRI is the investigation of choice for high risk breast cancer like the one who have a familial risk with BRCA gene mutation and those with strong family history of breast carcinoma. The reason being MRI can detect even the early lesions in these patients and help in making the diagnosis at a early stage. Mammography helps as a screening tool in general population and starts at the age of 40 years but it is less sensitive in high risk patients when compared with efficacy of MRI. Role of PET CT in a patient of breast carcinoma is to look for metastasis and not for diagnosis. Only role of USG in case of a breast lesion is to differentiate between a solid and a cystic lesion. USG can not make the diagnosis of breast carcinoma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tamoxifen is a SERM (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator) so this means that tamoxifen has anti estrogenic effects on breast but it has pro estrogenic effects on uterus and blood. Because of this use of tamoxifen can lead to the formation of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma. One of the reasons for using tamoxifen is to prevent the formation of breast carcinoma in the contralateral breast in pre menopausal women.",

CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modern second- and third-generation regimes include an anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes. Chemotherapy used to be prescribed only to premenopausal women with a poor prognosis (in whom its effects are likely to be the result, in part, of a chemical castration effect) but it is now also offered to postmenopausal women with poor prognosis disease. Chemotherapy may be considered in node-negative patients if other prognostic factors, such as tumour grade, imply a high risk of recurrence. The effect of combining hormone and chemotherapy is additive, although hormone therapy is started after completion of chemotherapy to reduce side effects.",

It is also known to reduce the incidence of secondary primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast. Tamoxifen increases the risk of Endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women , hence aromatase Inhibitors are used in post-menopausal women.

It mimics acute mastitis . The hallmark of Inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of the dermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin , often without a discrete underlying tumor mass (peau d' orange appearance). The patient presents with rapidly progressive swelling of the breast, warmth , erythema and edema . A breast lump may or may not be present . - A diagnosis of Inflammatory breast carcinoma should be suspected when a patient with rapidly progressive swelling with Inflammatory skin changes does not respond to antibiotics. The imaging features with ultrasound and a mammogram is non-specific because of underlying erythema and edema . A biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis.",

PET scan is not a part of the triple assessment method. Triple assessment of breast lump includes the following 3 parameters: - Clinical assessment: Clinical history and physical examination of the lump Radiological examination: USG or mammogram or both Cytological examination: FNAC or core biopsy of the lump . This is the most commonly used method as the PPV of this combination is 99.99%.",

It typically involves 2 components:- 1. Lumpectomy- with 1 mm margin. 2. Radiation therapy is recommended after lumpectomy(it's not optional) to destroy any remaining cancer cells and reduce the risk of local recurrence. 3.Axillary node dissection can be done as well frozen section (biopsy) can be done during surgery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lymph Node (LN) Status Lymph node involvement is the strongest independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. The number of involved axillary lymph nodes directly correlates with the risk of recurrence and overall survival. While distant metastasis (option B) is crucial for staging and indicates a poorer overall prognosis, it is more reflective of current stage rather than a modifiable or early prognostic indicator. Tumor size (option C) and hormone receptor status (option D) also matter, but they are secondary to lymph node status in terms of prognosis.",
