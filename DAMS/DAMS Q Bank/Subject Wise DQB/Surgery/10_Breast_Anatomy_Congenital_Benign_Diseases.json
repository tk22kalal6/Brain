      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) BREAST CYST Occur most commonly in the last decade of reproductive life as a result of a non-integrated involution of stroma and epithelium. Clinical Features Often multiple, may be bilateral and can mimic malignancy. Typically present suddenly and cause great alarm; prompt diagnosis and drainage provides immediate relief. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be confrmed by aspiration and/or ultrasound. Treatment Aspiration for Solitary cyst: If they resolve completely, and if the fluid is not blood-stained, no further treatment is required (30% will recur and require reaspiration) Core biopsy or local excision: If there is a residual lump or if the fluid is blood-stained, for histological diagnosis (exclude cystadenocarcinoma, which is more common in elderly women) Option A is wrong as cysts are common in patients who are 40-45 years of age. Option B is wrong as excision is not done as a primary treatment, we go for aspiration of the cyst as the primary treatment. Option C is false as breast cysts do not turn into a malignant disease.",

Option A is klinefelter’s syndrome in this there occurs a primary testicular failure and so we get a relative oestrogen excess as compared to testosterone as testosterone levels are very low in this condition. Option B is cirrhosis of liver in this the testosterone is not metabolized in liver and it get converted to estrogen in the peripheral tissue by the action of an enzyme aromatase which is present in the adipose tissue. Option C is cryptorchidism and in this we have testis which are situated in the abdominal cavity and as leydig cells are not affected in this condition. testosterone levels are normal normal and we have normal secondary sexual characters in these patients. Option D is sex cord tumors of sertoli cells as these cells secrete estrogen so we have absolute excess of estrogen secretion in the body and so patients develop gynecomastia.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery16.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

Typically breast abscesses are seen in staphylococcal infections and present with point tenderness, erythema, and hyperthermia. When these abscesses are related to lactation they usually occur within the first few weeks of breastfeeding.

Option E is wrong as metastasis is mostly by hematogenous route. • Leiomyosarcomas are malignant tumors composed of cells showing smooth muscle features •Locally aggressive tumor and hematogenous metastasis • Palpable axillary lymphadenopathy is uncommon and when encountered usually represents reactive LNs uninvolved by metastatic disease • A clinically negative axilla in presence of large tumor may be indicative of breast sarcoma • Tumor is well circumscribed or encapsulated • Simple mastectomy is gold standard of treatment • Axillary lymph node dissection is not indicated • Postoperative radiation may be used in patient undergoing mastectomy because chest wall recurrence are observed",
