      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Best procedure for the elective removal of CBD stone is ERCP with papillotomy with stent placement. It is minimally invasive approach, can be done in sedation and is a day care procedure with good results and good post operative recovery. So this is the treatment of choice for elective removal of CBD stones. Open choledocholithotomy is performed when CBD stones are detected intra operatively and the operating surgeon is not skilled to perform a laparoscopic CBD exploration. Laparoscopic choledocholithotomy is performed when CBD stones are detected intraoperatively and surgeon is skilled in laparoscopic CBD exploration.",

Option B is correct as primary CBD stones are the ones which are formed in the CBD because of an underlying infection and so they tend to be brown in colour. Secondary CBD stones are the ones which have formed in gall bladder and have migrated in the CBD from above, they tend to be cholesterol stones.

If there occurs an obstructive jaundice the biliary radicals along with gall bladder is distended but if there has been a gall bladder stone for a significant amount of time then these stones tend to lead to fibrosis of the gall bladder and if this happens then the gall bladder can not be distended because it has undergone fibrosis. If there occurs an obstruction of biliary tree because of carcinoma head of pancreas then gall bladder along with the biliary tree would be distended. Option A that is gall bladder stone and Option B that is pancreatic calculi will not lead to biliary obstruction on its own.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Synthetic absorbable suture such as Vicryl and PDS is preferred for CBD. Vicryl sutures are used in general soft tissue approximation and are preferred suture material for CBD. Non absorbable sutures ordinarily remain where they are buried within the tissues. This can cause late complications such as the development of Gallstones around non-absorbable sutures in the common bile duct or bladder stones in the urinary bladder. Option B and D are wrong because if we use non absorbable material then there occurs increased chance of stone formation as the non-absorbable suture acts as a nucleating agent. Option C is wrong as if we use natural absorbable suture it will cause severe tissue reaction and might lead to cholangiitis and stricture.",

The purpose of the T tube is to provide access to the biliary system for postoperative radiologic stone extraction and allow spasm or edema of sphincter to settle. The protocol which we follow is that we perform a post operative cholangiogram on day 7-10th , if this cholangiogram findings are normal we can procede and remove the T-tube on post operative day 12th. But If T-tube cholangiogram shows retained stones we have to keep the T-tube for 6 weeks as a stent so that the track matures and then stones can be removed percutaneously from this matured track by putting a choledochoscope and this is referred to as Burrhene’s technique.",

It is not because of any lack of knowledge or skills of the surgeon . Option A is correct as incidence of biliary injury following open cholecystectomy is in the range of 0.2-0.3 % Incidence of biliary injury is more following laparoscopic cholecystectomy,It is three times that with open cholecystectomy. If there is inadvertent ligation of a duct draining a particular portion of the liver it can lead to biliary cirrhosis.",

Sclerosing or scirrhous type is the one which is most common type, it has intense desmoplastic reaction and it is very difficult to treat so has a poor prognosis. Papillary carcinoma on the other hand is a rare variety and tends to grow into the lumen and has a favourable prognosis. Option B is correct as margin status and tumour stage determines a major prognostic factor in cholangiocarcinoma.

Option C is gall bladder stones and they can be easily picked up by USG and infact USG is the investigation of choise for GB Stones. Option D is ascites, and USG is a good investigation to look for ascites. Option B is the answer as USG can not pick up peritoneal deposits, CT scan is a better investigation for this as compared to USG but the best investigation is diagnostic laparoscopy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Primary Sclerosing cholangitis has a genetic predisposition owing its association with ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis is principally based on the findings at cholangiography, in which irregular, narrowed bile ducts are demonstrated in both the intrahepatic and the extrahepatic biliary tree. This condition often presents in young adults with mild non-specific symptoms. There is no specific treatment that can reverse the ductal changes, and the patients usually slowly progress to progressive cholestasis and death from liver failure. Serum CA 19-9 level may be increased but the sensitivity of CA 19-9 in detecting CCA in PSC is only 60%. Patients with good liver function, no dominant strictures and negative biliary cytology may simply be monitored for disease progression. The only useful treatment modality is liver transplantation, which is associated with excellent results if carried out before bile duct cancer has developed.",
