      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thyroglossal cyst is congenital in origin and can occur anywhere along the course of the thyroglossal tract, most common site of thyroglossal cyst is subhyoid . As the thyroglossal tract extends from the base of tongue to isthumus, so when a person swallows the cyst moves and makes the cyst move with it and when you protrude the tongue the cyst moves with it. And when we consider the treatment option we have to do a Sistrunk operation, which involves excision of the cyst and the tract and removal of the hyoid body. So Option A is wrong as the thyroglossal cyst moves with deglutition.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/12843.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

This denotes a lateral cervical lymphadenopathy in a case of papillary carcinoma of thyroid. Cervical lymph node enlargement in a papillary carcinoma of thyroid is called as lateral aberrant thyroid. Option A is wrong as sub acute thyroiditis presents with pain, it does not presents with lymph node enlargement. Option B is also wrong, this lymph node enlargement is because of the spread of the cancer from papillary carcinoma of thyroid to the cervical lymph nodes but this is not referred as a metastatic disease. It is just the lymph node enlargement and has good prognosis if it is treated timely. Option C is false as hashimoto’s thyroididtis does not have a lymph node enlargement .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Primary thyroid lymphoma is rare (<1% of all thyroid malignancies). There is an increased association between lymphoma and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In the current patient, the presence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a rapidly enlarging mass, and the constitutional symptoms are highly suggestive of primary thyroid lymphoma. If FNA fails to yield a diagnosis on the first attempt, it has been shown that repeated FNA is unlikely to be diagnostic in subsequent attempts. Observation is not an appropriate step in the management of any patient with a rapidly enlarging neck mass. Performing open or core biopsy is a feasible option in these circumstances and would more likely provide an adequate cell yield to complete flow cytometry and establish monoclonality. Treatment varies between chemotherapy and surgical ablation. Resection is typically reserved for patients who fail to respond to chemotherapy or have completed their course of adjuvant therapy and demonstrated incomplete regression of disease. If surgery is planned, total thyroidectomy should be performed, followed by chemotherapy.",
