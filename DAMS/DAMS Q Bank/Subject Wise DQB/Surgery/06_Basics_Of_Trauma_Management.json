In FAST we keep probe at epigastric, right hypochondriac, left hypochondriac and suprapubic region and by this we get an idea about fluid collection in peritoneal cavity and pericardial cavity.

Damage control includes an abbreviated laparotomy, temporary packing, and closure of the abdomen in an effort to blunt the physiologic response to prolonged shock and massive hemorrhage. These patients are often at limits of their physiological reserve when they present to operating room and persistent operative efforts result in exacerbation of their underlying hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis, initiating a vicious cycle that culminates in death. In these situations, abrupt termination of the procedure after control of surgical hemorrhage and contamination, followed by ICU resuscitation and staged reconstruction, can be life saving.",

Complications include: Hypocalcemia Due to citrate in stored blood binding calcium. Hypomagnesemia Can occur similarly due to citrate binding magnesium.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Definitive repair of all injuries Damage control surgery (DCS) is a staged approach aimed at controlling life-threatening conditions in critically injured patients. The components include: 1. Hemorrhage control – This involves stopping active bleeding using methods like packing, vessel ligation, or other temporary hemostatic techniques. 2. Prevention of contamination – This typically involves closing perforated hollow viscera or temporarily diverting bowel contents. 3. Temporary abdominal closure – The abdomen is often left open to reduce intra-abdominal pressure and allow for re-exploration. Definitive repair of all injuries is NOT part of the initial DCS phase because the focus is on stabilizing the patient physiologically (e.g., managing hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy) before proceeding with definitive repairs in subsequent operations. This approach minimizes operative time and allows for better patient outcomes in critically unstable trauma patients.",
