      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A is the answer as intraoperatively peristaltic movement of the ureter help to identify the ureter. There is a high chance that it will get confused with other structures so peristaltic movement is used to make sure that structure is ureter. In pelvic surgeries like APR and LAR we sometimes subject the patient to pre-operative DJ stenting before the operative procedure. We can not trace the ureter based on the rich arterial plexus, relation of renal vein and renal artery or relation of lumbar plexus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) there is no constriction of the ureter at the level of the ischial spine . There are 5 recognised narrowings in the ureter which may present obstacles to a stone’s passage through to the bladder and these are the PUJ, the point at which the ureter crosses the bifurcation of the common iliac artery and three areas in the distal ureter out of which ureterovesical junction is the narrowest part.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) This scenario shows a case of neglected ureteric calculi which has led to hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection and patient also has developed signs of renal failure as creatinine has risen above the normal limit. It is very important in this case to relieve the obstruction in the renal system and give the kidney to regain its function and hopefully reduction in the creatinine values. For this best method is Double J stenting of the ureter which reduces the pressure in the pelvicalyceal system . If DJ stenting fails we have to subject the patient to percutaneous nephrostomy to relive the pressure in the pelvicalyceal system. If the patient has acute rentention with UTI we do not go for immediate ureteroscopic retrival of stone, it is done once the kidney regains its functions and patient shows signs of improvement and reduction in creatinine value. Hemodialysis is reserved if the kidney does not show any signs of improvement and patient has persistent rise in creatinine values. Lithotripsy is not done in an acute scenario",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) PCNL stands for percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is a procedure done for the treatment of renal stones which are more than 2 cm in size. In this what we do is we create a track from skin to the calyces of the kidney, introduce a nephroscope in the calyces of kidney, then we try to break the stones into small pieces and then we remove the fragments, some of the fragments are washed away in the urine. As we have to make a track from skin to the kidney most common complication of PCNL is hematoma formation. As this a blind procedure done under C-Arm there is a high chance of injury to the structures. We can end up injuring Pleura, colon and spleen. Pleura is most commonly injured and patients develop pneumothorax. Coming back to this question as the question says we approached through 11th intercostal space there is a high chance of injuring the underlying pleura and leading to Pneumothorax. Hematuria can commonly occur with this procedure too but in this question there is higher chance of pleural injury.",
