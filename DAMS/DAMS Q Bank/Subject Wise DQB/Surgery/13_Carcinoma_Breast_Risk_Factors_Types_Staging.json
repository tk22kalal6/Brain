      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) A history of a sister who died from breast cancer is a significant and well-established risk factor. This indicates a strong family history, suggesting potential inherited genetic predispositions (like BRCA mutations) or shared environmental/lifestyle factors that increase the risk of developing breast cancer within the family. Genetic counseling and increased screening might be recommended for such individuals. Incorrect Options: Option A (Fibroadenoma on one side) Explanation: Fibroadenomas are benign (non-cancerous) breast lumps and, in their simple form, do not increase the risk of developing breast cancer. They are common and do not typically transform into malignancy. Option C (Jewish origin) Explanation: (Based on your premise, although contrary to general medical knowledge) While typically Ashkenazi Jewish origin is associated with a higher prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations (which are significant breast cancer risk factors), if, within your specific context, this is considered a false statement regarding breast cancer risk, then it would be incorrect. Option D (All) Explanation: Since option A (and based on your premise, C) is considered incorrect, \"All\" cannot be the correct answer as not all listed options are true risk factors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) A. Serum hormone levels: While hormones influence breast cancer, classifying the tumor itself is not done based on systemic hormone levels in the blood. B. Expression of hormone receptors (ER/PR): The expression of Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) is indeed crucial and is used in the immunohistochemical (IHC) classification of breast cancer, along with HER2 status and Ki-67 proliferation index. This helps define subtypes like Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-positive, and Triple-Negative. However, molecular classification (often referred to as intrinsic subtypes) delves deeper than just these protein expressions. C. In-vitro response to chemotherapeutic agents: This refers to how cancer cells react to drugs in a lab setting. While this information can be valuable for predicting treatment response, it is a functional test and not the fundamental basis for classifying the tumor's inherent molecular subtype. D. Gene expression profiling: This is the gold standard for molecular classification (intrinsic subtyping) of breast cancer. Techniques like DNA microarrays or RNA sequencing analyze the activity of thousands of genes within the tumor cells. This profiling allows for the categorization of breast cancers into distinct intrinsic subtypes such as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like (often overlapping with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer). These subtypes have different biological behaviors, prognoses, and responses to therapy.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/1(54).png\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",
