      "solution": "Correct Answer (C & E) Remember if there is a traumatic diaphragmatic injury with a rent in the diaphragm, no matter how small the rent is it should be repaired surgically by using non absorbable sutures, if the rent is not repaired it will never heal spontaneously. Over a period of time the rent will increase in size and patient can present with a late complication as visceral herniation. Mask ventilation is contraindicated in case of traumatic diaphragmatic injury with visceral herniation because if patient is subjected to mask ventilation air can enter can enter the viscera and can further compromise ventilation of lungs. Option A is correct diaphragmatic rupture is more common on left side Option B is also correct most of the diaphragmatic ruptures are traumatic in nature and even in this penetrating abdominal injuries form a major chunk of all the injuries. Option D is correct whenever you have to repair a diaphragmatic rupture abdominal route is favoured because by this route we can also examine other intra abdominal organs for injury and we can have a proper exposure of the diaphragm.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Diagnosis of traumatic rupture of diaphragm can be best done by laparoscopy. So diagnostic laparoscopy is the investigation of choice. This also helps us to evaluate other intra abdominal organs and check for injury to any of these organs. X-ray can be useful in traumatic diagphragmatic injury only if there is massive visceral herniation into the thoracic cavity . Diagnostic peritoneal lavage can diagnose traumatic diaphragmatic injury if the wash fluid comes out from ICD, but sensitivity of this test is very poor. CT Scan can help us detect diaphragmatic injury if there is visceral herniation in the thoracic cavity. So out of all the above mentioned tests most sensitive investigation and investigation of choice to detect diaphragmatic injury is diagnostic laparoscopy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) In this case, a 24-year-old male involved in a road traffic accident presents with an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, which are signs of physiological stress, likely due to chest trauma. Although the chest X-ray is not shown here, trauma of this nature commonly results in injuries such as pneumothorax, rib fractures, or pulmonary contusions. In such patients, epidural anesthesia is contraindicated because it can worsen respiratory compromise by blocking the intercostal nerves needed for effective breathing. Additionally, epidural anesthesia causes vasodilation through sympathetic blockade, which may lead to hypotension — a serious risk in trauma patients who could already be experiencing blood loss or shock. Furthermore, if a spinal injury is suspected, inserting an epidural needle could cause further neurological damage. Therefore, in the context of this trauma scenario, epidural anesthesia is contraindicated",

M-mode Findings: o Seashore Sign: Normal finding indicating pleural apposition (seen in the absence of pneumothorax). o Barcode Sign (Stratosphere Sign): Pathological finding in pneumothorax. The pleural layers do not slide, resulting in a uniform pattern (like a barcode) on M-mode. 3.
