Option A is not the answer as treatment of choledochal cyst is excision of the cyst and if required we perform a drainage procedure for the same.

Findings which we see are thick or irregular wall, peripheral enhancement, associated mass, or papillary tumour projections into the cyst cavity. Option B and C are correct as biliary cystic adenocarcinoma is a rare malignant cystic tumor of intrahepatic biliary tree and is more common in females and has elevated CA 19.9 Option D is wrong as these cystic lesions are situated in the intra hepatic region. Option E is wrong as these lesions are more common in females with M:F ratio of 1:2.",

Intermittent temporary clamping of the portal vein and hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament (Pringle manoeuvre) can reduce blood loss during parenchymal transection. The Kocher maneuver, in which the ascending colon and descending duodenum are reflected to the left, is often employed to expose and arrest a hemorrhage from the inferior vena cava. The Valsalva maneuver involves stopping the passage of air with the vocal folds to build up intrathoracic pressure, as for coughing or vocalization. Putting a clamp on the porta would not stop the bleeding but could certainly produce major injury to the numerous vascular elements there.",

Periodic peritonitis (Familial Mediterranean fever) occurs in children with recurring symptoms. Colchicine is used for acute episode and prevent recurring attacks. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; sometimes called primary bacterial peritonitis) is an acute bacterial infection of ascitic fluid. It can occur in children and adults and can in theory occur as a complication of any disease state that produces the clinical syndrome of ascites. The diagnosis is made by paracentesis, and this should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and ascites even when there is a low index of suspicion. The diagnosis is made by an increased neutrophil of 250/mm3 as determined by counting centrifuged ascitic fluid. Ascites culture is negative in as many as 60% of patients with clinical manifestations of SBP and increased ascitic neutrophil count. When culture is positive (40% of cases), the most common pathogens include gram-negative bacteria, usually E. coli, and gram-positive cocci (mainly streptococci and enterococci). Pneumococcal peritonitis may complicate nephrotic syndrome or cirrhosis in children.Should the exudate be odourless and sticky, the diagnosis of pneumococcal peritonitis is practically certain.",

Prevention of variceal bleeding may be accomplished through administration of nonselective ?-blockers (e.g., propranolol) and routine endoscopic surveillance and variceal band ligation. short-term antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., ceftriaxone) is recommended or patients with acute variceal bleeding. Management of the bleeding can be accomplished with vasoactive medications, including vasopressin and somatostatin analogues (eg, octreotide). Though vasopressin is the most potent vasoconstrictor, it is limited by its systemic effects. Thus, somatostatin analogues are the preferred agent.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Amebic abscesses are caused by the protozoan E. histolytica, which is spread through the fecal–oral route. Once ingested, the cysts pass into the intestines, where the trophozoite is released and transmitted to the colon. These trophozoites can then invade the colonic mucosa and subsequently reach the liver via the portal vein. In the liver, these trophozoites produce a liquefaction necrosis responsible for the classic “anchovy paste” appearance. Protozoa are not usually isolated from the abscess because they arelocated in the peripheral rim of tissue Diagnosis requires hepatic imaging (usually ultrasound or CT) and serologic testing for the presence of E. histolytica antibodies as well as a thorough history and physical examination. The patient in this question is a young man from an endemic region who has signs and symptoms similar to those of a pyogenic liver abscess; however, his classic history and the lack of rim enhancement on imaging suggest the diagnosis of amebic abscess rather than a pyogenic abscess. Hepatic amebiasis is treated primarily by the administration of amebicidal drugs, with metronidazole being the drug of choice. Percutaneous aspiration may be indicated if the patient does not respond to medical management Percutaneous or operative drainage is also indicated in the presence of secondary bacterial infection, which occurs in about 10% of amebic abscesses.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) This patient has focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), which is often found incidentally on imaging or during laparotomy. FNH is a benign liver tumor that predominantly occurs in women in the third to fifth decades of life. It is similar to hepatic adenoma (HA) but with important differentiating clinical and histologic features and therapeutic implications. Both occur most commonly in women of childbearing age; however, HA is associated with the use of oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids and is also seen in certain glycogen storage diseases. HA is usually symptomatic (80% of cases) and is associated with rupture and bleeding in a substantial proportion of patients, whereas FNH is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally. Furthermore, HA has the potential for malignant transformation, whereas the risk for malignancy in FNH is unlikely but uncertain. Histologically, HA consists of hepatocytes without bile ducts or Kupffer cells. FNH contains Kupffer cells along with a central stellate scar surrounded by fibrous tissue. Scanning for Kupffer cell activity with technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled sulfur colloid is thus useful in differentiating the lesions. Because of the asymptomatic nature of this patient, small size of the lesion, and negligible risk for malignant transformation, observation is appropriate. Surgical resection is reserved for symptomatic patients or when the diagnosis is uncertain.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The imaging characteristics described are typical of HA (hepatic adenoma). Because HA does not contain Kupffer cells, it does not take up radioisotope. This point may be useful for differentiating HA from FNH but not necessarily from other mass lesions of the liver. Percutaneous biopsy of suspected HA is not advisable because of the risk for hemorrhage. HAs associated with oral contraceptives tend to be larger and have a higher risk for bleeding. Regression does not reliably occur with cessation of oral contraceptives. However, for lesions smaller than 4 cm, a trial of cessation of contraceptives or steroids with observation may be attempted. Resection is indicated for most suspected HAs, particularly for symptomatic lesions, for patients not taking oral contraceptives, and if the diagnosis is uncertain. Embolization may be useful for treating hemorrhage in a patient whose HA is inoperable. Radiation has no role in the management of HA.",

The characteristic description of HCC is a lesion with arterial enhancement and venous washout.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ascites is the most common major complication of hepatic cirrhosis. It is associated with a 2-year survival rate of 50%, and its onset in a cirrhotic patient should prompt an evaluation for liver transplantation. Treatment of ascites depends on its cause, and therefore diagnostic paracentesis is required after a history and physical examination. Abdominal ultrasound can confirm the presence of ascites if it is not certain by examination. The serum-ascites albumin gradient is useful diagnostically. A high gradient (1.1 g/dL) indicates portal hypertension and suggests that the patient will be responsive to medical management consisting of sodium restriction (2000 mg/day) and oral diuretics. Usually, both spironolactone and furosemide are administered to produce fluid loss and natriuresis. Spironolactone alone may cause hyperkalemia, and furosemide alone is less effective. Medical therapy controls ascites in about 90% of patients. When the ascites is refractory, serial therapeutic paracentesis (with or without the administration of albumin or other plasma volume expanders) are indicated. Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment. A peritoneovenous shunt is an option for patients with refractory ascites who are not transplantation candidates or who cannot undergo repeated paracentesis. These shunts are fraught with potential complications, however, and do not prolong survival in comparison with medical management. TIPS or operative side-to-side–type portosystemic shunts may control the ascites in select patients",

Firstline therapy for patients with primary variceal bleeding is endoscopic therapy with variceal band ligation or sclerotherapy. However, there is a high risk for rebleeding not amenable to endoscopic techniques (refractory bleeding) or continuation of bleeding (recurrent bleeding). This patient has failed medical and endoscopic management of variceal bleeding. TIPS is very effective at reducing or normalizing portal pressure. Other indications for TIPS include refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, and Budd-Chiari syndrome refractory to anticoagulation. The mechanism is via diverting blood into systemic circulation and decompressing the portal system. Because hepatic metabolism is bypassed, hyperammonemia may occur manifesting clinically as worsening hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is therefore a relative contraindication to TIPS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The findings described are fairly typical of sclerosing cholangitis, which can also be discovered in asymptomatic patients based on a cholestatic liver enzyme pattern. Sclerosing cholangitis is a disease of undetermined cause characterized by inflammatory fibrosis and stenosis of the bile ducts. Primary sclerosing cholangitis may be an isolated finding or may occur in conjunction with a variety of other disease processes, most commonly ulcerative colitis.. Although the cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown, most attention has focused on an autoimmune or infectious cause. Antimitochondrial antibodies are generally associated with primary biliary cirrhosis but they can be seen in PSC also. The diagnosis is usually made following ERCP showing multiple strictures and dilations, which give a “beaded” appearance to the ducts. Typically, sclerosing cholangitis is a diffuse process that affects both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Choledochal cysts are a rare cause of RUQ pain and jaundice. They are premalignant lesions, carrying a 10%–30% risk of carcinoma, so observation is not appropriate. The most accepted theory of their pathogenesis is related to an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction, which allows pancreatic fluid to reflux up into the biliary tract. This results in chronic inflammation and cystic degeneration of the bile duct. This patient has a type I cyst, which involves fusiform dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tree and is treated by complete excision and hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction. Type II cysts appear as a diverticulum off the CBD and are treated by excision, as well as biliary-enteric drainage if an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction is present. Type III cysts, also known as choledochoceles, appear as intramural CBD cystic dilatation within the duodenal wall. Their pathogenesis is not clear and so treatment is directed at relieving the biliary or duodenal obstruction (if present). This can be approached via a transduodenal excision or endoscopic sphincteroplasty. Type IV disease involves both the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees. Treatment depends on the anatomic pattern of disease. Type V disease, also known as Caroli disease, involves only the intrahepatic bile ducts. Surgical treatment ranges from liver resection to transplantation depending on the extent of ductal involvement",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) After relief of biliary obstruction, there is a prompt increase in bile flow, and normal bile acid secretion resumes within several days. Serum bilirubin levels decline approximately 50% by 36 to 48 h after surgery and 8% per day thereafter. This rate varies depending on the duration of the jaundice. Delta-bilirubin is a form of bilirubin that is covalently bonded to albumin and is measured as part of the direct bilirubin fraction. As such, it is not filtered by the kidneys and has the same serum half-life as albumin, approximately 18 days, which accounts for the slow decline in serum bilirubin levels observed in patients following relief of longstanding jaundice.",
