Pleomorphic adenoma most commonly occurs in parotid gland but it can also occur in other salivary glands . Option C is false as most of parotid tumours are benign. Risk of malignancy in salivary gland tumours is inversely proportional to the size of salivary glands. As parotid is a larger salivary gland risk of a tumour occuring in it to be malignant is less. Option D is correct as most of parotid tumours originate from the superficial lobe so superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice .",

Later we apply starch ove this skin and then ask patient to eat lemon for 5 minutes. Because of lemon there is parasympathetic stimulation and salivation occurs, If there is frey's syndrome it will lead to sweating as well . When sweat comes in contact with the starch in presence of iodine it leads to the dark blue black colour and this is starch iodine test.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/3899063s.9.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",
