      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Alcohol and gall stones are the two most important causes of pancreatitis. Hypercalcemia and hyperlipidemia are also the causes of pancreatitis but the not more common causes. Causes: • The major causes are long-standing alcohol intake or biliary stone disease. • Medications: azathioprine, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides, furosemides, NSAIDs, mercaptopurine, methyldopa, tetracyclines DDI (dideoxycytosine), DDC (dideoxyinosine), azathioprine, valproic acid, acetaminophen, and others. • Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). • Hypertriglyceridemia: When the triglyceride level exceeds 1000mg/U. • Peptic ulcer disease. • Abdominal or cardiopulmonary bypass surgery: insulting the gland by ischemia. • Trauma to the abdomen or to the back. • Carcinoma of the pancreas, which may lead to pancreatic outflow obstruction. • Viral infections: cytomegalovirus, hepatitis virus, EBV, CMV and paramyxovirus [mumps], togavirus [rubella], cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, HIV, coxsackie B. • Bacterial infections, such as Mycoplasma, Campylobacter, Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium complex. • Intestinal parasites: Ascaris, Opisthorchis [clonorchiasis], which blocks outflow. • Pancreas divisum. • Black Scorpion and snake bites. • Vascular factors, such as ischemia or vasculitis, Connective-tissue disorders (SLE, polyarteritisnodosa, sarcoidosis). • Drugs: 5- Aminosalicylic acid, Azathiopine, 6 Mercaptopeurine, Thiazide, steroid, Pentamidine, Metronidazole, Valproic acid, L-Asparaginase, Zidovudine. Objective measurements such as Ranson’s criteria, show a good correlation with the risk of major complications and death.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery49.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) COMPLICATIONS OF ERCP • Complications: Pancreatitis, hemorrhage, cholangitis and perforation. • MC complication is acute pancreatitis (5%) • Hemorrhage requires surgical intervention most commonly, sphincterotomy usually is converted into formal surgical sphincteroplasty, which includes the bleeding artery . • Cholangitis is confined to patients in whom CBD clearance has not been achieved, and measures should be directed at providing adequate bile drainage and administering parenteral antibiotics. Emergency surgery for cholangitis carries high risk, but is indicated in patients who do not improve within 24 hours. • Perforation may be asymptomatic and noticed only as retroperitoneal gas or extravasation of radiographic contrast material, but even in symptomatic patient, conservative treatment is often effective with spontaneous resolution and avoidance of potentially difficult surgery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cardiopulmonary Bypass Post-operative pancreatitis is a known complication that can arise after various surgical procedures. While some cases are linked to direct mechanical trauma during surgery or changes in gastrointestinal physiology, it is also significantly associated with surgical interventions that impact systemic perfusion or induce a widespread inflammatory response. Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB), commonly used in complex cardiac surgeries, involves temporarily stopping the heart and lungs while a machine takes over their functions. This process often leads to periods of low systemic perfusion (reduced blood flow to organs throughout the body) and can trigger a systemic inflammatory response. These physiological changes are recognized mechanisms that can lead to acute pancreatitis in the post-operative period. The provided explanation explicitly states, \"Pancreatitis also can occur in association with surgery that uses low systemic perfusion, such as cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac transplantation.\" This directly affirms the association. Incorrect Options: A. Billroth type I: While gastrectomies (like Billroth I or II) involve abdominal surgery and can be associated with pancreatitis (especially Billroth II due to changes in duodenal pressure), Billroth I itself is not highlighted as a primary or distinct cause of pancreatitis due to low systemic perfusion, which is the mechanism linked to CPB in the provided context. B. Splenectomy: Pancreatitis can indeed be a complication of splenectomy, primarily due to the close anatomical proximity of the spleen to the tail of the pancreas, making it susceptible to direct surgical injury. However, the question and the provided explanation specifically highlight \"low systemic perfusion\" as a mechanism, which is characteristic of CPB, not direct trauma from splenectomy. C. Nephrectomy: This is the surgical removal of a kidney. While theoretically possible due to proximity of the left kidney to the pancreas, post-operative pancreatitis is an extremely rare complication of an uncomplicated nephrectomy and is not typically associated with the mechanism of \"low systemic perfusion\" like CPB.",

Option B is wrong as surgical treatment is needed only for few patients who have necrotic pancreatic tissue. we do not need surgical treatment for other cases of pancreatitis . Most of the patients with acute pancreatitis are managed conservatively. Option D is wrong as even though amylase is raised in acute pancreatitis it is also raised in many other conditions so it is not diagnostic of acute pancreatitis.

Once infection has been demonstrated, IV antibiotics should be given. Because of their penetration into the pancreas and spectrum coverage, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) are the first option of treatment. Defnitive treatment for infected pancreatic necrosis is surgical debridement with mucosectomy, closed continuous irrigation, and open packaging. Option A that is percutaneous drainage can be done by the time pancreatic necrosectomy is planned. Option D is a universal thing to build up the patient preoperatively as pancreatic surgery is a major stress for patient’s body and it should be able to withstand this stress.",

Option A is correct as in chronic pancreatitis we see irregular pancreatic duct with duct stricture and areas of dilation and this is referred to as string of beads appearance in the ERCP. Option B is correct as in majority of patients who are diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis we have a history of acute pancreatitis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Clinical Manifestations: The clinical picture of chronic pancreatitis is dominated by three features; abdominal pain, maldigestion, and diabetes (loss of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function). The pain is localized to the upper abdomen, with radiation to subcostal regions and to the back. The pain is aggravated by meals and improves with fasting. When more than 90% of exocrine pancreatic function is lost, maldigestion and malabsorption ensue. This is manifested by steatorrhea (fat malabsorption) associated with diarrhea and bloating, azotorrhea (protein malabsorption) and progressive weight loss. These patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue, judged by hanging skin folds, and more objectively by demonstrating that the skin fold at the mid-triceps is less than 8 mm in males and less than 12 mm in females. Latent fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (vitamins A, D, E and K) in addition to deficiencies of magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids may occur and are closely related to dysfunction of fat digestion. Endocrine insufficiency presenting as diabetes mellitus may present at the same time as exocrine insufficiency or a few years later.",

What happens in periampullary carcinoma is that tumour increases in size and a point comes when the arterial supply to the tumour is not able reach till the tip and thus the distal most portion undergoes necrosis and sloughs off . When tumour was large in size it causes obstructive jaundice and as soon as the tumour gets sloughed off, the jaundice gets relieved and this leads waxing and weaning of jaundice over a period of 2-3 months. Option B that is Liver fluke infestation is not a cause of intermittent jaundice. Option C that is choledochal cyst presents with pain lump and jaundice and the jaundice is not intermittent. Option D that is carcinoma head of pancreas presents with jaundice but in this case the jaundice is not intermittent it a persistent jaundice.",

Option B is correct as duodenum is the most common site for the occurrence of gastrinoma. Option C is correct as diarrhoea is an important feature of gastrinoma and this can be prevented by repeated NG tube aspiration. Option D is correct as we avoid total gastrectomy in gastrinoma. Treatment of gastrinoma comprises primarily of PPI’s and if it is situated in the distal pancreas, we go for distal pancreatectomy and if it is present in head, we go for pancreaticoduodenectomy.",

Option C Lesser sac is one of the most common sites of the pseudocyst but it is not the only site, pseudocyst can occur at other sites also. Option D Pseudocyst is mostly caused after chronic pancreatitis and alcohol is one of the most important cause of chronic pancreatitis but pseudocyst can occur even if cause of pancreatitis was other than alcohol.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Acute edematous pancreatitis occurs in the alcoholic or the patient with gallstones. Epigastric and midabdominal pain starts after a heavy meal or bout of alcoholic intake, is constant, radiates straight through to the back, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and (after the stomach is empty) continued retching. There is tenderness and mild rebound in the upper abdomen. Elevated serum amylase or lipase (early on) or urinary amylase or lipase (after a couple of days) are diagnostic, and a key finding to establish the edematous nature is an elevated hematocrit. Resolution usually follows a few days of pancreatic rest (NPO, NG suction, IV fluids). Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis is a much more deadly disease. It starts as the edematous form does, but an early laboratory clue is lower hematocrit (the degree of amylase elevation does not correlate with the severity of the disease).",

Frey described a modification of the duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection that requires partial coring of the ventral part of the pancreatic head, in addition to a side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis. This technique allows for simultaneous decompression of the intrapancreatic segment of the common bile duct in addition to drainage of the main pancreatic duct. The Frey procedure is best suited for patients with a dilation of the main pancreatic duct associated with a minor inflammatory mass in the head of the pancreas.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pancreas divisum currently refers to congenital variations of the pancreatic ducts that result from failed or incomplete fusion of the embryologic ventral and dorsal ductal systems. There may be complete separation of the ducts, an absent or minimal ventral duct, or only a few meager connections between the systems. As a consequence, most of the pancreatic duct drainage is through the dorsal duct joining the duodenum at the minor papilla . Any existing ventral ducts (Wirsung’s) drain only the uncinate process and the caudal head of the gland rather than the bulk of the gland at the major papilla, as when normally developed. In some individuals, it is clinically significant if the relatively stenotic minor papilla imposes an obstruction to ductal flow. This can potentially result in recurrent abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, or even chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis is usually made by ERCP, and cannulation of the minor papilla may be required to image the dorsal duct. MRCP might also demonstrate this ductal anatomy. The vast majority (95%) of individuals with pancreas divisum are asymptomatic",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Progression of IPMN through the adenoma cancer sequence is considered a slow process that requires perhaps 10 to 20 years. Main duct–type tumors have a greater risk for malignancy than the branch duct type. the following features as risk factors for cancer and as general indicators for resection: main pancreatic duct dilation to greater than 10 mm, cyst size larger than 3 cm, presence of mural nodules, and atypical cytology. Additional risk factors include high-grade dysplasia, multifocal or synchronous tumors, and increasing cyst size during follow-up. In branch duct–type tumors, mural nodularity or atypical cytology may be more important determinants than size.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Autoimmune pancreatitis can be very difficult to diagnose and is the cause of acute pancreatitis in 4%–6% of cases. Patient age varies between 30 and 70 years, and it affects men more often than women. The majority (70%–80%) present with painless jaundice. Acute pain, typical of classic pancreatitis, is rare. On CT or USG, a boggy, thick, “sausage-shaped” pancreas can be seen often with a rim of hypo- or hyperattenuation (early versus late). Immunoglobulin G4 levels are thought to be associated with autoimmune pancreatitis, but using levels as a diagnostic marker is highly debated. Antinuclear antibody levels may also be elevated, indicating an autoimmune process. Steroids are considered as standard therapy for this etiology of pancreatitis (typically 30 to 40 mg of prednisone for 1 week)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Pancreatic–pleural fistula is a very rare entity and complication of chronic/recurrent pancreatitis. This usually evolves from a disruption in the pancreatic duct (often posterior), followed by fluid tracking in the retroperitoneum and up along the aorta or esophagus into the pleural space. Initial non operative therapy can include nil per oral status, total parenteral nutrition, repeat thoracentesis, and octreotide. Interventional therapy utilizing ERCP to stent the ductal defect (if present) may also be attempted. Operative therapy for failed conservative therapy, including duct ligation and resection or Roux-en- Y reconstruction, has an efficacy of 90% with an 18% recurrence. Regardless of treatment modality, patients often require prolonged hospitalization. Currently, treatment consists of several weeks of conservative management before progressing to surgical intervention",
