      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) • Main thing which we look in case of penetrating injury is hemodynamic stability. If patient is hemodynamically unstable then patient needs to be taken for emergency exploratory laparotomy. If patient is hemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonitis or evisceration then we need to subject the patient to CECT to get a better understanding of the any significant intra abdominal injury. • Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is done in cases of blunt abdominal trauma when FAST results are equivocal. DPL gives the idea of intra peritoneal fluid or blood collection and helps surgeon to make a decision whether to operate the person or not . • Laparotomy is done in hemodynamically unstable patients, those with signs of peritonitis or any evisceration of organ. • Laparoscopy has no role in acute trauma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In this case scenario patient has suffered a splenic laceration due to penetrating injury and patient is hemodynamically stable after giving 2 units of blood. As patient is hemodynamically stable we can put the patient on conservative management. Conservative management means we need to put the patient on serial abdominal examinations, monitor abdominal girth, record BP and pulse at serial intervals and repeat CT Abdomen and pelvis every 24 hours if needed. if anytime during the conservative management if patient becomes hemodynamically unstable then operative managent is preferred. Laparotomy, splenoraphy and splenectomy are undertaken if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.

In order to prevent this we need to go for tube thoracotomy in which we drain the excess blood in the thoracic cavity thus allowing the lungs to expand.

The optimal timing is 14 days after surgery. Furthermore, in patients undergoing planned splenectomy, those who received the vaccine less than 14 days before surgery were more likely to need revaccination. However, in the trauma population many patients are lost to follow-up and some surgeons elect to administer the appropriate vaccines before discharge Pneumococcal vaccine needs to be repeated every 5 to 7 years",
