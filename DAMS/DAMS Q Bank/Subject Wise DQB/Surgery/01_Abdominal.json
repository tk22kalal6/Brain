      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A is correct as if a patient suffers from a renal trauma we need to know the functionality of the kidney before we operate and take definitive steps towards the treatment so we have to order an IVP in order to know the functioning status of the kidney. Option B is wrong as most of the patients of renal trauma are tried to be managed conservatively and exploration is indicated in very few patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Option C is false as we do not go for a lumbar approach while operating a patient with renal trauma as in these patients there is a high likelihood that patient has some accompanying other intra abdominal injury and if we go via a midline approach we can manage the condition in a better way. Option D is wrong as renal artery aneurysm is uncommon after a renal trauma.",

Option A is hypertension and even if one kidney of the patient is damaged, patient can suffer from hypertension due to excessive renin secreted by the normally functioning kidney.

This indicates a renal injury and to know the grade of renal injury we need to go forward and do a CECT as the patient is hemodynamically stable. Option A that is immediate laparotomy would have been the answer is patient would have been hemodynamically unstable. Option B that is retrograde cystourethrogram would have been the answer if patient would have had blood at the meatus, this would have been done to rule out urethral injury. Option C is done only when a patient of blunt abdominal trauma is hemodynamically unstable and FAST is equivocal and we need to decide whether the patient needs an operation.",

CECT is IOC in stable patients; FAST is IOC for unstable blunt trauma.FAST is nothing but a USG examination done in the casualty to look for intraperitoneal fluid accumulation. And based on the results of FAST further management is determined so USG is the initial investigation to be done for blunt abdominal trauma in a stable patient. But the investigation of choice for a patient of blunt abdominal trauma who is hemodynamically stable is CECT Xray can be done to look for gas under diaphragm and rule out visceral perforation but it is not the investigation of choice Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is reserved for the group of patients who are hemodynamically unstable and in whom FAST is inconclusive MRI has no role in acute case of blunt abdominal trauma CT scan is investigation of choice for a patient of blunt abdominal trauma who is hemodynamically stable IOC for blunt abdominal trauma in hemodynamically unstable patient : FAST Initial investigation for blunt abdominal trauma in hemodynamically unstable patient : FAST IOC for blunt abdominal trauma in hemodynamically stable patient : CECT Initial investigation for blunt abdominal trauma in hemodynamically stable patient : FAST",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) First understand the mechanism behind seat belt injury. In seat belt injury the driver is wearing a seat belt and he suddenly comes to a stop because of collision. Because of the inertia the body along with the mobile intra abdominal organs tend to move forward. As the driver is wearing the seat belt he is restained from moving forward. So a distraction force develops at the junction of mobile intra abdominal organs and the retroperitoneal fixed structures. MAIN INJURIES TO OCCUR IN SEAT BELT INJURY ARE AT THE JUNCTION OF MOBILE AND NON MOBILE INTRA ABDOMINAL ORGANS.As one part of the mesentery is attached to retroperitoneum and other end is attached to mobile intra abdominal organ mesentry injury is very common in seat belt injury. Duodenal jejunal flexure is another such part which is injured in seat belt injury. Option A, B and D are wrong as seat belt injury does not cause injury at these organs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) blood in stomach does not always represent a gastric injury, most of the times it is because of bleeding from some above source in esophagus or oropharynx and has trickled down into the stomach. Sometimes is is caused by stress ulcer in the stomach. So blood in stomach does not necessarily tells that there is a gastric injury . Option A is correct as most of the gastric injuries are caused by a penetrating trauma rather than blunt abdominal trauma. If there is breach in the wall of the stomach, its treatment is simple debridment and suturing which heals well and fast as stomach has a rich blood supply which facilitates early healing of the stomach.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) First understand the mechanism behind seat belt injury. In seat belt injury the driver is wearing a seat belt and he suddenly comes to a stop because of collision. Because of the inertia the body along with the mobile intra abdominal organs tend to move forward. As the driver is wearing the seat belt he is restrained from moving forward. So a distraction force develops at the junction of mobile intra abdominal organs and the retroperitoneal fixed structures. MAIN INJURIES TO OCCUR IN SEAT BELT INJURY ARE AT THE JUNCTION OF MOBILE AND NON MOBILE INTRA ABDOMINAL ORGANS. So as duodenal jejunal flexure is one such part,seat belt injury causes injury at this part of intestine. Option B and C are wrong as seat belt injury does not cause injury at these organs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mattox Maneuver, also known as a left medial visceral rotation, is a surgical step to explore and handle Zone 1 and 2 retroperitoneal injuries (aorta, left iliac and pelvic vessels). It starts with incising the parietal peritoneum at the white line of Toldt from the sigmoid colon to the splenic flexure. The spleen, tail of the pancreas, left kidney, and stomach are mobilized and reflected medially during this maneuver to explore the deeper structures. Option B. The Cattell–Braasch manoeuvre begins at the common bile duct and ends at the ligament of Treitz. It allows you to mobilise the whole duodenum, pancreas head, small bowel and the right colon and bring the two last structures outside the abdomen. Thanks to anatomical knowledge of the avascular planes – the Cattell–Braasch manoeuvre is the one of the quickest mobilisation surgical techniques with minimal blood loss. Extended Kocher’s manoeuvre is a part of Cattell–Braasch manoeuvre and generally consists of full exposition of the inferior vena cava (IVC), renal veins, abdominal aorta, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA).<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/3928051A.16.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

A large atraumatic hemostat is used to clamp the hepatoduodenal ligament (free border of the lesser omentum) interrupting the flow of blood through the hepatic artery and the portal vein and thus helping to control bleeding from the liver. More commonly, in the absence of soft clamp, manual compression of the hepatoduodenal ligament is performed. Should bleeding continue, it is likely that the inferior vena cava or the hepatic vein were also traumatised. If bleeding continues, a variation in arterial blood flow may be present.",
