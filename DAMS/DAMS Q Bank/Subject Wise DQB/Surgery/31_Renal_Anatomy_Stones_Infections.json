      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Option A is correct the stellate veins are veins that lie beneath the fibrous tunica of the kidney and drain the superficial zone of the kidney. Option C is correct as renal artery divides into 5 segmental branches out of these 4 are anterior and are named as apical anterior, upper anterior, middle anterior and lower anterior and one posterior segmental artery. Option D is also correct as these segmental arteries are end arteries as they have no communication with each other.

Retrocaval ureter deformity is caused by the abnormal persistence of Posterior cardiac vein. Other name for this reverse J deformity is Fish hook deformity. In congenital megaureter what you see is a dilated tortuous ureter on IVP In ureterocele there is cystic dilation of the terminal part of the ureter and it appears as a Adder head appearance on IVP and a filling defect in MCUG In VUR what we see is a reflux of urine in the ureter on MCUG .

In horse shoe kidney. Lowermost calyx is pointing caudally and medially (Hand joining sign or hand shake sign). High insertion of ureter draping over midline isthmus (Flower vase sign). Option B is correct as due to improper rotation of kidney ureters pass over the isthmus and might be compressed at that point and lead to UTI or stone formation. Option C is correct as due to the fusion of the lower calyces they are reversed and on IVP appear as a typical hand shake appearance. Option D is also correct heminephrectomy is one of the treatment options for horse shoe kidney and was performed but now a days as far as the person is asymptomatic we do not treat this condition.",

The main cause of retroperitoneal hematoma is renal trauma Strangury (or stranguria) is the symptom characterized by painful, frequent urination of small volumes that are expelled slowly only by straining and despite a severe sense of urgency, usually with the residual feeling of incomplete emptying.",

Depending on the position of the stone in the urinary tract the pain can radiate to different locations : If stone is at the junction of renal pelvis or the upper ureter: Patients have a typical Loin to Groin radiation of pain. If stone is in the upper ureter or at pelvic brim : Patients experience radiation of pain towards the medial aspect of thigh and perineum. This pain radiates along the obturator nerve. If stone comes to lie in the middle ureter: Pain radiates to the hypogastric region and this pain radiates along the iliohypogastric nerve If stone is in the lower ureter: Pain may radiate along the inguinal canal upto testis . This radiation of pain is along the Ilio inguinal nerve . If the pain is in the intramural part of the bladder then patients can have something which is known as stangury , this means that patient has a intense desire to pass the urine but patient is not anble to pass the urine, all patient passes is few drops of blood.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) PCNL stands for percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is a procedure done for the treatment of renal stones which are more than 2 cm in size. In this what we do is we create a track from skin to the calyces of the kidney, introduce a nephroscope in the calyces of kidney, then we try to break the stones into small pieces and then we remove the fragments, some of the fragments are washed away in the urine. As we have to make a track from skin to the kidney most common complication of PCNL is hematoma formation. As this a blind procedure done under C-Arm there is a high chance of injury to the structures. We can end up injuring Pleura, colon and spleen. Pleura is most commonly injured and patients develop pneumothorax. Coming back to this question as the question says we approached through 11th intercostal space there is a high chance of injuring the underlying pleura and leading to Pneumothorax. Hematuria can commonly occur with this procedure too but in this question there is higher chance of pleural injury.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Holmium YAG laser has a wavelength of 2100 nm and at this wavelength it is absorbed by all the stones but not by the surrounding tissue. The zone of thermal injury from Holmium YAG laser ranges from 0.5 to 1 mm. Holmium YAG lithotripsy occurs mainly by the photothermal mechanism which causes evaporation of the stones so it is helpful even for the hard stones. Holmium YAG laser should be used with care with metallic wires and dormia basket as it can lead to thermal disfiguaration of these wires and baskets and prevent their easy removal and sometimes even cut these wires. When Holmium YAG laser is used for cysteine stones there occurs formation of cyanide, but the good part is patients do not suffer from cyanide toxicity so they it can be used safely for cysteine stones also.",

If the latter occurs, the treatment of choice is embolisation but, if this doesn’t work, nephrectomy very occasionally has to be considered. 3 Sepsis. 4 Extravasation due to rupture of the collecting system. 5 Retained stone fragments. 6 Open surgery to the kidney is sometimes more complicated after PCNL.",
