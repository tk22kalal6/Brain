      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The primary factors stimulating gastrin release are vagal stimulation, food in the antrum, and gastric distension. Both polypeptides and amino acids result in increased gastrin release but fats and carbohydrates have no effect. Prolonged alkalinization (>8 h) will increase gastrin release, while acute alkalinization does not directly cause release of gastrin, but does potentiate the release by other stimuli. The primary inhibitor of gastrin release is antral acidification (pH <2.5). Increased acid in the antrum results in somatostatin release from antral D cells, which then inhibits gastrin release.",

Minimal chances of dumping syndrome and gastric atony .High recurrence rate. Selective Vagotomy: In this procedure we cut vagus nerve after it has given celiac and hepatic branches. Truncal Vagotomy : TV is performed by division of left and right vagus nerves above the hepatic and celiac branches just above the GE junction. MC operation performed for duodenal ulcer .Procedure of choice for recurrent duodenal ulcers .Lowest recurrence rate. Highest Morbidity and mortality.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Option B. Late dumping syndrome occurs 2 to 3 hours after a meal. It results from excessive movement of sugar into the intestine, which raises the body's blood glucose level and causes the pancreas to increase its release of the hormone insulin. The increased release of insulin causes a rapid drop in blood glucose levels, a condition known as alimentary hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Option A. Early dumping syndrome occurs 10 to 30 minutes after a meal. It results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach.The small intestine expands rapidly due to the presence of hypertonic or hyperosmolar contents from the stomach, especially sweet foods. This causes symptoms due to the shift of fluid into the intestinal lumen, with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention.Osmotic diarrhea, distension of the small bowel leading to crampy abdominal pain, and reduced blood volume can result. Option C. Duodenal stump blowout usually presents as sudden intense thoracoabdominal pain, sudden elevation in pulse and temperature or generalized deterioration of condition. Option D. Anastomotic leak will come with signs of peritonitis.",

Alcohol is associated with mallory weiss tear. Mallory-Weiss Tears Are Related To Forceful vomiting, retching, coughing, or straining. Forceful contraction of the abdominal wall against an unrelaxed cardia, resulting in mucosal laceration of the proximal cardia as a result of the increase in intragastric pressure.This results in disruption of gastric mucosa high on the lesser curve at cardia (just below GE junction). Tear is partial thickness,extending through the mucosa and submucosa. Option C. Supportive therapy is often all that necessary because 90% of bleeding episodes are self-limited, and the mucosa often heals within 72 hours. Option D.

Imatinib is given for 3 years for high risk cases of GIST of size >10cm. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and rash. Severe side effects may include fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, bone marrow suppression, liver problems, and heart failure. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Imatinib works by stopping the BCR-ABL tyrosine-kinase. This can slow growth or result in programmed cell death of certain types of cancer cells.",

Most commonly found in patients who have undergone surgery of the stomach and have impaired gastric emptying. But it can also occur in other parts of the intestine. Diabetics with autonomic neuropathy are also at risk Option C. Rapunzel syndrome is an extremely rare intestinal condition in humans resulting from ingesting hair (trichophagia).The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale. Trichophagia is sometimes associated with the hair-pulling disorder trichotillomania. This syndrome is a rare and unusual form of trichobezoar. Characteristics of the syndrome include: The body of a trichobezoar (hairball) located in the stomach, and its tail (hence the reference to Rapunzel in the syndrome's name) in the small bowel and/or in the right colon. Option E. As there is a foreign body inside the lumen it increases the chances of gastric ulceration. Option A. It can occur after gastrectomy in other parts of GIT or the remaining gastric stump. Option D. Primary treatment of phytobezoar is Enzymatic therapy attempt dissolution of the bezoar. Papain and cellulase have been used with some success. Generally, enzymatic débridement is followed by aggressive Ewald tube lavage or endoscopic fragmentation. Failure of these therapies would necessitate surgical removal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) (Atrophic gastritis) is the most appropriate cause of hypergastrinemia due to its chronic nature. Atrophic gastritis involves the long-term damage of the stomach lining, often due to autoimmune processes or chronic H. pylori infection, which leads to the destruction of parietal cells responsible for acid secretion. As a result, gastric acid production is severely reduced, and the body compensates by increasing gastrin levels in an attempt to stimulate more acid secretion. Unlike PPI-induced hypergastrinemia, which is usually temporary and reversible once the medication is stopped, atrophic gastritis causes persistent hypergastrinemia because the damage to the stomach lining is ongoing. This makes atrophic gastritis a more chronic and sustained cause of elevated gastrin levels, making it the most appropriate answer in this context.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/course_file_meta/79214154.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

The thin wall of the cyst, which is composed of connective tissue lined by flat endothelium, is filled with clear lymph or, less frequently, with chyle, varying in consistency from watered milk to cream. More often unilocular than multilocular, a chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary. Chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply that is independent from that of the adjacent intestine and, thus, enucleation is possible without the need for resection of gut. ENTEROGENOUS CYSTS - The content is mucinous and either colourless or yellowish brown as a result of past haemorrhage. The muscle in the wall of an enteric duplication cyst and the bowel with it is in contact have a common blood supply; consequently, removal of the cyst always entails resection of the portion of intestine. The most common presentation of a mesenteric cyst is of a painless abdominal swelling with characteristic physical signs there is a fluctuant swelling near the umbilicus the swelling moves freely in a plane at right angles to the attachment of the mesentery (Tillaux’s sign)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Helicobacter pylori possess the enzyme urease, which converts urea into ammonia and bicarbonate, thus creating an environment around the bacteria that buffers the acid secreted by the stomach. H. pylori infection is associated with decreased levels of somatostatin, decreased somatostatin messenger RNA production, and fewer somatostatin-producing D cells. These effects are probably mediated by H. pylori-induced local alkalinization of the antrum (antral acidification is the most potent antagonist to antral gastrin secretion), and H. pylori mediated increases in other local mediators and cytokines. The result is hypergastrinemia and acid hypersecretion, presumably leading to the parietal cell hyperplasia seen in many patients with duodenal ulcer.",

Unlike types 1 and II, they are not associated with hypergastrinemia. Type I gastric carcinoids are the most common type of gastric carcinoid, and occur in patients with chronic hypergastrinemia secondary to pernicious anaemia or chronic atrophic gastritis.

Histologically, gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is characterized by dilated mucosal blood vessels that often contain thrombi, in the lamina propria. Beta blockers and nitrates, useful in the treatment of portal hypertensive gastropathy, are ineffective in patients with gastric antral vascular ectasia. Antrectomy may be required to control blood loss, and this operation is quite effective but carries increased morbidity in this elderly patient group. Patients with portal hypertension and antral vascular ectasia should be considered for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute volvulus of the stomach is associated with epigastric pain, retching without vomiting and inability to pass a nasogastric tube. This is known as the Borchardt triad. Rotation of the stomach usually occurs around the axis and between its two fixed points, i.e. the cardia and the pylorus. Rotation can occur in the horizontal (organoaxial) or vertical (mesenteroaxial) direction but, commonly, it is the former which occurs. This condition is usually associated with a large diaphragmatic defect around the oesophagus (paraoesophageal herniation). An acute presentation with ischaemia may occur. Endoscopically, it can be extremely difficult to sort out the anatomy, and this is one situation in which the contrast radiograph is superior. It is advisable to separate the stomach from the transverse colon and then perform an anterior gastropexy to fix the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall.",

Other, less common, locations of fistulas include cholecystogastric and cholecystocolic, which can cause gastric outlet obstruction and colonic obstruction, respectively.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most common complication of peptic ulcers is bleeding. Peptic ulcers can erode into blood vessels, especially arteries like the gastroduodenal artery, leading to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding presents with symptoms like hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black, tarry stools). While perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, and penetration are also serious complications, bleeding is the most frequent. Incorrect Options: A. Perforation: Perforation is a dangerous complication and can present with sudden severe abdominal pain, peritonitis (guarding, rigidity), and signs of shock. In this particular patient's clinical story (sudden severe pain + guarding), perforation is very likely happening now, but in general, perforation is not the most common complication overall — bleeding is. If they ask about THIS SPECIFIC PATIENT’S current condition ? ? The patient has sudden severe pain, guarding, hypotension ? this is classical for perforation. (So, clinically for this man’s current problem, perforation is most likely happening right now.) C. Gastric outlet obstruction: This is a late complication of chronic ulcers leading to scarring and narrowing of the pyloric channel. It presents with vomiting of undigested food, early satiety, and weight loss, but it is much less common than bleeding. D. Penetration: Penetration occurs when the ulcer burrows into adjacent organs (like pancreas, liver). It presents with persistent severe pain, but again, it is less common than bleeding.",

Understanding this triangle is crucial for localizing gastrinomas during diagnostic imaging and surgery. Boundaries of Passaro's Triangle: 1. Superiorly: Junction of the cystic duct and the common bile duct (near the porta hepatis). 2. Medially: Neck of the pancreas. 3. Inferiorly: Third part of the duodenum.
