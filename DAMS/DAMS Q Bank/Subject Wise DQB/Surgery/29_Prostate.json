      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is an isotonic solution, meaning it has a similar solute concentration to blood plasma. While isotonic solutions are generally safe for intravenous administration, they are not used as irrigants during standard monopolar TURP because they are electrically conductive. During monopolar TURP, an electric current passes through the resectoscope loop to cut and coagulate tissue. If normal saline were used, the current would be dispersed through the irrigant, leading to inefficient cutting and coagulation, and potentially damaging the surrounding tissues and the patient due to uncontrolled current spread. Additionally, the absorption of large volumes of normal saline during TURP can lead to hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, which are undesirable complications. B. 1.5% Glycine is incorrect. Glycine solutions (typically 1.5% or 2.2%) are commonly used as irrigants during monopolar TURP. Glycine is a non-conductive, isotonic, or slightly hypotonic solution. Its non-conductive property allows the electrical current from the resectoscope to be concentrated at the tissue, ensuring efficient cutting and coagulation. While absorption of large volumes of glycine can lead to the \"TURP syndrome\" (characterized by hyponatremia, fluid overload, and neurological symptoms due to hypotonic fluid absorption), its non-conductive nature makes it a primary choice for monopolar TURP. C. 5?xtrose is incorrect. 5?xtrose in water (D5W) is a hypotonic, non-conductive solution that can be used as an irrigant during TURP, though less commonly than glycine. Like glycine, its non-conductive property allows for effective energy delivery during monopolar resection. However, due to its hypotonicity, significant absorption can lead to hyponatremia and hyperglycemia, which can be problematic, especially in diabetic patients. D. Distilled water is incorrect. Distilled water is a highly hypotonic and non-conductive solution. While its non-conductive property makes it suitable for electrical current transmission during monopolar TURP, its extreme hypotonicity is a major drawback. Significant absorption of distilled water can lead to severe and rapid hemolysis (rupture of red blood cells) and profound hyponatremia, posing a significant risk of severe complications, including acute renal failure and neurological damage. For these reasons, while technically effective for current transmission, it is rarely used as an irrigant due to its high risk profile. However, the question asks which is not used, implying it's never appropriate. Compared to normal saline, which fundamentally interferes with the electrocautery, the others (though with their own risks) are considered \"used\" or have been used, whereas normal saline is fundamentally unsuitable for monopolar TURP.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Screening for prostatic carcinoma is done for early detection and we use PSA levels and Digital rectal examination for the screening of prostatic cancer. We do not use PSA or DRE alone as when they are used together the sensitivity for detection of cancer is more. Serum PSA elevations may occur as a result of disruption of the normal prostatic architecture that allows PSA to diffuse into the prostatic tissue and gain access to the circulation. This can occur in the setting of prostate disease (BPH, prostatitis, prostate cancer) and with prostate manipulation (e.g., prostate massage, prostate biopsy, transurethral resection). PSA elevations may indicate the presence of prostate disease, but not all men with prostate disease have elevated PSA levels. Furthermore, PSA elevations are not specific for cancer. 5α-Reductase inhibitors that are used for treatment of BPH have been shown to lower PSA levels by about 50% after 12 months of treatment. Both type 2 isoenzyme inhibitors (finasteride) and dual type 1 and 2 isoenzyme inhibitors (dutasteride) lower PSA to the same extent",

When such a scenario occurs you have to categorize the person into two groups one which includes people who are <70 years who have life expectancy more than 10 years and who are fit for surgery. In these patients we have to subject the patient for radical prostatectomy. Another group includes patients who are >70 years old and have life expectancy less than 10 years or are not fit for surgery. These patients are just subjected to observation and no further intervention is needed . As patient in this question is 50 year old so we have to subject the patient to radical prostatectomy. Hormonal therapy and bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy is used for metastatic prostatic cancer.",

Both are used together as sensitivity for detection of the cancer increases as compared to when any one them is used individually. Ideally screening is started at the age of 50 years. Option B is wrong. Prostate cancer is more common in elderly patients, It is actually said that if a person lives to reach a age 80 there is 90% chance that he will have a focus of prostatic cancer. Option C is wrong as a tumour marker for Prostatic cancer is PSA and PSA is not diagnostic for prostatic cancer it is raised in many benign conditions as well.
