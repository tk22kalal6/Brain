      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) In this case scenario try to understand that if a patient has been in a road traffic accident with head injury he never suffers an isolated head injury, there is a high chance that patient has abdominal and extremity injury and they need to be ruled out. In this case patient is hypotensive after a road traffic accident, please note that a patient with isolated head injury will never present with hypotension as skull is a bony cavity and patient never exsanguinates after an isolated head injury. So in this case scenario patient most likely has blunt abdominal trauma as a cause of hypotension due to intra abdominal bleed. Options A,B and C are false as they will never lead to hypotension on their own and they are diagnosed on CT scan and can not be diagnosed clinically.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) With penetrating injury to neck, air embolism is an important complication which should be considered while treating this condition. Because of penetrating injury to the neck there is a possibility of external jugular vein being communicated with the environment and if this occurs air can be sucked in and if large amount of air gets sucked in it can cause a massive air embolism leading to sudden cardiac arrest. Options A, C and D can also lead to death in patients of penetrating neck injury but they rarely lead to sudden death in patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Glasgow coma scale is the objective scaling system used to quantify the head injury based on motor, verbal and eye response. Glasgow coma scale is the best predictor of prognosis of head injury. Age of the patient can give us a rough idea about the prognosis with better prognosis at the younger age but it is not the best prognostic indicator as it is not reliable and varies from patient to patient. Mode of injury is also suggestive of the prognosis but is not a reliable prognostic indicator. CT head can tell you about the diagnosis and can help you locate the site and type of pathology and can also predict the prognosis of the patient. But CT scan mainly helps in determining the further course of management of the patient rather than predicting the prognosis.",

The gag reflex, also known as the pharyngeal reflex, is an involuntary reflex involving bilateral pharyngeal muscle contraction and elevation of the soft palate. The afferent limb of the reflex is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), which inputs to the nucleus solitarius and the spinal trigeminal nucleus.

Le Fort II (Pyramidal): o Involves the maxilla, nasal bridge, and orbital floor. o Forms a pyramidal shape. o Clinical clue: Mobility of the midface (nasal bridge and maxilla move together). 3. Le Fort III (Craniofacial Disjunction): o Involves the maxilla, nasal bridge, zygomatic arches, and orbits. o Results in complete separation of the facial skeleton from the skull base. o Clinical clue: Entire face moves as a single unit when manipulated.
