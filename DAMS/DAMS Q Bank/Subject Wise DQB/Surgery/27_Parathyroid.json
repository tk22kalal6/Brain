      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The parathyroid is commonly transferred to the brachioradialis muscle post-surgery. This will facilitate easy removal if there is disease recurrence after surgery. After parathyroidectomy or thyroid surgery, if the parathyroid gland needs to be autotransplanted, it is commonly implanted into the brachioradialis muscle of the forearm. This site is preferred because it is easily accessible for monitoring or reoperation if needed. Explanation of incorrect options: A. Triceps: Not commonly used for parathyroid autotransplantation. B. Biceps: Less commonly used compared to brachioradialis. C. Sartorius: Rarely used; it’s in the thigh and less practical for this purpose.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Removal of 3 ½ glands The patient has primary hyperparathyroidism, indicated by elevated calcium and PTH levels, with a Sestamibi scan showing increased uptake in all four parathyroid glands, suggesting hyperplasia. Treatment involves initially correcting hypercalcemia with IV normal saline and furosemide, followed by neck exploration. For hyperplasia of all four glands, the approach is resection of three and a half glands or resection of all four glands with autotransplantation into the brachioradialis of the non-dominant arm. In contrast, a single parathyroid adenoma (85% of cases) and two adenomas (5%) are treated with resection.",
