Rest of the organs of urogenital system are affected either by an ascent or descent of the infection. So whenever testis are involved the Tuberculosis first involves epididymis via retrograde pathway and then only it can affect the testicular tissue. This is how tuberculosis affects the urogenital system . So out of the above mentioned 4 options first structure to be involved is Epididymis.",

In the evaluation of a patient with painful scrotum swelling we have 2 differential diagnosis: Acute epididymo orchitis and Testicular torsion and it is very important to differentiate between them to decide the further management of the patient. We have Phren test which we use to differentiate the two conditions. In this we basically elevate the testis and on elevation of testis in epididymo-orchitis what we find is the pain is reduced while in testicular torsion on elevation of testis the pain is increased. This is how we can differentiate between the two conditions. Option C is right as a patient of testicular torsion always comes with painful testicular swelling. Option D is also right as I have already told you that epididymo orchitis is an infective and inflammatory condition so what we get is signs of inflammation like raised temperature, tenderness and erythematous skin and raised WBCs.",

Option B is correct as right testis has undergone torsion it tends to lie at a higher level as compared to left testis. Please note that testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and needs to be treated immediately, golden period for testicular torsion is 4-6 hours it means that if testicular torsion is treated within this time frame there is a chance that testis can be preserved but if surgical intervention for testicular torsion is delayed by more than 6 hours we have to subject the patient for orchidectomy as testis become non viable.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) varicocele is more common on Left side as left testicular vein drains directly into left renal vein at right angle and is subjected to a constant high pressure but right testicular vein drains into IVC. So as left tesiticular vein is subjected to a constant high pressure there is more chance of development of varicocele on left side. Option B is correct as Varicocele can present as a late sign of RCC. RCC tends to grow along the veins as a tumor thrombus. So if left sided RCC grows into left renal vein it can obstruct the opening of left sided testicular vein and lead to formation of left sided irreducible varicocele. Option C is correct as in varicocele we have dilated tortuous pampiniform plexus of veins and when they on palpation gives a bag of worm like feel. Option D is also correct, infact varicocele is the most common cause of infertility in males. What happens is that due to varicocele there is pooling of blood and temperature of the testis is bit raised than usual so it hampers with the process of spermatogenesis and can lead to infertility.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) It is a general dictum is that a painless testicular swelling in a male is a testicular carcinoma until proven otherwise. So when a person comes to you with a painless testicular mass never perform a trans scrotal biopsy as there is a risk of tumour implantation along the track of the biopsy and overlying skin, thus making an operable tumour as inoperable. What you do is a high inguinal orchidectomy so that you get a tissue diagnosis and you have to ligate the cord at the deep inguinal ring so that there is a minimal chance of systemic spread of tumour. You can also subject the patient to USG of inguinoscrotal region so that it can give you an idea about the nature of the tumour but for confirmation you need a tissue biopsy which you get only after doing a high inguinal orchidectomy.",

This can spread the tumour cells to the skin and as skin gets involved the tumour cells can spread to inguinal lymph node. If this happens just because of the intervention of taking the trans scrotal biopsy we converted a tumour which was confined to the testis into a metastatic disease . So we never perform a trans scrotal procedure in any patient in whom we suspect a testicular malignancy. Option B is correct as we do perform a Chest Xray in these patients to screen for lung metastasis. Option C is correct as we have to perform an inguinal exploration with high inguinal orchidectomy to make the diagnosis of testicular tumour. Option D is correct as we have to perform a CT scan in these patients to look for any retroperitoneal spread of tumour to retroperitoneal lymph nodes.",

Option C that is biopsy is never performed in testicular swelling when you suspect a testicular malignancy. Option D that is AFP is done at a later stage in the management of testicular swelling.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The pathological T (pT) stage for testicular tumors, as per the TNM classification system, defines the extent of local tumor invasion. In this case, the high inguinal orchidectomy specimen reveals a tumor confined to the testis and involving the epididymis, crucially, without any evidence of vascular or lymphatic invasion. This specific combination of features is the defining characteristic of a pT1 stage testicular tumor. A pT1 tumor is strictly limited to the testis and/or epididymis, and it does not demonstrate invasion into lymphovascular spaces within the testis or epididymis. It may, however, invade the tunica albuginea, the fibrous capsule surrounding the testis. The absence of vascular invasion is the key differentiator that keeps this tumor within the pT1 classification despite epididymal involvement. Incorrect Options: B. T2: A pT2 stage tumor, while still confined to the testis and epididymis, would be characterized by the presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion. Alternatively, pT2 can also be assigned if the tumor extends through the tunica albuginea and involves the tunica vaginalis. Since the case explicitly states \"without vascular invasion,\" these criteria for pT2 are not met. C. T3: A pT3 stage tumor signifies invasion into the spermatic cord. This means the tumor has extended beyond the confines of the testis and epididymis and has entered the spermatic cord structures. The description in the question does not mention any involvement of the spermatic cord, making T3 an incorrect option. D. T4: A pT4 stage tumor indicates that the tumor has invaded the scrotum. This is the most extensive local invasion. The case description clearly limits the tumor's extent to the testis and epididymis, with no mention of scrotal involvement, thus ruling out T4.",
