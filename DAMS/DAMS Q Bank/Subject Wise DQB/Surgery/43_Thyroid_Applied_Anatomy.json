      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Normal weight of thyroid gland is inversely related to the dietary iodine. Iodine is a raw material which is needed for thyroid hormone production. If there is sufficient amount of iodine present in the blood patients thyroid gland can work efficiently with easy availability of iodine so thyroid gland is of normal size. If there is deficiency of iodine then cells of thyroid gland have to work more so there occurs an enlargement of the thyroid gland.",

As they start their development in the neck they derive their blood supply from the vessels in the neck. So they are managed through the incisions in the neck. Thoracotomy is required for the retrosternal goiters who primarily develop in the mediastinum and if they have developed other vessels around the thyroid .

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) whenever you have to operate on a patient who has either a hyper or hypothyroidism we have to make sure that patient has become euthyroid before we take the patient for operation and we take measures to work in that direction. The reason being surgery is a stressful event for patients body and if the patient has not become euthyroid before the surgery patient can present with excessive release of thyroid hormone and give rise to thyroid storm. So Thyroid storm after operation most commonly occurs due to inadequate control of hyperthyroidism. Option B is not the answer as massive bleeding in the intraoperative period is not the cause of thyroid storm in the post operative period . Option C is not the answer as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury if occurs in intraoperative period it will lead to respiratory distress in the post operative period and not thyroid storm. Option D is not the answer as post operative infection can lead to reactionary hemorrhage and not thyroid storm.",

The enhanced sensitivity and specifcity of TSH assays have greatly improved laboratory assessment of thyroid function. The reason being in any of the thyroid disease may it be hypo or hypothyroidism, TSH values are first to be altered and thus if you want to chose one option from the above mentioned options TSH is the answer for this.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Trousseau sign of latent tetany is a medical sign observed in patients with low calcium. This sign may be positive before other manifestations of hypocalcemia such as hyperreflexia and tetany, as such it is generally believed to be more sensitive (94%) than the Chvostek sign (29%) for hypocalcemia. To elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 minutes. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient's hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct. Option B. The Chvostek sign is a clinical sign of existing nerve hyperexcitability (tetany) seen in hypocalcemia. It refers to an abnormal reaction to the stimulation of the facial nerve. When the facial nerve is tapped in front of tragus the facial muscles on the same side of the face will contract momentarily (typically a twitch of the nose or lips) because of hypocalcemia (i.e. from hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypovitaminosis D) with resultant hyperexcitability of nerves. Option C. Troisier’s sign is enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node seen in intra abdominal malignancies Option D. Trousseau Syndrome is migratory thrombophlebitis seen in patients with intra abdominal malignancies. Most commonly associated with pancreatic Ca.",

Commonly affects women aged 45-65, presenting with painless thyroid enlargement and potential thyrotoxicosis due to autoantibody damage. Diagnosis involves low T3 and T4, elevated TSH, and specific autoantibodies. Management includes thyroid hormone replacement. Long-term goiter may lead to compressive symptoms, thyroid lymphoma, or increased risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma, sometimes requiring total thyroidectomy.",
