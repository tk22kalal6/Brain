      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Luminal obstruction in the form of fecolith is the most common initiating factor for acute appendicitis. This causes increased intraluminal pressure which hampers lymphatic, venous and arterial drainage and leads to ischemia of the appendix. Bacterial infection is not the most common cause of appendicitis, organism which is most commonly isolated from a perforated appendix specimen is bacteroides. Lymphatic hyperplasia may compress the base of appendix and lead to appendicitis but it is not the most common cause . Perforation is a complication of appendicitis and not the cause .",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pain is the earliest symptom of acute appendicitis, pain is around the periumbilical area and is because of distension of the appendix as appendix is derived from midgut. Slowly there occurs periappendicular fluid accumulation which irritates the parietal peritoneum and causes pain at Mc burney’s Point. Fever is a symptom which is present in patients of acute appendicitis but it is not the earliest symptom. Vomitting occurs in patients of acute appendicitis but it usually follows appearance of pain. Increased pulse rate is another feature found in patients of acute appendicitis.",

Option A is false as even though fecolith is responsible for the initiation of appendicitis, it is not a direct cause for perforation, the tension which develops in the appendix lumen due to accumulation of fluid and secretions inside the lumen is the actual cause for perforation.

Option A and B is wrong as we do not operate in the patients of appendicular lump as if we do an appendectomy there is a high chance of development of a ceacal fistula. Option D is also wrong as external drainage is a treatment option for an appendicular abscess.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Appendicitis occurs with equal frequency in both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Peritonitis may result in fetal loss. Diagnosing appendicitis during pregnancy can be difficult because abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated WBC count are common during pregnancy. Additionally, as the uterus enlarges, the location of the appendix is shifted superiorly and medially. Delayed diagnosis and therefore delay in the treatment leading to perforated appendicitis increases the risk of fetal loss to about 30%. Ultrasound is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. In cases where ultrasound is equivocal, an MRI can be performed for further evaluation without the risk of radiation exposure to the developing fetus. A fairly aggressive approach with early laparoscopic exploration is a reasonable option in pregnant women with suspected appendicitis. The risk of maternal and/or fetal morbidity is quite low with a negative laparoscopy and appendectomy.",

Poor prognostic indicators include high-grade lesions with a high mitotic rate, direct extension into the mesoappendix, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, positive margins, or mucin-producing tumors.
