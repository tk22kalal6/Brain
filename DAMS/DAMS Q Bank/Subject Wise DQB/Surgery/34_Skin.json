These lines are invisible under normal conditions. They become apparent when some diseases of the skin or mucosa manifest themselves according to these patterns. They follow a \"V\" shape over the back, \"S\" shaped whirls over the chest and sides, and wavy shapes on the head.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, is the most common type of skin cancer.It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it; or it may present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or to result in death. Option D. Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a common low-grade (unlikely to metastasize or invade) rapidly-growing skin tumour that is believed to originate from the hair follicle (pilosebaceous unit) and can resemble squamous cell carcinoma. The defining characteristic of a keratoacanthoma is that it is dome-shaped, symmetrical, surrounded by a smooth wall of inflamed skin, and capped with keratin scales and debris. It grows rapidly, reaching a large size within days or weeks, and if untreated for months will almost always starve itself of nourishment, necrose (die), slough, and heal with scarring.",

Differential Diagnoses: o Malignant melanoma: Usually presents as an asymmetrical pigmented lesion with irregular borders, color variation, and rapid growth. o Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): May present as a non-healing ulcer but usually with a more aggressive appearance, crusting, or overlying hyperkeratosis. SCC is often seen on sun-exposed areas. o Seborrheic keratosis: A benign lesion with a \"stuck-on\" appearance, not ulcerative. o Actinic keratosis: A precursor to SCC that presents as a scaly, erythematous macule or patch, not a rolled-edged ulcer. 3. Importance of Diagnosis: o BCC is the most common skin cancer, especially in older adults with significant sun exposure. o It has a very low metastatic potential but can cause local destruction if untreated. 4. Management: o Confirm diagnosis with skin biopsy. o Treatment options include surgical excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, or less commonly, cryotherapy or topical therapies for superficial BCC.",
