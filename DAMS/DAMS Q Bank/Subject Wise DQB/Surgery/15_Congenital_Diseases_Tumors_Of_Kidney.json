      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Potter facies and oligihydromnios occurs only in the presence of bilateral renal agenesis and due to complete absence of amniotic fluid production because of complete absence of both the kidneys. Unilateral renal agenesis will not lead to formation of such severe hydromnios as one of the kidneys is functioning absolutely fine and will give rise to amniotic fluid formation. Bilateral renal disease and unilateral cystic disease cannot lead to potter facies. Unilateral renal agenesis Complete absence of one kidney occurs in 1 in 500–1000 births and results from failure of connection between the metanephric blastema and the ipsilateral ureteric bud. This condition is an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. Typically, there is an absent ipsilateral ureter and the ipsilateral hemi-trigone is missing in the bladder. The remaining kidney is usually hypertrophic but may also be dysplastic. In addition, the ipsilateral testis and vas deferens are usually absent and in some patients the adrenal gland on the affected side is missing as well. Females with the condition may have an absent ovary or Fallopian tube. Renal agenesis is different from renal aplasia where there is a small dysplastic kidney. Bilateral renal agenesis Bilateral renal agenesis is incompatible with life. It is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter’s facies due to oligohydramnios.",

As DTPA scan helps us know the dynamic component of the kidney function. Option A that is IVP is not the investigation of choice for looking at the hydronephosis as it is not a sensitive investigation for that. Whittaker test is a sensitive test for detecting PUJ obstruction but this is an invasive test and thus it is not the investigation of choice. Ultrasound is an investigation which is used to screen the patients of hydronephrosis but this is not the investigation of choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Spider leg appearance is typical for renal cyst. Spider leg appearance is not seen in renal carcinoma, IOC for RCC is CECT. (In patients with contrast sensitivity MRI is done). Renal tuberculosis shows something which is known as putty kidney on X-Ray and when calcified it appears as cement kidney. Hydronephrosis in late stages shows blunting of pelvicalyceal system and thin rim of cortex on IVP In CRF we see small contracted kidneys So out of the above mentioned options spider leg appearance is typically seen with renal cysts only.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/12926.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

So decompression of the cyst does not lead to normal renal function. Option B is wrong as autosomal polycystic disease is a B/L condition we can not do B/L Nephrectomy as a treatment option for the patient. Option c is wrong. Although we do use dialysis as a treatment option for symptomatic relief and till kidney is arranged it is not the treatment of choice as patient will have to subjected to long term dialysis and will have a lot of complications.

If we go for radical nephrectomy for a patient with solitary kidney he will be left with no kidney at all and this will be a very serious situation and will need either a new kidney in the form of renal transplant which is not possible as patient had cancer and if he is put on dialysis, patient will have to bear lot of complications which come along with dialysis. So best option for this is partial nephrectomy.",
