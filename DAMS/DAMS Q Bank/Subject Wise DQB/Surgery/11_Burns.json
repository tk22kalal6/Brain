Out of these the preferred method to asses the burns in children is Lund and Browder Charts. Option A and Option D:-Rule of nine for calculating percentage of burns was given by sir william wallace, it is also called as Wallace Rule of Nine. It is good for assessing the percentage of burns in adults but not very helpful for assessing the percentage of burns in children. Option B That is Rule of Palm. Palm is taken as 1% and it is used to calculate burns in case of patchy burns.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery83.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) When deep second- and third-degree burn wounds encompass the circumference of an extremity, peripheral circulation to the limb can be compromised. Development of generalized edema beneath a non-yielding eschar impedes venous outflow and affects arterial inflow to the distal beds. This can be recognized by numbness and tingling in the limb and increased pain in digits. Arterial flow can be assessed by determination of Doppler signals in the digital arteries and the palmar and plantar arches in affected extremities. Capillary refill can also be assessed. Extremities at risk are identified either on clinical examination or by measurement of tissue pressures >40 mm Hg. These extremities require escharotomies (release of the burn eschar by incising the lateral and medial aspects of the extremity).<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/surgery85.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Third degree burns. A third-degree burn, also known as a full-thickness burn, is characterized by the complete destruction of both the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) and the entire dermis (the layer beneath the epidermis that contains blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and sweat glands). When the entire dermis is destroyed, the nerve endings in that area are also destroyed, leading to a painless burn. The skin may appear waxy white, leathery, charred, or dark brown/black, and it will not blanch (turn white) when pressed. While third-degree burns often extend into the subcutaneous tissue (fat, muscle, or bone), the complete involvement of the epidermis and dermis is the definitive characteristic for this classification. These burns do not heal on their own and typically require surgical intervention, such as skin grafting. Incorrect Options: A. First degree burns: First-degree burns are superficial injuries that only involve the epidermis. They typically present with redness, pain, and mild swelling, but no blistering. A common example is a mild sunburn. This does not match the description of involving the \"full thickness of dermis.\" B. Partial-thickness second degree burns: Second-degree burns are, by definition, \"partial-thickness\" because they involve the epidermis and only a portion of the dermis, either superficial or deep. Crucially, some part of the dermis remains intact. Since the question specifies involvement of the \"full thickness of dermis,\" this option is incorrect as it implies some dermal sparing. C. Full-thickness second degree burns: This term is not a standard or widely accepted classification in modern burn care. Second-degree burns are categorized as partial-thickness because some dermal elements are preserved. Once the burn involves the full thickness of the dermis, it crosses the threshold into a third-degree (full-thickness) burn. Therefore, this option is a misnomer in standard medical terminology.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) • The depth of the burn injury is the most important prognostic factor in determining the outcome of a burn injury. Burn injuries are classified based on their depth: • First-degree burns are superficial and heal without permanent damage. • Second-degree burns are partial-thickness burns, which can heal with scarring or may require grafting, depending on their severity. • Third-degree burns are full-thickness burns that involve complete skin destruction, requiring skin grafts and having a higher risk of complications like infection. • The depth of the burn influences how the body will heal, whether or not grafting is needed, and the risk of long-term complications. Thus, it is the most crucial factor in determining the prognosis. Incorrect Option A: Age of the patient While age is an important factor in burn prognosis, it is not the most critical. Older adults (especially those over 60 years) and very young children are at a higher risk for complications such as infection and poor healing. However, even a younger person with a deep burn injury (like a third-degree burn) can face a poor prognosis if the burn is severe enough. Therefore, age is a factor, but burn depth plays a more direct role in determining the healing potential and need for interventions. Incorrect Option B: Extent of the burn (TBSA affected) The extent of the burn (TBSA affected) is an important prognostic factor in burn management, as larger burns require more intensive fluid resuscitation and are associated with higher risks of hypovolemia and sepsis. However, while the size of the burn is critical for fluid management and overall survival, it is the depth of the burn that directly impacts the tissue damage and the recovery process. Larger burns can be more dangerous, but without considering the depth, it’s difficult to predict how well the body will heal. Incorrect Option D: Presence of inhalation injury Inhalation injury is a serious complication that can worsen prognosis, especially if the patient has respiratory distress or damage to the airways and lungs. However, inhalation injury does not directly affect the skin’s ability to heal or the need for grafting. While it can significantly impact the respiratory system and increase the risk of respiratory failure, the depth of the burn injury remains the primary factor for predicting outcomes related to healing and skin recovery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 25 kcal/kg/day + 40 kcal per % TBSA burn This is the standard Curreri formula used to estimate daily caloric needs in adult burn patients. It takes into account both the basal metabolic requirement (based on body weight) and the additional caloric need due to the burn (% of Total Body Surface Area — TBSA). Curreri Formula (Adults): Caloric need = (25 kcal × body weight in kg) + (40 kcal × % TBSA burned) This formula helps in estimating the increased metabolic demand due to the burn and is widely used in burn management, especially during the acute phase. Option B: 30 kcal/kg/day + 50 kcal per % TBSA burn This combination overestimates the caloric requirement. Although critically ill or severely burned patients may have higher demands, this formula is not evidence-based and can lead to overfeeding, increasing risks such as hyperglycemia and fatty liver. Option C: 40 kcal/kg/day + 50 kcal per % TBSA burn This again is too high and not aligned with the Curreri formula. Overfeeding based on this calculation may cause complications in nutritional therapy and does not reflect the established guidelines. Option D: 30 kcal/kg/day + 25 kcal per % TBSA burn While this seems more moderate, it is not the correct Curreri formula. It underestimates the burn-related hypermetabolic response and is not the standard used in clinical practice.",

Laboratory results reveal a serum calcium level of 6.5 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL). Her arterial blood gas shows metabolic acidosis. Which of the following acids is most likely responsible for her hypocalcemia?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Phosphoric acid Hypocalcemia can occur in metabolic acidosis due to the ionization of calcium. Under normal conditions, calcium exists in both bound (protein-bound) and unbound (ionized) forms in the blood. In an acidic environment, the concentration of free, ionized calcium decreases because of an increased binding to plasma proteins like albumin. Among the acids listed, phosphoric acid is particularly associated with hypocalcemia. Phosphoric acid can lead to the formation of calcium phosphate complexes, decreasing the ionized calcium in the blood and contributing to hypocalcemia.",
