Commonest site of Branchial fistula is at the junction of upper 2/3rd and lower 1/3rd of sternocleidomastoid at the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Branchial Cyst Develops from the vestigial remnants of 2nd branchial cleft Lined by squamous epithelium. It Contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. Cyst usually presents in the upper neck in early or middle adulthood. Fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is often soft in its early stages.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C & D) Option C: This is correct as oxygen saturation is less in the air at high altitudes so due to chronic hypoxia there occurs hypertrophy of chromaffin cells in the carotid bulb leading to carotid body tumour. Option D: This is correct as most of the carotid body tumours are sporadic but around 10% have familial association. Option A: This is false as Carotid body tumours arise from carotid body which is situated in the wall of the carotid bulb, which is a present at the carotid bifurcation. Option B: This is false as carotid body tumours do not arise from baroreceptor cells instead they arise from chemoreceptor cells. Carotid body tumours are also referred to as a non chromaffin paraganglioma. Option E: FNAC is not diagnostic, carotid angiography is diagnostic for diagnosing carotid body tumours. FNAC and Biopsy are contraindicated in carotid body tumours.",
