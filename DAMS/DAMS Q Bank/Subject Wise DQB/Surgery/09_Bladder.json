      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A is correct as micturating cystourethrogram can pick up reflux of urine into the ureter during the act of micturition as the pressure in the urinary bladder rises Option B is good for any anatomy of the urogenital tract with respect to hydronephrosis or dilated pelvicalyceal system. It is not useful in detecting VUR. Option C that is cystography is the study done in urinary bladder which maps the pressure changes in the bladder during micturition and can give the idea of bladder outlet obstruction. Option D that is radionuclide scan is used for detecting the static and dynamic component of the kidney function and detects hydronephrosis and renal scarring.",

Eosinophilic cystitis (EC) is a rare clinicopathological condition characterized by transmural inflammation of the bladder predominantly with eosinophils, associated with fibrosis with or without muscle necrosis. Radiation Cystitis is a term used to describe the side effect of inflammation and subsequent destruction to the normal anatomy of the urinary bladder at the cellular level after the use of radiation in the treatment of multiple cancer types, including, most commonly, pelvic cancers Tuberculous Cystitis : Up to 10% of patients with renal TB have bladder contractures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A. Common in pediatric patients in the tropics than in non-tropical areas. True. Primary bladder stones (those not caused by obstruction) are more common in children in tropical regions due to factors like diet and dehydration. B. Uric acid stones are dropped from above. False. Uric acid stones are the most common type of primary bladder stones. They form directly in the bladder and are not caused by an obstruction or infection. Stones that \"drop from above\" are typically kidney stones that pass into the bladder. C. Jack stones are caused by a urinary tract infection with urea-splitting bacteria. True. Jack stones are a type of calcium oxalate stone that gets its name from its appearance. They can be caused by infections with urea-splitting bacteria. This is a correct statement, but it is often confused with struvite stones, which are also caused by urea-splitting bacteria and a common type of bladder stone. Therefore, the statement is true. D. The most common cause of stone formation is distal passage obstruction. True. Distal obstruction of the urinary tract (e.g., due to an enlarged prostate in men or a urethral stricture) is the most common predisposing factor for bladder stone formation. The obstruction prevents the bladder from emptying completely, allowing crystals to form and accumulate.",

It is common in the pediatric age group patients in the tropical countries and as india is one of the tropical countries bladder stone in pediatric age group of indian population is not a rare finding. Bladder stones can be of two types:- primary bladder stones and secondary bladder stones.

Secondary bladder stones on the other hand are formed in the bladder in the presence of some underlying predisposing factor like bladder outlet obstruction or UTI. Out of these two secondary bladder stone are more common. No matter whether it is a primary or secondary bladder stone.

Risk factors of urinary bladder carcinoma: • Men are 2.5 times more likely than women. • Age increases risk; most commonly diagnosed in the eighth decade and is rare in those <50 years of age. • Race: Black people have a lower incidence than that of White people. • Environmental carcinogens, found in urine are the major cause of bladder cancer. • Chronic inflammation of bladder mucosa: Bladder stones, long term catheters and the ova of Schistosoma haematobium(bilharziasis) are implicated in development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. • Smoking is the major cause of bladder cancer: in the developed world. Cigarette smoke contains the carcinogens 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) and 2-naphthylamine which appears to increase urinary carcinogenic exposure of the urothelium. Smokers have a 2 to 5-fold risk compared to that of non-smokers of developing bladder cancer and subsequent recurrences. Estimates suggest that 30–50% of bladder cancer is caused by smoking. Passive exposure to cigarette smoke is also implicated. • Occupational exposure to carcinogens, in particular aromatic hydrocarbons like aniline, is a recognized cause of bladder cancer.",

During large-volume resuscitation associated with an inflammatory response, capillary leak leads to edema of the abdominal wall and intestine. The abdominal wall becomes less compliant, the intestines swell, and ascites production ensues. The resulting intraabdominal hypertension results in decreased abdominal organ perfusion by occluding capillaries and veins. Oliguria heralds acute renal failure. To diagnose ACS, bladder pressure should be measured in a supine patient who is placed in a flat position. Pressures less than20 mmHg are reassuring. However, for pressures exceeding 20mmHg, the measurement must be repeated in the setting of paralysis,which removes external forces contributing to abdominal hypertension. In the setting of heavy sedation and paralysis,pressures exceeding 20 mmHg warrant further investigation.",
