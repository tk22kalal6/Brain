Propofol is formulated as an oil-in-water emulsion, which contains soybean oil, glycerol, and egg lecithin. Usually, egg allergies are a reaction to egg white (egg albumin). But, propofol contains egg lecithin, which is extracted from egg yolk, and so, propofol is not necessarily contraindicated in patients with a history of egg allergy.",
