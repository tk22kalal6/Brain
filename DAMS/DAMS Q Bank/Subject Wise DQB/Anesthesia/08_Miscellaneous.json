      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Corneal abrasions The most common ophthalmological complication during anesthesia is corneal abrasions. These occur when the cornea is exposed to mechanical trauma, often due to the inability to blink or excessive dryness of the eye during general anesthesia. The eyelids typically remain open during anesthesia, and without reflexive blinking, the cornea is more vulnerable to abrasion, especially if the eyes are not adequately lubricated or protected with eye ointments or pads. This condition is often self-limiting but can cause discomfort and, in rare cases, lead to infection if not treated properly. Incorrect Answers: B. Ischemic optic neuropathy Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) is a serious condition that involves damage to the optic nerve due to insufficient blood flow. While this can occur after surgery, it is much less common during anesthesia compared to corneal abrasions. Factors such as long surgeries, prone positioning, or significant blood loss can increase the risk, but it is a rare complication overall. It usually manifests as vision loss, and while it may be linked to anesthesia in some cases, it is not the most frequent complication. C. Central retinal artery occlusion Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is another serious ophthalmological complication, but it is very uncommon during anesthesia. CRAO occurs when the central retinal artery becomes blocked, leading to sudden, severe vision loss. Although factors such as hypotension or embolic events during surgery may predispose someone to CRAO, it is a rare occurrence in the perioperative period and less frequent than corneal abrasions. D. Ptosis Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, can result from nerve injury or muscle weakness, but it is not a common complication of anesthesia. While ptosis may be seen in cases where there is damage to the oculomotor nerve or muscle fatigue due to positioning during surgery, it is a less frequent event than corneal abrasions. Ptosis typically resolves after the anesthesia wears off or if treated conservatively, and is not considered one of the primary ophthalmological concerns during anesthesia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 65ml/hr The correct maintenance fluid requirement for a 25 kg child undergoing surgery is 65 ml/hr. Maintenance fluid calculations are typically based on the child's weight, and the general formula used is 4 ml per kg for the first 10 kg, 2 ml per kg for the next 10 kg, and 1 ml per kg for each kg thereafter. For a 25 kg child, the total maintenance fluids are calculated as follows: 4 ml/kg for the first 10 kg = 40 ml 2 ml/kg for the next 10 kg = 20 ml 1 ml/kg for the remaining 5 kg = 5 ml This gives a total of 65 ml/hr, which is the correct maintenance fluid rate for this child. Incorrect Answers: A. 50 ml/hr 50 ml/hr is an incorrect option because it underestimates the child's fluid requirements. If we apply the maintenance fluid formula, the required fluids for a 25 kg child should be 65 ml/hr, not 50 ml/hr. This could lead to insufficient hydration during the surgical procedure. B. 25 ml/hr 25 ml/hr is too low for a 25 kg child. According to the formula for maintenance fluids, this would be inadequate for a child of this weight and could result in dehydration or an electrolyte imbalance if the fluid volume is not sufficient. D. 100 ml/hr 100 ml/hr is also too high for a 25 kg child. While it may seem reasonable for a larger child, the maintenance fluid requirement for a 25 kg child is closer to 65 ml/hr, not 100 ml/hr. Administering too much fluid can lead to fluid overload, which may increase the risk of complications during surgery, such as pulmonary edema.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sitting position The risk of air embolism is greatest in the sitting position. This occurs because the head and thorax are positioned higher than the heart in the sitting posture, which allows air to more easily enter the venous system. If there is a breach in a vein, such as during central venous catheter placement or certain surgical procedures, the gravitational pull can cause air to be drawn into the circulation. This can lead to air embolism, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. Therefore, the sitting position poses the highest risk for air embolism. Incorrect Answers: A. Supine position The supine position (lying flat on the back) is associated with a relatively low risk of air embolism because the venous system is not exposed in a way that would allow air to easily enter the bloodstream. In this position, gravity does not facilitate the entry of air into the veins, making the risk lower compared to other positions like sitting. B. Prone position The prone position (lying on the stomach) is also not associated with a high risk of air embolism. While air embolism can still theoretically occur in any position, the prone posture is not one where the heart and head are elevated above the venous system, as in the sitting position. The risk of air entering the veins is lower when the body is in a prone position. C. Park bench position The park bench position (where the patient is lying on their side with the upper body elevated) does increase the risk of air embolism slightly compared to supine or prone positions, but it is not as high as the sitting position. The park bench position places the venous system in a more neutral alignment, with the heart and head not as elevated, which reduces the likelihood of air being drawn into the venous circulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Glottic inlet is higher In neonates, the glottic inlet is higher compared to adults. This anatomical difference is important because it affects airway management, particularly during intubation. The higher position of the glottis in neonates (located at the level of the C3-C4 vertebrae, compared to C4-C5 in adults) makes visualization during intubation more challenging and requires adjustments in technique. Understanding this difference is crucial for clinicians to avoid complications during airway management in neonates. Incorrect Answers: A. Infants have a smaller tongue This statement is incorrect. Infants actually have a relatively larger tongue in proportion to their airway compared to adults. This can make airway management more difficult, as the larger tongue can obstruct the airway more easily during procedures like intubation. Therefore, the size of the tongue in infants should be considered when assessing the potential for airway obstruction. C. Narrowest part is just below the cricoid ring This is incorrect as well. In neonates, the narrowest part of the airway is at the level of the cricoid cartilage, which is different from adults, where the narrowest part is typically at the level of the glottis. This anatomical variation in the neonatal airway affects both the difficulty of intubation and the approach for airway management, as the cricoid ring is more rigid in neonates than in adults. D. Oxygen demand is lower than adult This statement is incorrect. Neonates actually have a higher oxygen demand per kilogram of body weight compared to adults. This is due to their higher metabolic rate, rapid growth, and need for energy. As a result, neonates are more susceptible to hypoxia, and their oxygen consumption must be closely monitored during surgery or anesthesia. Therefore, their oxygen demand is higher, not lower, than that of adults.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increased shunt fraction The most common cause of hypoxia during one-lung ventilation (OLV) is increased shunt fraction. In OLV, one lung is ventilated while the other is intentionally non-ventilated or collapsed. The non-ventilated lung may still receive blood flow, leading to a right-to-left shunt where deoxygenated blood bypasses the lungs and enters the systemic circulation, causing hypoxia. This increased shunt fraction is the most frequent reason for hypoxemia during OLV, as the blood that bypasses the ventilated lung is not oxygenated properly. Incorrect Answers: A. Malposition of double lumen tube While malposition of the double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) can lead to complications such as inadequate isolation of the lungs or incorrect lung ventilation, it is not the most common cause of hypoxia during OLV. If the tube is mispositioned, it may lead to ventilation of both lungs or insufficient ventilation of the intended lung, but this is less common compared to the physiological issue of increased shunt fraction. C. Collapse of one lung The collapse of one lung is usually a part of the intended management during OLV, especially for thoracic surgeries. It does not typically cause hypoxia on its own unless the collapsed lung is not adequately isolated, or there is a significant problem like atelectasis or obstruction. While collapse of the lung can contribute to hypoxia, increased shunt is a more common and significant factor in causing hypoxemia. D. Soiling of lung by secretions Soiling of the lung by secretions can occur during OLV, especially if there is poor management of airway protection. However, it is not the most common cause of hypoxia. Hypoxia during OLV is primarily due to increased shunt fraction, while soiling generally causes complications like aspiration pneumonia, which may contribute to respiratory distress but is less likely to be the immediate cause of hypoxia compared to shunting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Resistance to relaxants Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is not associated with resistance to relaxants. In fact, MH is characterized by an abnormal response to certain anesthetic agents, specifically volatile anesthetics (such as halothane) and depolarizing muscle relaxants (like succinylcholine). During an MH crisis, the body's muscle metabolism becomes dramatically elevated, leading to hyperthermia and other systemic changes, but it does not involve resistance to muscle relaxants. Typically, muscle relaxants like non-depolarizing agents are still effective during an MH crisis, although the patient’s overall response to anesthesia becomes unstable. Incorrect Answers: A. Hyperthermia Hyperthermia is a hallmark of malignant hyperthermia. The disorder causes a drastic increase in body temperature due to an uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle metabolism. This increase in heat production overwhelms the body's ability to dissipate it, resulting in hyperthermia, which is one of the key signs of MH. Thus, hyperthermia is indeed associated with malignant hyperthermia. B. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often associated with malignant hyperthermia. The hypermetabolic state caused by MH leads to widespread muscle breakdown, release of inflammatory mediators, and activation of the clotting cascade. This can result in clot formation throughout the body, leading to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets, which contributes to DIC. Therefore, DIC is a complication that can arise during an MH crisis. D. Respiratory acidosis Respiratory acidosis can also occur during malignant hyperthermia. The increased metabolic activity in the muscles produces excessive carbon dioxide (CO2), which the body may not be able to expel quickly enough, leading to respiratory acidosis. This can be worsened by impaired ventilation due to muscle rigidity and compromised respiratory function. Therefore, respiratory acidosis is indeed associated with malignant hyperthermia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aspiration of gastric contents Mendelson's syndrome occurs due to the aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. This condition is a type of chemical pneumonitis that results from the inhalation of gastric acid and partially digested food, which irritates the lungs and causes inflammation. It is most commonly seen during anesthesia induction when the protective reflexes of the airway are diminished, and the stomach contents are regurgitated and aspirated. The acidic nature of the gastric contents leads to damage to the lung tissue, resulting in severe respiratory complications. Incorrect Answers: A. Acidosis Acidosis is a condition where there is an excess of acid in the body fluids, but it is not the primary cause of Mendelson's syndrome. While acidosis can develop as a consequence of aspiration and lung injury (due to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure), it is not the direct cause. The primary cause of Mendelson's syndrome is the aspiration of gastric contents, not the acidosis itself. B. High pressure air leak A high-pressure air leak is unrelated to Mendelson's syndrome. This can occur in situations like mechanical ventilation or during certain medical procedures, but it does not lead to aspiration of gastric contents. Mendelson's syndrome specifically involves the inhalation of gastric material, which is a different mechanism. D. Nitrous oxide overdose Nitrous oxide overdose can lead to a variety of symptoms, such as hypoxia, dizziness, and in rare cases, neurologic effects, but it is not the cause of Mendelson's syndrome. The syndrome is primarily linked to aspiration of gastric contents during episodes of regurgitation, especially under anesthesia. Nitrous oxide overdose does not lead to aspiration or cause the chemical pneumonitis seen in Mendelson's syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Acid aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs The most common cause of death in a mother undergoing an emergency caesarean section under general anesthesia is aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. This is known as Mendelson's syndrome and is a major risk when anesthesia is administered quickly during emergency situations, where the stomach may not be empty. Aspiration of acidic stomach contents can lead to severe chemical pneumonitis and respiratory failure, which can be fatal if not managed promptly. This complication is a primary concern during emergency cesarean sections when general anesthesia is used, especially if the patient has not been adequately pre-oxygenated or had prophylactic measures against aspiration. Incorrect Answers: A. Overdose of inhalational anaesthetic An overdose of inhalational anesthetics is a serious concern, but it is not the most common cause of maternal death in this scenario. Overdose of anesthetics can lead to deep anesthesia, hypotension, and respiratory depression, but such incidents are less common than aspiration-related complications during emergency caesarean sections. In most cases, proper monitoring and adjustments during anesthesia prevent an overdose from reaching fatal levels. B. Circulatory failure Circulatory failure is another potential cause of death, particularly if there is significant blood loss during the caesarean section or underlying cardiac issues. However, it is not the most common cause of death during general anesthesia for an emergency caesarean section. Blood loss and shock are managed with fluids and transfusion, making circulatory failure less frequent than aspiration events in this context. D. Renal failure Renal failure is not typically an immediate cause of death during an emergency caesarean section under general anesthesia. While renal failure can develop in critically ill patients with prolonged hypotension or sepsis, it is a more distant complication and not usually the direct cause of death in this situation. Aspiration of stomach contents is a much more immediate and common cause of fatality.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vertical laparotomy A vertical laparotomy is associated with the highest risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. This incision, which is typically made along the midline of the abdomen, can interfere with diaphragmatic movement and lead to impaired lung expansion, which increases the risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, and other respiratory complications after surgery. The incision may also cause pain that restricts deep breathing and coughing, further increasing the likelihood of pulmonary complications. As it involves larger muscle groups and may affect the abdominal and thoracic pressure dynamics, the risk of respiratory issues is higher compared to other types of incisions. Incorrect Answers: B. Horizontal laparotomy A horizontal laparotomy (or Pfannenstiel incision) is less invasive on the diaphragm compared to a vertical laparotomy. While it still carries some risk for postoperative pulmonary complications, it is associated with lower risk than the vertical incision. The muscle groups involved are less extensive, and the incision typically does not compromise diaphragmatic function as much as the vertical one, leading to a reduced risk of pulmonary complications. C. Lateral thoracotomy A lateral thoracotomy, used in procedures such as lung resections or chest surgeries, can lead to significant pulmonary complications, particularly if there is lung tissue manipulation or if the surgery involves a large area of the chest. However, the risk is usually more related to direct lung injury or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, rather than the incision itself. It is still associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary complications compared to a vertical laparotomy. D. Median sternotomy A median sternotomy is typically performed in cardiac surgeries. While it can lead to some respiratory complications such as pain and reduced chest wall movement, it does not directly interfere with diaphragmatic function as much as a vertical laparotomy does. The postoperative pulmonary complications associated with sternotomy are generally manageable, and the risk is lower than that associated with a vertical laparotomy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Most commonly occurs in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is most commonly observed in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. This reflex is triggered by manipulation of the eye or its surrounding tissues, leading to parasympathetic stimulation and resulting in a decrease in heart rate (bradycardia). Strabismus surgery, which involves the manipulation of extraocular muscles, is known to be the procedure most commonly associated with OCR in children. Although it can occur in adults, the reflex is more pronounced and frequent in pediatric patients due to their heightened vagal response. Incorrect Answers: A. Occurs due to traction of intraocular muscles This statement is partially correct, as traction on the extraocular muscles (which control eye movement) during surgery can trigger the oculocardiac reflex. However, the reflex is not caused by traction of the intraocular muscles specifically, but rather by manipulation of the extraocular muscles and surrounding tissues. The reflex involves the parasympathetic pathway, primarily affecting the heart rate. C. Cholinergic medication is given to prevent it Cholinergic medications, such as atropine, are not typically given to prevent the oculocardiac reflex; in fact, atropine is often used to treat it once it occurs by blocking the parasympathetic response and preventing bradycardia. While other methods, such as gentle handling and avoiding excessive traction on the eye, can help minimize the risk, cholinergic agents are not used prophylactically to prevent the reflex. D. With repeated traction the reflex is marked leading to VF While repeated traction can indeed exacerbate the oculocardiac reflex and lead to more pronounced bradycardia or even asystole in extreme cases, it is not typically associated with ventricular fibrillation (VF). The primary consequence of a significant oculocardiac reflex is bradycardia, and while it may lead to more severe cardiac arrhythmias if untreated, VF is not a typical direct consequence. If the reflex is not managed appropriately, it can result in a transient cardiac event, but VF is rare.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Larynx The most common site of airway injury during anesthesia is the larynx. The larynx is particularly vulnerable during the insertion of airway devices, such as endotracheal tubes or laryngeal mask airways. Traumatic intubation, improper positioning of the tube, or prolonged pressure on the larynx can lead to injury, which may manifest as hoarseness, laryngeal edema, or even vocal cord damage. Laryngeal injury is a well-recognized complication of anesthesia, especially in cases of difficult intubation or improper technique. Incorrect Answers: B. T.M. joint (Temporomandibular joint) Injury to the temporomandibular (T.M.) joint is not as common as laryngeal injury during anesthesia. While T.M. joint dislocation or damage may occur during procedures involving difficult airway management, it is less frequently encountered compared to laryngeal injuries. The primary concern in airway management is the protection and manipulation of the airway structures, with the larynx being the most susceptible to injury. C. Pharynx While the pharynx can be injured during anesthesia, especially during the insertion of airway devices such as endotracheal tubes or during nasotracheal intubation, pharyngeal injuries are less common compared to laryngeal injuries. Pharyngeal trauma may result from the use of rigid airway devices or improper technique, but the larynx, with its delicate vocal cords and structures, remains the most vulnerable site during airway management. D. Tongue Injury to the tongue during anesthesia is uncommon. The tongue is generally protected during airway procedures, as it is usually retracted gently using an appropriate technique. Though there can be transient injury due to improper positioning of the airway devices, tongue injuries are rare compared to laryngeal injuries, which involve more critical structures in the airway.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Calcium Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is caused by an abnormal release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells. This excessive calcium release leads to uncontrolled muscle contraction, increased metabolism, and a cascade of metabolic abnormalities, including hyperthermia. The abnormal calcium handling is due to mutations in genes encoding for the ryanodine receptor (RYR1), which is responsible for calcium release during muscle contraction. The sustained muscle contractions and increased metabolism result in the hallmark features of MH, including hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and acidosis. Incorrect Answers: A. Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide (CO?) is a product of metabolism, and its accumulation can occur during malignant hyperthermia due to increased muscle activity and metabolic rate. However, carbon dioxide is not the primary cause of the condition. It is a secondary result of the excessive muscle contraction and metabolism associated with MH. The initial pathological event is the abnormal release of calcium, which leads to the metabolic changes, including elevated CO? levels. C. Glucose Glucose is a fuel source for cellular metabolism, but its release is not involved in the pathophysiology of malignant hyperthermia. While glucose metabolism is affected by the increased metabolic demand in MH, it is not the triggering factor. The core issue lies in the abnormal calcium release in the muscles, not in glucose regulation or metabolism. D. Heat Heat is a consequence of the abnormal metabolic processes occurring in malignant hyperthermia, but it is not the cause. The uncontrolled muscle contractions and heightened metabolism generate heat, leading to hyperthermia. The primary cause of MH is the abnormal release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which initiates the hypermetabolic state, not the heat itself.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Decreased peripheral vascular resistance Decreased peripheral vascular resistance is not a deleterious effect of hypothermia. In fact, hypothermia generally causes increased peripheral vascular resistance as the body attempts to conserve heat. The cold causes vasoconstriction in peripheral blood vessels, which helps reduce heat loss from the body. This compensatory mechanism can lead to an increase in blood pressure and workload on the heart. Thus, decreased peripheral vascular resistance is not a typical or harmful effect of hypothermia, making this the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. Cardiac arrhythmia and ischemia Hypothermia can indeed cause cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia. As body temperature decreases, the electrical conductivity of the heart becomes altered, leading to a higher risk of arrhythmias, such as bradycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Hypothermia can also lead to myocardial ischemia by reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. These are well-documented and deleterious effects of hypothermia. C. Reversible platelet dysfunction Platelet dysfunction is a common effect of hypothermia, and it is typically reversible once the body temperature is restored. At lower temperatures, platelet function is impaired, leading to a reduced ability to form clots and an increased risk of bleeding. This dysfunction is temporary and improves with warming, which is why it is considered reversible. Despite being reversible, it is still a significant deleterious effect in the perioperative or trauma setting. D. Left shift of O2 Hb dissociation curve A left shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is a known consequence of hypothermia. At lower temperatures, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases, making it more difficult for oxygen to be released to tissues. This can impair oxygen delivery to vital organs, particularly in critically ill or injured patients. Although this effect can be harmful, it is a recognized and expected response to hypothermia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) • An airway fire is a fire that occurs within a patient’s airway or involves an in-situ airway device or contiguous breathing circuit • In order for an airway fire to occur, the essential elements of the classical fire triad must be present: 1. An ignition source: electrocautery and lasers utilised in Ear, Nose and Throat surgeries. Other potential sources are static electricity, heated probes, drills and burrs, argon beam coagulators, fibreoptic light sources and cables, and defibrillator pads and paddles. 2. An oxidiser: supplemental oxygen or nitrous oxide in anaesthetic gases delivered via closed or semi-closed breathing circuits creates an oxidiser-enriched environment within patients’ airways and breathing apparatus 3. A fuel source: The most common source of fuel for airway fires are endotracheal tubes, followed by surgical drapes. - Other sources include alternative airway devices, breathing circuits, scavenging tubes, suction catheters, wound drains, surgical packs, dressings, pledgets, sponges and gauze. 1. Ignition sources include but are not limited to electrosurgery or electrocautery units and lasers. 2. An oxidizer-enriched atmosphere occurs when there is any increase in oxygen concentration above room air level, and/or the presence of any concentration of nitrous oxide. 3. After minimizing delivered oxygen, wait a period of time (e.g., 1-3 min) before using an ignition source. For oxygen dependent patients, reduce supplemental oxygen delivery to the minimum required to avoid hypoxia. Monitor oxygenation with pulse oximetry, and if feasible, inspired, exhaled, and/or delivered oxygen concentration. 4. After stopping the delivery of nitrous oxide, wait a period of time (e.g., 1-3 min) before using an ignition source. 5. Unexpected flash, flame, smoke or heat, unusual sounds ( e.g., a “pop,” snap or “foomp”) or odors, unexpected movement of drapes, discoloration of drapes or breathing circuit, unexpected patient movement or complaint. 6. In this algorithm, airway fire refers to a fire in the airway or breathing circuit. 7.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Differences in airway anatomy in pediatric patients Typically, the airway of infants differs from adults in five ways: 1. LARGE TONGUE: increases the likelihood of airway obstruction and technical difficulties during laryngoscopy. 2. HIGH LARYNX: thus, making straight blades more useful than curved blades. 3. The EPIGLOTTIS is shaped differently, being short, stubby, omega shaped, and angled over the laryngeal inlet. Control with the laryngoscope blade is therefore more difficult. 4. The vocal cords are angled; consequently, a blindly passed tracheal tube may easily lodge in the anterior commissure rather than slide into the trachea. 5. Finally, the infant larynx is funnel shaped, the narrowest portion occurring at the cricoid cartilage • Use of cuffed endotracheal tube is therefore not advised in a paediatric patients up to 8 years of age because a tube that passes through the vocal cards can still get stuck in the cricoid region and on inflation of the cuff can lead to critical decrease in the blood flow of tracheal mucosal capillaries leading to a complication of post extubation tracheal oedema leading to stridor and complete airway obstruction.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/12(6).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

High flow nasal cannula offers the advantage of providing PEEP when compared to low-flow oxygen supplementation. • The high-flow nasal cannula has been showed to reduce the need for respiratory support of cardiac surgical patients when compared to low-flow oxygen supplementation. • High flow nasal cannula has also been associated with higher compliance and comfort rates when compared to conventional oxygen supplementation facilitating pain management in the immediate post-op surgical period. • Venturi mask will only give a fixed FiO2 of oxygen and use of morphine will lead to delayed respiratory depression so wont be a preferred technique.",

The 'gate' is the mechanism where pain signals can be let through or restricted. One of two things can happen, the gate can be 'open' or the gate can be 'closed': If the gate is open, pain signals can pass through and will be sent to the brain to perceive the pain. If the gate is closed, pain signals will be restricted from travelling up to the brain, and the sensation of pain won't be perceived. If someone experiences a painful (noxious) stimulus, the application of a non-noxious (soothing or light rubbing or Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) stimulus can help activate the gate control mechanism, and reduce the pain.",

Option B-Venous access below clavicle :- supraclavicular approach to a subclavian vein. In the given image,we're getting venous access on left side. Left-sided internal jugular or subclavian access carries a higher risk of lymphatic injury due to the anatomic location of the thoracic duct, but lymphatic injury can still occur with right-sided access.Hence, Chylothorax is a specific answer in this question.
