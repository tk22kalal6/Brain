      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Paromomycin. Giardiasis is caused by Giardia lamblia, a protozoan parasite that affects the small intestine, leading to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and malabsorption. The first-line treatment in non-pregnant individuals is metronidazole or tinidazole, but these drugs are contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy due to their potential teratogenic effects. Paromomycin is the safest option for treating giardiasis during the first trimester of pregnancy because: It is a poorly absorbed aminoglycoside, meaning it acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract without significant systemic absorption. It does not cross the placenta, minimizing fetal risk. It effectively eradicates Giardia without causing DNA damage or mutagenic effects. Thus, paromomycin is preferred for giardiasis in the first trimester to ensure fetal safety while effectively treating the infection. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Metronidazole Incorrect because metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic that is teratogenic in animal studies. It crosses the placenta and has been associated with mutagenic and carcinogenic potential in early pregnancy. While some studies suggest it may be safe in later trimesters, it is avoided in the first trimester unless no other option is available. (B) Tinidazole Incorrect because tinidazole is closely related to metronidazole and has similar teratogenic risks. It is classified as pregnancy category C due to limited safety data and potential mutagenic effects. It is strictly avoided in the first trimester. (C) Clindamycin Incorrect because clindamycin is ineffective against Giardia. It is a lincosamide antibiotic used for anaerobic bacterial infections, bacterial vaginosis, and toxoplasmosis, but it does not work against protozoal infections like giardiasis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Histoplasmosis. Metronidazole is not effective against Histoplasmosis because it is an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent, whereas Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus. The treatment for Histoplasmosis includes antifungal drugs such as itraconazole and amphotericin B, not metronidazole. Metronidazole acts by producing toxic free radicals that disrupt DNA synthesis in anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, making it ineffective against fungi like Histoplasma. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Amoebiasis Incorrect because metronidazole is the drug of choice for amoebiasis (caused by Entamoeba histolytica). It effectively kills both trophozoites and tissue-invasive forms of Entamoeba histolytica, treating both intestinal and extraintestinal (liver abscess) infections. (C) Trichomoniasis Incorrect because metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis, which is caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. It works by damaging protozoal DNA, leading to cell death and resolution of the infection. (D) Giardiasis Incorrect because metronidazole is a first-line drug for giardiasis, caused by Giardia lamblia. It eradicates the protozoa by interfering with anaerobic metabolism, making it an effective treatment.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dihydroemetine. Dihydroemetine is not a luminal amoebicide but a systemic (tissue) amoebicide used to treat invasive amoebiasis, particularly hepatic amoebiasis (amoebic liver abscess). It acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in Entamoeba histolytica, leading to the death of the parasite in tissues. It is a derivative of emetine and is primarily used as an alternative to metronidazole for severe cases of amoebiasis when metronidazole cannot be used. It is not effective against luminal amoebas and does not clear the cysts from the intestine, so it must be combined with a luminal amoebicide (e.g., paromomycin or diloxanide furoate) to prevent relapse. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Tetracyclines Incorrect because tetracyclines act as indirect luminal amoebicides. They do not kill Entamoeba histolytica directly but reduce the bacterial flora in the intestine, depriving the amoebas of their food source. They are sometimes used as adjunct therapy in amoebiasis. (B) Paromomycin Incorrect because paromomycin is a luminal amoebicide. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that acts within the intestinal lumen by inhibiting protein synthesis in amoebas. It is commonly used to treat asymptomatic carriers of E. histolytica and is also used after systemic therapy (e.g., metronidazole) to clear residual cysts. (C) Diloxanide furoate Incorrect because diloxanide furoate is a luminal amoebicide. It is effective against the cyst form of E. histolytica in the intestines and is commonly used in combination with metronidazole for complete eradication of amoebiasis. It is particularly useful in asymptomatic carriers and mild intestinal infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Clindamycin and Quinine. Severe babesiosis is treated with a combination of clindamycin and quinine, which is the preferred regimen for critically ill patients. Babesiosis, caused by the protozoan Babesia microti and transmitted by Ixodes ticks, can lead to hemolytic anemia, fever, chills, and organ failure in severe cases. Quinine acts by inhibiting heme detoxification within the parasite, leading to its death. Clindamycin works by inhibiting protein synthesis in the parasite. This combination is more potent and effective in life-threatening cases, especially in immunocompromised individuals or those with severe hemolysis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Azithromycin and Atovaquone Incorrect because this combination is used in mild to moderate babesiosis, not severe cases. Atovaquone disrupts mitochondrial electron transport in Babesia, while azithromycin inhibits protein synthesis. This combination is less toxic and better tolerated but is not the first-line treatment for severe cases. (C) Tetracycline Incorrect because tetracyclines are not the primary treatment for babesiosis. Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) are primarily used for other tick-borne infections like Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis but are not very effective against Babesia parasites. (D) Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole) Incorrect because cotrimoxazole is not effective against Babesia species. This drug is used to treat Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and bacterial infections but does not have a significant effect on Babesia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Benznidazole. Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite transmitted by Triatomine (\"kissing\") bugs. It is endemic in Central and South America and can lead to chronic cardiomyopathy, megacolon, and megaesophagus. Benznidazole is the first-line treatment for acute and early chronic Chagas disease due to its antiparasitic effect. It works by producing free radicals that damage the parasite's DNA and cellular structures. It is most effective in the acute phase but can also slow disease progression in chronic cases. It is generally preferred over nifurtimox due to better tolerability and fewer side effects. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Metronidazole Incorrect because metronidazole is not effective against Trypanosoma cruzi. It is primarily used for anaerobic bacterial infections (e.g., Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides) and protozoal infections (e.g., amoebiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis). (B) Suramin Incorrect because suramin is used for early-stage Trypanosoma brucei (African trypanosomiasis), not Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease). Suramin is used in West African sleeping sickness (T. b. gambiense) and East African sleeping sickness (T. b. rhodesiense) before CNS involvement. (C) Melarsoprol Incorrect because melarsoprol is used for late-stage African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) with CNS involvement, not for Chagas disease. It is an arsenic-based drug that is highly toxic, used mainly for CNS-involved T. b. rhodesiense infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Praziquantel. Praziquantel is an anthelmintic drug that primarily affects calcium ion channels in the membranes of parasitic flukes (trematodes) and cestodes. It increases the permeability of calcium ions, leading to rapid muscle contractions, paralysis, and eventual disintegration of the parasite. The drug also exposes antigenic sites, making the parasite more vulnerable to the host’s immune response. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, and other fluke infections. Its selective toxicity towards trematodes makes it highly effective for treating fluke-related diseases. Incorrect Options: A. Albendazole: Incorrect. Albendazole is a benzimidazole derivative that primarily targets microtubule formation in parasites. It binds to ?-tubulin, disrupting microtubule polymerization and leading to impaired glucose uptake and energy depletion. Albendazole is more effective against nematodes (roundworms) and certain cestodes but does not significantly affect calcium channels in flukes. C. Ivermectin: Incorrect. Ivermectin acts by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in nematodes and arthropods, causing paralysis and death. It is highly effective against nematodes and ectoparasites (e.g., scabies, lice) but has no significant action on calcium channels in flukes. D. Piperazine: Incorrect. Piperazine acts as a GABA agonist, causing flaccid paralysis in nematodes by hyperpolarizing their neuromuscular junctions. It is used primarily for treating ascariasis and enterobiasis (pinworm infection) but has no role in affecting calcium channels or treating fluke infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Piperazine. Piperazine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorders because it acts as a ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist in nematodes, causing flaccid paralysis of the worms. However, in humans, it can cross the blood-brain barrier and may lower the seizure threshold, increasing the risk of convulsions, particularly in individuals with preexisting epilepsy or neurological conditions. Due to this proconvulsant potential, piperazine should be avoided in patients with seizure disorders and alternative anthelmintics should be used instead. Incorrect Options: A. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC): Incorrect. DEC is primarily used for filariasis and works by altering the surface structure of microfilariae, making them more susceptible to host immune attack. While it may cause encephalopathy in high microfilarial loads, it does not have a significant effect on seizure threshold like piperazine. C. Albendazole: Incorrect. Albendazole inhibits microtubule synthesis in parasites, leading to energy depletion and parasite death. It does not directly affect neurotransmitters like GABA and is not known to exacerbate seizure disorders. However, caution is advised in neurocysticercosis treatment, where seizures may occur due to the inflammatory response from dying cysticerci. D. Pyrantel Pamoate: Incorrect. Pyrantel pamoate is a neuromuscular blocker that induces spastic paralysis in nematodes by stimulating nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. It does not significantly affect the central nervous system or the seizure threshold, making it safe for use in patients with epilepsy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Proguanil. Proguanil is an antimalarial drug that acts by inhibiting bifunctional plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS), an essential enzyme required for DNA synthesis and parasite replication. By blocking this enzyme, proguanil disrupts folate metabolism, preventing the parasite from synthesizing purines and pyrimidines necessary for DNA replication. This leads to impaired parasite growth and eventual death. Proguanil is often used in combination with atovaquone (Malarone) for malaria prophylaxis and treatment, particularly against Plasmodium falciparum. Incorrect Options: A. Primaquine: Incorrect. Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline that acts by generating reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative damage and destruction of the malaria parasite. It is primarily used for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale hypnozoites in the liver and does not target the DHFR-TS enzyme. C. Pyronaridine: Incorrect. Pyronaridine is an antimalarial drug that acts by inhibiting hemozoin formation, leading to the accumulation of toxic heme within the parasite. It is commonly used in combination with artesunate (Pyramax) for treating multidrug-resistant malaria but does not inhibit dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase. D. Piperaquine: Incorrect. Piperaquine is a bisquinoline antimalarial that functions similarly to chloroquine by interfering with hemoglobin digestion in the parasite’s food vacuole. It prevents the detoxification of free heme, causing parasite death. It is often combined with dihydroartemisinin in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), but it does not target DHFR-TS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Chloroquine. Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drug that acts by inhibiting the polymerization of heme into hemozoin within the parasite’s food vacuole. During its life cycle, the Plasmodium parasite digests host hemoglobin to obtain amino acids for survival. This process releases free heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX), which is toxic to the parasite. To neutralize this toxicity, the parasite normally polymerizes heme into the non-toxic hemozoin. Chloroquine prevents this polymerization, causing an accumulation of free heme, which disrupts the parasite’s membranes and leads to its death. Due to widespread resistance, chloroquine is now mainly used for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria in regions where resistance is low. Incorrect Options: A. Primaquine: Incorrect. Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline that acts by generating reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and parasite death. It is primarily used for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale hypnozoites in the liver, rather than acting on hemoglobin digestion. B. Artesunate: Incorrect. Artesunate is an artemisinin derivative that acts by producing free radicals in the presence of heme, leading to oxidative damage and rapid parasite clearance. Unlike chloroquine, it does not inhibit hemozoin formation but rather disrupts parasite metabolism through reactive oxygen species. C. Lumefantrine: Incorrect. Lumefantrine is a quinoline-based antimalarial drug that works by interfering with heme detoxification, but its exact mechanism differs from chloroquine. It is commonly used in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with artemether but is not the primary inhibitor of heme polymerization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Not effective on gametocytes. This statement is incorrect because primaquine is highly effective against gametocytes, particularly those of Plasmodium falciparum. It is the only drug capable of clearing mature gametocytes from the bloodstream, thereby reducing the transmission of malaria to mosquitoes. Primaquine is often used as a gametocytocidal agent in combination with other antimalarials to prevent the spread of malaria in endemic areas. Incorrect Options: A. It is a poor erythrocytic schizontocide: Correct. Primaquine is not effective against the asexual erythrocytic (blood-stage) forms of Plasmodium spp., making it a poor erythrocytic schizontocide. Instead, it primarily targets hepatic (liver-stage) parasites and gametocytes. This is why primaquine is not used alone for treating acute malaria but is combined with blood schizontocides like chloroquine or artemisinin-based therapies. B. More active against the pre-erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum than that of P. vivax: Correct. Primaquine exhibits greater activity against pre-erythrocytic (liver-stage) forms of P. falciparum compared to P. vivax. However, its primary importance is in eliminating hypnozoites (latent liver-stage parasites) of P. vivax and P. ovale, preventing relapse. D. Effective on primary as well as secondary hepatic phases of the malarial parasite: Correct. Primaquine is unique in its ability to target both primary hepatic stages (pre-erythrocytic schizonts) and secondary hepatic stages (hypnozoites) of P. vivax and P. ovale. This makes it the drug of choice for the radical cure of relapsing malaria, ensuring complete eradication of liver-stage parasites.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 5?xtrose. Quinine is best administered via IV infusion in 5?xtrose to ensure optimal drug solubility, stability, and controlled absorption. Quinine has a tendency to cause hypoglycemia, which is a serious adverse effect, particularly in severe malaria patients. The dextrose solution helps counteract quinine-induced hypoglycemia by maintaining blood glucose levels during treatment. Additionally, 5?xtrose provides an isotonic medium, reducing the risk of venous irritation and thrombophlebitis, which can occur with quinine administration. Incorrect Options: A. Normal saline: Incorrect. While quinine can be diluted in normal saline (0.9% NaCl), it does not provide glucose supplementation, which is crucial to prevent quinine-induced hypoglycemia. Therefore, 5?xtrose is preferred over normal saline. C. Ringer lactate: Incorrect. Ringer lactate contains calcium, which can precipitate with quinine, leading to potential drug instability and reduced efficacy. Thus, it is not recommended for quinine infusion. D. ½ Normal saline (0.45% NaCl): Incorrect. While ½ normal saline is hypotonic and can be used for fluid resuscitation, it does not provide the glucose supplementation required to prevent quinine-induced hypoglycemia, making 5?xtrose the better choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Levamisole Levamisole is an antihelminthic that is also known for its immunomodulatory properties. It works as an anthelmintic by paralyzing nematodes through its action on the neuromuscular junction, leading to expulsion of the worms from the intestine. Beyond its role in treating parasitic infections (especially ascariasis and hookworm infections), levamisole has been recognized as an immunomodulator. It enhances T-cell function, increases macrophage activity, and stimulates immune responses, making it useful in certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. Levamisole has been used as an adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer and for treating autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. However, it has been largely discontinued in many places due to adverse effects like agranulocytosis. Incorrect Options: (A) Albendazole – Incorrect Albendazole is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole antihelminthic that acts by inhibiting microtubule synthesis in parasites, leading to their immobilization and death. It is highly effective against intestinal and systemic helminth infections, including neurocysticercosis and echinococcosis. However, it does not possess immunomodulatory properties like levamisole. (C) Mebendazole – Incorrect Mebendazole, like albendazole, is a benzimidazole antihelminthic that blocks glucose uptake in parasites by inhibiting microtubule formation. It is commonly used for treating intestinal nematode infections such as ascariasis, hookworm, and whipworm infections. While effective against a broad range of helminths, it does not act as an immunomodulator. (D) Piperazine – Incorrect Piperazine acts by blocking neuromuscular transmission in worms, leading to flaccid paralysis, which allows the worms to be expelled by normal peristalsis. It is primarily used for treating ascariasis and enterobiasis (pinworm infections). Unlike levamisole, it does not have any immunomodulatory effects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Metronidazole plus chloroquine plus iodoquinol. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The patient has intestinal amebiasis that has progressed to an amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica. The most effective regimen for treating both hepatic and intestinal infections includes: Metronidazole – A tissue amebicide that is highly effective against E. histolytica trophozoites in the liver and intestines. It disrupts DNA synthesis in anaerobic organisms and is the drug of choice for amebic liver abscess. Chloroquine – Used as a second-line agent for hepatic amebiasis, particularly when metronidazole alone is insufficient. It accumulates in liver tissue and enhances the eradication of trophozoites. Iodoquinol – A luminal amebicide that kills E. histolytica cysts in the intestine, preventing recurrence and transmission. Metronidazole does not effectively clear luminal cysts, so iodoquinol is essential for complete eradication. Since this patient initially responded to oral therapy but later developed severe dysentery, liver enlargement, and fever, indicating hepatic involvement, a combination of a tissue amebicide (metronidazole), an adjunct hepatic agent (chloroquine), and a luminal amebicide (iodoquinol) is required for complete treatment. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: A) Chloroquine alone: While chloroquine can kill trophozoites in the liver, it is not effective in eradicating intestinal cysts or treating severe amebic colitis. It should only be used as an adjunct to metronidazole, not as monotherapy. B) Diloxanide furoate plus iodoquinol: Both diloxanide furoate and iodoquinol are luminal amebicides, meaning they work only in the intestine to clear E. histolytica cysts. They do not penetrate the liver and are ineffective for treating amebic liver abscess. C) Emetine plus diloxanide furoate plus chloroquine: Emetine is a toxic alternative tissue amebicide that is rarely used today due to severe cardiotoxicity, including QT prolongation, which could be dangerous in this patient with a past history of tachyarrhythmia. Diloxanide furoate is a luminal agent that does not treat liver abscesses. Chloroquine alone is insufficient for hepatic amebiasis without metronidazole.",

It is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic that works by inhibiting microtubule formation in the parasite, leading to disruption of glucose uptake and depletion of energy stores, eventually killing the larval stage of the parasite. In hydatid disease, albendazole is used as: Primary treatment for patients who refuse surgery, as in this case. Adjunctive therapy before or after surgery to reduce cyst viability and prevent recurrence. Alternative therapy for inoperable cases or when surgery poses high risks.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pyrazinamide Explanation for the Correct Answer: Pyrazinamide is not a common cause of drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE). Drug-induced lupus is a condition in which long-term drug use triggers autoimmune-like symptoms, including fever, myalgia, arthritis, and skin rashes. The hallmark of DILE is the presence of anti-histone antibodies, which were detected in this patient. Pyrazinamide is an anti-tubercular drug that is primarily associated with hepatotoxicity, hyperuricemia, and arthralgia due to increased uric acid levels. It does not commonly trigger autoimmunity or cause anti-histone antibody production, making it the correct answer in this scenario. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: (A) Dapsone Dapsone is known to cause drug-induced lupus in some individuals. It is used for leprosy, dermatitis herpetiformis, and other dermatological conditions, but it can lead to an autoimmune response in certain predisposed individuals. (C) Procainamide Procainamide is one of the most common causes of drug-induced lupus. It is an antiarrhythmic drug used in cardiac conditions. Up to 20-30% of patients on long-term procainamide therapy develop anti-histone antibodies, leading to DILE symptoms. (D) Para-amino salicylic acid (PAS) PAS, an older anti-tubercular drug, has been associated with autoimmune reactions and drug-induced lupus in rare cases. Although less common than procainamide, it has been reported to trigger lupus-like symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Metronidazole Metronidazole is known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction when alcohol is consumed. This occurs because metronidazole inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol metabolism. This results in flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, tachycardia, hypotension, and severe discomfort. Due to this adverse reaction, patients taking metronidazole are advised to avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least 48 hours after completing the course. Incorrect Options: (B) Amoxicillin Amoxicillin, a ?-lactam antibiotic, does not inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase and is not associated with a disulfiram-like reaction. While it may cause gastrointestinal upset or hypersensitivity reactions, it does not interact significantly with alcohol. (C) Doxycycline Doxycycline (a tetracycline antibiotic) does not cause a disulfiram-like reaction. However, alcohol may reduce doxycycline’s effectiveness by increasing its metabolism in the liver. This interaction does not involve aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition and does not produce the flushing and vomiting associated with disulfiram-like reactions. (D) Cefuroxime Cefuroxime (a second-generation cephalosporin) is less likely to cause a disulfiram-like reaction compared to some other cephalosporins (e.g., cefotetan, cefoperazone). While certain cephalosporins contain an N-methylthiotetrazole (MTT) side chain, which can inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase and cause this reaction, cefuroxime lacks this side chain and is generally safe with alcohol.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Metronidazole Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic that is highly effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. It works by penetrating bacterial cells and generating reactive nitrogen species, which cause DNA damage and strand breakage, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death. Because anaerobes lack the enzymes to detoxify these reactive species, metronidazole is selectively toxic to them. Metronidazole is frequently used in combination with other antibiotics for mixed infections involving anaerobes, such as intra-abdominal infections, pelvic infections, bacterial vaginosis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and aspiration pneumonia. It is also commonly combined with beta-lactams or aminoglycosides to provide broad-spectrum coverage in polymicrobial infections. Incorrect Options: (B) Vancomycin – Incorrect Vancomycin is primarily used for Gram-positive infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (oral formulation). However, it is not effective against anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, making it less suitable for treating mixed anaerobic infections. (C) Amoxicillin – Incorrect Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin that is effective against many Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria, but it has limited activity against anaerobes. However, when combined with clavulanic acid (as amoxicillin-clavulanate), its spectrum expands to include some anaerobes. Nevertheless, metronidazole remains a superior choice for anaerobic infections. (D) Ceftriaxone – Incorrect Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is highly effective against many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, but it has poor activity against anaerobes. It is often used for serious systemic infections like bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and gonorrhea but is not the first-line option for anaerobic infections.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Metronidazole Metronidazole is an antiprotozoal and antibacterial drug that is the first-line treatment for giardiasis, an intestinal infection caused by Giardia lamblia. It exerts its effect by undergoing enzymatic reduction in anaerobic protozoa, leading to the formation of reactive free radicals. These radicals damage the protozoan DNA, resulting in strand breakage and inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, ultimately leading to cell death. Metronidazole is also effective against other anaerobic protozoal infections, including trichomoniasis and amoebiasis. Incorrect Options: (B) Chloroquine – Incorrect Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that works by inhibiting heme polymerase, leading to the accumulation of toxic heme in Plasmodium species. It is used for treating and preventing malaria but has no role in the treatment of giardiasis. Additionally, it does not generate free radicals to kill protozoa. (C) Quinine – Incorrect Quinine is another antimalarial agent used for the treatment of severe malaria, particularly against Plasmodium falciparum. It functions by interfering with heme detoxification in the parasite's food vacuole, leading to oxidative damage and parasite death. Since it is not effective against Giardia lamblia and does not generate free radicals, it is not the correct answer. (D) Primaquine – Incorrect Primaquine is an antimalarial drug that is specifically used to treat liver stages of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. It eliminates hypnozoites (dormant liver forms) to prevent relapses of malaria. However, it is not effective against Giardia lamblia and does not work by generating free radicals, making it an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Primaquine Primaquine is an antimalarial drug that is particularly effective against Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale because it targets the liver (exoerythrocytic) stages of the parasite, including hypnozoites. These hypnozoites are dormant forms in the liver that can reactivate and cause relapsing infections. By eliminating these liver-stage parasites, primaquine prevents relapses and is therefore essential for the radical cure of malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale. It is also used for malaria prophylaxis, making it effective in both treatment and prevention. Incorrect Options: (A) Artemisinin – Incorrect Artemisinin and its derivatives (e.g., artesunate, artemether) are fast-acting antimalarials that are primarily used for severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. They work by generating free radicals that damage the parasite's proteins and membranes. However, they do not target the liver stages of P. vivax, making them ineffective for preventing relapses. (B) Chloroquine – Incorrect Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that works by accumulating in the parasite’s food vacuole and inhibiting heme polymerase, leading to toxic heme buildup and parasite death. While it is effective against the blood stages of P. vivax, it does not eliminate hypnozoites in the liver, meaning it cannot prevent relapses. It is also ineffective in areas with chloroquine-resistant P. vivax. (D) Mefloquine – Incorrect Mefloquine is mainly used for malaria prophylaxis and treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. It acts on the blood stages of the parasite but has no effect on liver-stage hypnozoites, making it ineffective in preventing relapses of P. vivax malaria.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Artesunate Artesunate is a fast-acting antimalarial drug belonging to the artemisinin class, which is widely used for the treatment of severe malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium falciparum. It works by generating free radicals inside the parasite, leading to oxidative damage and parasite death. Artesunate has a rapid onset of action, significantly reducing parasite load within hours, making it the first-line treatment for severe malaria, especially in hospitalized patients. It is often used in combination therapy (e.g., artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)) to prevent resistance. Incorrect Options: (A) Quinine – Incorrect Quinine has been historically used for severe malaria treatment, but it has a slower onset of action compared to artesunate and is associated with significant side effects such as cinchonism (tinnitus, headache, dizziness). While it is still used in some cases, the WHO now recommends artesunate over quinine for severe malaria due to its superior efficacy and lower toxicity. (B) Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine – Incorrect Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is an antifolate combination that inhibits folate synthesis, blocking parasite DNA replication. It has a slow onset of action and is not effective for severe malaria. Instead, it is used for uncomplicated malaria and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp). (D) Atovaquone – Incorrect Atovaquone, usually given in combination with proguanil (Malarone), is used for malaria prophylaxis and uncomplicated malaria, but not for severe malaria. It works by inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the parasite. However, it has a slower onset and is not as effective as artesunate for rapid parasite clearance.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ivermectin Ivermectin is a highly effective anti-helminthic drug used to treat strongyloidiasis (caused by Strongyloides stercoralis) and onchocerciasis (river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus). It works by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in the parasites, leading to an increase in chloride ion influx, which causes paralysis and death of the worms. Ivermectin is particularly effective in immobilizing microfilariae in onchocerciasis, preventing their migration and reducing symptoms like skin irritation and blindness. Due to its broad spectrum of activity against filarial and nematode infections, it is widely used in mass drug administration programs for parasite control. Incorrect Options: (B) Praziquantel – Incorrect Praziquantel is not effective against strongyloidiasis or onchocerciasis. Instead, it is used to treat schistosomiasis and trematode (fluke) infections by increasing calcium ion permeability in parasite cell membranes, leading to spastic paralysis and eventual death of the worms. (C) Albendazole – Incorrect Albendazole is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole anti-helminthic that works by inhibiting microtubule synthesis in the worms. It is mainly used for intestinal nematodes (e.g., ascariasis, hookworm, whipworm) and cestode infections (e.g., neurocysticercosis caused by Taenia solium) but is not the preferred drug for strongyloidiasis or onchocerciasis. (D) Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) – Incorrect Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is used for lymphatic filariasis (caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi) and loiasis (Loa loa infection). However, it is not used for onchocerciasis, as it can cause severe inflammatory reactions due to rapid microfilarial death. Unlike ivermectin, it does not paralyze worms but rather alters their surface membrane, making them more susceptible to immune attack.",
