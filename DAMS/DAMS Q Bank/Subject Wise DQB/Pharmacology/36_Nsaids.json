      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Bosentan Bosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) used for the treatment of severe pulmonary hypertension, specifically pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It works by blocking the action of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor that contributes to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and hypertension. By inhibiting both ETA and ETB receptors, Bosentan leads to vasodilation, reduced pulmonary artery pressure, and improved exercise capacity in patients with PAH. This makes it an effective therapeutic option for managing severe cases of pulmonary hypertension. Incorrect Options: (A) Angiotensin 1 – Incorrect. Angiotensin I is an inactive precursor that is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure, which would worsen pulmonary hypertension rather than treat it. Therefore, angiotensin I is not used for managing pulmonary hypertension. (C) Omapatrilat – Incorrect. Omapatrilat is a vasopeptidase inhibitor, which blocks both ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). While it has been studied for hypertension and heart failure, it is not approved for pulmonary hypertension due to concerns about angioedema and limited efficacy in PAH treatment. (D) Endothelin – Incorrect. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor that contributes to the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension by increasing vascular resistance. Instead of treating PAH, excess endothelin worsens the condition, which is why endothelin receptor antagonists like Bosentan are used instead.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Alprostadil Alprostadil is a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog that is used to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates with congenital heart defects such as transposition of the great vessels, tetralogy of Fallot, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing blood to bypass the lungs. In conditions like transposition of the great vessels, maintaining ductal patency is critical for survival because it allows for some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood until definitive surgical correction can be performed. Alprostadil relaxes the smooth muscle of the ductus arteriosus, preventing its closure after birth. Incorrect Options: (B) Cortisol – Incorrect. Cortisol (a glucocorticoid) is important for fetal lung maturation and has a role in surfactant production, but it does not maintain ductal patency. In fact, corticosteroids may contribute to ductal closure, making it unsuitable for this situation. (C) Indomethacin – Incorrect. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, leading to closure of the ductus arteriosus. It is used to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants, making it the opposite of what is needed in this case. (D) Tacrolimus – Incorrect. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ transplant rejection by inhibiting T-cell activation. It has no role in ductal patency or congenital heart defects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Decreased hepatocellular store of glutathione Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and sulfation, but a small portion is converted by Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4) into a highly toxic intermediate called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). In healthy individuals, NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, a key antioxidant, and then excreted. However, in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, glutathione stores are significantly depleted due to chronic oxidative stress and liver damage. This depletion reduces the ability of the liver to detoxify NAPQI, leading to increased hepatotoxicity, even at doses that are safe for individuals with normal liver function. This makes decreased hepatocellular glutathione the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Decreased availability of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase – Incorrect. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is involved in the metabolism of alcohol, not acetaminophen. Its deficiency (such as in individuals with genetic polymorphisms) leads to acetaldehyde accumulation, causing symptoms like flushing and nausea after alcohol consumption. However, it has no significant role in acetaminophen toxicity. (B) Decreased activity of Cytochrome P450 enzymes – Incorrect. In alcoholic liver disease, CYP2E1 activity is often increased, not decreased, due to chronic alcohol consumption. This enhances the conversion of acetaminophen into toxic NAPQI, further exacerbating liver damage. A decrease in P450 activity would actually reduce acetaminophen toxicity, making this an incorrect answer. (C) Increased liver blood flow – Incorrect. In cirrhosis, liver blood flow is typically reduced due to fibrosis and portal hypertension. Even if blood flow were increased, it would not directly contribute to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. The primary issue in cirrhotic patients is reduced glutathione availability, not altered blood flow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Treatment with acetylcysteine Acetylcysteine is used as an antidote for acetaminophen (paracetamol) toxicity because it replenishes glutathione stores, helping to detoxify the toxic metabolite NAPQI. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms—hyperventilation, dehydration, and metabolic acidosis—are more suggestive of salicylate (aspirin) overdose, not acetaminophen poisoning. Salicylate toxicity leads to initial respiratory alkalosis (due to hyperventilation), followed by metabolic acidosis. Since acetylcysteine has no role in salicylate poisoning, it would not be of therapeutic value in this scenario, making option (A) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (B) Alkalinization of urine – Incorrect. Alkalinization of the urine using intravenous sodium bicarbonate enhances the renal excretion of salicylates by increasing their ionized (water-soluble) form, preventing reabsorption in the renal tubules. This is a key treatment strategy in salicylate overdose, making it an important therapeutic approach. (C) Correction of metabolic acidosis – Incorrect. Salicylate poisoning leads to anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can cause serious complications like seizures, coma, and multi-organ failure. Treating the acidosis, often with IV sodium bicarbonate, is essential to stabilize the patient and prevent further toxicity. (D) Gastric lavage – Incorrect. Gastric lavage or activated charcoal is useful in cases of acute salicylate overdose, particularly if the patient presents within 1-2 hours of ingestion. It helps remove unabsorbed aspirin from the stomach, reducing systemic toxicity. However, it is not effective if too much time has passed since ingestion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Reye’s syndrome Aspirin is contraindicated in children, especially those with viral infections like influenza or varicella (chickenpox), due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Reye’s syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal condition that affects the liver and brain, leading to acute encephalopathy and hepatic dysfunction. The exact mechanism is unclear, but aspirin is thought to damage mitochondrial function in hepatocytes, causing fatty liver degeneration, hyperammonemia, and cerebral edema. Symptoms include vomiting, confusion, seizures, and coma. Due to this risk, paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen is preferred for fever management in children. Incorrect Options: (B) Gastric bleeding – Incorrect. Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which can lead to gastric mucosal injury and bleeding. However, the primary concern in children is Reye’s syndrome, not gastric bleeding. Gastric bleeding is a more common issue in adults with chronic aspirin use. (C) Thrombocytopenia – Incorrect. Aspirin acts as an antiplatelet agent by irreversibly inhibiting COX-1, which decreases thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis, impairing platelet aggregation. However, aspirin does not directly cause thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Instead, it reduces platelet function, leading to an increased risk of bleeding disorders, but this is not the primary reason aspirin is contraindicated in children. (D) Fanconi syndrome – Incorrect. Fanconi syndrome is a proximal renal tubule disorder that leads to the loss of glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and phosphate in urine. It is not related to aspirin use but can be caused by certain medications (e.g., expired tetracyclines), inherited disorders, or heavy metal toxicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Leukotrienes Aspirin-induced bronchospasm is due to the shunting of arachidonic acid metabolism toward the leukotriene pathway. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), blocking the production of prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). In susceptible individuals, this leads to a compensatory increase in leukotriene synthesis via the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway. Leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are potent bronchoconstrictors and play a major role in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which manifests as asthma, nasal polyps, and chronic rhinosinusitis. This is why aspirin can trigger severe shortness of breath (bronchospasm) in some patients. Incorrect Options: (A) Prostaglandin E – Incorrect. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has bronchodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. While aspirin inhibits PGE2 synthesis, the resulting increase in leukotrienes is the primary cause of bronchospasm. The reduction of PGE2 may contribute slightly, but it is not the main mechanism responsible for aspirin-induced asthma. (B) Thromboxane A2 – Incorrect. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is a vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator, playing a role in hemostasis and cardiovascular function. While aspirin inhibits TXA2, its absence does not contribute to bronchoconstriction. Instead, TXA2 inhibition helps reduce platelet aggregation, which is beneficial in conditions like cardiovascular disease. (C) Prostacyclin – Incorrect. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, produced mainly in endothelial cells. While aspirin reduces PGI2 levels, this does not contribute to bronchospasm. Instead, PGI2 reduction can have mild prothrombotic effects, but this is not related to respiratory symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Inhibition of thromboxane synthesis Aspirin plays a crucial role in the management of myocardial infarction (MI) due to its antiplatelet effect. It works by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, thereby blocking the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and promoter of platelet aggregation, both of which contribute to thrombus formation in coronary arteries. By inhibiting TXA2 production, aspirin prevents further platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of occlusive thrombus formation, which is critical in the acute phase of MI. This makes inhibition of thromboxane synthesis (option D) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Inhibition of cyclooxygenase – Incorrect. While aspirin does inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), this is a broader mechanism that affects both platelet function and prostaglandin synthesis. The key effect in MI prevention and treatment is specific inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthesis, not just general COX inhibition. (B) Decreased serum lipids – Incorrect. Aspirin has no significant effect on lipid levels. Drugs like statins (e.g., atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) are used to reduce serum lipids and lower cardiovascular risk, but this is not the primary mechanism by which aspirin benefits MI patients. (C) Thrombolytic action – Incorrect. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent, not a thrombolytic. Thrombolytic drugs like streptokinase, alteplase (tPA), and reteplase work by breaking down existing clots through activation of plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades fibrin clots. Aspirin, on the other hand, prevents new clot formation but does not dissolve existing clots.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Less likely to cause gastric ulcer and their complications Rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, whereas indomethacin is a non-selective COX inhibitor (inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for producing gastroprotective prostaglandins, which help maintain the gastric mucosal barrier. Since rofecoxib selectively inhibits COX-2 while sparing COX-1, it has a lower risk of causing gastric ulcers and gastrointestinal (GI) complications compared to indomethacin. This makes option (C) the correct answer because rofecoxib is less likely to cause gastric ulcers and related complications than indomethacin. Incorrect Options: (A) Likely to be more effective in rheumatoid arthritis – Incorrect. Both rofecoxib and indomethacin are effective in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but COX-2 inhibitors like rofecoxib primarily offer better gastrointestinal safety, not necessarily higher efficacy. Indomethacin, a potent non-selective NSAID, is also effective in inflammatory conditions like RA. Therefore, rofecoxib is not necessarily more effective in RA. (B) Not likely to produce renal complications – Incorrect. While COX-2 inhibitors like rofecoxib reduce gastric toxicity, they do not prevent renal complications. COX-2 plays a role in kidney function, particularly in maintaining renal blood flow. Inhibition of COX-2 can still lead to fluid retention, hypertension, and acute kidney injury, similar to non-selective NSAIDs like indomethacin. Therefore, rofecoxib is not entirely free from renal complications. (D) All of the above – Incorrect. Since A and B are incorrect, option D is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Indomethacin Indomethacin is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used for its strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, it is not suitable for a truck driver because it has significant central nervous system (CNS) side effects, including dizziness, headache, confusion, and drowsiness. These effects can impair alertness and coordination, which are critical for someone operating heavy machinery like a truck. Given the risk of drowsiness and cognitive impairment, indomethacin should be avoided in this patient. Incorrect Options: (A) Celecoxib – Incorrect. Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor with a lower risk of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. It does not significantly affect CNS function, making it a safer choice for a truck driver. (B) Naproxen – Incorrect. Naproxen is a non-selective NSAID, but it has a lower risk of CNS side effects compared to indomethacin. While it can cause gastric irritation, it does not impair alertness as much as indomethacin. It is a reasonable choice for pain relief in a truck driver. (C) Diclofenac sodium – Incorrect. Diclofenac is another non-selective NSAID, but it has less CNS toxicity than indomethacin. It is commonly used for musculoskeletal pain and soft tissue injuries and does not cause significant drowsiness, making it a better alternative.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hyperventilation Aspirin-induced hyperventilation is not mediated by prostaglandin inhibition. Instead, it occurs due to direct stimulation of the respiratory center in the medulla. At therapeutic doses, aspirin stimulates the respiratory center, leading to increased respiratory rate (hyperventilation) and mild respiratory alkalosis. At toxic doses (salicylate poisoning), aspirin causes metabolic acidosis and compensatory hyperventilation. Since this effect is independent of prostaglandin inhibition, option A is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (B) Analgesia – Incorrect. Aspirin relieves pain by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), which reduces prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors to inflammatory mediators like bradykinin. By decreasing prostaglandin levels, aspirin reduces pain perception, making this effect prostaglandin-mediated. (C) Closure of patent ductus arteriosus – Incorrect. The ductus arteriosus remains open in fetal life due to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which maintains vasodilation. After birth, a natural decline in prostaglandins leads to duct closure. Aspirin (along with indomethacin) inhibits COX, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and promoting ductus arteriosus closure. This action is mediated by prostaglandin inhibition. (D) Bleeding tendency – Incorrect. Aspirin inhibits thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis in platelets by irreversibly inhibiting COX-1. TXA2 promotes platelet aggregation, so its inhibition leads to reduced clot formation and increased bleeding tendency. Since thromboxane is a prostaglandin derivative, this effect is mediated by prostaglandin inhibition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Prolongation of prothrombin time Prostanglandin synthesis inhibitors (such as NSAIDs and aspirin) do not directly affect prothrombin time (PT). Prothrombin time is a measure of extrinsic coagulation pathway function, which depends on clotting factors (such as factor VII, factor X, prothrombin, and fibrinogen) synthesized in the liver. These factors are vitamin K-dependent, and their levels are primarily altered by drugs like warfarin (which inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase), not by NSAIDs. Since NSAIDs do not interfere with coagulation factor synthesis or vitamin K metabolism, they do not significantly prolong PT, making option (D) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Prolongation of bleeding time – Incorrect. NSAIDs (especially aspirin) irreversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, which prevents the formation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a key promoter of platelet aggregation. Since platelets cannot synthesize new COX-1, this results in impaired clot formation and prolonged bleeding time. Thus, this effect is mediated by prostaglandin inhibition. (B) Prolongation of labour – Incorrect. Prostaglandins (especially PGE2 and PGF2?) play a crucial role in stimulating uterine contractions and cervical ripening during labor. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (e.g., NSAIDs) reduce uterine contractions, leading to prolonged labor. This is why NSAIDs, particularly indomethacin, are sometimes used to delay preterm labor. (C) Gastric mucosal damage – Incorrect. Prostaglandins (especially PGE2 and PGI2) protect the gastric mucosa by stimulating mucus and bicarbonate secretion, maintaining mucosal blood flow, and inhibiting gastric acid secretion. By inhibiting COX-1, NSAIDs reduce protective prostaglandins, increasing the risk of gastric ulceration and mucosal damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Platelets cannot synthesize fresh COX molecules Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, preventing the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is essential for platelet aggregation. Since platelets are anucleate cells (lack a nucleus), they cannot synthesize new proteins, including COX-1. This means that once COX-1 is inhibited, the effect lasts for the entire lifespan of the platelet (7–10 days), leading to a prolonged reduction in platelet function. This unique irreversible inhibition explains why low-dose aspirin is effective in preventing thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Incorrect Options: (A) Platelets contain low quantity of COX – Incorrect. Platelets do have COX-1, which is essential for thromboxane A2 production and normal hemostasis. The effect of aspirin is due to irreversible inhibition rather than the quantity of COX present. (B) Platelets bind aspirin with high affinity – Incorrect. While aspirin irreversibly acetylates COX-1, its effect is not due to high-affinity binding but rather its ability to covalently modify the enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. (C) Platelet COX is inducible – Incorrect. Unlike COX-2, which is an inducible enzyme (activated in response to inflammation), COX-1 in platelets is constitutively expressed and not inducible. Aspirin’s action is due to its permanent inhibition of COX-1, not because platelet COX can be upregulated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Prednisolone Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid that exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting phospholipase A2 (PLA2). It does this by inducing the synthesis of lipocortins (annexins), which inhibit PLA2, the enzyme responsible for breaking down membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid. Since arachidonic acid is the precursor for prostaglandins and leukotrienes, inhibiting PLA2 leads to a reduction in both inflammatory mediators, making prednisolone a powerful anti-inflammatory drug. This mechanism differentiates corticosteroids from NSAIDs, which act further downstream by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Incorrect Options: (A) Alprostadil – Incorrect. Alprostadil is a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog, which means it mimics the effects of prostaglandins rather than inhibiting their production. It is used in conditions like erectile dysfunction and maintaining the patency of the ductus arteriosus in newborns. Since it does not inhibit phospholipase A2, it is not the correct answer. (C) Aspirin – Incorrect. Aspirin is a non-selective COX inhibitor, meaning it inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, thereby preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and thromboxanes. However, aspirin does not inhibit phospholipase A2, which is responsible for releasing arachidonic acid in the first place. (D) Ibuprofen – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) LTC4 Slow Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis (SRS-A) is a mixture of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4). These leukotrienes are potent mediators of bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and mucus secretion, making them crucial in asthma and anaphylaxis. LTC4 is the precursor of LTD4 and LTE4, and together, they contribute to the prolonged smooth muscle contraction observed in anaphylaxis and allergic reactions. Since LTC4 is a key component of SRS-A, it is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) LTB4 – Incorrect. While LTB4 is a leukotriene, it is not part of SRS-A. Instead, LTB4 is a strong chemoattractant that recruits neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to sites of inflammation. It plays a significant role in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory responses, but not in anaphylaxis. (B) Misoprostol – Incorrect. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog used for gastric cytoprotection (preventing NSAID-induced ulcers), inducing labor, and managing postpartum hemorrhage. Since it is not a leukotriene, it has no role in SRS-A or anaphylaxis. (C) Prostacyclin (PGI2) – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ibuprofen Ibuprofen is a non-selective NSAID that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) reversibly. This reversible inhibition of platelet COX-1 leads to a temporary reduction in thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis, which is responsible for platelet aggregation. However, because the inhibition is reversible, normal platelet function resumes once the drug is cleared from the body, typically within a few hours. This makes ibuprofen different from aspirin, which causes irreversible COX inhibition. Incorrect Options: (B) Alprostadil – Incorrect. Alprostadil is a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog, not a COX inhibitor. It is primarily used for vasodilation, particularly in conditions like erectile dysfunction and maintaining the ductus arteriosus in newborns. Since it does not inhibit platelet COX, it is not relevant to the question. (C) Aspirin – Incorrect. Unlike ibuprofen, aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1 by acetylating the enzyme, leading to permanent suppression of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis. Since platelets lack a nucleus, they cannot synthesize new COX enzymes, meaning the effect lasts for the entire lifespan of the platelet (7–10 days). This irreversible inhibition is what makes aspirin effective in cardiovascular prevention, but it also means it is not the correct answer for reversible COX inhibition. (D) Prednisolone – Incorrect. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid that does not directly inhibit COX enzymes. Instead, it exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inducing lipocortins, which inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby reducing the release of arachidonic acid (the precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nimesulide Nimesulide is a selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAID with additional pharmacological properties, including the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix components and contribute to cartilage destruction in conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Nimesulide reduces MMP expression and prevents collagen breakdown, thereby offering chondroprotective effects in addition to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions. This property differentiates nimesulide from other traditional NSAIDs. Incorrect Options: (A) Naproxen – Naproxen is a non-selective COX inhibitor (both COX-1 and COX-2) and does not significantly inhibit metalloproteinases. Its primary action is through prostaglandin inhibition, which reduces inflammation and pain. (B) Nabumetone – Nabumetone is a prodrug that gets converted into an active COX-2 selective metabolite but does not possess metalloproteinase inhibitory activity. It mainly provides anti-inflammatory and analgesic benefits without affecting MMP activity. (C) Diclofenac – Diclofenac is another non-selective NSAID that primarily acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. While it has some additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it does not have a significant inhibitory effect on metalloproteinases. Since nimesulide uniquely inhibits metalloproteinase activity, the correct answer is (D) Nimesulide.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ketoprofen Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that belongs to the propionic acid class. It has a dual mechanism of action: (1) inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) to reduce prostaglandin synthesis, and (2) inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX), leading to decreased leukotriene production. This dual inhibition provides enhanced anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, ketoprofen stabilizes lysosomal membranes, preventing the release of degradative enzymes that contribute to inflammation and tissue damage. These properties make ketoprofen effective in treating pain, inflammation, and conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Incorrect Options: (A) Diclofenac: Diclofenac is a potent COX inhibitor, primarily acting on COX-2, with additional activity in inhibiting prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. However, it does not significantly inhibit LOX or stabilize lysosomal membranes as effectively as ketoprofen. (C) Piroxicam: Piroxicam is an oxicam-class NSAID that primarily inhibits COX enzymes but does not have a significant effect on LOX. While it has a long half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing, it lacks the lysosomal stabilization properties of ketoprofen.

It has a very high COX-2 selectivity index, meaning it preferentially inhibits COX-2 while sparing COX-1, reducing the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with non-selective NSAIDs. Due to its strong COX-2 inhibition, etoricoxib provides potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects, making it useful in conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and gouty arthritis. However, like other highly selective COX-2 inhibitors, it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke. Incorrect Options: (B) Valdecoxib: Valdecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, but its COX-2 selectivity is lower than that of etoricoxib. It was previously used for pain management but was withdrawn from the market due to concerns over serious cardiovascular and skin-related adverse effects, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. (C) Rofecoxib: Rofecoxib is another COX-2 selective inhibitor, but its selectivity is lower than that of etoricoxib. It was withdrawn from the market due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which were observed in clinical trials. (D) Celecoxib: Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, but its COX-2 selectivity is the lowest among the options provided. It is still widely used for conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as it has a better cardiovascular safety profile compared to other COX-2 inhibitors.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ketorolac Ketorolac is an NSAID that is non-selective for COX enzymes, meaning it inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 without preference. It is known for its potent analgesic effects, often comparable to opioids, making it widely used for short-term management of moderate to severe pain (e.g., post-surgical pain). However, because it strongly inhibits COX-1, it is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) irritation, ulceration, and bleeding, as well as effects on renal function. Due to these risks, ketorolac is usually not recommended for long-term use and is often limited to a maximum of 5 days for pain relief. Incorrect Options: (A) Etodolac: Etodolac is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, meaning it inhibits COX-2 more than COX-1, but not as selectively as coxibs (e.g., celecoxib). It has lower GI toxicity compared to non-selective NSAIDs like ketorolac and is commonly used for treating osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. (B) Nimesulide: Nimesulide is another preferential COX-2 inhibitor with greater selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. It has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects but has been restricted or banned in several countries due to concerns over hepatotoxicity. (C) Meloxicam: Meloxicam is also a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, meaning it inhibits COX-2 more than COX-1 but retains some COX-1 activity. It is commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and has a lower incidence of GI side effects compared to fully non-selective NSAIDs.

Prostaglandins, particularly PGE? and PGF??, play a key role in the pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea by increasing uterine contractility and reducing blood flow, leading to cramping and pain. By blocking prostaglandin production, ibuprofen effectively relieves menstrual cramps and pain. It is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for dysmenorrhea due to its efficacy, rapid onset of action, and relatively mild side effects when taken at recommended doses. Incorrect Options: (B) Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an analgesic and antipyretic, but it does not have strong anti-inflammatory effects because it weakly inhibits COX enzymes in peripheral tissues. While it can provide some pain relief, it is not as effective as NSAIDs like ibuprofen for menstrual cramps because it does not significantly reduce prostaglandin synthesis in the uterus. (C) Aspirin: Aspirin is also an NSAID that inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, thereby reducing prostaglandin production. However, it is not the preferred NSAID for dysmenorrhea due to its increased risk of gastrointestinal irritation, bleeding, and longer-lasting effects on platelet function. Additionally, other NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen are more effective for menstrual pain relief. (D) Naproxen: Naproxen is another NSAID that effectively inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and is used for dysmenorrhea. However, compared to ibuprofen, naproxen has a longer half-life, meaning it lasts longer but may take more time to achieve peak pain relief. While it is a good alternative, ibuprofen is often preferred for its faster onset of action and better tolerability in many patients.",

Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that play a crucial role in asthma pathogenesis, leading to airway narrowing and increased mucus secretion. Montelukast is commonly used as an add-on therapy in patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and exercise-induced bronchospasm. It is particularly useful in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), where leukotriene overproduction leads to severe asthma symptoms. Incorrect Options: (B) Zileuton: Zileuton is a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, which prevents the synthesis of leukotrienes rather than blocking their receptors. While it is also used in asthma management, it is less commonly prescribed than montelukast due to its potential hepatotoxicity and the need for liver function monitoring. (C) Prednisone: Prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that exerts broad anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting multiple inflammatory pathways, including leukotriene synthesis. While effective for severe asthma exacerbations, it is not a leukotriene receptor blocker and has significant long-term side effects, such as osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, and adrenal suppression. (D) Salmeterol: Salmeterol is a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that promotes bronchodilation by stimulating β2 receptors in the airway smooth muscle.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Epinephrine Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis because it is a non-selective adrenergic agonist that stimulates α and β receptors. It has multiple beneficial effects in anaphylaxis: α1 receptor activation → Vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure, reduces airway swelling, and prevents further vascular leakage (which leads to hypotension and shock). β1 receptor activation β Increases heart rate and cardiac output, counteracting anaphylactic shock. β2 receptor activation β Bronchodilation, which helps relieve airway constriction and improves breathing. Inhibits mast cell degranulation, reducing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Because of these combined effects, intramuscular epinephrine (IM, preferably in the anterolateral thigh) is the drug of choice for anaphylaxis. Incorrect Options: (A) Norepinephrine: Norepinephrine primarily stimulates α1 and β1 receptors, leading to vasoconstriction and increased heart rate, but it lacks significant β2 agonist activity, meaning it does not provide bronchodilation. This makes it less effective in treating the airway constriction seen in anaphylaxis. It is mainly used in septic and cardiogenic shock, rather than anaphylaxis. (C) Isoproterenol: Isoproterenol is a non-selective β-agonist (stimulates β1 and β2 receptors). While it causes bronchodilation (β2 effect) and increases heart rate (β1 effect), it does not activate α1 receptors. This means it lacks the vasoconstrictive action needed to counteract hypotension and vascular leakage, making it ineffective for anaphylaxis. (D) Dopamine: Dopamine primarily acts on dopaminergic receptors (D1, D2) at low doses and β1 receptors at moderate doses. At high doses, it activates α1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction. However, it is not a reliable bronchodilator and does not provide the necessary rapid action required to treat anaphylaxis effectively. It is typically used in shock and heart failure, not for allergic reactions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Celecoxib Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that reduces pain and inflammation by specifically inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is responsible for the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. In osteoarthritis, chronic inflammation leads to joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Celecoxib is an effective NSAID for managing chronic pain and inflammation while minimizing gastrointestinal (GI) side effects because: It selectively inhibits COX-2 while sparing COX-1, which plays a role in gastric mucosal protection. Unlike non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen), celecoxib has a lower risk of GI ulcers and bleeding. It provides long-term pain relief with fewer GI complications, making it a preferred option for chronic pain conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Incorrect Options: (A) Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic that works centrally (primarily in the brain) rather than by inhibiting peripheral COX enzymes. It is not an anti-inflammatory agent, so it does not reduce inflammation in osteoarthritis. While it is sometimes used for mild osteoarthritis pain, it is less effective than NSAIDs like celecoxib for controlling inflammatory pain. (B) Aspirin: Aspirin is a non-selective COX inhibitor, meaning it inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. While it is effective in reducing pain and inflammation, long-term use can lead to gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding, and kidney toxicity, making it less favorable for chronic osteoarthritis treatment. (C) Gabapentin: Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant and neuropathic pain modulator that does not inhibit COX enzymes. It is used for neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia) but is not effective for inflammatory pain associated with osteoarthritis.",
