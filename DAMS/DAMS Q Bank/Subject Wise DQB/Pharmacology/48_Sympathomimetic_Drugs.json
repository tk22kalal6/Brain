      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cocaine. Cocaine is a potent inhibitor of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) reuptake into presynaptic nerve terminals. It blocks the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter (SERT), leading to an increase in synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters and prolonged stimulation of postsynaptic receptors. Additionally, cocaine also blocks voltage-gated sodium (Na?) channels in the axonal membrane, which leads to local anesthetic effects. This property makes it unique among stimulant drugs, as it can be used clinically as a local anesthetic in certain procedures (e.g., ophthalmology and ENT surgeries). Thus, due to its dual action as a reuptake inhibitor and sodium channel blocker, cocaine is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Ephedrine – Incorrect. Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug that acts by increasing norepinephrine release from presynaptic nerve terminals rather than blocking its reuptake. It does not significantly block dopamine reuptake or sodium channels. Hence, this option is incorrect. (B) Imipramine – Incorrect. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, but not dopamine to a significant extent. While TCAs can have some Na? channel-blocking effects, these are not as strong as those seen with cocaine. Imipramine also has strong anticholinergic and antihistaminic properties, which cocaine lacks. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (C) Fluoxetine – Incorrect. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that primarily blocks serotonin reuptake (SERT) but does not significantly affect dopamine or norepinephrine transporters. Additionally, fluoxetine does not block sodium channels, making it distinct from cocaine. Thus, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Asthma. ??-selective agonists are primarily used in the treatment of asthma because they cause bronchodilation by activating ??-adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscles. This leads to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which relaxes bronchial smooth muscles and improves airflow. These drugs are widely used in both acute asthma exacerbations (short-acting ?? agonists like albuterol/salbutamol) and long-term control (long-acting ?? agonists like salmeterol and formoterol). Thus, ?? agonists are highly effective in asthma treatment, making option (C) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Angina due to coronary insufficiency – Incorrect. ?? agonists are not used for angina because they increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand due to reflex tachycardia, which can worsen angina rather than improve it. Instead, ?-blockers (like atenolol or metoprolol) are commonly used for angina. (B) Delayed labor – Incorrect. While ?? agonists (such as ritodrine and terbutaline) were once used to delay preterm labor (tocolysis), their use has declined due to concerns about maternal cardiovascular side effects (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension). They are not the primary treatment for preterm labor anymore, as other drugs like nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) and atosiban (an oxytocin receptor antagonist) are preferred. (D) All the above – Incorrect. Since ?? agonists are not effective for angina and are no longer preferred for delayed labor, the \"all of the above\" option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Nasal decongestants commonly contain α-adrenergic agonists such as phenylephrine, oxymetazoline, or pseudoephedrine. These drugs stimulate α1-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasoconstriction, which reduces nasal congestion by decreasing blood flow to nasal mucosa. However, excessive ingestion can cause systemic adrenergic effects, including both α and β receptor activation. The possible signs of adrenergic activation in this child may include: (A) Tachycardia – β1 receptor activation in the heart leads to increased heart rate. Additionally, reflex tachycardia may occur due to α1-mediated vasoconstriction. (B) Vasodilation – Though α1 activation initially causes vasoconstriction, β2 activation can lead to vasodilation in skeletal muscles, potentially causing a mixed response. (C) Dilation of pupil (Mydriasis) – α1 activation leads to contraction of the radial muscle in the iris, causing pupil dilation (mydriasis). Since all these signs can be present after excessive ingestion of an adrenergic agonist, option (D) \"All of the above\" is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Tachycardia – Partially Correct, but not the most complete answer. Adrenergic agonists, especially those affecting β1 receptors, can lead to tachycardia, but other symptoms like pupil dilation and vasodilation are also prominent. (B) Vasodilation – Partially Correct. While β2 activation can cause vasodilation, α1 activation causes vasoconstriction. However, due to mixed adrenergic effects, vasodilation may be observed in some vascular beds. (C) Dilation of pupil – Partially Correct. Mydriasis is caused by α1 receptor activation, leading to contraction of the radial muscles of the iris. However, it is not the only sign observed in adrenergic toxicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Secondary shock. Secondary shock refers to a state of shock that occurs due to prolonged hypoperfusion and cellular damage, often following an initial insult such as hemorrhage, trauma, or infection. In secondary shock, the body's compensatory mechanisms fail, leading to widespread vasodilation, loss of vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, and metabolic derangements. In this stage, the vascular system becomes unresponsive to vasoconstrictors, so administering them is ineffective or even harmful. Instead, treatment focuses on fluid resuscitation, correcting metabolic imbalances, and addressing the underlying cause. Vasoconstrictors (like norepinephrine or dopamine) may worsen tissue perfusion if vascular collapse has already set in. Thus, secondary shock is the condition where vasoconstrictors are generally avoided, making option (D) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Neurogenic shock – Incorrect. Neurogenic shock occurs due to loss of sympathetic tone (e.g., spinal cord injury), leading to severe hypotension and bradycardia. Vasoconstrictors (such as norepinephrine) are actually useful in neurogenic shock to restore vascular tone and maintain blood pressure. (B) Hemorrhagic shock – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic shock results from severe blood loss leading to hypotension, tachycardia, and reduced organ perfusion. Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion are the primary treatments, but vasoconstrictors may be used as supportive therapy in severe cases. (C) Hypotension due to spinal anesthesia – Incorrect. Spinal anesthesia can block sympathetic outflow, leading to vasodilation and hypotension. Vasoconstrictors such as ephedrine or phenylephrine are often used to counteract the hypotension, making this answer incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dopamine. Dopamine is a dose-dependent adrenergic and dopaminergic agonist that activates multiple receptors, including dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors, alpha-adrenergic receptors, and beta1-adrenergic receptors, but not beta2 receptors. At low doses, dopamine predominantly stimulates D1 receptors in the renal and mesenteric vasculature, leading to vasodilation and increased renal perfusion. At moderate doses, dopamine stimulates beta1 receptors, increasing heart rate and myocardial contractility, making it useful in heart failure and shock. At high doses, dopamine stimulates alpha receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. It does not activate beta2 receptors, meaning it does not promote vasodilation in skeletal muscle or bronchodilation. Thus, dopamine’s receptor profile perfectly matches the description in the question, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Dobutamine – Incorrect. Dobutamine is a selective beta1 agonist with minimal action on D1, D2, and alpha receptors. It primarily increases myocardial contractility with minimal effects on vascular tone. Unlike dopamine, dobutamine does not significantly affect renal perfusion or vasoconstriction. (B) Methoxamine – Incorrect. Methoxamine is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that causes vasoconstriction and increases blood pressure. It does not activate dopamine receptors (D1, D2) or beta1 receptors, making it an incorrect choice. (C) Phenylephrine – Incorrect. Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist with no effects on dopamine (D1, D2) or beta1 receptors. It is used for vasoconstriction and increasing blood pressure, often in conditions like hypotension and nasal congestion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ephedrine. Ephedrine is the only non-catecholamine sympathomimetic drug among the options given. It is classified as a non-catecholamine indirect and direct sympathomimetic agent. Unlike catecholamines, ephedrine lacks a catechol (benzene with two hydroxyl groups) structure, making it more resistant to metabolism by COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) and MAO (monoamine oxidase). Due to this, ephedrine has a longer duration of action compared to catecholamines like adrenaline and dopamine. It acts by both direct stimulation of adrenergic receptors (alpha and beta) and indirect release of stored norepinephrine. It is used clinically for nasal decongestion, hypotension, and as a bronchodilator. Thus, ephedrine is a non-catecholamine sympathomimetic drug, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Adrenaline – Incorrect. Adrenaline (epinephrine) is a catecholamine as it contains a catechol group. It acts as a potent agonist of alpha and beta receptors and is rapidly metabolized by COMT and MAO, leading to a short duration of action. (B) Dopamine – Incorrect. Dopamine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter and sympathomimetic agent. It is a precursor to noradrenaline and adrenaline and has a catechol group, classifying it as a catecholamine. Dopamine is quickly degraded by COMT and MAO, leading to a short half-life. (C) Isoprenaline – Incorrect. Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) is a synthetic catecholamine and a beta-selective sympathomimetic agent. It has a catechol structure, making it susceptible to COMT metabolism and giving it a short duration of action.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tamsulosin. Tamsulosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, is commonly used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to relieve urinary symptoms. One of its known side effects is its effect on the pupillary dilator muscle, leading to floppy iris syndrome (IFIS). In this condition, the iris becomes floppy and may prolapse during cataract surgery, leading to difficulty maintaining pupil dilation and an increased risk of surgical complications such as iris prolapse, poor visibility, and endophthalmitis. The progressive intraoperative constriction of the pupil despite the use of mydriatic eye drops and the iris prolapse through the surgical wound in this patient strongly suggests that tamsulosin is the likely cause of these complications. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Rosuvastatin – Incorrect. Rosuvastatin is a statin, used for lowering cholesterol levels and reducing cardiovascular risk. Statins primarily work on lipid metabolism and do not directly affect the iris or the eye muscles. They are not known to be associated with cataract surgery complications like iris prolapse or endophthalmitis. Therefore, rosuvastatin is not likely to be the cause of the complications described in this case. (B) Enalapril – Incorrect. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for managing hypertension and heart failure. ACE inhibitors primarily act on the renin-angiotensin system to reduce blood pressure. While they can cause side effects like hyperkalemia or cough, they are not associated with floppy iris syndrome or complications related to pupil constriction during cataract surgery. Thus, enalapril is unlikely to be the cause of the issue. (C) Glimepiride – Incorrect. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea used to lower blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. While it can lead to hypoglycemia as a side effect, it does not have any direct effects on the iris or pupil muscles. Therefore, glimepiride is not the likely culprit in causing the iris prolapse and subsequent complications observed in this patient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Urinary Retention Explanation for the Correct Answer: Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug that primarily acts as an α-adrenergic agonist with some α-adrenergic activity. It is commonly used as a nasal decongestant due to its ability to cause vasoconstriction of nasal blood vessels, reducing nasal congestion. However, its α-adrenergic effects can also cause smooth muscle contraction in the bladder neck and prostate, leading to urinary retention, especially in older men or those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Mechanism of urinary retention with pseudoephedrine: Stimulation of α1 receptors in the bladder neck and prostate causes smooth muscle contraction, leading to difficulty in urination. This effect is more pronounced in older men who may already have some degree of prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction. Given that this 61-year-old man is taking pseudoephedrine for cold symptoms, he should be concerned about urinary retention, particularly if he has a history of BPH or difficulty urinating. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: (B) Constriction of the bronchioles causing increased pulmonary secretions Pseudoephedrine has some α-adrenergic activity, which actually leads to bronchodilation rather than bronchoconstriction. It does not increase pulmonary secretions but rather reduces secretions in the nasal mucosa due to its decongestant effects. This option is incorrect because pseudoephedrine does not cause bronchoconstriction or increased pulmonary secretions. (C) Erectile function improvement Pseudoephedrine is a vasoconstrictor due to its α1 agonist activity, which can actually impair erectile function rather than improve it. Erection requires vasodilation (mediated by nitric oxide and parasympathetic activity), but pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction, potentially worsening erectile dysfunction. Therefore, pseudoephedrine would not improve erectile function but could instead worsen it. (D) Thinning of his salivary glandular secretions While pseudoephedrine reduces nasal secretions, it does so by vasoconstriction of nasal blood vessels rather than by directly affecting salivary glands. Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine) are more likely to cause dry mouth and reduced salivary secretions, whereas pseudoephedrine does not significantly affect saliva production.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Epinephrine because it is a potent α-adrenergic agonist that activates both α1 and α2 receptors. Epinephrine binds to α-receptors with high affinity, leading to vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, and reduced blood flow to non-essential tissues. This property makes epinephrine crucial in physiological responses such as the fight-or-flight reaction, where rapid cardiovascular adjustments are needed. Additionally, epinephrine is widely used in medical settings for anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and vasopressor support due to its strong receptor activation. Incorrect Options: (A) Acetylcholine – Incorrect because acetylcholine is a cholinergic agonist, not an adrenergic agonist. It primarily acts on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, not α-adrenergic receptors, making it irrelevant for this question. (C) Isoproterenol – Incorrect because isoproterenol is a β-adrenergic agonist, with high selectivity for β1 and β2 receptors, rather than α-receptors. It primarily induces vasodilation and increases heart rate, rather than causing the vasoconstriction associated with α-receptor activation. (D) Metanephrine – Incorrect because metanephrine is a metabolite of epinephrine, rather than a direct adrenergic agonist. While it has some adrenergic activity, it is significantly weaker in potency compared to epinephrine at α-receptors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypertension Explanation for the Correct Answer: Phenylephrine is a selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, meaning it primarily causes vasoconstriction. It is commonly used as a nasal decongestant because it reduces nasal mucosal swelling by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages. However, due to its systemic vasoconstrictive effects, it can also cause increased blood pressure (hypertension). Mechanism of Hypertension: Phenylephrine stimulates α1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle, leading to peripheral vasoconstriction. This increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which can raise blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure may trigger a reflex bradycardia as a compensatory response. This effect is more pronounced in elderly patients or those with preexisting hypertension. Because hypertension is a well-known adverse effect of phenylephrine, (D) is the correct answer. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: (A) Constipation Phenylephrine does not have significant effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Constipation is more commonly seen with opioids or drugs with anticholinergic effects (e.g., atropine). Since phenylephrine does not act on muscarinic receptors, constipation is not a typical side effect. (B) Diarrhea Phenylephrine primarily acts on blood vessels, not on the intestinal smooth muscle. Diarrhea is more commonly associated with drugs that increase GI motility, such as cholinergic agonists or certain antibiotics. Since phenylephrine causes vasoconstriction and not GI stimulation, it is unlikely to cause diarrhea. (C) Epistaxis Phenylephrine is used as a nasal decongestant due to its vasoconstrictive properties, which help reduce nasal swelling. While excessive use of nasal sprays containing phenylephrine may lead to rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa), it does not directly cause nosebleeds (epistaxis). Epistaxis is more commonly linked to nasal dryness, trauma, or excessive anticoagulation, rather than phenylephrine use.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Metanephrine Explanation for the Correct Answer: The patient presents with vague abdominal pain, headaches, sweating, and unintentional weight loss, along with elevated catecholamine metabolites in the urine, which suggests a catecholamine-secreting tumor, such as pheochromocytoma. Catecholamine Metabolism: Epinephrine is broken down into metanephrine by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Metanephrine is further metabolized into vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) by monoamine oxidase (MAO). Therefore, the presence of metanephrine in the urine is specific for epinephrine metabolism and is often used in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Increased metanephrines in the urine suggest excess epinephrine production, which is characteristic of adrenal medullary tumors. Thus, metanephrine is the correct answer because it is a direct metabolite of epinephrine and serves as a key diagnostic marker in pheochromocytoma. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: (A) Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) – Incorrect DOPA is a precursor to dopamine, not a metabolite of epinephrine. Tyrosine is first converted into DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting step in catecholamine synthesis. DOPA is then converted into dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase and eventually metabolized into norepinephrine and epinephrine. Since DOPA is an early precursor and not a direct breakdown product of epinephrine, it is incorrect. (B) Dihydroxymandelic Acid (DHMA) – Incorrect DHMA is a metabolite of norepinephrine, not epinephrine. Norepinephrine is first metabolized into DHMA by monoamine oxidase (MAO), which is then further converted into vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). Since the question asks specifically about epinephrine metabolism, DHMA is incorrect. (C) Homovanillic Acid (HVA) – Incorrect HVA is a breakdown product of dopamine, not epinephrine. Dopamine is metabolized into homovanillic acid by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). HVA is often measured in conditions like dopamine-secreting tumors (e.g., neuroblastoma). Since the patient has elevated catecholamines consistent with a pheochromocytoma (which primarily secretes norepinephrine and epinephrine), HVA is not relevant here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA. The rate-limiting step in the synthesis of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Tyrosine hydroxylase is the key regulatory enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, and its activity is tightly controlled through feedback inhibition by noradrenaline. This step requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor and is the slowest step in the pathway, making it rate-limiting. Once L-DOPA is formed, the subsequent steps occur more rapidly, leading to the production of dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. Thus, the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA is the rate-limiting step in noradrenaline synthesis, making option (A) correct. Incorrect Options: (B) Conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine – Incorrect. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase). This reaction occurs rapidly and is not rate-limiting. (C) Conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline – Incorrect. This step is catalyzed by dopamine ?-hydroxylase and occurs within the synaptic vesicles. It is not the slowest step in the pathway and thus not rate-limiting. (D) Conversion of noradrenaline to adrenaline – Incorrect. This step is catalyzed by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), which is primarily present in the adrenal medulla. It is not a rate-limiting step, as noradrenaline is already synthesized by this stage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dobutamine. Dobutamine is a selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist that is primarily used in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. It works by increasing myocardial contractility and cardiac output without significantly affecting heart rate or peripheral resistance. Mechanism of action: Dobutamine selectively stimulates beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading to increased intracellular cAMP, which enhances calcium influx into cardiac myocytes. This results in increased contractility (positive inotropic effect) and stroke volume, which is beneficial in heart failure. Clinical Use: Dobutamine is commonly used in conditions like acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and stress echocardiography due to its strong inotropic effects. Thus, dobutamine is the preferred beta-1 agonist for improving cardiac output in chronic heart failure, making option (A) correct. Incorrect Options: (B) Albuterol – Incorrect. Albuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is primarily used as a bronchodilator in conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It does not have significant beta-1 agonist activity and does not improve cardiac output. (C) Isoproterenol – Incorrect. Isoproterenol is a non-selective beta agonist that stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. While it can increase heart rate and contractility (beta-1 effect), it also causes vasodilation (beta-2 effect), which can lead to hypotension. Because of its vasodilatory properties, it is not ideal for treating chronic heart failure. (D) Epinephrine – Incorrect. Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist that stimulates alpha and beta receptors. While it increases cardiac output (beta-1 effect), it also increases vasoconstriction (alpha-1 effect), which can raise afterload—a factor that is not desirable in chronic heart failure. Epinephrine is typically used in anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and severe hypotension, but not as a long-term treatment for heart failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Epinephrine. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylactic shock because it acts as a non-selective adrenergic agonist, stimulating alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. This makes it highly effective in counteracting the severe hypotension, bronchoconstriction, and widespread vasodilation associated with anaphylaxis. Alpha-1 receptor activation: Causes vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure and reducing swelling in the airways. Beta-1 receptor activation: Increases heart rate and cardiac output, helping to maintain circulation. Beta-2 receptor activation: Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation, which relieves respiratory distress. Because anaphylactic shock involves severe hypotension, airway obstruction, and cardiovascular collapse, epinephrine is the drug of choice to rapidly reverse these life-threatening symptoms. Incorrect Options: (A) Diphenhydramine – Incorrect. Diphenhydramine is an H1 antihistamine, used as an adjunctive treatment in anaphylaxis. It blocks histamine-mediated effects like urticaria and angioedema but does not act fast enough to treat the life-threatening cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms of anaphylactic shock. (C) Albuterol – Incorrect. Albuterol is a selective beta-2 agonist that is used for bronchospasm relief in asthma and COPD. While it can help with bronchoconstriction, it does not treat hypotension or cardiovascular collapse, which are critical in anaphylaxis. (D) Norepinephrine – Incorrect. Norepinephrine is a potent alpha-1 and beta-1 agonist but has little beta-2 activity. It is mainly used for septic shock and hypotension, but it does not provide bronchodilation, making it less effective than epinephrine in anaphylaxis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Phentermine-topiramate. Phentermine-topiramate is a centrally acting weight-loss medication that works by suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure. Phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine, stimulates the release of norepinephrine, which can lead to increased heart rate and blood pressure. Because this patient has a history of hypertension, phentermine-topiramate should be avoided as it can worsen hypertension and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Phentermine (a stimulant): Can cause vasoconstriction and increased sympathetic tone, leading to elevated blood pressure. Topiramate (an anticonvulsant): Promotes weight loss, but does not offset phentermine's hypertensive effects. Since hypertension is a contraindication, this drug is not suitable for the patient. Incorrect Options: (A) Liraglutide – Incorrect. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that promotes weight loss by reducing appetite and delaying gastric emptying. Unlike phentermine-topiramate, it does not cause significant increases in blood pressure and may even have cardiovascular benefits. Safe for hypertensive patients. (B) Orlistat – Incorrect. Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor that reduces fat absorption in the intestines. It has no effect on blood pressure and is safe for patients with hypertension. No central stimulant action. (D) Naltrexone/bupropion – Incorrect. This combination modulates reward pathways and appetite regulation in the brain. Bupropion, a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, can cause mild blood pressure increases, but less than phentermine. It should be used cautiously in hypertensive patients but is not as strongly contraindicated as phentermine-topiramate.",
