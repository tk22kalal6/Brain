      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Epigastric pain and bowel upset. Oral iron therapy, commonly prescribed for iron deficiency anemia, often leads to gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, which significantly affect patient compliance. The most common adverse effects include nausea, epigastric pain, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. These side effects occur because iron salts (such as ferrous sulfate) can irritate the gastric mucosa, leading to discomfort and digestive issues. The severity of these symptoms can cause patients to discontinue therapy prematurely, reducing treatment effectiveness. To mitigate these effects, iron supplements are sometimes taken with food, though this may reduce absorption. Alternatively, slow-release formulations or lower doses can be considered to improve tolerance. Incorrect Options: (A) Black stools: While iron supplementation commonly causes black or dark-colored stools due to unabsorbed iron being excreted, this is a benign and expected effect. Although it may cause concern for some patients, it does not significantly impact compliance compared to GI side effects like pain and bowel disturbances. (B) Staining of Teeth: This occurs mainly with liquid iron preparations, particularly in children. Though it can be cosmetically concerning, it is preventable by using a straw, rinsing the mouth after administration, or brushing teeth immediately after intake. It is not a major factor in non-compliance with oral iron therapy. (D) Metallic taste: Some patients report a metallic or unpleasant taste while taking iron supplements. This side effect, though undesirable, is not as severe as gastrointestinal distress and rarely leads to treatment discontinuation. Switching to a different formulation may help if taste intolerance is an issue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hemorrhagic stroke. Fibrinolytic drugs, such as alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase, are used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to dissolve thrombi and restore blood flow to the myocardium. However, their major adverse effect is bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to hemorrhagic stroke. This occurs due to excessive fibrinolysis, weakening the integrity of blood vessels and increasing the risk of spontaneous bleeding. The likelihood of hemorrhagic stroke is higher in elderly patients, those with uncontrolled hypertension, and those with a history of cerebrovascular disease. Because of this risk, fibrinolytic therapy is carefully considered against its benefits, and strict inclusion/exclusion criteria are used before administration. Incorrect Options: (B) Acute renal failure: While acute renal failure can occur in patients with myocardial infarction, it is not a direct adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy. Renal dysfunction is more commonly associated with contrast-induced nephropathy (from imaging studies like coronary angiography) or systemic hypotension leading to reduced renal perfusion. (C) Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction: Fibrinolytic drugs do not directly cause liver dysfunction or encephalitis. While liver disease can affect coagulation pathways, increasing bleeding risk, fibrinolytic agents primarily act on the fibrin clot and do not induce liver toxicity or encephalopathy. (D) Development of antiplatelet antibodies: Antiplatelet antibody formation is primarily associated with drugs like heparin, which can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Fibrinolytic agents act by breaking down fibrin and do not affect platelet antibody production. Therefore, this is not a likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Enalapril. Enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is used for hypertension and heart failure. It does not interfere with statin metabolism or muscle function, making it unlikely to exacerbate statin-induced myopathy. Unlike drugs that inhibit statin metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes or have direct myotoxic effects, enalapril does not affect muscle metabolism or increase statin-related side effects. In fact, ACE inhibitors may have some protective effects on skeletal muscle, reducing inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, enalapril does not contribute to an increased risk of statin-induced muscle toxicity. Incorrect Options: (A) Clofibrate: Clofibrate, a fibrate class drug, is used for lowering triglycerides. When combined with statins, fibrates significantly increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis due to overlapping effects on muscle metabolism. Both drug classes can disrupt muscle cell integrity and lead to increased muscle damage. (B) Nicotinic Acid: Also known as niacin, this lipid-lowering agent can enhance the risk of statin-induced myopathy. Niacin can cause muscle toxicity, especially when used in high doses with statins, due to its metabolic effects on lipid and energy pathways in muscle cells. (C) Erythromycin: Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, which is responsible for metabolizing many statins. This inhibition leads to increased statin plasma levels, heightening the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, erythromycin exacerbates statin-induced muscle toxicity by prolonging statin activity in the body.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Aprotinin. Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor that counteracts excessive fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin, the enzyme responsible for breaking down fibrin clots. Since streptokinase is a fibrinolytic agent that converts plasminogen to plasmin, excessive bleeding can occur due to the breakdown of fibrin clots. In this case, hematemesis (vomiting blood) suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, likely exacerbated by the thrombolytic effect of streptokinase. Aprotinin helps control bleeding by preventing fibrin degradation, stabilizing clots, and reducing hemorrhagic complications. Though not commonly used due to concerns about adverse effects, it remains an option in cases of severe fibrinolysis-related bleeding. Incorrect Options: (B) Noradrenaline: Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is a vasopressor that increases blood pressure and is sometimes used in shock management. However, it does not directly counteract fibrinolysis or stop bleeding caused by streptokinase. While it may help maintain hemodynamic stability in hemorrhagic shock, it does not address the underlying cause of bleeding in this case. (C) Vitamin K: Vitamin K is essential for synthesizing clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and is used to reverse warfarin-induced anticoagulation. However, it does not have a role in reversing fibrinolytic therapy, as streptokinase acts independently of vitamin K–dependent pathways. Therefore, it would not be effective in managing bleeding caused by streptokinase. (D) Rutin: Rutin is a flavonoid with mild vascular-protective and antioxidant properties, but it lacks a direct role in reversing fibrinolysis. While it may support capillary integrity, it is not an appropriate treatment for acute hemorrhagic complications caused by streptokinase.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Erythropoietin. Chronic renal insufficiency in children leads to reduced erythropoietin production by the kidneys, resulting in anemia. Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone essential for red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), erythropoietin deficiency leads to normocytic, normochromic anemia, which can cause fatigue, growth retardation, and developmental issues in children. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is administered to stimulate erythropoiesis, improving hemoglobin levels and reducing the need for blood transfusions. This therapy is essential for managing anemia in pediatric CKD patients, improving their quality of life and overall prognosis. Incorrect Options: (A) Cyanocobalamin: This is a synthetic form of vitamin B12, used to treat megaloblastic anemia caused by B12 deficiency. However, anemia in chronic renal insufficiency is not due to vitamin B12 deficiency but rather a lack of erythropoietin. Therefore, cyanocobalamin would not be the appropriate treatment. (B) Desferrioxamine: This is an iron-chelating agent used to manage iron overload in conditions like thalassemia or multiple blood transfusions. While CKD patients may sometimes receive blood transfusions, iron overload is not the primary concern in anemia of renal disease. Desferrioxamine does not address the root cause of anemia in CKD and is not the treatment of choice. (C) Filgrastim (G-CSF): Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to promote neutrophil production in conditions like chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Chronic renal insufficiency does not primarily cause neutropenia, so filgrastim is not relevant for anemia management in this setting.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hydroxyurea is a key drug used in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) due to its ability to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production, which reduces sickling of red blood cells and prevents vaso-occlusive crises. The primary mechanism by which hydroxyurea achieves this is by inhibiting DNA synthesis through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Ribonucleotide reductase is an essential enzyme that converts ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides, a crucial step in DNA synthesis. By blocking this enzyme, hydroxyurea induces stress on erythroid progenitor cells, leading to increased HbF production and improved red blood cell deformability. Additionally, hydroxyurea reduces inflammation, decreases white blood cell counts, and enhances nitric oxide levels, further contributing to its benefits in sickle cell disease. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A: Decreases nitric oxide (Incorrect) Hydroxyurea actually increases nitric oxide (NO) levels, not decreases them. It is thought to stimulate the release of NO by red blood cells, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow, which helps prevent vaso-occlusive crises in SCD patients. Option B: Increases neutrophil and monocytes (Incorrect) Hydroxyurea has the opposite effect; it reduces the number of neutrophils and monocytes. Since these white blood cells contribute to inflammation and vaso-occlusion in SCD, hydroxyurea’s ability to decrease them is beneficial in reducing disease complications. Option D: Inhibits DNA synthesis by acting as a ribonucleotide synthase inhibitor (Incorrect) Hydroxyurea does inhibit DNA synthesis, but it does so by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, not ribonucleotide synthase. The latter is not a known target of hydroxyurea, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Hydroxyurea can lead to hyperuricemia (elevated serum uric acid levels) as a result of its cytotoxic effects. As a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, hydroxyurea disrupts DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis (cell death), particularly in rapidly dividing cells. This leads to an increased turnover of nucleic acids, which results in the excessive breakdown of purines into uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. This effect is particularly significant in conditions like sickle cell disease or malignancies, where hydroxyurea is commonly used. The elevated uric acid levels may increase the risk of gout or urate nephropathy in predisposed individuals. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B: Hypouricemia (Incorrect) Hypouricemia, or low uric acid levels, would occur if a drug enhanced uric acid excretion or reduced purine metabolism. However, hydroxyurea does the opposite by increasing purine breakdown, leading to higher uric acid levels, making this option incorrect. Option C: Variable effect (Incorrect) While individual variations exist, the general and well-documented effect of hydroxyurea is hyperuricemia due to increased purine catabolism. The effect is not highly variable but rather predictable in most patients. Option D: None (Incorrect) Hydroxyurea has a clear effect on uric acid metabolism, causing an increase in serum uric acid levels. Thus, stating that it has no effect is incorrect.",

Om Prakash presents with anemia, anorexia, weakness, paresthesia, and sluggish tendon reflexes, along with macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils on a peripheral blood smear, which are hallmark findings of megaloblastic anemia. His endoscopy findings of atrophic gastritis suggest pernicious anemia, a condition where autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells leads to intrinsic factor deficiency, impairing vitamin B12 absorption. Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis, and its deficiency results in ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to macrocytic anemia. Additionally, B12 deficiency affects the myelin sheath of neurons, leading to neurological symptoms such as paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, and sluggish reflexes (subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord). Incorrect Options: (A) Folic Acid – Incorrect. Folic acid deficiency also causes macrocytic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils, but unlike B12 deficiency, it does not cause neurological symptoms. Since Om Prakash has paresthesia and sluggish reflexes, vitamin B12 deficiency is more likely. Additionally, atrophic gastritis is more commonly linked to pernicious anemia (B12 deficiency) rather than folate deficiency. (B) Riboflavin – Incorrect. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is important for energy metabolism and antioxidant function, but its deficiency typically presents with cheilitis (cracked lips), glossitis (inflamed tongue), seborrheic dermatitis, and corneal vascularization. It does not cause macrocytic anemia or neurological symptoms, making it an unlikely cause of this patient’s condition. (C) Pyridoxine – Incorrect. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B2) is essential for amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Its deficiency can cause neurological symptoms such as irritability, depression, and seizures, but it does not lead to macrocytic anemia. Instead, B2 deficiency is more commonly associated with microcytic anemia due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis. Additionally, atrophic gastritis is not a feature of B2 deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vitamin B12. Megaloblastic anemia with neurological abnormalities is highly suggestive of Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and proper functioning of the nervous system, especially in maintaining myelin sheath integrity. Deficiency of Vitamin B12 leads to defective red blood cell maturation, causing megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms such as paresthesia, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and peripheral neuropathy. Early intervention with Vitamin B12 supplementation (parenteral or high-dose oral) is crucial to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Iron sulfate – Incorrect. Iron sulfate is used to treat iron deficiency anemia, which presents with microcytic hypochromic anemia, not megaloblastic anemia. It does not address the neurological complications seen in Vitamin B12 deficiency. (C) Erythropoietin – Incorrect. Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates red blood cell production in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) or anemia of chronic disease, but it does not correct the defective DNA synthesis seen in megaloblastic anemia. (D) Folic acid – Incorrect. While folic acid deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia, it does not lead to neurological symptoms. Moreover, administering folic acid alone in a Vitamin B12-deficient patient can worsen neurological damage by allowing DNA synthesis to continue without correcting the underlying demyelination of nerves.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Counteracting toxicity of high-dose methotrexate therapy. Folinic acid (Leucovorin) is a reduced form of folic acid that bypasses dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and directly participates in DNA synthesis. It is used as a \"rescue therapy\" to counteract the toxic effects of high-dose methotrexate (MTX). Methotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, blocking folate metabolism and leading to bone marrow suppression, mucositis, and other toxicities. Folinic acid replenishes folate pools without requiring DHFR, thus preventing methotrexate-induced cytotoxicity, particularly in healthy cells. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Prophylaxis of neural tube defects in the offspring of women receiving anticonvulsant medications – Incorrect. Folic acid, not folinic acid, is used to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs) in pregnant women, especially those on anticonvulsants like valproate or carbamazepine, which interfere with folate metabolism. Folinic acid is not recommended for this purpose. (B) Pernicious anemia – Incorrect. Pernicious anemia is caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor, leading to megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. Folinic acid does not correct the neurological complications of Vitamin B12 deficiency and can worsen them by allowing continued hematologic improvement while nerve damage progresses. (D) Anemia associated with renal failure – Incorrect. Anemia in renal failure is primarily due to erythropoietin deficiency, not folate deficiency. Treatment involves erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) like epoetin alfa or darbepoetin along with iron supplementation, rather than folinic acid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Conversion of malonic acid to succinic acid. This reaction refers to the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an important step in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, threonine, and methionine). This reaction requires methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, an enzyme that uses vitamin B12 (cobalamin) as a cofactor. Folate is not involved in this reaction. A deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to methylmalonic acidemia, which can cause neurological complications due to the buildup of toxic metabolites. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Conversion of serine to glycine – Incorrect. This reaction is catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which requires tetrahydrofolate (THF), a derivative of folate, as a cofactor. Vitamin B12 is not required for this process. (B) Conversion of homocysteine to methionine – Incorrect. This reaction is catalyzed by methionine synthase, which requires both vitamin B12 and folate (as 5-methyl-THF). Since folate is also involved, this does not meet the criteria of the question. (D) Thymidylate synthesis – Incorrect. Thymidylate (dTMP) is synthesized from deoxyuridylate (dUMP) in a reaction catalyzed by thymidylate synthase, which requires 5,10-methylene-THF as a cofactor. This reaction depends on folate, but not vitamin B12.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Cannot be injected intravenously (i.v.). Iron sorbitol-citric acid is a complex iron preparation used for intramuscular (i.m.) administration only. Unlike iron dextran, which can be given both intramuscularly and intravenously, iron sorbitol-citric acid must not be injected intravenously because it may lead to severe adverse reactions, including hypotension and anaphylactic shock. This limitation makes intravenous administration contraindicated for this formulation. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Is not excreted in urine – Incorrect. Both iron sorbitol-citric acid and iron dextran undergo some renal excretion, though the majority of iron is utilized for erythropoiesis. Iron dextran, however, has a slightly higher excretion rate in urine. (B) Is not bound to transferrin in plasma – Incorrect. Once absorbed, iron from both formulations is released and binds to transferrin in the plasma for transport to the bone marrow, liver, and other tissues. There is no significant difference between them in this regard. (D) Produces fewer side effects – Incorrect. Iron sorbitol-citric acid is more likely to cause local pain and tissue discoloration at the injection site compared to iron dextran. It can also cause hypersensitivity reactions and, if accidentally administered intravenously, may lead to severe adverse effects. Hence, it does not necessarily produce fewer side effects than iron dextran.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Heparin. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious complication during pregnancy due to the hypercoagulable state induced by hormonal changes. In pregnant patients, heparin is the preferred anticoagulant because it does not cross the placenta and is safe for both the mother and fetus. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), such as enoxaparin or dalteparin, is the first-line treatment. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is an alternative, particularly in patients requiring rapid reversal (e.g., peripartum period). Heparin prevents thrombus formation and embolization without increasing the risk of fetal bleeding or teratogenicity. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Abciximab Incorrect because abciximab is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor that prevents platelet aggregation, not fibrin clot formation. It is primarily used for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) but has no role in treating DVT. Additionally, it can cause significant bleeding complications in pregnancy. (B) Aspirin Incorrect because aspirin is an antiplatelet drug, not an anticoagulant. Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), reducing thromboxane A2, which prevents platelet aggregation. While low-dose aspirin is sometimes used in pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia, it is not effective for treating DVT. Aspirin does not dissolve existing clots or prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) effectively. (D) Streptokinase Incorrect because streptokinase is a fibrinolytic (clot-dissolving) agent, not the first-line treatment for DVT in pregnancy. Streptokinase is used for life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE) or stroke but is too aggressive for routine DVT treatment. It carries a high risk of maternal hemorrhage and fetal complications, making it unsuitable for this patient.",

This patient presents with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as evidenced by a low hemoglobin level (8.0 g/dL), microcytosis (MCV = 72 fL), low reticulocyte count, and iron studies showing low serum iron, low ferritin, and elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). IDA is the most common cause of microcytic anemia and often results from chronic blood loss (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, heavy menstruation), inadequate dietary intake, or malabsorption. The first-line treatment is oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, which replenishes iron stores, increases hemoglobin production, and improves symptoms of anemia such as fatigue and dizziness. Iron supplementation should be continued for several months to fully restore iron stores. Incorrect Options: (B) Erythropoietin: While erythropoietin is used to treat anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) or conditions associated with reduced erythropoiesis, it is not the primary treatment for iron deficiency anemia. Without sufficient iron, erythropoietin will not be effective in increasing red blood cell production. This patient has no mention of CKD, making iron supplementation the correct approach. (C) Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 is used to treat megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by macrocytosis (MCV >100 fL) and often results from malabsorption (e.g., pernicious anemia, gastrectomy, or ileal disease). This patient's microcytic anemia (MCV = 72 fL) and iron study findings are not consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, making this treatment inappropriate. (D) Folic Acid: Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis and is used to treat folate deficiency anemia, which also presents as macrocytic anemia (MCV >100 fL). Folate deficiency is common in malnutrition, alcoholism, and pregnancy but does not cause the iron deficiency anemia seen in this patient. Since the lab findings and clinical presentation are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia, folic acid supplementation would not be the appropriate treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) High-dose corticosteroids. This patient has thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 40,000/µL) with normal coagulation studies in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is highly suggestive of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) secondary to lupus. In ITP, autoantibodies target platelet surface glycoproteins, leading to increased platelet destruction in the spleen. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone, or methylprednisolone) are the first-line treatment, as they suppress immune-mediated platelet destruction and increase platelet counts. High-dose corticosteroids are effective in the majority of patients and are the initial therapy of choice in mild to moderate ITP. Incorrect Options: (B) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG can be used in severe or life-threatening bleeding in ITP, as it provides rapid but temporary platelet count elevation by blocking Fc receptors in the spleen and reducing platelet clearance. However, corticosteroids are the preferred initial treatment for most patients with moderate ITP. IVIG is generally reserved for emergency situations, such as intracranial hemorrhage or when a rapid increase in platelets is needed. (C) Platelet transfusions: Platelet transfusions are not routinely used in ITP because transfused platelets are rapidly destroyed by autoantibodies. They are only considered in cases of severe hemorrhage (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage) where immediate platelet support is necessary. Since this patient does not have life-threatening bleeding, platelet transfusion is not the most effective treatment. (D) Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (e.g., romiplostim, eltrombopag): These agents stimulate platelet production and are used in chronic refractory ITP (when steroids and other treatments fail). However, they are not first-line therapy and are generally reserved for patients who do not respond to corticosteroids or require long-term management of persistent thrombocytopenia. Since this is an initial episode of ITP, corticosteroids remain the preferred treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Consider splenectomy. This patient has idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that is persistent despite two months of corticosteroid therapy, indicating steroid-refractory ITP. In such cases, the next step is to consider splenectomy, which is a well-established second-line treatment. The spleen plays a key role in ITP by producing autoantibodies against platelets and serving as the primary site of platelet destruction. Splenectomy removes this site, leading to significant and sustained platelet count improvement in many patients. Splenectomy is particularly effective in patients with chronic or refractory ITP and is recommended in cases where corticosteroid therapy fails to achieve adequate platelet counts. Incorrect Options: (A) Increase the corticosteroid dosage: Long-term corticosteroid use is associated with serious adverse effects, including osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, hypertension, muscle wasting, and increased infection risk. Since the patient has already been on corticosteroids for two months without significant improvement, simply increasing the dosage is not an effective or sustainable approach. (B) Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG is primarily used for rapid but short-term increases in platelet count, typically in patients with severe bleeding or those needing urgent procedures. It is not a long-term treatment option for refractory ITP, making splenectomy the more definitive approach in this case. (C) Start thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs): Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (e.g., romiplostim, eltrombopag) stimulate platelet production and are an alternative to splenectomy in patients who are not surgical candidates or prefer to avoid surgery. However, they are generally considered in chronic refractory ITP, particularly if splenectomy is contraindicated. Since splenectomy provides a potential cure, it is the preferred next step before initiating TPO-RAs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Inclisiran. Inclisiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is a protein that degrades low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on hepatocytes, reducing the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. By silencing the PCSK9 gene, inclisiran increases LDL receptor availability, leading to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol levels. Unlike monoclonal antibodies (which require frequent administration), inclisiran has a long-lasting effect, requiring only twice-yearly dosing after initial loading doses, making it a promising option for patients with severe hyperlipidemia, especially those with familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Incorrect Options: (B) Alirocumab & (C) Evolocumab: Both alirocumab and evolocumab are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PCSK9, not siRNA therapies. While they also inhibit PCSK9, their mechanism involves directly binding to the PCSK9 protein, preventing it from degrading LDL receptors. These drugs require more frequent administration (every 2-4 weeks) compared to inclisiran. Though highly effective, they are different from siRNA-based approaches. (D) Lomitapide: Lomitapide is not a PCSK9 inhibitor but an MTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) inhibitor. It reduces LDL cholesterol by inhibiting the assembly of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL) in the liver. Lomitapide is used primarily for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) but has significant hepatic side effects, including increased liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis. It does not target PCSK9 and is not an siRNA therapy.",
