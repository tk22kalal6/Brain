      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tenofovir. Unlike other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). Because it is already a monophosphate prodrug, it requires only two phosphorylation steps to become its active form, tenofovir diphosphate. This is in contrast to nucleoside analogs, which must undergo three phosphorylation steps (triphosphorylation) to become active. This unique activation process differentiates tenofovir from traditional NRTIs like stavudine, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Incorrect Options: A. Stavudine: Incorrect. Stavudine (d4T) is an NRTI that requires three-step phosphorylation to become stavudine triphosphate, its active form. This active triphosphate form inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase, preventing viral replication. B. Lamivudine: Incorrect. Lamivudine (3TC) is also an NRTI that needs triphosphorylation for activation. Once converted to lamivudine triphosphate, it acts as a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase, leading to chain termination. D. Zidovudine: Incorrect. Zidovudine (AZT) follows the same activation pathway as other NRTIs, undergoing triphosphorylation to form zidovudine triphosphate, which integrates into the viral DNA and halts replication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Zidovudine. Zidovudine (AZT) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that, once phosphorylated, has a higher affinity for mitochondrial DNA polymerase-? compared to other NRTIs. This leads to mitochondrial toxicity, which is responsible for side effects such as myopathy, lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. The inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase-? reduces mitochondrial DNA synthesis, causing cellular dysfunction. This property makes zidovudine more toxic to mitochondria than other options listed. Incorrect Options: A. Emtricitabine: Incorrect. Emtricitabine (FTC) is an NRTI with low affinity for mitochondrial DNA polymerase-?, making it less likely to cause mitochondrial toxicity. This contributes to its better safety profile compared to zidovudine. C. Lamivudine: Incorrect. Lamivudine (3TC) also exhibits low affinity for DNA polymerase-?, resulting in minimal mitochondrial toxicity. This makes it one of the safest NRTIs, with fewer mitochondrial-related adverse effects. D. Tenofovir: Incorrect. Tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI), has very low affinity for DNA polymerase-?, leading to a lower risk of mitochondrial toxicity compared to zidovudine. It is generally well-tolerated, with renal toxicity being a more significant concern than mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dolutegravir. Dolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a class of antiretroviral drugs that targets the HIV-1 integrase enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for incorporating viral DNA into the host genome, a key step in the HIV replication cycle. By inhibiting integrase, dolutegravir prevents the integration of viral DNA, effectively stopping HIV from replicating and reducing viral load. Integrase inhibitors like dolutegravir are highly effective, well-tolerated, and commonly used in combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to their high barrier to resistance. Incorrect Options: A. Tipranavir: Incorrect. Tipranavir is a protease inhibitor (PI), not an integrase inhibitor. It works by inhibiting the HIV-1 protease enzyme, preventing the cleavage of viral polyproteins necessary for the maturation of infectious HIV particles. B. Darunavir: Incorrect. Darunavir is also a protease inhibitor (PI). Like tipranavir, it blocks HIV protease activity, thereby interfering with viral maturation. It is often used in combination with ritonavir or cobicistat for boosted efficacy. C. Atazanavir: Incorrect. Atazanavir is another protease inhibitor (PI) that prevents the cleavage of viral polyproteins, leading to the production of immature, non-infectious HIV particles. It is not an integrase inhibitor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Fluconazole. Rifabutin is a rifamycin antibiotic used for treating tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections, especially in HIV-positive patients. It is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) enzyme system, and its levels can be influenced by co-administered drugs. Fluconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases rifabutin plasma concentrations, leading to dose-dependent toxicity. This toxicity manifests as uveitis (inflammation of the uvea) and arthralgias (joint pain), both of which are known adverse effects of rifabutin when its levels become excessively high. Incorrect Options: B. Itraconazole: Incorrect. Itraconazole is also a CYP3A4 inhibitor but does not elevate rifabutin levels as significantly as fluconazole. Although interactions exist, itraconazole does not commonly cause the severe rifabutin toxicity seen with fluconazole. C. Posaconazole: Incorrect. Posaconazole is another strong CYP3A4 inhibitor; however, its use with rifabutin is less common, and reports of uveitis and arthralgia due to this combination are rare. Fluconazole is more frequently associated with this adverse effect. D. Ketoconazole: Incorrect. Ketoconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor but is rarely used due to its hepatotoxicity. While it may increase rifabutin levels, fluconazole is the most well-documented antifungal to cause rifabutin-induced uveitis and arthralgia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Didanosine. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Didanosine (ddl), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), is well known for its potential to cause dose-dependent pancreatitis, which can be life-threatening. The risk is particularly high in patients with other risk factors such as HIV/AIDS and those taking additional medications that may contribute to pancreatic toxicity. Didanosine can cause direct toxicity to the pancreatic acinar cells, leading to inflammation and elevated pancreatic enzymes (e.g., amylase). Given this patient's symptoms of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, along with an elevated amylase level (220 U/L), acute pancreatitis is a likely diagnosis, and didanosine is the most probable causative agent. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: B) Dronabinol: This is a synthetic form of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) used to stimulate appetite in HIV/AIDS patients experiencing weight loss. While it may cause gastrointestinal side effects like nausea or vomiting, it is not known to cause pancreatitis. Therefore, it is an unlikely culprit. C) Ritonavir: Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) used to boost the levels of other protease inhibitors by inhibiting CYP3A4 metabolism. Although PIs have been rarely associated with pancreatitis, this usually occurs with other PIs such as lopinavir, not ritonavir alone. Moreover, pancreatitis due to ritonavir is much less common compared to didanosine. D) Zidovudine: Another NRTI, zidovudine is primarily associated with bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia and neutropenia) and lactic acidosis rather than pancreatitis. Although some mitochondrial toxicity can occur with NRTIs, pancreatitis is not a common adverse effect of zidovudine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acyclovir. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Acyclovir is the drug of choice for treating genital herpes (HSV-2 infections), especially in patients with recurrent episodes. It is a safe and effective antiviral agent that selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase, preventing viral replication. In lactating mothers, acyclovir is considered safe because only a small amount is excreted in breast milk, and it has a low risk of toxicity for the infant. Given that the patient previously used a topical treatment (likely acyclovir or another topical antiviral), systemic therapy with oral acyclovir is now more appropriate to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms and prevent further recurrences. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: B) Amantadine: Amantadine is an antiviral drug used for influenza A virus infections, not herpes simplex virus (HSV). It works by blocking the M2 ion channel of influenza A, which is not relevant to HSV infections. Since genital herpes is caused by HSV-2, amantadine would be ineffective for this patient. C) Foscarnet: Foscarnet is a second-line antiviral used for acyclovir-resistant HSV infections and CMV infections in immunocompromised patients. It is not typically needed for a nursing mother with a recurrent, uncomplicated HSV infection, as acyclovir remains the preferred treatment. Additionally, foscarnet requires intravenous administration and has significant renal toxicity, making it an inappropriate first-line choice. D) Trifluridine: Trifluridine is a topical antiviral mainly used for herpetic keratitis (HSV eye infections). While it is effective for treating HSV infections of the eye, it is not used for genital herpes, as its systemic absorption is poor, and it is impractical for treating widespread lesions. Since this patient has genital herpes, trifluridine is not the correct choice.",

It is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that inhibits viral DNA polymerase by acting as a chain terminator during viral DNA replication. By incorporating into the growing viral DNA chain, lamivudine halts the synthesis of viral DNA, thereby suppressing HBV replication.

It is not effective against hepatitis B virus (HBV), making it an incorrect choice for this question. (C) Oseltamivir – Incorrect Oseltamivir is an influenza antiviral drug that acts as a neuraminidase inhibitor, preventing the release of new virions from infected cells. It is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B, but it has no role in the treatment of hepatitis B, making it an incorrect option.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Amphotericin B Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent used for the treatment of systemic fungal infections, including cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis. It works by binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, forming pores that increase membrane permeability, leading to leakage of intracellular contents and fungal cell death. Despite its efficacy, amphotericin B is associated with significant toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity (acute kidney injury due to direct damage to renal tubules) and cardiotoxic effects, including arrhythmias. Due to these adverse effects, it is often reserved for severe infections and may be administered in a liposomal formulation to reduce toxicity. Incorrect Options: (A) Fluconazole – Incorrect Fluconazole is an azole antifungal that works by inhibiting fungal ergosterol synthesis via cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition. It is used primarily for mucosal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, and some systemic infections, but it lacks the broad-spectrum activity of Amphotericin B. Fluconazole is not associated with severe nephrotoxicity or arrhythmias, making it an incorrect choice. (C) Terbinafine – Incorrect Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase, leading to an accumulation of toxic squalene in fungal cells, which disrupts membrane function. It is mainly used for dermatophytic infections (e.g., onychomycosis and tinea infections) rather than systemic fungal infections. It is not nephrotoxic or cardiotoxic, making it an incorrect option. (D) Nystatin – Incorrect Nystatin is a polyene antifungal, similar to amphotericin B, but it is only used topically or orally for mucocutaneous candidiasis due to its high toxicity if administered systemically. It is ineffective for systemic fungal infections, and while it can cause mild nephrotoxicity when absorbed in small amounts, it is not associated with arrhythmias, making it an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Clotrimazole Clotrimazole is an imidazole antifungal that works by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, which is essential for fungal cell membrane integrity. It specifically inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14?-demethylase, leading to ergosterol depletion and increased membrane permeability, ultimately causing fungal cell death. Clotrimazole is primarily used topically for superficial fungal infections, including dermatophytosis (tinea infections), vaginal candidiasis, and oral thrush. Its low systemic absorption minimizes systemic side effects, making it an ideal choice for topical application. Incorrect Options: (A) Itraconazole Itraconazole is a triazole antifungal that also inhibits ergosterol synthesis by targeting lanosterol 14?-demethylase. However, it is primarily used systemically to treat onychomycosis, systemic candidiasis, and aspergillosis, rather than being a topical agent. It is available in oral and intravenous forms, making it less suitable for topical fungal infections compared to clotrimazole. (B) Griseofulvin Griseofulvin is a fungistatic agent that works by binding to microtubules and inhibiting fungal mitosis, thereby preventing fungal cell division. It is not involved in ergosterol synthesis inhibition. Griseofulvin is used orally for dermatophyte infections (e.g., tinea capitis, tinea corporis), but it is not a topical antifungal, making it an incorrect choice. (C) Ketoconazole Ketoconazole is another imidazole antifungal that also inhibits ergosterol synthesis, but it is available in both topical and oral formulations. While topical ketoconazole is used for seborrheic dermatitis and cutaneous fungal infections, clotrimazole is more widely used for topical applications, particularly for vaginal and oral candidiasis, making clotrimazole the better answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tenofovir-emtricitabine Tenofovir-emtricitabine is the standard combination used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV infection in high-risk individuals, such as sexually active individuals at high risk, people with HIV-positive partners, and individuals who inject drugs. This fixed-dose combination contains tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC), both of which are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). These drugs work by blocking the action of HIV reverse transcriptase, preventing the virus from replicating and establishing an infection if exposure occurs. Clinical trials, including the iPrEx trial, have shown that daily PrEP with tenofovir-emtricitabine can reduce HIV transmission by more than 90% when taken consistently. Incorrect Options: (B) Abacavir-lamivudine – Incorrect Abacavir-lamivudine is also a combination of NRTIs, but it is not recommended for PrEP. This combination is primarily used for HIV treatment in already infected individuals, rather than for HIV prevention in high-risk individuals. Additionally, abacavir requires HLA-B*5701 screening due to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. (C) Ritonavir – Incorrect Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) that is mainly used as a pharmacokinetic booster to enhance the effects of other protease inhibitors like lopinavir or darunavir in HIV treatment. It does not have a role in PrEP and is not used alone to prevent HIV infection. (D) Enfuvirtide – Incorrect Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that prevents HIV from entering host cells by blocking gp41-mediated membrane fusion. However, it is not used for PrEP and is mainly reserved for treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV. Moreover, it requires subcutaneous injection, making it impractical for long-term prophylactic use.",
