      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in its chronic phase is best treated with Imatinib (A), a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Imatinib specifically targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is responsible for the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells in CML. By inhibiting the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, Imatinib effectively reduces the abnormal clonal expansion of leukemic cells, leading to significant hematologic and cytogenetic remission. It has revolutionized CML treatment and is considered the first-line therapy due to its high efficacy, tolerability, and ability to induce long-term remission. Incorrect Options: (B) Hydroxyurea: This drug is a cytoreductive agent that can be used to temporarily lower white blood cell (WBC) counts in CML patients. However, it does not target the underlying BCR-ABL fusion protein and does not provide long-term disease control. It is sometimes used in the initial management of very high leukocyte counts before starting Imatinib but is not a definitive treatment. (C) Interferon: Previously used in the treatment of CML before the advent of TKIs, interferon-alpha helped achieve partial cytogenetic responses but had limited efficacy and significant side effects. It has been largely replaced by Imatinib and other TKIs as a more effective and better-tolerated therapy. (D) Cytarabine: A chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis, Cytarabine was historically used in combination with interferon in CML treatment. However, it lacks specificity for BCR-ABL, making it much less effective than Imatinib. It is now mainly used in the treatment of acute leukemias rather than CML.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ipilimumab. Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 inhibitor, not a PD-1 inhibitor. It works by blocking cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), a receptor on T-cells that downregulates immune responses. By inhibiting CTLA-4, Ipilimumab enhances T-cell activation and proliferation, leading to an increased immune response against tumors. It is primarily used in the treatment of melanoma and other cancers as an immune checkpoint inhibitor but does not directly inhibit the PD-1 (programmed death-1) pathway. Incorrect Options: (A) Nivolumab: Nivolumab is a PD-1 inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), thereby restoring T-cell activity against cancer cells. It is used in cancers like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. (B) Pembrolizumab: Pembrolizumab also inhibits PD-1, preventing immune suppression and allowing T-cells to attack tumor cells more effectively. It is used in multiple malignancies, including melanoma, lung cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. (D) Atezolizumab: Unlike Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab does not block PD-1 directly; instead, it inhibits PD-L1 (the ligand for PD-1). By blocking PD-L1, it prevents PD-1-mediated immune suppression and enhances T-cell response against tumors. It is used in lung cancer, bladder cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ribociclib. Ribociclib is not considered hormonal chemotherapy; rather, it is a CDK4/6 inhibitor. It works by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), which are crucial for cell cycle progression in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. By blocking CDK4/6, Ribociclib prevents cancer cell proliferation and is used in combination with hormonal therapies like letrozole for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. However, since it does not directly act on hormonal receptors or endocrine pathways, it is not classified as hormonal chemotherapy. Incorrect Options: (A) Fulvestrant: Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) used in hormonal chemotherapy for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. It works by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), leading to its degradation and preventing estrogen from stimulating cancer cell growth. (B) Tamoxifen: Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue but an agonist in bones and the uterus. It is used in hormonal chemotherapy for ER-positive breast cancer by blocking estrogen's proliferative effects on tumor cells. (D) Letrozole: Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estrogen synthesis by blocking the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens into estrogens. It is used in postmenopausal women for hormonal chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer to deprive cancer cells of estrogen stimulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sorafenib. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets multiple kinases, including VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases, primarily used for treating renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and thyroid cancer. While Sorafenib is associated with hypertension and hand-foot syndrome, it does not typically cause significant cardiotoxicity like the other drugs listed. Its effects on the cardiovascular system are mainly related to vascular endothelial dysfunction rather than direct cardiac toxicity. Incorrect Options: (A) Trastuzumab: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against HER2 (ERBB2), commonly used in HER2-positive breast cancer. It is associated with reversible cardiotoxicity, leading to left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Unlike anthracyclines, its cardiotoxic effects are usually not dose-dependent and may improve after discontinuation of the drug. (B) Doxorubicin: Doxorubicin is an anthracycline that causes dose-dependent, irreversible cardiotoxicity due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in cardiac cells. It leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure (CHF). The risk increases with cumulative doses, and cardioprotective agents like dexrazoxane may be used to mitigate this effect. (C) Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent, can cause acute cardiotoxicity, particularly at high doses. It is associated with myocarditis, pericarditis, and heart failure, likely due to direct endothelial damage and inflammation. Unlike doxorubicin, its cardiotoxicity is usually acute and dose-related, with recovery possible if managed promptly.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor (Programmed Death-1) on T-cells, preventing its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. This blockade releases the inhibitory signals on T-cells, allowing them to recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively. Pembrolizumab is widely used in cancer immunotherapy, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and other cancers with high PD-L1 expression. It is a key immune checkpoint inhibitor that enhances the body's natural ability to fight cancer. Incorrect Options: (A) Panitumumab: Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. It inhibits EGFR signaling, which prevents cancer cell proliferation. However, it is not considered a primary immunotherapy agent since it does not directly modulate the immune system. (B) Pegaptanib: Pegaptanib is an anti-VEGF aptamer used primarily in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It works by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to prevent abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye. It has no role in cancer immunotherapy. (C) Pertuzumab: Pertuzumab is a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody used in HER2-positive breast cancer. It works by blocking HER2 dimerization, preventing downstream signaling that leads to cancer cell growth. While it is used in cancer treatment, it is not an immune checkpoint inhibitor like Pembrolizumab.",

By blocking EGFR, Necitumumab inhibits tumor growth and enhances the effects of chemotherapy. It is primarily used in the treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and gemcitabine). Incorrect Options: (A) EGFR agonist: An EGFR agonist would stimulate EGFR activity, leading to increased cancer cell growth and survival. Since Necitumumab functions as an EGFR inhibitor, this option is incorrect. (C) PDGF agonist: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth, but Necitumumab does not target this pathway. It specifically blocks EGFR, not PDGF, making this option incorrect. (D) PDGF antagonist: While PDGF antagonists may have potential roles in anti-cancer therapy, Necitumumab does not work by inhibiting PDGF.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It has dose-dependent kinetics. Rituximab does not exhibit dose-dependent kinetics; instead, it follows target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD). This means that at lower concentrations, rituximab is rapidly cleared due to its binding to CD20 on B cells, while at higher concentrations, clearance slows as the CD20 target becomes saturated. This non-linear pharmacokinetics distinguishes rituximab from drugs that exhibit classic dose-dependent elimination. Incorrect Options: (A) It is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD-20 – Correct Statement Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen found on the surface of B cells. It is composed of murine variable regions and human constant regions, which enhances immune-mediated B-cell destruction through mechanisms like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation. (C) It is used for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma – Correct Statement Rituximab is widely used in the treatment of CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. It is often combined with chemotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP regimen). (D) Its most common adverse effect is infusion-related reactions – Correct Statement Rituximab’s most common adverse effects include infusion-related reactions, such as fever, chills, hypotension, and bronchospasm. These reactions are due to cytokine release following B-cell lysis. Premedication with antihistamines, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids is often used to mitigate these effects.",

Lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as HER1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It inhibits the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of these receptors, thereby blocking downstream signaling pathways responsible for cell growth and proliferation. Due to its dual inhibition, lapatinib is particularly useful in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, especially in patients resistant to trastuzumab. Incorrect Options: (A) Imatinib – Incorrect Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but it specifically targets BCR-ABL kinase, which is involved in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It also inhibits c-KIT and PDGFR, but it does not inhibit EGFR or HER2, making it unrelated to the mechanism of lapatinib. (B) Gefitinib – Incorrect Gefitinib is a selective EGFR (HER1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, used primarily for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it does not inhibit HER2, which differentiates it from lapatinib. (C) Erlotinib – Incorrect Erlotinib is similar to gefitinib and acts as a selective inhibitor of EGFR (HER1) tyrosine kinase, but it does not have significant action against HER2.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Blocks the action of chimeric fusion protein of BCR-ABL. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that specifically targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which results from the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)) translocation seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). By inhibiting the constitutively active tyrosine kinase, imatinib prevents uncontrolled proliferation and survival of leukemia cells, effectively treating CML and GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumors) that express c-KIT tyrosine kinase. Incorrect Options: (A) Increase in metabolism of P-glycoprotein – Incorrect P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an efflux pump that expels drugs from cancer cells, leading to multidrug resistance (MDR). Imatinib does not increase its metabolism but may be a substrate for P-gp, affecting drug transport. (B) Blocking the action of P-glycoprotein – Incorrect While some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can influence P-glycoprotein activity, imatinib’s primary mechanism is not through P-gp inhibition but rather through direct inhibition of BCR-ABL, c-KIT, and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). (D) Non-competitive inhibition of ATP binding site – Incorrect Imatinib is actually a competitive inhibitor of the ATP binding site on the BCR-ABL kinase. It competes with ATP for binding, thereby preventing phosphorylation and subsequent activation of signaling pathways that drive cancer cell proliferation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anti-VEGF antibody. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors develop new blood vessels to sustain their growth. By inhibiting VEGF, bevacizumab reduces blood supply to tumors, thereby limiting their growth and metastatic potential. It is widely used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma. Incorrect Options: (B) Histone deacetylase inhibitor – Incorrect Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors work by modifying chromatin structure and reactivating tumor suppressor genes. Examples include Vorinostat and Romidepsin, which are used for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but bevacizumab does not belong to this category. (C) Proteasome inhibitor – Incorrect Proteasome inhibitors, such as Bortezomib and Carfilzomib, work by blocking the 26S proteasome, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. They are primarily used in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, but bevacizumab does not act through this mechanism. (D) Her-2/neu inhibitor – Incorrect HER2 inhibitors, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and Lapatinib, are used for HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers by targeting the HER2 receptor. Bevacizumab does not inhibit HER2/neu, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) receptor. HER2 is overexpressed in certain breast and gastric cancers, and trastuzumab works by blocking HER2 signaling, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. However, HER2 is also expressed in cardiac myocytes, where it plays a role in maintaining normal cardiac function. Inhibition of HER2 in the heart can lead to cardiotoxicity, manifesting as cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This is particularly exacerbated when trastuzumab is used with anthracyclines, which are also cardiotoxic. Cardiac function monitoring (e.g., echocardiography) is recommended during trastuzumab therapy. Incorrect Options: (B) Infliximab Infliximab is a TNF-α inhibitor used in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. While TNF-? inhibitors can cause immunosuppression and increase the risk of infections, they do not typically cause cardiomyopathy. However, they may worsen preexisting heart failure in some patients. (C) Adalimumab Similar to infliximab, adalimumab is also a TNF-α inhibitor and is used in autoimmune conditions like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Although TNF-α inhibitors can potentially exacerbate heart failure, they do not directly cause cardiomyopathy like trastuzumab. (D) Rituximab Rituximab is a CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody used in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). While it can cause infusion reactions and immunosuppression, it is not known to cause cardiomyopathy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vorinostat, as it is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones, leading to chromatin condensation and suppression of gene transcription. Vorinostat inhibits HDAC, leading to chromatin relaxation and increased transcription of tumor suppressor genes, ultimately inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation in cancer cells. It is primarily used for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and is being explored for other malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Bortezomib – Incorrect. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, not an HDAC inhibitor. It works by blocking the 26S proteasome, preventing degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and apoptosis. It is primarily used in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. (C) Olaparib – Incorrect. Olaparib is a PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitor, which prevents DNA repair in BRCA-mutated cancers, leading to synthetic lethality and cell death. It is used in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers with BRCA mutations. (D) Temsirolimus – Incorrect.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pembrolizumab. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Pembrolizumab is a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, which is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) used in the treatment of various cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, Pembrolizumab is contraindicated in patients with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) because: It can trigger or worsen MG by enhancing T-cell–mediated immune responses, leading to exacerbation of neuromuscular weakness. It can cause immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), including autoimmune myasthenia gravis, which can lead to respiratory failure. Multiple case reports have documented MG exacerbations and even fatalities in patients given PD-1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab. Since this patient has a confirmed diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (evidenced by anti-ACh receptor antibodies and decremental EMG response), pembrolizumab should never be given in the future, as it can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: A) Mycophenolate: Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits purine synthesis, used in autoimmune diseases like MG and organ transplant rejection. It is actually used to treat MG and would help reduce autoantibody production. C) Rituximab: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20 used in B-cell–mediated autoimmune diseases, including refractory MG. It is beneficial in MG patients with MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) autoantibodies. Since MG is B-cell–mediated, rituximab can be an effective long-term therapy. D) Azathioprine: Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant that inhibits purine synthesis, leading to decreased B- and T-cell proliferation. It is commonly used in autoimmune diseases and is a mainstay of MG treatment for long-term immune suppression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Use ponatinib Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is primarily treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Imatinib, a first-generation TKI, is often the first-line treatment. However, resistance can develop due to mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, with the T315I mutation being particularly significant. This mutation confers resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib by preventing effective drug binding. Ponatinib is the only approved TKI that remains effective against the T315I mutation, making it the most appropriate next step in management. Ponatinib is a third-generation TKI specifically designed to overcome resistance caused by the T315I mutation, allowing continued suppression of BCR-ABL activity in patients with refractory CML. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Use ponatinib. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Increase imatinib dosage – Increasing the dose of imatinib is ineffective against the T315I mutation, as this mutation completely prevents imatinib from binding to the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Higher doses would not overcome this resistance, making this option inappropriate. B. Switch to dasatinib – Dasatinib is a second-generation TKI with greater potency than imatinib and effectiveness against most imatinib-resistant mutations. However, it is ineffective against the T315I mutation, as the mutation blocks dasatinib’s ability to bind to BCR-ABL. Switching to dasatinib would not provide clinical benefit. C. Switch to nilotinib – Nilotinib, like dasatinib, is a second-generation TKI with enhanced activity against many imatinib-resistant mutations. However, it does not overcome resistance due to the T315I mutation, making it an ineffective choice in this scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Imatinib is primarily used to treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) because it is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that specifically targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is the hallmark of CML. This fusion protein results from the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22) translocation), leading to continuous activation of tyrosine kinase, which drives uncontrolled cell proliferation. Imatinib binds to the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL kinase, inhibiting its activity and thereby reducing the proliferation of leukemic cells. This targeted mechanism makes imatinib highly effective in managing CML, particularly in the chronic phase, and has revolutionized the treatment of the disease, significantly improving survival rates. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Breast Cancer: Imatinib is not the standard treatment for breast cancer. Breast cancer is commonly treated using hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), chemotherapy, targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer), and radiation therapy. While tyrosine kinase inhibitors are explored in some breast cancer subtypes, imatinib is not a primary treatment. (C) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): NSCLC is typically treated with EGFR inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib), ALK inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or chemotherapy, depending on molecular characteristics. Imatinib does not target the primary genetic mutations found in NSCLC, making it ineffective for this cancer type. (D) Ovarian Cancer: The treatment for ovarian cancer includes surgery, platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin and paclitaxel), and targeted therapies like PARP inhibitors (e.g., olaparib in BRCA-mutated cases). Imatinib is not a key agent in ovarian cancer management as it does not specifically target the pathways commonly involved in its pathogenesis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) is the correct answer because it is a monoclonal antibody specifically used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is overexpressed in approximately 20-25% of breast cancers, leading to increased tumor growth and aggressive disease. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, blocking its signaling and preventing uncontrolled proliferation. Additionally, trastuzumab induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), enhancing immune system activity against HER2-positive cancer cells. It is used alone or in combination with chemotherapy to improve survival and reduce recurrence in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Rituximab: This monoclonal antibody targets CD20, a surface antigen present on B cells, and is primarily used in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas (e.g., Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It does not target HER2 and is not used for breast cancer treatment. (B) Cetuximab: Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), which is overexpressed in certain cancers like colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Since HER2 and EGFR are distinct receptors, cetuximab is ineffective in HER2-positive breast cancer. (D) Bevacizumab: This drug is an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) monoclonal antibody that inhibits angiogenesis (blood vessel formation), making it useful in cancers like colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. While it has been explored in breast cancer treatment, it is not HER2-specific and is not the first-line treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) is the correct answer because edema and fluid retention are common side effects of imatinib, and diuretics help manage these symptoms effectively. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL, is used primarily for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, it can cause fluid retention leading to peripheral edema, periorbital swelling, and in severe cases, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Diuretics such as furosemide or spironolactone can help reduce fluid overload, and patients are also advised to monitor their fluid intake, reduce salt consumption, and elevate their legs if peripheral edema occurs. In severe cases, dose adjustment or temporary discontinuation may be considered, but diuretics remain the first-line treatment. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Discontinue imatinib immediately: Discontinuing imatinib is not the first-line approach unless the edema is severe and life-threatening (e.g., pulmonary edema, severe pleural effusion). In most cases, fluid retention can be managed symptomatically without stopping the drug, as abrupt discontinuation may lead to disease progression in CML patients. (C) Add an antihistamine: Antihistamines are used for allergic reactions or hypersensitivity symptoms (such as rash or itching) but do not reduce fluid retention caused by imatinib. Edema from imatinib is related to vascular endothelial effects rather than histamine-mediated reactions. (D) Increase the dose of imatinib: Increasing the dose would likely worsen fluid retention and other side effects, making it an inappropriate strategy. If side effects become intolerable, dose reduction rather than escalation is usually considered.",

Sunitinib inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), and c-KIT, which are involved in tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation. By blocking VEGF signaling, sunitinib reduces tumor blood vessel formation, thereby limiting tumor growth and progression. It is a first-line treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and is also used for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Erlotinib: Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), not VEGFR. It is used mainly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations and pancreatic cancer. Since it does not target VEGF receptors, it is not the correct choice for kidney cancer. (C) Vemurafenib: Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that specifically targets BRAF V600E mutations, which are commonly found in melanoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Dabrafenib (Option A) is the correct answer because it is a targeted therapy that specifically inhibits the BRAF V600E mutation, which is present in approximately 50% of melanomas. The BRAF gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth and proliferation. The V600E mutation results in a constitutively active BRAF protein, leading to uncontrolled cell division and tumor growth. Dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutated BRAF, blocking the downstream signaling cascade and slowing tumor progression. It is often combined with MEK inhibitors (such as trametinib) to enhance efficacy and prevent resistance. This combination therapy has significantly improved survival rates in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which inhibits tumor angiogenesis. It is used in cancers such as colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, but it does not target the BRAF V600E mutation and is not a standard treatment for melanoma. (C) Cetuximab: Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), commonly used in colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Drug-induced hypertension and proteinuria (Option B) is the most likely cause because bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) monoclonal antibody, is known to cause both hypertension and proteinuria as common side effects. Bevacizumab works by inhibiting VEGF, which reduces the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and inhibits tumor growth. However, VEGF is also important for maintaining endothelial cell function and vascular permeability, so its inhibition can lead to vascular toxicity, increased blood pressure, and leakage of protein into the urine. These side effects are commonly seen in patients receiving bevacizumab, and hypertension often occurs due to reduced vascular endothelial function, while proteinuria is a result of endothelial injury to the glomeruli in the kidneys. Management may involve controlling blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs and monitoring urine protein levels. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Drug-induced nephrotoxicity: While drug-induced nephrotoxicity can lead to proteinuria, bevacizumab does not directly cause nephrotoxicity in the traditional sense. The proteinuria observed with bevacizumab is primarily due to endothelial injury and leakage in the kidneys, rather than classic nephrotoxic damage such as that seen with drugs like cisplatin. (C) Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome is a complication of rapid tumor cell breakdown (often after chemotherapy or targeted therapy), which releases large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the bloodstream. This leads to metabolic disturbances such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute kidney injury, but it does not directly cause hypertension and proteinuria. Tumor lysis syndrome typically presents with elevated serum uric acid and creatinine, which is not a common finding with bevacizumab treatment. (D) Acute renal failure: Although bevacizumab can cause kidney damage leading to proteinuria, acute renal failure is not the most likely cause of the symptoms described. Acute renal failure generally results from sudden and severe damage to the kidneys, leading to a marked increase in serum creatinine and urea. While bevacizumab may lead to kidney dysfunction in the form of proteinuria, it is less likely to cause acute renal failure unless other complicating factors are present.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ibrutinib (Option A) is the correct answer because it is a small molecule inhibitor that targets Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a critical enzyme in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. BTK is essential for the survival and proliferation of B-cells, including malignant B-cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib irreversibly binds to BTK, inhibiting BCR signaling, which reduces the proliferation and survival of CLL cells. It is a first-line therapy for CLL and has been shown to significantly improve survival rates in patients with this disease. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Idelalisib: Idelalisib is an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), specifically the delta isoform (PI3K?), which is involved in B-cell signaling. While it is also used in the treatment of CLL, it does not target BTK. Idelalisib works by inhibiting downstream signaling from the BCR pathway, but it has a different mechanism of action than ibrutinib. (C) Venetoclax: Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that works by binding to and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, which promotes cell death in CLL cells. While it is effective in treating CLL, its mechanism of action is distinct from that of ibrutinib, as it does not target BTK or interfere with BCR signaling. (D) Acalabrutinib: Acalabrutinib is also a BTK inhibitor, similar to ibrutinib. However, ibrutinib is more commonly used in clinical practice, and it is typically the first choice for CLL treatment. Acalabrutinib is a second-generation BTK inhibitor with a more selective binding profile and potentially fewer side effects, but the question specifically asks for the most commonly used BTK inhibitor, which is ibrutinib.",

Dasatinib is more potent than imatinib and can overcome certain mutations that cause imatinib resistance, particularly BCR-ABL mutations that affect the kinase domain. Dasatinib is able to inhibit both BCR-ABL and Src family kinases, making it effective in CML patients who are resistant to imatinib, including those with mutations like the T315I mutation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Inhibition of the PD-1 receptor (Option A) is the correct answer because nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1), a checkpoint protein expressed on T-cells. PD-1 normally acts as a negative regulator of immune responses by binding to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed on tumor cells. By inhibiting PD-1, nivolumab enhances T-cell activity, allowing the immune system to better recognize and attack cancer cells. This immune checkpoint blockade has proven effective in treating melanoma and other cancers. However, immune-related adverse effects like autoimmune hepatitis can occur due to the enhanced immune response attacking normal tissues. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Inhibition of BRAF V600E: BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib target the BRAF V600E mutation that drives melanoma cell growth, but nivolumab does not work through this mechanism. Nivolumab targets PD-1, not BRAF, making this option incorrect for the mechanism of action of nivolumab. (C) Targeting CD20: CD20 is a cell surface marker on B-cells, and therapies targeting CD20 (such as rituximab) are used for B-cell malignancies like non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nivolumab does not target CD20; it modulates T-cell activity through PD-1 inhibition. (D) Inhibition of VEGF: VEGF inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are used to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Nivolumab, on the other hand, works by blocking the PD-1 receptor, not by inhibiting VEGF. Therefore, this is not the mechanism of action for nivolumab.",

JAK2 mutations, such as JAK2 V617F, lead to unregulated cell proliferation due to constant activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Ruxolitinib is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor that effectively reduces excessive blood cell production and is used to treat myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera in patients who have failed other treatments. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Ibrutinib: Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma. It does not target JAK2 mutations and is therefore not appropriate for myeloproliferative disorders involving JAK2 mutations. (C) Imatinib: Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) by targeting the BCR-ABL fusion protein. While effective for these conditions, imatinib does not target JAK2 mutations and is not used for myeloproliferative disorders. (D) Erlotinib: Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), used primarily in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. It does not target the JAK2 mutation and is not used for myeloproliferative disorders.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Everolimus (Option A) is the correct answer because it is a mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitor used to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC), particularly in patients who have failed prior therapies such as VEGF inhibitors. mTOR is a crucial protein kinase involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival, and it is often dysregulated in cancer. By inhibiting mTOR, everolimus reduces tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, making it an effective treatment for RCC and other cancers like breast cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Sunitinib: Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). It is used to treat renal cell carcinoma as well, but it does not target mTOR. Instead, it works by inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth through receptor blockade, making it a VEGF inhibitor, not an mTOR inhibitor. (C) Sorafenib: Sorafenib is another multikinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR, PDGFR, and RAF kinases, and it is used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Like sunitinib, sorafenib does not target mTOR. Its mechanism of action is primarily through inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation via kinases. (D) Vemurafenib: Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor specifically targeting the BRAF V600E mutation. It is primarily used to treat melanoma with this mutation and has no activity against mTOR. Vemurafenib does not play a role in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.",

Venetoclax binds to BCL-2, inhibiting its activity and promoting apoptosis in B-cell malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is specifically designed to target and block the BCL-2 protein, thereby making CLL cells more susceptible to cell death. Venetoclax has been shown to be effective in CLL patients, particularly those who have relapsed or are refractory to other treatments. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Idelalisib: Idelalisib is a PI3K? inhibitor used in the treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies. It works by blocking PI3K signaling in B-cells, leading to inhibition of their survival and proliferation. While effective for CLL, idelalisib does not target BCL-2 and is not the drug in question.

By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab prevents the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 receptors on T-cells, which normally suppresses immune responses. This immune checkpoint inhibition can lead to immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis, where the immune system attacks the lungs. Pneumonitis is a known side effect of atezolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors like nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. While bevacizumab has several side effects, including hypertension and proteinuria, it is not associated with immune-related pneumonitis, making it an unlikely cause in this scenario. (C) Cetuximab: Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). It is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer and head and neck cancers. While cetuximab can cause skin reactions and infusion-related reactions, it is not associated with pneumonitis. Therefore, it is not the most likely cause of pneumonitis in this patient. (D) Trastuzumab: Trastuzumab targets HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and is primarily used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. While it has potential side effects such as cardiotoxicity, it is not linked to the development of pneumonitis, making it an unlikely cause of the patient's symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Idelalisib (Option A) is the correct answer because it is a small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway. The PI3K pathway is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and migration, and its dysregulation contributes to the growth and survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Idelalisib inhibits the delta isoform of PI3K (PI3K?), which is primarily expressed in B-cells, including malignant CLL cells. By blocking this pathway, Idelalisib reduces CLL cell survival and is effective in treating relapsed or refractory CLL. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Ibrutinib: Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, not a PI3K inhibitor. It targets the BTK pathway, which is important in B-cell signaling and cell survival. Ibrutinib is used in the treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies, but it does not inhibit the PI3K pathway. (C) Venetoclax: Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that targets the BCL-2 protein, an anti-apoptotic protein, to promote the death of cancerous cells. While it is used in the treatment of CLL and AML, it does not target the PI3K pathway and works through a different mechanism by inhibiting apoptosis resistance. (D) Rituximab: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 on B-cells and is used in the treatment of various B-cell malignancies, including CLL. It does not inhibit the PI3K pathway but rather works by inducing B-cell destruction through immune-mediated mechanisms such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity.",

Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 receptor, inhibiting signaling pathways that promote tumor growth and survival. It is specifically used in the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer and HER2-positive breast cancer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Nivolumab: Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1 receptor on T-cells to enhance the immune response against cancer cells. It is used in the treatment of several cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, but it is not used for HER2-positive gastric cancer.

By blocking CTLA-4, Ipilimumab enhances T-cell activation and allows for a stronger immune response against cancer cells. It is specifically used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and has shown significant efficacy in improving survival in patients with this condition. Ipilimumab is one of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors approved for cancer treatment. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Pembrolizumab: Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) inhibitor, not a CTLA-4 inhibitor. It works by blocking the interaction between PD-1 on T-cells and its ligands, which are often exploited by tumors to evade the immune system. Pembrolizumab is used in the treatment of several cancers, including melanoma, but it targets the PD-1 pathway, not CTLA-4. (C) Atezolizumab: Atezolizumab is another PD-L1 inhibitor, which works by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction to enhance the immune response. It is used to treat cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. It does not target CTLA-4 and therefore is not used in the same way as Ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Vemurafenib and trametinib (Option A) is the correct answer because this combination is commonly used for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma. Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that specifically targets the BRAF V600E mutation, which drives tumor growth in melanoma cells. Trametinib is a MEK inhibitor, targeting the downstream signaling pathway that is activated by BRAF mutations. The combination of these two drugs has shown significant efficacy in improving survival rates and reducing tumor progression in BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma patients. This dual targeting approach helps to overcome resistance mechanisms and provides a more effective treatment strategy. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Ibrutinib and rituximab: Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, and rituximab is a CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody. This combination is used in the treatment of B-cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but it is not relevant for BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma. (C) Enasidenib and venetoclax: Enasidenib is an IDH2 inhibitor used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with IDH2 mutations, and venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor used in the treatment of CLL and other hematologic malignancies. This combination is not used for melanoma and is unrelated to the treatment of BRAF V600E-positive melanoma.

MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, when mutated or overexpressed, can promote tumor growth and metastasis in various cancers, including NSCLC. Cabozantinib inhibits MET signaling, thereby reducing tumor progression. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Crizotinib: Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that primarily targets ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), ROS1, and MET receptors. While Crizotinib does inhibit the MET receptor, it is more commonly used for ALK-positive NSCLC and ROS1-positive NSCLC, rather than as a first-line MET inhibitor for general NSCLC. It is not the most specific drug for MET inhibition in this context. (C) Erlotinib: Erlotinib is a EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of EGFR-positive NSCLC. It does not target the MET receptor and therefore would not be effective in a patient requiring MET inhibition for NSCLC.

As an immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab has shown significant clinical benefit in increasing overall survival in these cancer types. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Atezolizumab: Atezolizumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor, not a PD-1 inhibitor. It works by binding to PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1, preventing it from binding to PD-1 receptors on T-cells. Atezolizumab is used to treat cancers like NSCLC and bladder cancer, but it targets PD-L1 rather than PD-1, making it different from nivolumab.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cardiotoxicity (Option A) is the correct answer. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor, is highly effective in treating HER2-positive gastric cancer. However, a well-known adverse effect of trastuzumab is cardiotoxicity, which can lead to heart failure. The exact mechanism is not completely understood, but it is believed that trastuzumab interferes with normal HER2 signaling in heart cells, which plays a role in maintaining normal heart function. This can result in reduced cardiac function and heart failure, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or those receiving other cardiotoxic therapies. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity refers to liver damage, but trastuzumab is not commonly associated with significant liver toxicity. While some chemotherapies can lead to hepatotoxicity, trastuzumab’s primary adverse effect is cardiotoxicity, not liver damage. (C) Nephrotoxicity: Nephrotoxicity refers to kidney damage, and although some cancer therapies can affect kidney function, trastuzumab is not known to commonly cause kidney toxicity. The main adverse effect of trastuzumab is related to cardiac function, not renal function.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Cetuximab (Option A) is the correct answer. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, especially in patients whose tumors express wild-type KRAS (i.e., tumors that do not have mutations in the KRAS gene). By inhibiting EGFR, cetuximab prevents the activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote tumor growth and survival, thus helping to control the spread of colorectal cancer. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It works by inhibiting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), which is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis. While bevacizumab is used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, it does not target EGFR, so it is not the correct choice here. (C) Trastuzumab: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2/neu, a protein that is overexpressed in certain types of cancer, particularly HER2-positive breast cancer. It is not effective in targeting EGFR, and therefore it is not used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. (D) Pembrolizumab: Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-1, a receptor on T cells involved in immune checkpoint regulation. It is used in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, but it does not target EGFR and is not used for metastatic colorectal cancer in the same way as cetuximab.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Bortezomib (Option A) is the correct answer. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. It works by inhibiting the proteasome, which is an enzyme complex responsible for degrading unneeded or damaged proteins in the cell. By blocking this process, bortezomib leads to an accumulation of proteins in the cell, disrupting cell function and ultimately inducing cell death, particularly in cancer cells. This makes it an effective treatment for multiple myeloma, where it helps to target and kill malignant plasma cells. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Ibrutinib: Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, used primarily in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma. It works by inhibiting the BTK pathway, which is involved in the survival and proliferation of B cells, but it does not affect the proteasome and is not used in multiple myeloma. (C) Enasidenib: Enasidenib is an IDH2 inhibitor used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly for patients with mutations in the IDH2 gene. It works by inhibiting the mutated enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), which helps to correct the abnormal metabolic pathway in AML cells. It does not target the proteasome and is not used in multiple myeloma. (D) Venetoclax: Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that is used primarily in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It works by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, promoting cell death in cancer cells, particularly in hematologic cancers.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. All three of the drugs listed—sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib—are small molecule inhibitors that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, which are involved in angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels). These drugs are commonly used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), among other cancers. A known side effect of these drugs is hypertension, which occurs due to the inhibition of VEGF receptors that can lead to endothelial dysfunction and impaired vasodilation, causing elevated blood pressure. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Sunitinib: Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets several receptors, including VEGF receptors, and is commonly used to treat renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and other cancers. It has a well-known risk of causing hypertension due to its effect on VEGF receptors. (B) Sorafenib: Sorafenib is another small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGF receptors and other pathways involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Like sunitinib, it is used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and has been associated with hypertension as a common side effect. (C) Pazopanib: Pazopanib is also a VEGF receptor inhibitor used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcomas. It shares a similar mechanism of action to sunitinib and sorafenib, leading to a similar risk of hypertension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Midostaurin. Midostaurin is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the FLT3 receptor, which is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The FLT3 receptor plays a significant role in the growth and survival of leukemia cells, and inhibiting this receptor can help control the progression of AML. Midostaurin is approved for the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML and is often used in combination with chemotherapy. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Enasidenib: Enasidenib is an IDH2 inhibitor used to treat AML that harbors IDH2 mutations. It works by targeting and inhibiting the mutant form of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), which is implicated in some cases of AML. However, it does not target the FLT3 receptor, and thus is not appropriate for the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML. (C) Ibrutinib: Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). It does not target the FLT3 receptor and is not used in the treatment of AML. (D) Venetoclax: Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor used primarily for the treatment of AML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While it is effective in targeting the BCL-2 protein to induce cell death in leukemia cells, it does not specifically target the FLT3 receptor and thus is not used for FLT3-mutated AML.",

It is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. By inhibiting the PD-L1 receptor, atezolizumab helps to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and attack tumor cells, making it a valuable treatment option for cancers that express PD-L1. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Nivolumab: Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor, not the PD-L1 receptor. It is used in the treatment of various cancers, including NSCLC and melanoma, but it is not the drug that targets PD-L1. (C) Pembrolizumab: Pembrolizumab, like nivolumab, is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor, not PD-L1. It is used to treat a variety of cancers, including NSCLC, melanoma, and others. While pembrolizumab and nivolumab share similar mechanisms, they do not target PD-L1 directly. (D) Durvalumab: Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that also targets PD-L1, similar to atezolizumab.

This drug is used in the treatment of advanced Hodgkin lymphoma and works by delivering a cytotoxic agent directly to the cancer cells, leading to cell death. It is a targeted therapy specifically developed for diseases expressing CD30. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Rituximab: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a protein found on the surface of B cells. It is commonly used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and other B-cell malignancies, but it is not used for Hodgkin lymphoma and does not target CD30.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ponatinib. Ponatinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), especially for patients who have developed resistance or intolerance to earlier-generation TKIs. Ponatinib is specifically effective against the T315I mutation, a common mutation that causes resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs. It is considered a third-generation TKI due to its broader activity against resistant mutations, offering a treatment option for difficult-to-treat cases of CML. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Dasatinib: Dasatinib is a second-generation TKI used to treat CML, especially for patients who have shown resistance or intolerance to imatinib, a first-generation TKI. Dasatinib is more potent than imatinib but does not have the broad resistance profile of third-generation TKIs like ponatinib. (C) Nilotinib: Nilotinib is also a second-generation TKI used in the treatment of CML, particularly for patients with imatinib-resistant CML. It is more potent than imatinib but, like dasatinib, it is not effective against all mutations, particularly the T315I mutation, which is a key target for third-generation TKIs like ponatinib. (D) Imatinib: Imatinib is the first-generation TKI used to treat CML. While it is effective in most cases of CML, resistance can develop over time, especially due to mutations in the BCR-ABL gene, leading to the need for second- or third-generation TKIs for more resistant cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. All three options—midostaurin, gilteritinib, and sorafenib—are FLT3 inhibitors used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 mutations are common in AML and are associated with poor prognosis. Targeting FLT3 with these inhibitors can help control the growth of leukemic cells that harbor these mutations, making these drugs effective treatment options in AML. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Midostaurin: Midostaurin is an FLT3 inhibitor that has been approved for use in FLT3-mutated AML. It is often used in combination with chemotherapy to improve patient outcomes and has been shown to increase overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. (B) Gilteritinib: Gilteritinib is another FLT3 inhibitor that is specifically used for relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutations. It has shown promising results in clinical trials and is used when patients do not respond to other therapies, including midostaurin. (C) Sorafenib: Sorafenib is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, which includes the FLT3 receptor. It has been shown to have activity in FLT3-mutated AML, especially in combination with other agents, and is used to treat patients with relapsed or refractory AML.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide are all androgen receptor antagonists used in the treatment of prostate cancer. These drugs work by blocking the androgen receptor, which is responsible for the growth of prostate cancer cells. By inhibiting this receptor, these medications help prevent cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Enzalutamide: Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist that has been approved for use in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It works by inhibiting the androgen receptor and preventing androgen receptor signaling, thereby reducing tumor growth and progression in prostate cancer. (B) Apalutamide: Apalutamide is also an androgen receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Like enzalutamide, it inhibits androgen receptor signaling but has a slightly different pharmacokinetic profile. (C) Darolutamide: Darolutamide is another androgen receptor antagonist used for the treatment of nmCRPC. It has a unique structure and does not cause some of the central nervous system side effects seen with enzalutamide and apalutamide, making it a valuable option for patients who may not tolerate other therapies.",
