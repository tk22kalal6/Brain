      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Etanercept Etanercept is a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is available only in parenteral (subcutaneous) form and works by acting as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist. TNF-α is a key inflammatory cytokine involved in RA pathogenesis, contributing to joint inflammation, swelling, and destruction. Etanercept is a fusion protein that binds to TNF-α, preventing it from interacting with its receptors, thereby reducing inflammation and halting disease progression. It is widely used in moderate-to-severe RA cases, particularly in patients who do not respond well to conventional disease-modifying drugs like methotrexate. Incorrect Options: (B) Cyclosporine – Incorrect. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant that inhibits calcineurin, thereby preventing T-cell activation. While it is used in autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection, it is not a TNF antagonist and is available in oral and intravenous formulations. It is not a first-line treatment for RA. (C) Penicillamine – Incorrect. Penicillamine is a chelating agent that has been used as a slow-acting disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). It reduces inflammation by interfering with immune functions but does not target TNF. Additionally, it is available in oral form, making it inconsistent with the question’s criteria. (D) Phenylbutazone – Incorrect. Phenylbutazone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used mainly for inflammatory conditions like arthritis. However, it is not a TNF antagonist and does not modify disease progression in RA, only providing symptomatic relief. Moreover, its use is limited due to severe side effects, including bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal toxicity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Infliximab Infliximab is a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) that is specifically used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune conditions like Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a key cytokine responsible for inflammation and joint destruction in RA. By inhibiting TNF-α, infliximab helps reduce inflammation, prevent joint damage, and slow disease progression in RA patients. Infliximab is not appropriate for osteoarthritis (OA) because OA is a degenerative joint disease primarily caused by cartilage wear and tear, rather than an autoimmune inflammatory process. Since TNF-α is not a major contributor to OA, TNF inhibitors like infliximab provide no significant benefit for OA patients. Incorrect Options: (A) Acetaminophen – Incorrect. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a non-opioid analgesic commonly used for mild-to-moderate pain relief in osteoarthritis. While it is not a strong anti-inflammatory, it is still an appropriate option for OA management, making it inconsistent with the question’s criteria. (B) Ketorolac – Incorrect. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with potent analgesic effects, mainly used for short-term pain relief. NSAIDs, including ketorolac, are commonly used in both RA and OA to relieve pain and inflammation, making this option incorrect. (C) Rofecoxib – Incorrect. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NSAID) that was previously used for pain relief in both RA and OA. However, it was withdrawn from the market due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Despite this, it was still effective in treating both conditions, making it an inappropriate choice as the correct answer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Increasing urate oxidation Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme used primarily for the management of hyperuricemia associated with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and, in some cases, refractory gout. It works by converting uric acid into allantoin, a more water-soluble compound that is easily excreted by the kidneys. This mechanism effectively lowers serum uric acid levels, preventing urate crystal formation and deposition in tissues. Unlike other gout medications that either reduce uric acid production or enhance its excretion, rasburicase directly breaks down uric acid into a more soluble form, making it highly effective in managing acute hyperuricemia. Incorrect Options: (A) Decreasing urate synthesis – Incorrect. Drugs that reduce uric acid synthesis target xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for converting hypoxanthine to uric acid. Allopurinol and febuxostat are examples of such drugs. However, rasburicase does not inhibit uric acid synthesis but instead breaks down existing uric acid, making this option incorrect. (B) Decreasing intestinal absorption of uric acid – Incorrect. Some experimental therapies target the intestinal absorption of uric acid, but no clinically established gout treatment works primarily through this mechanism. Rasburicase functions by oxidizing uric acid, not reducing its absorption from the gut. (C) Increasing renal excretion of uric acid – Incorrect. Uricosuric drugs like probenecid and lesinurad work by blocking renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, leading to increased uric acid excretion in the urine. Rasburicase, however, does not enhance renal excretion directly but rather converts uric acid into allantoin, which is then excreted.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Acute gouty arthritis Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces uric acid production by blocking the conversion of hypoxanthine to uric acid. While it is effective in the long-term management of gout, it is not used in acute gouty arthritis because it does not relieve inflammation or pain. In fact, initiating allopurinol during an acute gout attack can worsen or prolong the attack by causing fluctuations in uric acid levels, which can trigger further crystal mobilization in the joints. Instead, NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids are preferred for managing acute gout attacks. Allopurinol is introduced after the acute phase has resolved to prevent future attacks. Incorrect Options: (B) Cancer chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia – Incorrect. Cancer chemotherapy, especially for hematological malignancies, can lead to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), causing a massive release of nucleic acids that metabolize into uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury. Allopurinol is commonly used before or during chemotherapy to prevent excessive uric acid formation by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. This makes it an appropriate choice for this condition. (C) Hyperuricemia induced by Hydrochlorothiazide – Incorrect. Thiazide diuretics like hydrochlorothiazide can cause hyperuricemia by reducing uric acid excretion in the kidneys, increasing the risk of gout. Allopurinol can be used to lower chronic hyperuricemia in patients who develop gout due to thiazide use, making it a useful treatment in this scenario. (D) Kala-azar – Incorrect. Kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis) is treated with antimonials, amphotericin B, or miltefosine, but allopurinol has been studied as a potential adjunctive therapy. Some studies suggest that allopurinol has antileishmanial activity due to its effects on purine metabolism in Leishmania parasites, making it useful in some cases.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Indomethacin Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is widely used as the first-line treatment for acute gout attacks. It works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, which are responsible for pain, swelling, and inflammation in gout. Indomethacin is particularly effective because it provides rapid symptom relief, reduces joint inflammation, and has a favorable safety profile compared to colchicine when used appropriately. Other NSAIDs like naproxen and ibuprofen can also be used, but indomethacin remains the most commonly preferred NSAID for acute gout management. Incorrect Options: (A) Colchicine – Incorrect. While colchicine is an effective treatment for acute gout, it is not the first-line choice due to its narrow therapeutic index and risk of severe side effects, including gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and bone marrow suppression. Colchicine works by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, which prevents neutrophil migration and reduces inflammation. It is typically used when NSAIDs are contraindicated. (B) Allopurinol – Incorrect. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is used for the long-term prevention of gout by reducing uric acid production. However, it is not effective for acute gout attacks and can even worsen an ongoing attack if started during an episode. Allopurinol is initiated only after the acute phase has resolved to prevent future flare-ups. (C) Dexamethasone – Incorrect. Corticosteroids like dexamethasone can be used in severe cases of acute gout, especially in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine. However, oral or intra-articular corticosteroids (like prednisone or methylprednisolone) are preferred over dexamethasone. Since NSAIDs are the standard first-line treatment, dexamethasone is not the drug of choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Sulfinpyrazone Sulfinpyrazone is a uricosuric drug that lowers uric acid levels by inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal tubules, thereby increasing renal excretion of uric acid. This makes it useful in the treatment of chronic gout to prevent hyperuricemia and gouty attacks. Since sulfinpyrazone helps reduce uric acid levels rather than increase them, it does not cause hyperuricemia, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Ethambutol – Incorrect. Ethambutol, an anti-tubercular drug, is known to cause hyperuricemia by inhibiting renal tubular excretion of uric acid, leading to its accumulation in the blood. This can trigger gouty arthritis in susceptible individuals. (C) Pyrazinamide – Incorrect. Pyrazinamide, another anti-tubercular drug, significantly reduces uric acid excretion by competing with uric acid for renal excretion, leading to hyperuricemia. It is a well-known cause of drug-induced gout. (D) Hydrochlorothiazide – Incorrect. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, causes hyperuricemia by increasing uric acid reabsorption in the renal tubules. This effect predisposes patients to gout, making it a common concern in hypertensive patients using thiazides for blood pressure control.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) History of peptic ulcer disease Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, which means it primarily inhibits the COX-2 enzyme involved in inflammation, while sparing the COX-1 enzyme that plays a protective role in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by promoting gastric mucus production. This selectivity reduces the risk of GI side effects, such as gastric ulcers, which are common with non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen). Therefore, celecoxib is preferred in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease because it is less likely to cause gastric mucosal damage than non-selective NSAIDs. Incorrect Options: (B) History of severe rash after treatment with a sulfonamide antibiotic – Incorrect. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide-containing drug, and patients with a history of severe rash or allergic reaction to sulfonamide antibiotics may be at increased risk of cross-reactivity. Celecoxib should be used cautiously or avoided in patients with sulfonamide allergies, as a severe rash could occur. (C) History of gout – Incorrect. Celecoxib is an anti-inflammatory drug, but it is not the first-line treatment for gout. For gout, uric acid-lowering therapies (e.g., allopurinol) and colchicine are more commonly used for treatment and prevention. NSAIDs (including celecoxib) can be used to manage acute flare-ups of gout, but it is not specifically chosen for gout management. (D) History of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) – Incorrect. There is no direct benefit of celecoxib for managing type 2 DM. While NSAIDs (including celecoxib) can be used to treat inflammation in conditions like arthritis, they do not affect blood glucose levels or insulin sensitivity in a way that would benefit a patient with type 2 diabetes. The use of celecoxib would not be primarily influenced by a history of DM.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thioguanine Thioguanine is a purine analog used in the treatment of certain leukemias. Unlike 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine, which are metabolized by xanthine oxidase (XO), thioguanine is primarily inactivated by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and does not significantly depend on xanthine oxidase for metabolism. Since Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it does not significantly impact thioguanine metabolism, meaning its dose does not need to be reduced during allopurinol therapy. Incorrect Options: (B) 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) – Incorrect. 6-MP is metabolized by xanthine oxidase, which is inhibited by allopurinol. If allopurinol is given along with 6-MP, it can lead to severe toxicity due to accumulation of 6-MP, including bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the dose of 6-MP must be reduced when given with allopurinol. (C) Azathioprine – Incorrect. Azathioprine is a prodrug of 6-MP and follows the same metabolic pathway. Since allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, co-administration increases the risk of myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, requiring dose adjustment. (D) All of the above – Incorrect. Since thioguanine does not require dose adjustment, but 6-MP and azathioprine do, this statement is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is primarily used for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. However, it also has several orphan drug uses, meaning it is used for rare conditions where alternative treatments are limited. These include: (A) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome – Allopurinol is used off-label to manage hyperuricemia in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency. This leads to excessive uric acid production, causing gout, kidney stones, and neurological symptoms. Since allopurinol reduces uric acid levels, it can help manage the gouty complications in these patients. (B) Chagas disease – Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects the heart and digestive system. Allopurinol has been studied as an experimental therapy because T. cruzi relies on purine metabolism, and inhibition of xanthine oxidase can disrupt its survival. Though not a first-line treatment, allopurinol has been considered as a potential therapy in some cases. (C) Ex vivo preservation of cadaveric kidneys prior to transplantation – Allopurinol is used in organ preservation protocols to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in cadaveric kidney transplantation. It helps by decreasing oxidative stress and uric acid accumulation, improving organ viability before transplantation. Since all three conditions are recognized as orphan uses of allopurinol, the correct answer is (D) All of the above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Rheumatoid Arthritis Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in joint inflammation, synovial hyperplasia, and bone erosion seen in RA. By blocking IL-6 receptor signaling, tocilizumab helps reduce inflammation, slow disease progression, and improve symptoms in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in those unresponsive to TNF inhibitors or methotrexate. It is also approved for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Incorrect Options: (A) Multicentric Castleman’s disease – While IL-6 plays a role in Castleman’s disease, tocilizumab is not the primary treatment. Instead, siltuximab, another IL-6 inhibitor, is FDA-approved for multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD). Tocilizumab may be used off-label in some cases, but it is not the standard of care. (B) Systemic Sclerosis – Tocilizumab has been investigated in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), particularly for interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). However, it is not a first-line therapy for systemic sclerosis, and its efficacy is still being evaluated in clinical trials. (C) Chronic Gout – Tocilizumab is not used for chronic gout. Instead, urate-lowering therapies (allopurinol, febuxostat) and IL-1 inhibitors (canakinumab, anakinra) are more effective in treating severe or refractory gout. Since tocilizumab is primarily indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, the correct answer is (D) Rheumatoid Arthritis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Inhibits the synthesis of uric acid Colchicine does not inhibit the synthesis of uric acid. Instead, it works by reducing inflammation associated with acute gout. Uric acid synthesis is primarily controlled by xanthine oxidase, and drugs like allopurinol and febuxostat inhibit this enzyme to lower uric acid levels. Colchicine, however, does not interfere with uric acid production and is not a urate-lowering drug. Incorrect Options: (B) Binds to tubulin and causes its depolymerization – Correct mechanism. Colchicine binds to tubulin, a structural protein of microtubules, leading to depolymerization and disruption of cytoskeletal function. This prevents the migration and adhesion of inflammatory cells like neutrophils to the affected joints, reducing inflammation in acute gout attacks. (C) Colchicine blocks cell division by binding to mitotic spindles – Correct mechanism. By disrupting microtubule function, colchicine arrests cell division in metaphase, preventing mitotic spindle formation. This effect contributes to its toxicity at high doses, particularly affecting rapidly dividing cells in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. (D) Colchicine inhibits the synthesis and release of leukotrienes – Correct mechanism. Colchicine suppresses the activation of neutrophils, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes (e.g., LTB4) that mediate inflammation and pain in gout. This further limits the inflammatory response.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reduces purine synthesis in actively dividing cells This statement is false because leflunomide does not reduce purine synthesis; instead, it inhibits pyrimidine synthesis. Leflunomide works by blocking dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This leads to a reduction in the availability of uridine monophosphate (UMP), which is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, particularly T and B lymphocytes. By selectively targeting pyrimidine synthesis, leflunomide suppresses the proliferation of immune cells involved in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Incorrect Options: (A) Used in the treatment of RA: This statement is true. Leflunomide is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis. It helps in reducing inflammation and joint damage by inhibiting immune cell proliferation. (C) Acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase: This statement is true. Leflunomide specifically inhibits DHODH, which is an essential enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This inhibition decreases the production of pyrimidine nucleotides, thereby limiting the proliferation of activated immune cells. (D) Inhibits proliferation of T and B cells: This statement is true. By blocking pyrimidine synthesis, leflunomide prevents the expansion of rapidly dividing T and B lymphocytes, which play a crucial role in autoimmune diseases like RA.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Colchicine. Colchicine is commonly used for acute gout attacks and works by inhibiting microtubule polymerization, which prevents neutrophil migration and inflammatory response. The presence of needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals in joint aspirate confirms gout, which is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition. While colchicine is effective in reducing inflammation, it has a narrow therapeutic window and frequently causes gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, as seen in this patient. These adverse effects are due to colchicine's impact on rapidly dividing cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Incorrect Options: A. Allopurinol: Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to lower uric acid levels in chronic gout but is not used during an acute attack, as it can paradoxically worsen symptoms. Additionally, allopurinol does not cause immediate gastrointestinal side effects like colchicine. B. Steroids: Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) can be used in acute gout attacks, especially in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine. They do not commonly cause severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea when taken orally or intra-articularly. C. Indomethacin: Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for acute gout. It can cause gastrointestinal irritation and ulceration, but severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are less common compared to colchicine.",
