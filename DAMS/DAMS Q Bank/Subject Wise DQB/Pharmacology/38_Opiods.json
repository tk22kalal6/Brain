      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Pentazocine Pentazocine is an opioid analgesic that acts primarily through opioid receptors, specifically as an agonist at kappa (κ) opioid receptors and a partial agonist or antagonist at mu (μ) opioid receptors. Its analgesic effects are mainly mediated via kappa receptors, which contribute to pain relief but may also cause dysphoria and hallucinations. Unlike full mu agonists like morphine or methadone, pentazocine has a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, making it less dangerous in overdose but also limiting its analgesic efficacy. Incorrect Options: Option A (Pethidine): Pethidine (meperidine) is a mu-opioid receptor agonist, meaning it acts on opioid receptors. However, it also has anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties, which contribute to its analgesic effects. Additionally, its metabolite, normeperidine, has neurotoxic effects, including seizures. Because pethidine's action is not solely through opioid receptors, this option is incorrect. Option B (Methadone): Methadone is a full mu-opioid receptor agonist and is primarily used for pain management and opioid dependence. However, it also acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which contributes to its unique analgesic profile and helps prevent opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Since its action is not exclusively through opioid receptors, this option is incorrect. Option C (Buprenorphine): Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at mu-opioid receptors and an antagonist at kappa receptors. This dual action gives it a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, reducing the risk of overdose. However, its action is not solely dependent on opioid receptor activation, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ischemic heart disease patients Morphine is not contraindicated in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients; in fact, it is beneficial in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), particularly in myocardial infarction (MI) with severe pain. Morphine helps by: Reducing pain and anxiety, which lowers sympathetic outflow, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Causing venodilation, which reduces preload and cardiac workload. Dilating coronary arteries, potentially improving myocardial oxygen supply. Because of these effects, morphine is part of the MONA (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitrates, Aspirin) protocol in ACS management, making it safe and useful in IHD patients. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A (Elderly male patients): Morphine should be used with caution in elderly patients due to their decreased renal and hepatic clearance, leading to prolonged drug effects and a higher risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and confusion. Additionally, morphine can cause urinary retention, which is more problematic in elderly males with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Option B (Bronchial asthma patients): Morphine is contraindicated in asthma because it causes histamine release, which can trigger bronchospasm and worsen respiratory distress. Additionally, morphine-induced respiratory depression can further compromise oxygenation in asthmatic patients. Option D (Biliary colic patients): Morphine is not preferred in biliary colic because it causes spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, leading to increased biliary pressure and pain exacerbation. NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac) or alternative opioids like buprenorphine are preferred in biliary colic.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Morphine. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those on hemodialysis, the renal clearance of many drugs, including morphine, is impaired. Morphine and its metabolites (such as morphine-6-glucuronide) are excreted by the kidneys and can accumulate in renal impairment. Accumulation of these metabolites can lead to toxicity, resulting in side effects such as sedation, respiratory depression, and altered mental status. Therefore, morphine is generally avoided in patients with severe renal failure or those on hemodialysis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Methadone – Incorrect. Methadone is a synthetic opioid that has a long half-life and is primarily metabolized by the liver, rather than being excreted by the kidneys. This makes it a safer option for patients with CKD, as it does not accumulate in the same way as morphine. However, careful dosing is required due to its long half-life and potential for QT interval prolongation, but methadone is generally preferred over morphine for pain management in patients with kidney failure. (C) Buprenorphine – Incorrect. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that is also primarily metabolized by the liver. It has a ceiling effect for respiratory depression, which makes it safer in certain populations, including those with renal impairment. Buprenorphine is commonly used in pain management for patients with chronic kidney disease because it has a lower risk of accumulating toxic metabolites compared to full agonists like morphine. It is generally considered a safe and effective option in this patient population. (D) Alfentanil – Incorrect. Alfentanil is a short-acting opioid that is metabolized in the liver and has minimal renal clearance. While it requires careful monitoring in patients with renal impairment due to potential changes in drug metabolism, it is generally safer than morphine in patients with stage 4 CKD and those on hemodialysis. Its short duration of action allows for easier management of potential side effects, and it does not accumulate as much as morphine in patients with renal failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Naltrexone Explanation for the Correct Answer: The patient is experiencing opioid-induced constipation (OIC) due to long-term morphine use for cancer pain. This condition can become refractory to conventional laxatives and requires peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs), which block opioid effects in the gut without affecting analgesia. Naltrexone is not suitable for treating opioid-induced constipation because: It is a centrally acting opioid antagonist, meaning it blocks opioid effects in both the brain and gut. If given to a patient on chronic morphine therapy, it can precipitate opioid withdrawal and worsen pain control. Unlike Methylnaltrexone, Alvimopan, and Naloxegol, which are peripherally acting, Naltrexone crosses the blood-brain barrier, making it unsuitable for opioid-induced constipation. Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: (A) Methylnaltrexone A peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) that relieves constipation without affecting central opioid analgesia. Approved for opioid-induced constipation (OIC), especially in palliative care patients. Given subcutaneously and works quickly. (B) Alvimopan Another peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Mostly used in postoperative ileus but can be effective in OIC. Does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it does not interfere with pain relief. (D) Naloxegol A PEGylated derivative of naloxone, designed to block opioid receptors in the gut while preserving central analgesia. Given orally, making it convenient for long-term use. Approved for chronic opioid-induced constipation.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Morphine, as it should be avoided in patients with head injury. Morphine is a potent opioid analgesic that acts on mu-opioid receptors to provide pain relief. However, in cases of head injury, morphine and other opioids can increase intracranial pressure (ICP) by causing respiratory depression and CO? retention, leading to cerebral vasodilation. This can worsen brain swelling and neurological deterioration, making opioid use particularly dangerous in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Additionally, opioids can mask signs of neurological deterioration, such as changes in mental status, making clinical assessment difficult. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option B - Diazepam: Correct. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to control seizures, muscle spasms, and anxiety in patients with head trauma. It acts by enhancing GABAergic inhibition in the central nervous system. However, while it may cause mild sedation, it does not significantly increase ICP like opioids do. Option C - Chlorpromazine: Correct. Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic with sedative properties, which can help control agitation and vomiting in head injury patients. It also has antiemetic effects by blocking dopamine D? receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). However, it should be used cautiously, as excessive sedation can interfere with neurological assessments. Option D - Phenobarbitone: Correct. Phenobarbitone is a barbiturate that can be used to control seizures in head injury patients. In fact, barbiturates are sometimes used in barbiturate coma therapy to reduce intracranial pressure in severe TBI cases by decreasing cerebral metabolic demand. Unlike opioids, phenobarbitone does not cause CO? retention, making it safer in this context.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Reduce the dose of gabapentin. Gabapentin is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain, and its dose-dependent side effects include dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, and fatigue. These side effects are more common in elderly patients due to slower drug clearance and increased CNS sensitivity. Gradual dose reduction can help alleviate these symptoms while still providing pain relief. Additionally, starting with a low dose and titrating gradually is the best approach to minimize adverse effects while maintaining therapeutic benefit. Explanation of Incorrect Options: Option A - Discontinue gabapentin immediately: Incorrect. Abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, and rebound pain. Instead, a gradual dose tapering approach is recommended if discontinuation is necessary. Since the patient is experiencing improvement in pain, reducing rather than stopping the medication is the better strategy. Option C - Switch to a different neuropathic pain medication: Incorrect. Although alternatives like pregabalin, duloxetine, or tricyclic antidepressants are available for neuropathic pain, switching immediately is not the first-line approach. Many other medications have similar side effects, and switching may require titration and adjustment, leading to delayed symptom control. Instead, adjusting the gabapentin dose should be tried first. Option D - Increase the dose of gabapentin: Incorrect. Increasing the dose would likely worsen the dizziness and somnolence rather than help. Since these side effects are dose-dependent, a higher dose would only exacerbate the problem rather than manage it.",
