      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pneumocystis jiroveci The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is highly effective against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), a life-threatening opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. PJP is a fungal infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS, causing progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and hypoxia. TMP-SMX works by inhibiting folate synthesis at two different steps, effectively preventing the growth of Pneumocystis jiroveci. It is the first-line treatment and prophylactic drug for PJP in AIDS patients with CD4+ counts below 200 cells/mm³. Incorrect Options: (A) Disseminated Herpes simplex: Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections require antiviral therapy with drugs like Acyclovir or Valacyclovir, not TMP-SMX. Disseminated HSV can cause severe complications, including encephalitis and hepatitis in immunocompromised individuals, but it does not respond to TMP-SMX. (C) Cryptococcal meningitis: Incorrect. Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungal pathogen, is treated with Amphotericin B and Flucytosine in the acute phase, followed by Fluconazole for maintenance therapy. TMP-SMX has no activity against Cryptococcus species and is not used in its treatment. (D) Tuberculosis: Incorrect. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is treated with first-line anti-TB drugs (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol - RIPE regimen). TMP-SMX is ineffective against M. tuberculosis and is not part of standard TB treatment.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ofloxacin Ofloxacin is highly active against Mycobacterium leprae and is used as part of alternative multidrug therapy (MDT) regimens for leprosy. It is a fluoroquinolone with strong bactericidal activity against M. leprae and is particularly useful in cases of resistance to standard drugs like dapsone, rifampicin, or clofazimine. The WHO has recommended ofloxacin-based regimens for patients who cannot tolerate first-line drugs. Additionally, its good oral bioavailability and tissue penetration make it an effective option in leprosy treatment. Incorrect Options: (A) Norfloxacin: Incorrect. Norfloxacin is primarily used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and does not exhibit strong activity against M. leprae. Its poor tissue penetration and limited systemic activity make it ineffective for treating leprosy. (B) Ciprofloxacin: Incorrect. Although ciprofloxacin has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, it is not as potent against M. leprae as ofloxacin. While some studies have shown partial efficacy, ofloxacin remains the preferred fluoroquinolone in leprosy treatment due to better activity and clinical effectiveness. (D) Lomefloxacin: Incorrect. Lomefloxacin has poor activity against M. leprae and is mainly used for respiratory and urinary tract infections. It does not play a significant role in the treatment of leprosy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Skin reactions Sulfonamides are most commonly associated with skin reactions, which can range from mild rashes to severe hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These reactions occur due to the immune response against sulfonamide metabolites, which can act as haptens and trigger delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Other common dermatological manifestations include maculopapular rashes, photosensitivity, and exfoliative dermatitis. Incorrect Options: (A) Neurologic effects including headache, dizziness, and lethargy: Incorrect. While sulfonamides can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause mild CNS effects like headache or dizziness, these are not the most common adverse effects. Severe neurotoxicity is rare, and skin reactions are far more frequent and clinically significant. (C) Fanconi's anemia: Incorrect. Fanconi's anemia is a genetic disorder that results in bone marrow failure, not a direct drug-induced effect. Some medications like tetracyclines (when expired) can cause a Fanconi-like syndrome, but sulfonamides do not lead to Fanconi’s anemia. (D) Hematuria: Incorrect. Sulfonamides can cause crystalluria and nephrotoxicity, leading to hematuria in some cases, but this is not the most common adverse effect. Adequate hydration is recommended to prevent precipitation of sulfa crystals in the renal tubules, but skin reactions are still more frequently observed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A fluoroquinolone is the drug of choice for treatment of an uncomplicated urinary tract infection in a 7-year-old girl Fluoroquinolones are generally avoided in children due to concerns about cartilage toxicity and the risk of tendon rupture. These drugs can interfere with the normal development of weight-bearing joints, as demonstrated in animal studies. For uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children, first-line options typically include beta-lactams (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), rather than fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones are only considered in pediatric cases when no safer alternatives are available, such as in complicated UTIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Incorrect Options: (B) Modification of fluoroquinolone dosage is required in patients if creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL/min: Correct. Most fluoroquinolones (except moxifloxacin) are renally excreted, and their doses must be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function (CrCl <50 mL/min) to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity. Moxifloxacin is primarily metabolized in the liver, so dose adjustment is not necessary in renal impairment. (C) Gonococcal resistance to fluoroquinolones may involve changes in DNA gyrase: Correct. Fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for DNA replication. Gonococcal resistance often develops due to mutations in the genes encoding DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB), leading to reduced drug binding and treatment failure. This is why fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for gonorrhea treatment in many regions. (D) Fluoroquinolones inhibit relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA: Correct. Fluoroquinolones block bacterial DNA replication by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, preventing the relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA, which is essential for transcription and replication. This mechanism ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase Sulfonamides do not inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase; instead, they act by inhibiting dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme involved in the folic acid synthesis pathway of bacteria. Dihydropteroate synthase is essential for converting para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) into dihydropteroic acid, a precursor of folic acid. Since folic acid is necessary for bacterial DNA synthesis, inhibiting this enzyme ultimately disrupts bacterial growth and replication. On the other hand, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is inhibited by drugs like trimethoprim (in bacteria) and methotrexate (in humans), not by sulfonamides. This is why sulfonamides are often combined with trimethoprim (as in trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or TMP-SMX) to exert a synergistic effect on folic acid inhibition at different steps in the pathway. Incorrect Options: (A) Sulfonamide crystalluria is most likely to occur at low urinary pH: Correct. Sulfonamides can precipitate in acidic urine, leading to crystalluria and kidney damage. Older sulfonamides were especially prone to this issue due to their low solubility, but newer sulfonamides (such as sulfamethoxazole) have improved solubility. Patients are advised to increase fluid intake and alkalinize urine (e.g., with sodium bicarbonate) to prevent crystalluria. (B) Dysfunction of the basal ganglia may occur in the newborn if sulfonamides are administered late in pregnancy: Correct. Sulfonamides displace bilirubin from albumin-binding sites, increasing free bilirubin levels in neonates. Since the newborn's immature liver cannot effectively conjugate bilirubin, this can lead to kernicterus, a form of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity that particularly affects the basal ganglia. For this reason, sulfonamides are contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and in neonates. (D) Sulfonamides are antimetabolites: Correct. Sulfonamides act as structural analogs of PABA, competing with it to inhibit dihydropteroate synthase, thereby disrupting bacterial folate metabolism. Because they interfere with an essential bacterial metabolic pathway, they are classified as antimetabolites.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Moxifloxacin Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone that has a unique mechanism of action compared to earlier fluoroquinolones. It inhibits both bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), which are essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair. By inhibiting topoisomerase IV, moxifloxacin interferes with the separation of newly replicated bacterial DNA strands, preventing bacterial cell division. Additionally, by targeting DNA gyrase, it blocks the supercoiling process necessary for DNA stability. This dual inhibition enhances its effectiveness against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical pathogens. Incorrect Options: (A) Ciprofloxacin – Incorrect Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone that primarily inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), making it highly effective against Gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it has lesser activity against topoisomerase IV, making it less effective against Gram-positive bacteria compared to moxifloxacin. (B) Norfloxacin – Incorrect Norfloxacin is another second-generation fluoroquinolone that mainly inhibits DNA gyrase, with limited inhibition of topoisomerase IV. It has a narrower spectrum of activity, primarily used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and gastrointestinal infections, but is less effective against systemic infections compared to newer fluoroquinolones like moxifloxacin. (D) Ofloxacin – Incorrect Ofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone, has a mechanism of action similar to ciprofloxacin, mainly targeting DNA gyrase with less inhibition of topoisomerase IV. Although it has a broader spectrum than norfloxacin, it is less effective against Gram-positive organisms than moxifloxacin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a sulfonamide-containing antibiotic that should be avoided in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency leads to reduced levels of NADPH, which is necessary to maintain glutathione levels that protect red blood cells from oxidative damage. Sulfonamides, including sulfamethoxazole, act as oxidative stressors, leading to hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. This hemolysis can result in jaundice, anemia, and dark-colored urine, particularly after drug exposure. Incorrect Options: (A) Ciprofloxacin – Incorrect Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, has been implicated in rare cases of hemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients, but the risk is lower than with sulfonamides. While it is not the preferred choice in G6PD deficiency, it is not as strongly contraindicated as TMP-SMX. Other fluoroquinolones, such as norfloxacin and levofloxacin, may also have some oxidative potential but are not as commonly associated with hemolysis. (B) Chloramphenicol – Incorrect Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and is primarily associated with bone marrow suppression and aplastic anemia, rather than hemolysis due to G6PD deficiency. However, in some cases, oxidative stress caused by chloramphenicol may lead to hemolytic anemia, but it is less common than with sulfonamides. Due to its toxicity profile, chloramphenicol use is generally limited to severe infections like typhoid fever and bacterial meningitis when no alternatives are available. (D) Vancomycin – Incorrect Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that primarily causes nephrotoxicity and \"Red Man Syndrome\", a histamine-mediated reaction, but it does not induce oxidative stress leading to hemolysis. It is safe for use in patients with G6PD deficiency.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is well known for its potential to cause tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in the Achilles tendon. This adverse effect is more common in older adults, patients on corticosteroids, and those with kidney disease. The mechanism behind this toxicity is believed to involve collagen degradation and inhibition of tendon fibroblast function, leading to weakened tendons and an increased risk of rupture. Because of this risk, fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin should be used with caution in high-risk individuals, and alternative antibiotics should be considered whenever possible. Incorrect Options: (B) Azithromycin – Incorrect Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, does not affect tendons or increase the risk of rupture. Instead, its major concerns involve QT prolongation and the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in patients with underlying heart conditions. (C) Metronidazole – Incorrect Metronidazole, commonly used for anaerobic and protozoal infections, does not cause tendon rupture. However, it is associated with neurological side effects, such as peripheral neuropathy and a disulfiram-like reaction when combined with alcohol. (D) Cefotaxime – Incorrect Cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, has no known effect on tendons. It is widely used for severe bacterial infections, including meningitis and pneumonia, but does not cause tendon rupture as a side effect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, exerts its antibacterial effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair. By disrupting these processes, ciprofloxacin effectively kills bacteria, making it a potent bactericidal agent. Ciprofloxacin has excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is often responsible for hospital-acquired infections, urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory infections, and skin infections. Due to its broad-spectrum activity, oral bioavailability, and ability to penetrate tissues well, ciprofloxacin is widely used in both community and hospital settings. Incorrect Options: (A) Cefepime – Incorrect Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, not by binding to DNA gyrase. While cefepime is a strong option for treating Pseudomonas infections, it does not share ciprofloxacin’s mechanism of action. (C) Tobramycin – Incorrect Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is also effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It is often used in nebulized form for cystic fibrosis patients or as part of combination therapy for severe Pseudomonas infections. (D) Piperacillin – Incorrect Piperacillin, a broad-spectrum penicillin, is often combined with tazobactam to enhance its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, not by targeting DNA gyrase. While it is highly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, it does not share ciprofloxacin’s mechanism of action.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Nitrofurantoin Nitrofurantoin is a unique antibiotic used primarily for urinary tract infections (UTIs). It works by undergoing bacterial nitroreductase-mediated reduction, which generates highly reactive intermediates. These intermediates damage bacterial DNA, proteins, and other macromolecules, leading to bacterial cell death. This unique mechanism of action makes nitrofurantoin effective against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative uropathogens, including Escherichia coli. Due to its concentrated excretion in urine, nitrofurantoin is particularly useful for lower urinary tract infections but not for systemic infections. Incorrect Options: (B) Vancomycin – Incorrect Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It binds to D-Ala-D-Ala termini of peptidoglycan precursors, preventing their incorporation into the cell wall. Unlike nitrofurantoin, it does not generate reactive intermediates or directly damage bacterial DNA. (C) Azithromycin – Incorrect Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and preventing translocation. It does not damage bacterial DNA or generate reactive intermediates. (D) Cefazolin – Incorrect Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis through beta-lactam ring-mediated inhibition of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). It does not cause direct DNA damage like nitrofurantoin.",
