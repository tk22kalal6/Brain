      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) It is an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation. Trimetazidine is a metabolic anti-ischemic agent that works by inhibiting 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (3-KAT), an enzyme involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. By shifting myocardial energy metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation, trimetazidine enhances ATP production efficiency under ischemic conditions. This reduces oxygen consumption and oxidative stress, making it useful in conditions like stable angina, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Incorrect Options: (B) It improves tissue perfusion by modifying the rheological property of blood – Incorrect. Trimetazidine does not affect blood viscosity or rheological properties. Instead, it directly optimizes myocardial metabolism without causing changes in blood flow or vascular resistance. Drugs like pentoxifylline influence blood rheology, but trimetazidine does not. (C) It is a novel sodium channel blocker – Incorrect. Trimetazidine is not a sodium channel blocker. Instead, agents like ranolazine exert anti-anginal effects by inhibiting late sodium channels, reducing intracellular calcium overload and improving myocardial relaxation. (D) Both (A) and (B) are correct – Incorrect. Since option (B) is incorrect, this choice is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Aspirin. Aspirin is commonly used as long-term therapy for the prevention of recurrent strokes, particularly in patients who have had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). It works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and reducing the risk of further thromboembolic events. In the case of an elderly patient like Nanda, who suffered a stroke and was treated with alteplase (a thrombolytic), aspirin is typically recommended after the acute phase to help prevent recurrence. Incorrect options: A. Urokinase: Urokinase is another thrombolytic agent, but it is not used for long-term prevention of stroke. It is used acutely for dissolving blood clots during the early management phase, not for ongoing stroke prevention. B. Warfarin: Warfarin is an anticoagulant used in specific cases, like in patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves, to prevent clot formation. However, it is not the first-line treatment for stroke prevention in atherosclerosis-related strokes, where aspirin is preferred due to its efficacy and safety profile. D. Enoxaparin: Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin used for short-term prevention of clot formation in hospitalized patients. It is not suitable for long-term use for stroke prevention and is not typically prescribed indefinitely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Statins. Statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin) are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, one of the well-known side effects of statins is muscle pain (myalgia) and muscle weakness. This occurs in a subset of patients, possibly due to disruption of muscle cell metabolism or increased creatine kinase (CK) levels. In rare cases, statins can lead to rhabdomyolysis, a severe form of muscle damage. For patients concerned about muscle-related side effects, alternative treatments or dose adjustments may be considered. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) ARBs – Incorrect. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (e.g., losartan, valsartan) are used to manage hypertension and heart failure. They work by blocking the effects of angiotensin II, which causes vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. While ARBs can cause some side effects like dizziness or hyperkalemia, they are not associated with muscle pain or weakness. Therefore, muscle-related side effects are not commonly linked to ARBs. (C) Beta-blockers – Incorrect. Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol) are used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and arrhythmias by reducing heart rate and blood pressure. Although they can cause fatigue, bradycardia, and exercise intolerance, they are not commonly associated with muscle pain or weakness. Muscle-related side effects are generally not a major concern with beta-blockers. (D) Calcium channel blockers – Incorrect. Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, amlodipine) are used to treat hypertension and angina by causing vasodilation and reducing heart rate in some cases. While they may cause peripheral edema, headache, or dizziness, muscle pain or weakness is not a typical side effect. Therefore, they are not commonly associated with muscle-related side effects.",

Which of the following antihypertensive medications is least likely to affect lipid levels?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). ARBs are the least likely to affect lipid levels among the options listed. Angiotensin II receptor blockers work by blocking the effects of angiotensin II, which leads to vasodilation, lowered blood pressure, and reduced workload on the heart. Unlike beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, ARBs have a neutral effect on lipid profiles and are not typically associated with elevated triglycerides or reduced HDL cholesterol. This makes ARBs an ideal choice for patients concerned about maintaining or improving their lipid levels while managing hypertension. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Beta-blockers – Incorrect. Beta-blockers, especially older non-selective ones, can adversely affect lipid profiles. They are known to increase triglyceride levels and decrease HDL cholesterol, which may raise concerns in patients with preexisting lipid abnormalities or those at risk for cardiovascular disease. While newer beta-blockers like metoprolol have a somewhat less pronounced effect on lipids, they can still contribute to lipid profile changes in some patients. (B) Thiazide diuretics – Incorrect. Thiazide diuretics are commonly used to treat hypertension, but they can have an adverse effect on lipid profiles, especially at higher doses. They are known to cause an increase in cholesterol levels, particularly total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and may also raise triglycerides. This effect is generally dose-dependent, and while it may not be significant in all patients, it is something to consider in those with concerns about lipid management. (D) Calcium channel blockers – Incorrect. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs), particularly dihydropyridines (e.g., amlodipine), tend to have a neutral or mildly positive effect on lipid profiles. However, some non-dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g., verapamil and diltiazem) may have a slight tendency to increase lipid levels, particularly triglycerides. Nonetheless, CCBs are generally considered to have a minimal effect on lipid profiles compared to beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, but they are not as neutral as ARBs.",
