      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dapsone. Dapsone is a sulfone antibiotic used in the multidrug therapy (MDT) of leprosy, particularly for multibacillary leprosy. A major adverse effect of dapsone is dose-dependent hemolysis, especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Chronic hemolysis can lead to anemia, manifesting as fatigue, pallor, and decreased work capacity, which are seen in this patient. Additionally, dapsone syndrome (a hypersensitivity reaction) can occur within a few weeks of therapy, presenting with fever, rash, and hepatitis. However, in this case, the symptoms strongly suggest dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia. Incorrect Options: A. Rifampicin: Incorrect. Rifampicin is a key drug in MDT for leprosy but is not commonly associated with anemia. Instead, it can cause hepatotoxicity, flu-like syndrome, and orange discoloration of body fluids. Rarely, rifampicin can lead to bone marrow suppression, but this is not a frequent cause of the patient’s symptoms. B. Clofazimine: Incorrect. Clofazimine is primarily associated with skin pigmentation (red-brown discoloration) and gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea and abdominal pain. It does not typically cause anemia or fatigue. C. Minocycline: Incorrect. Minocycline, sometimes used as an alternative in leprosy treatment, can cause dizziness, vertigo, and skin pigmentation, but it does not lead to hemolysis or significant anemia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Pretomanid is a nitroimidazo-oxazine class antibiotic used primarily in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). It exhibits multiple mechanisms of action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, making it highly effective. Inhibition of Mycolic Acid Synthesis: Pretomanid, under aerobic conditions, inhibits mycolic acid biosynthesis, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. This weakens the structural integrity of M. tuberculosis, leading to bacterial death. Generation of Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS): Under anaerobic conditions, pretomanid undergoes nitroreduction, leading to the production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which cause oxidative and nitrosative stress, ultimately killing the bacteria. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis: Pretomanid also interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, further enhancing its bactericidal activity. Thus, since pretomanid acts through all three mechanisms, option D (All of the above) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: A. Inhibits M. tuberculosis mycolic acid synthesis: Correct but incomplete. While pretomanid does inhibit mycolic acid synthesis under aerobic conditions, it also has additional mechanisms of action, making this option partially correct but not the best choice. B. Inhibits M. tuberculosis protein synthesis: Correct but incomplete. Although pretomanid affects protein synthesis, it is not its primary mechanism. Therefore, this option alone does not fully describe its activity. C. Generates reactive nitrogen species: Correct but incomplete. Pretomanid generates reactive nitrogen species (RNS) under anaerobic conditions, leading to bacterial death. However, it also affects cell wall synthesis and protein synthesis, making this option alone insufficient.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Bedaquiline. Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antitubercular drug that acts by specifically inhibiting mycobacterial ATP synthase, an essential enzyme required for ATP production in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. ATP synthase plays a critical role in generating cellular energy, and its inhibition leads to energy depletion and bacterial death, making bedaquiline a highly effective bactericidal agent. It is particularly useful in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, bedaquiline is associated with QT prolongation and should be used with caution. Incorrect Options: A. Isoniazid: Incorrect. Isoniazid primarily inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, which is essential for the mycobacterial cell wall. It does not target ATP synthase. B. Rifampicin: Incorrect. Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, thereby preventing transcription and protein synthesis. It is a key first-line drug for tuberculosis but does not affect ATP synthesis. C. Ethambutol: Incorrect. Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferase, an enzyme required for cell wall synthesis in M. tuberculosis. It does not interfere with ATP production.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rifampicin. Rifampicin is the safest first-line anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) drug in patients with renal failure because it is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted through biliary elimination rather than the kidneys. As a result, no dose adjustment is required in renal impairment. This makes rifampicin the preferred drug in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or renal failure who require ATT. Incorrect Options: B. Streptomycin: Incorrect. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside, which is nephrotoxic and excreted unchanged by the kidneys. In renal failure, its clearance is significantly reduced, leading to accumulation and increased risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Therefore, streptomycin is contraindicated in renal failure or requires major dose adjustments. C. Isoniazid: Incorrect. Isoniazid is metabolized by the liver and partially excreted by the kidneys. While it is generally safe in renal failure, metabolite accumulation can occur, potentially increasing the risk of neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy and seizures), especially in slow acetylators. Thus, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation is recommended in such cases. D. Ethambutol: Incorrect. Ethambutol is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and dose adjustments are necessary in renal failure to prevent optic neuritis, a serious dose-dependent adverse effect. Patients with renal impairment are at a higher risk of vision-related complications if ethambutol accumulates.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Isoniazid. \"Shoulder-hand syndrome\" (also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome - CRPS) is a rare neurological complication associated with isoniazid therapy. Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy, which may lead to pain, swelling, and stiffness in the shoulder and hand, characteristic of this syndrome. This occurs due to neuronal dysfunction and altered sympathetic nervous system activity. The risk of neuropathy is increased in slow acetylators, diabetics, alcoholics, and malnourished individuals. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation is recommended to prevent this side effect. Incorrect Options: A. Ethambutol: Incorrect. Ethambutol is primarily associated with optic neuritis, leading to visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, red-green color blindness), but it does not cause shoulder-hand syndrome. B. Streptomycin: Incorrect. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside that primarily causes ototoxicity (vestibular dysfunction) and nephrotoxicity. It does not affect the peripheral nervous system in the way isoniazid does. C. Bacitracin: Incorrect. Bacitracin is a topical antibiotic used for skin infections and has nephrotoxic potential when used systemically. It does not cause neuropathy or shoulder-hand syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hepatotoxicity. While isoniazid (INH) is known to cause hepatotoxicity, it is not a characteristic feature of acute overdose. Instead, hepatotoxicity is a dose-dependent adverse effect that develops gradually over time due to liver enzyme induction and accumulation of toxic metabolites. In contrast, acute isoniazid overdose primarily presents with neurotoxicity, including seizures, metabolic acidosis, and coma due to the depletion of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Incorrect Options: A. Seizures refractory to treatment with phenytoin and barbiturates: Incorrect. Acute isoniazid toxicity causes intractable seizures due to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) depletion, which leads to reduced GABA synthesis in the central nervous system. These seizures are often resistant to standard anticonvulsants (phenytoin, barbiturates) but respond well to pyridoxine supplementation, which is the specific antidote. C. Metabolic acidosis with an anion gap that is resistant to treatment with sodium bicarbonate: Incorrect. Isoniazid overdose leads to lactic acidosis and an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA). The metabolic acidosis is primarily due to seizure-induced lactic acid accumulation and impaired mitochondrial metabolism. This acidosis is resistant to sodium bicarbonate but improves with pyridoxine therapy, which corrects the underlying biochemical derangement. D. Coma: Incorrect. Severe isoniazid overdose can cause altered mental status progressing to coma, primarily due to CNS toxicity, seizures, and lactic acidosis. Coma in INH toxicity is often associated with persistent seizures and GABA depletion, and it improves with high-dose pyridoxine administration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Begins within 24 hours after treatment with chloramphenicol. Grey baby syndrome is a serious condition that occurs in neonates, particularly premature infants, due to chloramphenicol toxicity. However, it does not usually begin within 24 hours; instead, symptoms typically appear after 2 to 9 days of treatment. This delay occurs because chloramphenicol gradually accumulates due to immature hepatic metabolism and renal excretion in neonates. Incorrect Options: A. Neonates, especially if premature, are at greater risk: Correct. Premature neonates are at the highest risk for grey baby syndrome because their hepatic glucuronidation system is immature, leading to the accumulation of toxic levels of chloramphenicol. B. Mechanisms are due to inadequate/deficiency of glucuronyl transferase: Correct. The immature liver in neonates has low levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase, the enzyme required for glucuronidation and elimination of chloramphenicol. This leads to drug accumulation, toxicity, and cardiovascular collapse. C. If the baby recovers, there will be no long-term sequelae: Correct. If prompt treatment (discontinuation of chloramphenicol and supportive care) is provided, most infants recover fully without long-term complications. However, if severe toxicity occurs with prolonged hypoxia and cardiovascular instability, there may be neurological damage.",
