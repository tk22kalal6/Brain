      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Serum TSH level. Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is the most reliable parameter for adjusting thyroxine dosage in patients with hypothyroidism. TSH is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in response to circulating thyroid hormone levels. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are elevated due to a lack of negative feedback from thyroid hormones. When thyroxine therapy is adequate, TSH levels normalize. Regular monitoring of TSH levels (typically after 6–8 weeks of therapy adjustment) helps determine if the dose of thyroxine needs to be increased or decreased. Serum free T4 levels can be considered in special cases (e.g., central hypothyroidism), but TSH remains the primary guide. Thus, TSH measurement is the most reliable indicator for dose adjustment in hypothyroid patients. Incorrect Options: A. Pulse Rate – Incorrect Thyroid hormones influence metabolism and can affect heart rate, but pulse rate alone is not a reliable guide for dose adjustment. Many other factors, such as cardiovascular fitness, medications (e.g., beta-blockers), or stress, can alter pulse rate. C. Serum Thyroxine Level – Incorrect While serum T4 levels reflect thyroid hormone concentration, they do not provide a complete picture of thyroid function. T4 levels can fluctuate, and they do not always correlate well with clinical symptoms or TSH regulation. TSH is a more sensitive indicator of whether the thyroid hormone level is appropriate for the body's needs. D. Body Weight – Incorrect Although severe hypothyroidism can cause weight gain and thyroxine therapy can help reverse it, body weight is not a precise or specific measure for dose adjustments. Multiple other factors (diet, physical activity, fluid balance, metabolic rate) influence body weight.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Propylthiouracil (PTU). Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred drug to reduce thyroid gland size and vascularity before thyroid surgery in a pregnant woman with thyrotoxicosis. PTU is a thionamide that works by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase, thereby blocking the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). It also reduces the peripheral conversion of T4 to the more active T3, which helps in faster control of hyperthyroid symptoms. PTU is preferred over methimazole in the first trimester of pregnancy because it has a lower risk of teratogenic effects (though it is not entirely risk-free). By reducing thyroid hormone levels, PTU decreases the gland’s vascularity, making surgery safer by minimizing the risk of excessive bleeding. Thus, PTU is the most appropriate choice for preoperative preparation in a pregnant woman undergoing thyroid surgery. Incorrect Options: A. Iodine Ion – Incorrect Although iodine (Lugol’s iodine or potassium iodide) can reduce thyroid gland vascularity, it is generally used only in the immediate preoperative period (e.g., 7–10 days before surgery). PTU is preferred first to control hormone levels, and iodine is only added later if needed. Excess iodine can cause a \"Jod-Basedow phenomenon\" (iodine-induced hyperthyroidism), making it unsuitable as a first-line treatment. C. Propranolol – Incorrect Propranolol is a beta-blocker that helps control symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (e.g., tachycardia, tremors, anxiety), but it does not reduce thyroid hormone production or gland vascularity. It is used as an adjunct therapy along with antithyroid drugs like PTU. D. Radioactive Iodine – Incorrect Radioactive iodine (I-131) is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy because it crosses the placenta and destroys fetal thyroid tissue, leading to congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism). This option is never used for a pregnant woman and is mainly used for non-pregnant patients with hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Elderly patients with ischemic heart disease. Radioactive iodine (I-131) is the preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism, especially in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease. I-131 selectively destroys thyroid tissue, reducing excessive thyroid hormone production and leading to controlled hypothyroidism, which can then be managed with thyroxine replacement. Elderly patients, particularly those with ischemic heart disease, are at high risk for cardiac complications (such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure) if hyperthyroidism remains uncontrolled. Compared to surgery or antithyroid drugs, I-131 provides a definitive, non-invasive, and safer long-term treatment with fewer cardiovascular risks in this patient population. Thus, I-131 is the preferred treatment in elderly patients with ischemic heart disease to achieve stable thyroid function with minimal risk. Incorrect Options: (B) Young adult with recent onset Graves’ disease – Incorrect In young adults with recently diagnosed Graves' disease, antithyroid drugs (such as methimazole or propylthiouracil) are preferred initially because some patients achieve remission after 12-18 months of therapy. I-131 is considered if there is a relapse or if the patient prefers definitive treatment instead of lifelong medication. (C) Children – Incorrect I-131 is not the first-line treatment in children due to concerns about long-term effects, including a theoretical risk of thyroid malignancy and permanent hypothyroidism. Antithyroid drugs (like methimazole) are preferred in children, and surgery is considered in selected cases. (D) Pregnant women – Incorrect I-131 is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy because it crosses the placenta and destroys the fetal thyroid gland, leading to severe congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism). Pregnant women with hyperthyroidism are treated with Propylthiouracil (PTU) in the first trimester and Methimazole in later trimesters due to their safety profiles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Propylthiouracil (PTU). Propylthiouracil (PTU) inhibits 5'-deiodinase, the enzyme responsible for converting thyroxine (T4) to the more active triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. This action reduces circulating T3 levels, thereby decreasing thyroid hormone activity. In addition to peripheral deiodination inhibition, PTU also inhibits thyroid peroxidase, preventing new thyroid hormone synthesis. Because of its dual action, PTU is particularly useful in thyroid storm, where rapid reduction of T3 levels is required. Thus, PTU is the only option that directly inhibits 5'-deiodinase, making (C) the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Lugol’s Iodine – Incorrect Lugol’s iodine contains elemental iodine and potassium iodide, which temporarily suppresses thyroid hormone release (Wolff-Chaikoff effect). It does not inhibit 5'-deiodinase but blocks thyroid hormone synthesis and release from the thyroid gland. (B) Methimazole – Incorrect Methimazole is a thionamide that inhibits thyroid peroxidase, preventing iodination and coupling reactions necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis. However, unlike PTU, Methimazole does not inhibit 5'-deiodinase and has no effect on peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. (D) Radioactive iodine (I-131) – Incorrect I-131 selectively destroys thyroid follicular cells, reducing overall thyroid hormone production over time. It does not directly inhibit 5'-deiodinase or interfere with peripheral T4 to T3 conversion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Propylthiouracil (PTU) acts by multiple mechanisms to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and decrease its activity in hyperthyroidism. It primarily inhibits thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which is responsible for key steps in thyroid hormone production: Inhibition of oxidation of iodine (Option B) – PTU prevents the oxidation of iodide (I-) to iodine (I2), a crucial step in thyroid hormone synthesis. Inhibition of organification of iodine (Option A) – PTU blocks the incorporation (organification) of iodine into tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, preventing the formation of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Inhibition of coupling of two DIT residues (Option C) – PTU inhibits the coupling of iodinated tyrosine residues, which is required for the synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Inhibition of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 – PTU uniquely inhibits 5'-deiodinase, decreasing the conversion of the less active T4 to the more potent T3 in peripheral tissues. Since PTU inhibits all three major steps of thyroid hormone synthesis, the correct answer is (D) All of the above. Incorrect Options: (A) Inhibition of organification of iodine – Partially correct While PTU does inhibit organification, it also has additional effects on iodine oxidation, coupling, and peripheral conversion. (B) Inhibition of oxidation of iodine – Partially correct PTU inhibits oxidation, but it also inhibits organification, coupling, and peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion. (C) Inhibition of coupling of two DIT residues – Partially correct PTU blocks coupling, but its action is not limited to this step alone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Is shorter acting. Triiodothyronine (T3) is the more biologically active thyroid hormone compared to thyroxine (T4), but it has a shorter half-life and duration of action due to its rapid metabolism and clearance. T3 has a half-life of about 1 day, whereas T4 has a much longer half-life of approximately 7 days. T3 is rapidly absorbed and exerts its effects more quickly, making it shorter acting. It is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted faster than T4, contributing to its shorter duration of action. Because of its shorter half-life and faster metabolism, T3 is considered a short-acting thyroid hormone compared to T4. Incorrect Options: (A) Is more plasma protein bound – Incorrect T4 is more strongly bound to plasma proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, albumin, and transthyretin) than T3. T3 has lower protein binding and a higher free hormone fraction, which allows it to exert its effects more quickly. (B) Has delayed action – Incorrect T3 acts more rapidly than T4 because it is already the active form of thyroid hormone. T4 serves mainly as a prohormone that needs to be converted to T3 in peripheral tissues before becoming biologically active. (C) Is less potent – Incorrect T3 is 3-4 times more potent than T4 in terms of metabolic activity. It binds more strongly to thyroid hormone receptors and produces faster physiological effects.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sodium iodide. Sodium iodide, in the form of Lugol’s iodine or saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI), has the most rapid onset of action among anti-thyroid drugs. It works through the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, where a high dose of iodine temporarily inhibits the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. This effect occurs within hours and peaks in 1-2 days, making sodium iodide the fastest-acting anti-thyroid agent. It is used in emergency situations such as thyroid storm and to prepare patients for thyroid surgery by reducing thyroid gland vascularity. However, this inhibitory effect is temporary (lasting only a few weeks), and thyroid hormone synthesis can rebound once the iodine is depleted. Incorrect Options: (A) I-131 (Radioactive Iodine) – Incorrect Radioactive iodine (I-131) is used to destroy thyroid tissue in hyperthyroidism but has a delayed onset of action (weeks to months). It takes several weeks to start reducing thyroid hormone levels and 3-6 months for full therapeutic effect. Therefore, it is not suitable for rapid control of hyperthyroidism. (B) Propylthiouracil (PTU) – Incorrect PTU inhibits thyroid peroxidase, preventing iodine organification and hormone synthesis. Additionally, it inhibits 5'-deiodinase, reducing the conversion of T4 to T3, leading to a faster action compared to methimazole but still slower than sodium iodide. PTU typically takes 2-4 weeks to exert significant effects. (C) Methimazole – Incorrect Methimazole also inhibits thyroid peroxidase, blocking the synthesis of thyroid hormones. However, it does not inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 like PTU does. Its onset of action is slow, typically taking 3-6 weeks to produce a full therapeutic effect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Amiodarone. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that contains a high iodine content and is known to have significant effects on thyroid function. It inhibits both type 1 (D1) and type 2 (D2) iodothyronine deiodinases, which are responsible for the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the more active triiodothyronine (T3). By inhibiting these enzymes, amiodarone reduces peripheral T3 production, leading to increased serum T4 and reverse T3 (rT3) levels while decreasing T3 levels. This effect contributes to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis, depending on individual susceptibility. Incorrect Options: (A) Propylthiouracil (PTU): PTU primarily acts by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase, thereby blocking thyroid hormone synthesis. It also inhibits type 1 deiodinase (D1) but has minimal effect on type 2 deiodinase (D2), making it an incorrect answer. (C) Propranolol: Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in hyperthyroidism to control symptoms like tachycardia and tremors. While it inhibits type 1 deiodinase (D1) to some extent, it does not significantly affect type 2 deiodinase (D2), so it is not the correct answer. (D) Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids primarily inhibit type 1 deiodinase (D1), reducing peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. However, they do not significantly inhibit type 2 deiodinase (D2), making them incorrect for this question.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increased. In pregnancy, the demand for thyroid hormones increases due to several physiological changes. Increased levels of estrogen lead to higher thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), reducing free thyroxine (T4) levels. Additionally, the placenta produces deiodinases, which enhance T4 metabolism, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates the thyroid, altering thyroid hormone requirements. Since thyroid hormones are essential for fetal brain development, hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine require a dose increase—typically by 30–50%—to maintain euthyroid status and prevent complications like miscarriage, preeclampsia, or impaired fetal development. Regular TSH monitoring every 4–6 weeks is necessary to adjust the dosage. Incorrect Options: (A) Decreased: A reduction in thyroxine dosage would worsen maternal hypothyroidism, potentially leading to complications such as fetal growth restriction, neurodevelopmental delays, or preterm birth. This is incorrect because pregnancy increases thyroid hormone requirements, not decreases them. (C) Continue the same dose: Maintaining the pre-pregnancy dose is insufficient due to the increased metabolic demand and hormonal changes. Without increasing the dose, maternal and fetal hypothyroidism can develop, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. (D) Doubles: While an increase in levothyroxine dose is necessary, a 100% dose increase (doubling the dose) is excessive in most cases. Typically, only a 30–50% dose increase is needed, making this answer incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Oral bioavailability of I-thyroxine is – 25%. This statement is incorrect because the actual oral bioavailability of levothyroxine (L-thyroxine) is approximately 60–80%, not 25%. Absorption primarily occurs in the small intestine (jejunum and ileum) and is influenced by factors such as gastrointestinal pH, food intake, and concurrent medications. Since levothyroxine is a synthetic form of T4, its absorption efficiency is crucial for maintaining adequate thyroid hormone levels, especially in patients with hypothyroidism. Incorrect Options: (A) Should be administered on an empty stomach: This is correct. Levothyroxine absorption is reduced by food, especially high-fiber meals, calcium, and iron-containing foods. It is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30–60 minutes before breakfast or 3–4 hours after the last meal, for optimal absorption. (B) Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) also reduce I-thyroxine absorption: This is correct. PPIs (e.g., omeprazole, pantoprazole) increase gastric pH, leading to reduced dissolution and absorption of levothyroxine. Patients on long-term PPI therapy may require higher doses of levothyroxine to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels. (C) Rifampin increases metabolism of T4: This is correct. Rifampin is a potent inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, which accelerates the metabolism of thyroid hormones, particularly T4, leading to increased clearance and potential hypothyroidism in susceptible patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Carbimazole. Carbimazole is an antithyroid medication commonly used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. However, it is known to be teratogenic and can lead to birth defects when used during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. One of the most well-known risks associated with carbimazole is the development of congenital abnormalities, especially craniofacial defects like aplasia cutis and hypothyroidism in the newborn. These effects are thought to be due to the drug's ability to cross the placenta and inhibit the thyroid function of the developing fetus. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Propylthiouracil – Incorrect. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is another antithyroid medication, and while it is safer than carbimazole during pregnancy, it is not entirely without risk. PTU is usually preferred in the first trimester because it has a lower risk of birth defects compared to carbimazole. PTU does cross the placenta, but it is less teratogenic than carbimazole. Therefore, PTU would be a safer choice for managing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. (C) Propranolol – Incorrect. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which is often used to manage symptoms of hyperthyroidism (like palpitations and tremors) but does not directly affect thyroid hormone levels. While propranolol can be used to treat the cardiovascular manifestations of hyperthyroidism, it is not teratogenic and does not cause the birth defects seen with carbimazole. The use of propranolol in pregnancy is typically avoided in high doses due to potential risks such as intrauterine growth restriction, but it does not cause the same kind of congenital defects as carbimazole. (D) Lugol’s iodine – Incorrect. Lugol’s iodine is a form of iodine used in certain thyroid conditions, especially in the preoperative preparation for thyroid surgery. It works by reducing thyroid hormone production but can be harmful during pregnancy if used for extended periods. However, it is not commonly associated with teratogenic effects like carbimazole. While iodine should be used with caution during pregnancy, it is not the drug responsible for the birth defects described in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inhibition of thyroid peroxidase. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid drug belonging to the thionamide class, primarily used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, including Graves’ disease. Its main mechanism of action is the inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO). TPO is an enzyme responsible for oxidation of iodide to iodine, iodination of tyrosine residues, and coupling of iodotyrosines to form thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). By blocking TPO, PTU prevents the synthesis of new thyroid hormones, thereby reducing excessive thyroid hormone levels. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Inhibition of thyroid hormone release – Incorrect. PTU does not directly inhibit the release of preformed thyroid hormones. Instead, it prevents the synthesis of new hormones. Drugs like iodine solutions (Lugol’s iodine, potassium iodide) work by blocking thyroid hormone release, which is known as the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. (C) Decreased peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 – Partially correct but not the primary mechanism. PTU does inhibit 5'-deiodinase, the enzyme responsible for converting T4 (thyroxine) into T3 (triiodothyronine), the more active thyroid hormone. However, this effect is secondary to its main mechanism of blocking thyroid peroxidase. Another drug, methimazole, only inhibits TPO and lacks this peripheral T4-to-T3 conversion inhibition. (D) Increased iodine uptake by the thyroid gland – Incorrect. PTU does not increase iodine uptake. Instead, radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) is used to increase iodine uptake for targeted destruction of the thyroid gland in hyperthyroidism. PTU mainly prevents iodine incorporation into thyroid hormones rather than promoting its uptake.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) It has a narrow therapeutic index and requires careful monitoring. Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), used to treat hypothyroidism. It has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning small deviations in dosage can lead to ineffectiveness or toxicity. Underdosing can result in persistent hypothyroid symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and bradycardia, while overdosing can cause hyperthyroid symptoms such as tachycardia, weight loss, and osteoporosis. Therefore, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels must be regularly monitored (typically every 6–8 weeks after starting or adjusting the dose). Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) It should be taken with food for optimal absorption – Incorrect. Levothyroxine absorption is reduced by food, particularly calcium, iron, and fiber-rich meals. It should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30–60 minutes before breakfast or 3–4 hours after the last meal, with a full glass of water to ensure proper absorption. (C) It does not interact with other medications – Incorrect. Levothyroxine has multiple drug interactions. For example: Calcium and iron supplements, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and antacids can reduce its absorption. Warfarin effects are enhanced, increasing the risk of bleeding. Estrogen and certain anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) increase the metabolism of levothyroxine, requiring dose adjustments. (D) It can be abruptly discontinued once thyroid levels normalize – Incorrect. Hypothyroidism is a chronic condition, and levothyroxine therapy is usually lifelong. Abrupt discontinuation can lead to hypothyroid symptoms and, in severe cases, myxedema coma, a life-threatening condition. If dose adjustments are needed, they should be done gradually under medical supervision.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4) used in the management of patients with a history of thyroid cancer, particularly differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary or follicular carcinoma). After thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine therapy, levothyroxine is administered to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels because TSH can stimulate the growth of any residual thyroid cancer cells. Suppression of TSH with levothyroxine therapy reduces the risk of cancer recurrence. Additionally, thyroglobulin (Tg) is a tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer, and rising Tg levels may indicate persistent or recurrent disease. Levothyroxine therapy helps in monitoring Tg levels while maintaining TSH suppression. Explanation of Incorrect Options: B. Methimazole – Incorrect Methimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, particularly in Graves’ disease. It works by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase, which is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. However, in the case of thyroid cancer, methimazole is not beneficial because the goal is not to reduce thyroid hormone production but rather to replace thyroid hormones after thyroidectomy and suppress TSH. C. Propylthiouracil (PTU) – Incorrect Like methimazole, propylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid drug that inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis and reduces peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. It is mainly used for hyperthyroidism, especially during pregnancy (first trimester) or thyroid storm. However, it is not used in thyroid cancer management because it does not help suppress TSH or support thyroid hormone replacement after thyroidectomy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Overdosing of levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone (T4) used to treat hypothyroidism by restoring normal thyroid hormone levels. If the dosage is too high, it can lead to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, which manifests with symptoms such as anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, tremors, heat intolerance, and increased heart rate. These symptoms mimic hyperthyroidism because excess levothyroxine increases metabolic activity and sympathetic stimulation. Overdosing may occur due to excessive initial dosing, improper dose titration, or increased absorption due to drug interactions. To confirm the diagnosis, thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4, and free T3) should be evaluated. If TSH is suppressed and free T4 is elevated, the levothyroxine dose should be adjusted downward. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Underdosing of levothyroxine – Incorrect Underdosing would result in persistent hypothyroid symptoms, such as fatigue, weight gain, depression, cold intolerance, and bradycardia, rather than anxiety and weight loss. The symptoms described in the patient suggest excess thyroid hormone levels, making underdosing an unlikely cause. C. Secondary hyperthyroidism – Incorrect Secondary hyperthyroidism occurs due to excessive TSH secretion, usually from a pituitary adenoma. In this case, the patient is taking exogenous thyroid hormone (levothyroxine), meaning her symptoms are more likely due to overreplacement rather than a pituitary disorder. In secondary hyperthyroidism, both TSH and T4 would be elevated, whereas in levothyroxine overdose, TSH would be low and free T4 would be high. D. Drug interaction – Incorrect Certain drugs, such as amiodarone, lithium, and iron supplements, can interfere with levothyroxine absorption or metabolism, leading to fluctuating thyroid hormone levels. However, a drug interaction alone is unlikely to be the direct cause of the patient’s hyperthyroid symptoms, unless it leads to excessive thyroid hormone levels by increasing absorption or enhancing conversion of T4 to T3. The most straightforward explanation is an overdose of levothyroxine rather than a drug interaction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hepatotoxicity is more common. Carbimazole is not more hepatotoxic than propylthiouracil (PTU). While both carbimazole (which is converted to methimazole in the body) and PTU are thionamide drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism, PTU is associated with a higher risk of severe hepatotoxicity, including fulminant liver failure. This is why PTU is generally reserved for specific cases, such as pregnancy in the first trimester or thyroid storm, while carbimazole/methimazole is preferred in most other cases due to its better safety profile. Explanation of Incorrect Options: A. Longer half-life – Incorrect Carbimazole has a longer half-life than PTU. Once absorbed, carbimazole is converted to methimazole, which has a half-life of 6–13 hours, allowing once-daily dosing. In contrast, PTU has a shorter half-life (1–2 hours) and requires multiple daily doses for effective control of hyperthyroidism. B. Less plasma protein binding – Incorrect Carbimazole/methimazole has lower plasma protein binding compared to PTU. PTU binds more extensively to plasma proteins, which limits its placental transfer, making it the preferred choice in early pregnancy despite its hepatotoxic risks. C. More teratogenic – Incorrect Carbimazole/methimazole is more teratogenic than PTU. It is associated with congenital malformations, including aplasia cutis (scalp defects) and choanal/esophageal atresia, when used in early pregnancy. For this reason, PTU is the drug of choice in the first trimester, after which patients are typically switched to carbimazole/methimazole for the remainder of the pregnancy due to PTU’s hepatotoxic risks.",
