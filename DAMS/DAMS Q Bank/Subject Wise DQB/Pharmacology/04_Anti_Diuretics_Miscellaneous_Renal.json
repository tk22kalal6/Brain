      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Spironolactone The patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and decreased plasma renin activity, along with a suprarenal mass on CT scan. These findings are highly suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome), most commonly caused by an adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and an aldosterone receptor antagonist, making it the treatment of choice for primary hyperaldosteronism. By blocking aldosterone, spironolactone helps: Decrease sodium and water retention, reducing hypertension Increase potassium retention, correcting hypokalemia Normalize acid-base balance, resolving metabolic alkalosis Since the patient’s symptoms and lab findings returned to normal after a few weeks, it confirms the effectiveness of spironolactone in treating the underlying condition. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Clonidine – Incorrect Clonidine is a central ?2-adrenergic agonist that reduces sympathetic outflow, leading to decreased blood pressure. However, it does not address the underlying hyperaldosteronism, nor does it correct hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis. (C) Hydrochlorothiazide – Incorrect Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that lowers blood pressure by increasing sodium and water excretion. However, it worsens hypokalemia by increasing potassium loss in urine, which is already a problem in primary hyperaldosteronism. It does not correct the root cause of the disorder. (D) Propranolol – Incorrect Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can lower blood pressure by reducing cardiac output and renin release. However, primary hyperaldosteronism is renin-independent, so propranolol would have minimal impact on this patient’s condition. It does not correct hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic analog of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH), is ineffective in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) because the condition results from renal resistance to ADH. In nephrogenic DI, the kidneys fail to respond to ADH, making desmopressin useless in reducing urine output. Treatment for nephrogenic DI typically includes thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide), amiloride, or NSAIDs like indomethacin, which help to reduce urine output by different mechanisms. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Neurogenic Diabetes Insipidus – Correct Desmopressin is the first-line treatment for neurogenic (central) DI, where the pituitary gland fails to produce ADH. It replaces the deficient ADH, reducing excessive urination and preventing dehydration. (B) Bleeding Due to Hemophilia – Correct Desmopressin stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII, making it useful in mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease (type 1). It does not work for hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). (C) Bed Wetting in Children – Correct Desmopressin is used for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children, as it reduces nighttime urine production by mimicking ADH. It is particularly useful when bedwetting is due to excessive urine production rather than a behavioral issue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Esophageal Varices V2 receptor agonists, such as desmopressin (DDAVP), act on vasopressin V2 receptors in the kidney, promoting water reabsorption and reducing urine output. They also stimulate von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII release, making them useful in certain bleeding disorders. However, they are NOT used for esophageal varices, which require V1 receptor activation for vasoconstriction. In esophageal varices, vasopressin (V1 receptor agonist) or terlipressin is used instead because V1 receptor stimulation causes splanchnic vasoconstriction, reducing portal hypertension and the risk of variceal bleeding. V2 receptor agonists do not have this effect, making option (A) incorrect. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (B) Bed Wetting in Children – Correct Desmopressin is a first-line treatment for nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) as it reduces nighttime urine production by mimicking ADH action. It is effective in children with excessive nocturnal urine output and a low bladder capacity. (C) von Willebrand's Disease – Correct Desmopressin stimulates release of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII, making it useful in mild von Willebrand disease (type 1) and mild hemophilia A. It reduces bleeding tendencies by enhancing platelet adhesion. (D) Central Diabetes Insipidus – Correct In central diabetes insipidus, there is insufficient ADH production from the pituitary gland. Desmopressin replaces the missing ADH, preventing excessive urination and dehydration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Increase in Water Permeability Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) reduces urine volume by increasing water permeability in the collecting ducts of the kidney. It does this by activating V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of collecting duct cells, leading to the insertion of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channels into the apical membrane. This enhances water reabsorption, concentrating the urine and decreasing urine output. Vasopressin's action is crucial in maintaining fluid balance, preventing dehydration, and regulating plasma osmolality by retaining free water without significantly affecting sodium excretion. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Decrease in Glomerular Filtration Rate – Incorrect Vasopressin does not directly reduce the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is mainly regulated by renal blood flow, afferent/efferent arteriolar tone, and systemic blood pressure, whereas vasopressin primarily acts on the collecting ducts. (C) Decrease in Water Permeability – Incorrect Vasopressin increases, not decreases, water permeability by upregulating aquaporin-2 channels in the collecting duct. A decrease in water permeability would lead to diuresis (excessive urine output), which is seen in conditions like nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, where vasopressin's action is impaired. (D) Decrease in Renal Blood Flow – Incorrect Vasopressin does not significantly reduce renal blood flow at physiological levels. At higher concentrations, it can cause vasoconstriction via V1 receptor activation, but its primary renal effect is on water reabsorption, not blood flow.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ceftriaxone intramuscularly as a single dose. This patient presents with classic symptoms of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, characterized by dysuria and yellow urethral discharge. The gram-negative diplococci seen on Gram stain of the urethral exudate, along with the clinical symptoms, strongly suggest gonococcal urethritis. The recommended first-line treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, administered intramuscularly as a single dose. It is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and ceftriaxone is preferred due to its efficacy, convenience of a single dose, and low risk of resistance. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Amoxicillin orally for 7 days – Incorrect. Amoxicillin is not a first-line treatment for gonorrhea, as Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed significant resistance to penicillins due to the production of beta-lactamase. Amoxicillin is ineffective against gonorrhea and should not be used as monotherapy in this case. (C) Procaine penicillin G intramuscularly as a single dose plus 1 g of probenecid – Incorrect. Procaine penicillin G used with probenecid was historically an option for treating gonorrhea, but it is now considered less effective compared to ceftriaxone due to increased antibiotic resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. While probenecid helps increase the penicillin's half-life, ceftriaxone is the more appropriate and preferred therapy because of its superior efficacy against gonorrhea. (D) Tetracycline orally for 7 days – Incorrect. Tetracyclines such as doxycycline were previously used for treating gonorrhea, but Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed significant resistance to tetracyclines, making them no longer the first-line treatment. Additionally, tetracyclines do not effectively treat gonococcal infections when used alone, especially in the case of urethritis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Inject intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. This patient presents with classic signs of syphilis: dysuria, urethral discharge, a painless clean-based ulcer (chancre), and nontender regional lymphadenopathy, all of which are characteristic of primary syphilis caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealing treponemes confirms the diagnosis. The first-line treatment for syphilis, regardless of the stage, is penicillin. Benzathine penicillin G is the preferred form for treating primary syphilis because it is effective, has a long half-life, and provides sustained blood levels of penicillin that are effective against Treponema pallidum. This drug is typically administered intramuscularly as a single dose and is highly effective in curing syphilis. Explanation of Incorrect Options: (A) Treat with intravenous aqueous penicillin G – Incorrect. While intravenous aqueous penicillin G is an appropriate treatment for neurosyphilis or tertiary syphilis, it is not necessary for the treatment of primary syphilis in this patient. Benzathine penicillin G is the standard treatment for primary syphilis, as it is less invasive (given intramuscularly) and equally effective for this stage of infection. (B) Treat with oral tetracycline – Incorrect. Although tetracyclines like doxycycline are used to treat syphilis in patients with penicillin allergy, they are not preferred in this case because the patient does not have a penicillin allergy. Penicillin remains the treatment of choice for syphilis, and tetracycline is typically reserved for patients who cannot receive penicillin. (D) Give a single oral dose of fosfomycin – Incorrect. Fosfomycin is used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), not syphilis. It is not effective against Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, and thus would not be appropriate for treating this infection. The first-line treatment for syphilis remains penicillin.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Drug toxicity. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist commonly used in the management of hypertension, heart failure, and hyperaldosteronism. It has a structural similarity to steroid hormones, which allows it to competitively inhibit androgen receptors. This anti-androgenic effect can lead to: Gynecomastia (breast tissue enlargement in men) Decreased libido Erectile dysfunction Additionally, spironolactone is known to have a direct irritating effect on the gastric mucosa, which can increase the risk of gastric ulcers. This explains why the patient, who is taking spironolactone, has both gynecomastia and gastric ulcers. This makes drug toxicity (spironolactone side effects) the most likely explanation for the patient’s findings. Incorrect Options: (A) Chronic stress Incorrect because chronic stress does not directly cause gynecomastia. Chronic stress can lead to increased cortisol levels, which may contribute to gastric ulcers, but it does not affect androgen levels in a way that causes gynecomastia. Spironolactone’s anti-androgenic effects are a more likely explanation. (C) Pituitary tumor Incorrect because a pituitary tumor, such as a prolactinoma, would cause hyperprolactinemia, not anti-androgenic effects. Prolactinomas cause galactorrhea, decreased libido, and infertility, but they are not linked to gastric ulcers. Spironolactone's direct hormonal effects are a better explanation for the patient's symptoms. (D) Thyroid disease Incorrect because thyroid disorders do not cause both gynecomastia and gastric ulcers together. Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and increased gastric acid production, leading to ulcers, but gynecomastia is rare. Hypothyroidism may cause gynecomastia (due to altered estrogen metabolism) but is not linked to ulcers.",
