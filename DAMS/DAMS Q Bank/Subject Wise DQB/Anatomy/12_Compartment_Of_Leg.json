      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Base of fifth metatarsal The peroneus brevis muscle inserts into the base of the fifth metatarsal. It is located in the lateral compartment of the leg and plays a key role in plantar flexion and eversion of the foot. As the muscle contracts, it pulls the foot laterally, which helps in stabilizing the foot during walking and running. The tendon of the peroneus brevis passes behind the lateral malleolus and then inserts at the tuberosity on the base of the fifth metatarsal. Incorrect Responses: (B) Base of first metatarsal This option refers to the base of the first metatarsal, which is the insertion point for the peroneus longus muscle, not the peroneus brevis. The peroneus longus functions similarly to the brevis but inserts on the first metatarsal and the medial cuneiform. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (C) Head of third metatarsal There is no anatomical structure where the peroneus brevis inserts at the head of the third metatarsal. This is not a typical insertion point for any of the peroneal muscles. Hence, this option is incorrect. (D) Head of second metatarsal The head of the second metatarsal is not the insertion point for the peroneus brevis muscle. Like option C, this does not align with the anatomical path or function of the peroneus brevis, which inserts specifically at the base of the fifth metatarsal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) EHL and EDL. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The neurovascular bundle of the anterior compartment of the leg passes between the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. This bundle consists of the anterior tibial artery, deep peroneal nerve, and the associated veins. It runs within the deep fascia of the anterior compartment, between the tendons of EHL and EDL, just before it crosses the ankle joint. This anatomical relationship is crucial for the proper function and protection of the neurovascular structures in the anterior compartment. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. EDL and peroneus tertius: This statement is incorrect. The peroneus tertius is part of the anterior compartment of the leg but is not situated between the tendons of EDL and the neurovascular bundle. The neurovascular bundle lies between EHL and EDL, not between EDL and peroneus tertius. C. Tibialis anterior and EHL: This statement is incorrect. The tibialis anterior tendon is located medial to the neurovascular bundle, while the EHL tendon is lateral to it. The neurovascular bundle does not pass between these two tendons, as they are not situated in that specific arrangement. D. None of the above: This statement is incorrect because the correct answer is indeed option A, where the neurovascular bundle passes between EHL and EDL.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Deep peroneal nerve. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The deep peroneal nerve (or deep fibular nerve) is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the skin of the dorsum of the first web space of the foot. This nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve and supplies the skin between the first and second toes. Additionally, it innervates muscles responsible for dorsiflexion and extension of the toes, such as the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Sural nerve: The sural nerve is a sensory nerve that innervates the posterolateral aspect of the lower leg and the lateral side of the foot, including the little toe. It does not provide sensation to the dorsum of the first web space. B. Saphenous nerve: The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve and provides sensory innervation to the medial side of the lower leg and medial aspect of the foot. It does not supply the dorsum of the first web space, which is the domain of the deep peroneal nerve. D. Lateral plantar nerve: The lateral plantar nerve is a branch of the tibial nerve and primarily supplies muscles and skin on the lateral side of the sole of the foot, including the little toe and the lateral half of the fourth and fifth toes. It does not provide sensation to the dorsum of the first web space.",
