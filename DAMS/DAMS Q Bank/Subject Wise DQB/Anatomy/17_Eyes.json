      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Extorsion The superior oblique muscle is responsible for intorsion, abduction, and depression of the eyeball. Intorsion refers to the inward rotation of the eyeball, abduction involves moving the eye outward away from the midline, and depression involves moving the eye downward, especially when the eye is abducted. The superior oblique muscle does not produce extorsion, which is the outward rotation of the eyeball. Therefore, option C (extorsion) is the correct answer as it does not correspond to the actions of the superior oblique muscle. Incorrect Answers: A. Abduction Abduction refers to the movement of the eye away from the midline, which is one of the actions of the superior oblique muscle. When the superior oblique contracts, it moves the eye outward (abduction), especially when the eye is in a position of primary gaze or when the eye is looking downwards. Therefore, option A is incorrect. B. Intorsion Intorsion is the inward rotation of the eyeball, which is a primary function of the superior oblique muscle. This action occurs when the eye is in the primary position or when the eye is looking downward. Therefore, option B is incorrect. D. Depression Depression of the eye, particularly when the eye is abducted, is another key action of the superior oblique muscle. It helps the eye to look downward, which is one of its primary roles in eye movement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Apex of orbit between optic nerve and lateral rectus The ciliary ganglion is located at the apex of the orbit, specifically between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle. It is positioned in the posterior part of the orbit and is situated just lateral to the optic nerve. The ciliary ganglion plays an important role in the autonomic innervation of the eye, particularly in controlling pupil constriction and lens accommodation through parasympathetic fibers from the oculomotor nerve (CN III). Therefore, option D is correct. Incorrect Answers: A. Between optic nerve and lateral rectus While this description is close to the correct anatomical location, it does not specify the ciliary ganglion's exact positioning in relation to the apex of the orbit. Option A does not indicate that it is located at the apex, which is important in the precise anatomical context. Therefore, option A is incorrect. B. Apex of orbit Although the ciliary ganglion is located at the apex of the orbit, this answer is incomplete because it does not provide the specific relation between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle. The precise anatomical location, as mentioned in option D, is necessary for a complete understanding of its position. Therefore, option B is incorrect. C. Apex of orbit and superior rectus The ciliary ganglion is not located between the apex of the orbit and the superior rectus muscle. It is specifically situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, not in the region between the apex and the superior rectus. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Diencephalon. Explanation: Correct Answer: (B) Diencephalon: The retina is an outgrowth of the diencephalon, which is a part of the brain's forebrain. During embryonic development, the optic cup, from which the retina develops, arises from the diencephalon. Specifically, it forms from the optic vesicle, which is an evagination of the diencephalon. This is why the retina is considered a part of the central nervous system and shares a common embryological origin with the brain. Incorrect Answers: (A) Mesencephalon: The mesencephalon, or midbrain, contributes to the formation of structures such as the superior colliculus and the cerebral aqueduct, but it does not give rise to the retina. (C) Telencephalon: The telencephalon primarily gives rise to structures like the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and the olfactory bulb, but not the retina. The telencephalon is involved in higher brain functions, not in the development of the visual system. (D) Pons: The pons, which is part of the brainstem, plays a role in motor control and sensory analysis but is not involved in the formation of the retina.",
