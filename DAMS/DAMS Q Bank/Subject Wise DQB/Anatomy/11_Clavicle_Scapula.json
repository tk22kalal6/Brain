      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Most common site of fracture is the junction of medial 1/3rd with lateral 2/3rd This statement is false because the most common site of clavicular fractures is the middle third of the clavicle, not the junction of the medial third and lateral two-thirds. The clavicle is a long bone that is particularly vulnerable to fractures due to its location and shape. The middle third is the weakest and thinnest part of the bone, making it the most common fracture site (accounting for about 80% of clavicular fractures). The forces transmitted through the shoulder girdle typically concentrate at this point, increasing the risk of fracture here. Incorrect Responses: (A) Ossifies in membrane This statement is correct. The clavicle is one of the first bones to begin ossification during fetal development, and it ossifies through intramembranous ossification, unlike most long bones, which ossify through endochondral ossification. This unique feature highlights its early development and structural significance. (B) Horizontal bone This statement is correct. The clavicle is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally. It serves as a strut between the sternum and the scapula, providing structural support to the shoulder girdle and enabling a wide range of arm movements. (C) No medullary cavity This statement is correct. Unlike most long bones, the clavicle does not have a medullary cavity (the hollow center typically filled with bone marrow). Instead, it is composed of spongy bone surrounded by compact bone, which contributes to its structural strength and unique characteristics.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Abduction and lateral rotation The greater tuberosity of the humerus serves as the attachment site for three key rotator cuff muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. These muscles collectively contribute to shoulder movements: Supraspinatus: Initiates and assists in abduction of the arm (first 15 degrees). Infraspinatus and Teres Minor: Facilitate lateral rotation of the arm at the shoulder joint. If the greater tuberosity is damaged or lost, these muscles lose their anchoring point, directly impairing abduction and lateral rotation of the shoulder, which are their primary functions. Incorrect Responses: (A) Adduction and flexion Adduction and flexion are primarily carried out by muscles like the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and anterior deltoid, none of which attach to the greater tuberosity. These movements would remain unaffected by damage to the greater tuberosity. (C) Medial rotation and adduction Medial rotation is mainly performed by muscles like the subscapularis, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major, all of which attach elsewhere (e.g., lesser tuberosity or the humeral shaft). Similarly, adduction involves the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, which are not dependent on the greater tuberosity. (D) Flexion and medial rotation Flexion is primarily executed by the anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, and biceps brachii, while medial rotation is carried out by muscles like the subscapularis and teres major. These movements do not rely on the muscles attached to the greater tuberosity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pectoralis major The pectoralis major is a large muscle located in the chest. It originates from the clavicle, sternum, and costal cartilages and inserts into the lateral lip of the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus. It has no attachment to the scapula. Its primary functions are to facilitate adduction and medial rotation of the arm, but since it lacks any connection to the scapula, it does not contribute to scapular movements, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (B) Pectoralis minor The pectoralis minor originates from the third to fifth ribs and inserts into the coracoid process of the scapula. It plays a role in stabilizing the scapula by drawing it anteriorly and inferiorly against the thoracic wall. Its attachment to the scapula is well established. (C) Biceps brachii The biceps brachii has two heads: The long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. The short head originates from the coracoid process of the scapula. Both heads confirm the biceps brachii's attachment to the scapula, making it incorrect for this question. (D) Triceps The triceps brachii has three heads: The long head originates from the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. The attachment of the long head of the triceps to the scapula is a key part of its function in shoulder and elbow extension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Flat shoulder A fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus can result in injury to the axillary nerve, which supplies the deltoid muscle and the teres minor muscle. Damage to the axillary nerve leads to atrophy of the deltoid muscle, which gives the shoulder its rounded contour. Consequently, the shoulder appears flat, a characteristic clinical sign of axillary nerve damage. Additionally, patients may experience weakness in shoulder abduction (from 15° to 90°) and loss of sensation over the regimental badge area (the skin over the lower deltoid region). Incorrect Responses: (A) Loss of sensation in dorsal forearm Loss of sensation in the dorsal forearm is typically associated with injury to the radial nerve, not the axillary nerve. The radial nerve supplies sensation to the posterior arm, forearm, and part of the hand, and it is not commonly affected by a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. (C) Wrist drop Wrist drop is a hallmark of radial nerve injury, which results from an inability to extend the wrist and fingers due to paralysis of the extensor muscles. While the radial nerve runs near the humerus, it is more commonly injured in fractures of the shaft of the humerus, not the surgical neck. (D) Claw hand Claw hand is associated with an injury to the ulnar nerve, which affects the intrinsic muscles of the hand. This presentation is unrelated to a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus or axillary nerve damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Suprascapular nerve The suprascapular nerve travels through the suprascapular notch under the superior transverse scapular ligament to innervate the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Its position in the scapular region, away from the acromial space, protects it from compression during flexion and abduction of the shoulder joint. While other structures in the subacromial space can be compressed during these movements, the suprascapular nerve remains unaffected. Incorrect Responses: (A) Supraspinatus muscle The supraspinatus muscle lies in the subacromial space, which is a common site for impingement during shoulder flexion and abduction. Compression of this muscle can lead to pain and dysfunction, commonly associated with conditions like rotator cuff impingement syndrome. (B) Long head of biceps The tendon of the long head of the biceps runs through the bicipital groove and enters the shoulder joint capsule. It is positioned close to the subacromial space and can also be compressed during shoulder movements, leading to conditions like biceps tendinitis. (D) Subacromial bursa The subacromial bursa is situated between the acromion and the supraspinatus tendon. It serves to reduce friction during shoulder movement but is prone to compression during flexion and abduction. This can lead to inflammation and pain, known as subacromial bursitis.",

It is involved in movements such as shrugging the shoulders and helps in the stabilization of the scapula when the neck is extended. The levator scapulae is not involved in pulling the scapula toward the spine (retraction), unlike the other muscles listed. Incorrect Options: (A) Trapezius The trapezius muscle is one of the key muscles responsible for scapular retraction. The middle fibers of the trapezius muscle pull the scapula medially toward the spine, which is essential for proper shoulder posture and movements such as rowing. It plays a significant role in stabilizing and moving the scapula. (B) Rhomboid major The rhomboid major muscle is also involved in scapular retraction. It originates from the thoracic vertebrae and inserts into the medial border of the scapula. It functions to pull the scapula towards the spine, assisting in retraction and helping to stabilize the scapula during upper limb movements. (C) Rhomboid minor The rhomboid minor muscle works similarly to the rhomboid major in scapular retraction. It helps to retract the scapula by pulling it medially toward the spine.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Serratus anterior The serratus anterior does not form the boundary of the triangle of auscultation. The triangle of auscultation is an anatomical region located on the posterior thoracic wall, where breath sounds can be heard clearly with a stethoscope. The boundaries of the triangle of auscultation are formed by the scapula, trapezius, and latissimus dorsi, not the serratus anterior. The serratus anterior muscle lies more anteriorly on the chest and does not contribute to the boundaries of this region. Incorrect Options: (B) Scapula The scapula is one of the boundaries of the triangle of auscultation. The medial border of the scapula forms the lateral boundary of the triangle. This anatomical region is important for listening to the lungs during auscultation because the scapula's positioning creates a relatively thin area for clear sound transmission. (C) Trapezius The trapezius muscle forms the superior boundary of the triangle of auscultation. It is a large muscle that covers the upper back and contributes to the formation of this region. Its involvement in the boundaries makes the area more accessible for auscultation. (D) Latissimus dorsi The latissimus dorsi forms the inferior boundary of the triangle of auscultation. It is a broad, flat muscle of the back that helps define the lower edge of the triangle. Its role in the boundaries makes this anatomical area suitable for auscultation of lung sounds.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lateral angle. The head of the scapula is located at the lateral angle of the scapula. This part of the scapula is also called the glenoid cavity or glenoid fossa, where the scapula articulates with the humerus to form the shoulder joint. The lateral angle is the most prominent part of the scapula and is crucial in the formation of the shoulder joint. It is located at the lateral (outer) part of the scapula and serves as the socket for the head of the humerus. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Coracoid process Incorrect The coracoid process is a hook-like structure located on the anterior surface of the scapula, near the base of the neck. While it serves as an attachment point for muscles and ligaments, it is not the head of the scapula. The coracoid process is distinct from the glenoid cavity and does not form part of the shoulder joint. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B. Acromion process Incorrect The acromion process is located at the top of the scapula and is a bony prominence that forms the highest point of the shoulder. It is the extension of the scapular spine and provides attachment for muscles and ligaments. However, it is not the head of the scapula, which refers specifically to the lateral angle (glenoid cavity). Thus, this option is incorrect. D. Spine Incorrect The spine of the scapula is a prominent ridge on the posterior surface of the scapula. It serves as an attachment site for muscles like the deltoid and trapezius, but it is not considered the head of the scapula. The spine is distinct from the lateral angle and does not contribute to the shoulder joint's articulation with the humerus.",
