      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve is not a content of the cubital fossa. While it passes near the cubital fossa, specifically along the medial aspect of the elbow, it does not enter the cubital fossa itself. Instead, it passes posteriorly to the medial epicondyle of the humerus, where it can be palpated as the \"funny bone.\" The cubital fossa primarily contains structures that pass anteriorly through the elbow joint, such as the median nerve, biceps tendon, and brachial artery. Incorrect Options: (A) Median nerve The median nerve is one of the primary structures within the cubital fossa. It passes through the fossa between the two heads of the pronator teres muscle and continues into the forearm to innervate muscles involved in forearm flexion and hand movements. It is located medial to the brachial artery within the fossa. (B) Biceps tendon The biceps tendon is a key structure found within the cubital fossa. The tendon of the biceps brachii muscle crosses the elbow joint and inserts on the radial tuberosity. In the cubital fossa, it lies laterally to the brachial artery and is palpable during physical examination. (C) Brachial artery The brachial artery is a major vessel that passes through the cubital fossa. It divides into the radial and ulnar arteries at the level of the fossa, supplying blood to the forearm and hand. It is located between the biceps tendon and the median nerve in the fossa.",
