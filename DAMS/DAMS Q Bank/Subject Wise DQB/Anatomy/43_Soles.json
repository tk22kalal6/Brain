      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Ball & Socket The talocalcaneonavicular joint is a ball and socket joint. This joint is formed by the articulation of the talus, calcaneus, and navicular bones. It allows for a significant range of movement, including inversion, eversion, and some degree of rotation, similar to the movement seen in ball and socket joints, although the motion is more restricted compared to joints like the shoulder or hip. The shape of the talus (which resembles a ball) fitting into the concave surface of the calcaneus and navicular bones enables a multi-axial movement pattern, which is characteristic of ball and socket joints. Incorrect Responses: (A) Plane A plane joint is characterized by two flat surfaces that allow for limited sliding or gliding movements, typically found between bones that have flat or slightly curved surfaces. The talocalcaneonavicular joint does not exhibit the limited sliding motion typical of a plane joint; instead, it permits a more complex range of motions, making it unsuitable for this classification. (C) Saddle A saddle joint allows movement in two planes, typically permitting flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. The best example of a saddle joint is the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. However, the talocalcaneonavicular joint does not fit this description, as it allows for more rotational movement rather than just two planes of motion, ruling out the saddle classification. (D) Pivot A pivot joint allows for rotational movement around a single axis. An example of a pivot joint is the atlantoaxial joint in the neck, which allows rotation of the head. The talocalcaneonavicular joint, on the other hand, permits multi-axial movements, not just rotational motion, so it is not classified as a pivot joint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Dorsiflexion. Explanation for Correct Answer: The most stable position of the ankle joint is dorsiflexion. In dorsiflexion, the angle between the dorsum of the foot and the leg decreases, causing the talus bone to fit more snugly into the mortise of the tibia and fibula. This position aligns the bones more securely and increases the bony congruency, thereby providing greater stability to the joint. The stability is further enhanced by the ligaments and the overall structure of the ankle joint in this position. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Inversion: Inversion involves tilting the sole of the foot inward, which can lead to strain on the lateral ligaments and make the joint less stable, increasing the risk of sprains. It is not the most stable position because the ligaments and structures are not as well aligned as in dorsiflexion. (B) Plantar flexion: Plantar flexion involves pointing the toes downward, and while it might seem stable, it actually reduces the bony congruency between the talus and the tibia/fibula. The ankle joint is less stable in plantar flexion because the talus doesn't fit as securely into the mortise of the tibia and fibula. (C) Eversion: Eversion refers to the outward tilting of the sole of the foot. This position puts strain on the medial ligaments of the ankle and can destabilize the joint. It is not a stable position for the ankle joint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Talus. Explanation for Correct Answer: The talus is considered the keystone of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. It is the bone that sits at the top of the arch, forming the main connection between the foot and the leg. The talus plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape and stability of the medial longitudinal arch because it is centrally positioned and bears the weight of the body as it transfers from the tibia to the foot. Its positioning and structure help support the other bones that form the arch, making it the keystone of the medial arch. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Calcaneum: The calcaneus (heel bone) forms the foundation of the foot and supports the body weight, but it does not serve as the keystone of the medial longitudinal arch. It provides support to the posterior part of the arch, while the talus is the central keystone. (B) Cuboid: The cuboid is located on the lateral side of the foot and helps support the lateral longitudinal arch, not the medial one. It is not involved in the formation or maintenance of the medial longitudinal arch. (D) Navicular: The navicular bone is important in maintaining the medial arch, but it is not considered the keystone. The navicular works closely with the talus and other bones of the arch, but the talus, being centrally located and bearing most of the weight, is the true keystone.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Peroneus brevis. Forceful inversion of the foot can result in an avulsion fracture of the tuberosity of the 5th metatarsal due to the pull exerted by the peroneus brevis tendon. The peroneus brevis originates from the lower two-thirds of the lateral surface of the fibula and inserts into the tuberosity of the 5th metatarsal. During an inversion injury, the foot is twisted inward forcefully, causing the peroneus brevis to contract suddenly in an attempt to stabilize the foot. This sudden, strong pull on its insertion can lead to an avulsion fracture of the 5th metatarsal tuberosity, a common injury in such scenarios. Explanation of the incorrect options: (A) Peroneus longus: The peroneus longus originates from the upper part of the lateral fibula and inserts on the medial cuneiform and base of the 1st metatarsal. It plays a role in plantarflexion and eversion of the foot but does not attach to the 5th metatarsal, so it cannot cause its fracture during inversion. (C) Peroneus tertius: The peroneus tertius originates from the distal fibula and inserts on the dorsal surface of the base of the 5th metatarsal. While it does attach to the 5th metatarsal, it assists in dorsiflexion and eversion. It is not the primary tendon involved in inversion injuries, as its line of pull does not contribute to avulsion fractures of the 5th metatarsal tuberosity. (D) Extensor digitorum: The extensor digitorum longus is a muscle that extends the toes and dorsiflexes the foot. It does not insert on the 5th metatarsal, nor does it play a role in inversion-related injuries.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Subtalar joints. The movements of inversion (turning the sole of the foot inward) and eversion (turning the sole outward) primarily occur at the subtalar joint, also known as the talocalcaneal joint. This joint is formed by the articulation between the talus and the calcaneus and allows for the side-to-side movement necessary for these actions. The subtalar joint is critical for adapting the foot to uneven terrain and maintaining balance during walking or running. Its unique structure, including an oblique axis, facilitates these rotational movements. Explanation of the incorrect options: (A) Ankle joints: The ankle joint (talocrural joint) is a hinge joint formed by the tibia, fibula, and talus. Its primary movements are dorsiflexion (lifting the foot upward) and plantarflexion (pointing the foot downward). It does not allow for inversion or eversion, as these movements occur at more distal joints. (C) Tibiotalar joints: The tibiotalar joint is another name for the talocrural (ankle) joint. Like the ankle joint, it only allows dorsiflexion and plantarflexion and is not involved in inversion or eversion movements. (D) Transverse tarsal joints: The transverse tarsal joint (Chopart’s joint) is formed by the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints. While it assists in inversion and eversion to some extent, it plays a secondary role compared to the subtalar joint. It functions more in conjunction with the subtalar joint to enhance foot adaptability.",

The deltoid ligament originates from the medial malleolus of the tibia, and its fibers extend to attach to the talus and calcaneus bones. The lateral malleolus is located on the opposite side of the ankle (on the fibula), and is not part of the deltoid ligament's attachment. The lateral malleolus is associated with the lateral collateral ligament of the ankle. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Medial malleolus: The deltoid ligament originates from the medial malleolus of the tibia, which is one of the primary attachment points for this ligament. B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Subtalar and midtarsal joints. Inversion and eversion occur primarily at the subtalar and midtarsal joints. The subtalar joint is located between the talus and the calcaneus and allows for the movement of the foot in the frontal plane, enabling inversion (turning the sole of the foot inward) and eversion (turning the sole outward). The midtarsal joint, which consists of the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints, also contributes to these movements, allowing for further adjustment of foot position during walking and running. These two joints work together to control the orientation of the foot in relation to the ground. Reasons for Incorrect Options: B. Calcaneonavicular joint: The calcaneonavicular joint, also known as the spring ligament, is important for supporting the arch of the foot but does not directly contribute to inversion and eversion. This joint helps maintain the integrity of the medial arch, and while it plays a role in foot biomechanics, it is not the primary site for inversion and eversion movements. C. Midtarsal joint: The midtarsal joint is indeed involved in inversion and eversion, but it cannot be considered in isolation without the subtalar joint, which is the more important contributor to these movements. The subtalar joint and the midtarsal joint together contribute to the inversion and eversion of the foot, making option A a more comprehensive and correct answer. D. Calcaneocuboid only: The calcaneocuboid joint is a component of the midtarsal joint and contributes to foot mobility, but it alone does not produce significant inversion and eversion. The movement is more complex and involves both the calcaneocuboid and the talonavicular components of the midtarsal joint, as well as the subtalar joint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Calcaneonavicular ligament. The spring ligament, also known as the calcaneonavicular ligament, is a crucial ligament of the foot. It connects the calcaneus (heel bone) to the navicular bone and plays a key role in supporting the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. The ligament helps maintain the integrity of the arch and contributes to the ability to walk and bear weight. Its nickname \"spring ligament\" comes from its role in providing elastic support to the foot. Reasons for Incorrect Options: B. Calcaneocuboid ligament: The calcaneocuboid ligament connects the calcaneus (heel bone) to the cuboid bone, located on the lateral side of the foot. This ligament helps stabilize the lateral aspect of the foot, but it is not involved in supporting the medial arch, which is the role of the spring (calcaneonavicular) ligament. Therefore, option B is incorrect. C. Transverse tibiofibular ligament: The transverse tibiofibular ligament is located between the tibia and fibula in the lower leg, specifically in the syndesmosis joint. It is not involved in foot arch support and is unrelated to the spring ligament. Therefore, option C is incorrect. D. Talocalcaneal ligament: The talocalcaneal ligament connects the talus to the calcaneus in the ankle joint.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Peroneus longus. Eversion of the foot involves turning the sole outward, away from the midline. This movement is primarily produced by the muscles in the lateral compartment of the leg, namely the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. The peroneus longus is the more significant contributor to eversion. It originates from the fibula and inserts on the medial cuneiform and the base of the first metatarsal, passing under the foot. Its action pulls the sole laterally, producing eversion. Additionally, the peroneus longus supports the transverse arch of the foot, making it essential for both movement and stability. Explanation of the incorrect options: (A) Tibialis anterior: The tibialis anterior is a muscle located in the anterior compartment of the leg. Its primary actions are dorsiflexion and inversion of the foot. It is not involved in eversion, as it pulls the foot medially rather than laterally. (B) Tibialis posterior: The tibialis posterior is located in the deep posterior compartment of the leg. It plays a role in plantarflexion and inversion of the foot. Like the tibialis anterior, it pulls the foot medially and supports the arch, so it does not contribute to eversion. (C) Peroneus tertius: The peroneus tertius, a small muscle in the anterior compartment of the leg, assists in dorsiflexion and weak eversion of the foot. However, its contribution to eversion is minimal compared to the peroneus longus and brevis, and it is not the primary muscle for this action.",

The tibialis posterior is the primary muscle responsible for this action. It is located in the deep posterior compartment of the leg. The muscle originates from the posterior surfaces of the tibia and fibula and inserts on the navicular and several other tarsal bones. Its contraction pulls the sole medially, producing inversion. In addition to inversion, the tibialis posterior supports the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, making it crucial for maintaining foot stability and proper alignment. Explanation of the incorrect options: (B) Peroneus tertius: The peroneus tertius is a muscle in the anterior compartment of the leg. It assists in dorsiflexion and weak eversion of the foot but does not contribute to inversion. Its primary role is opposite to that of the tibialis posterior. (C) Peroneus brevis: The peroneus brevis is a muscle in the lateral compartment of the leg. It is a strong evertor of the foot, working alongside the peroneus longus. It pulls the sole outward, away from the midline, which is the opposite of inversion.

Tibialis anterior: The tibialis anterior tendon runs along the anterior aspect of the ankle and does not pass below the sustentaculum tali. It functions primarily in dorsiflexing and inverting the foot. B. Tibialis posterior: The tibialis posterior tendon passes behind the medial malleolus, but it does not pass below the sustentaculum tali. It plays a key role in foot inversion and maintaining the arch of the foot. C. Flexor digitorum longus: The flexor digitorum longus tendon also passes behind the medial malleolus, but it runs in a separate path and does not pass below the sustentaculum tali. It is responsible for flexing the toes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The lateral arch of the foot is supported by a tendinous sling formed by the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. These muscles help stabilize the lateral side of the foot and contribute to its arch. Specifically: The peroneus longus tendon passes under the foot and attaches to the medial cuneiform and the first metatarsal bone. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the lateral arch. The peroneus brevis tendon runs along the lateral side of the foot and helps support the lateral arch, although it is primarily involved in foot eversion and plantar flexion. The tendons of these two muscles create a \"sling\" effect across the lateral aspect of the foot, aiding in both the structural integrity and function of the foot's arch. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Peroneus brevis: While the peroneus brevis contributes to the lateral arch, it is not the sole muscle that forms the tendinous sling. The peroneus longus also plays an essential role in this function. C. Peroneus longus and tibialis posterior: The tibialis posterior is important for supporting the medial arch of the foot but does not directly contribute to the tendinous sling of the lateral arch. D. Peroneus brevis and tibialis posterior: Again, the tibialis posterior supports the medial arch and does not form part of the tendinous sling in the lateral arch.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Gluteus maximus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The gluteus maximus is primarily a hip extensor, not a flexor. It is responsible for extending and laterally rotating the hip joint, particularly during movements such as standing up from a sitting position, running, or climbing stairs. It plays a significant role in activities that involve moving the leg behind the body, but it does not contribute to flexion at the hip joint. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Psoas major: The psoas major is one of the primary flexors of the hip. It originates from the lumbar vertebrae and inserts into the lesser trochanter of the femur, facilitating hip flexion. B. Sartorius: The sartorius is another hip flexor. It is the longest muscle in the body and helps in flexing, abducting, and laterally rotating the hip joint. D. Rectus femoris: The rectus femoris, part of the quadriceps muscle group, is also a hip flexor. It crosses the hip joint and helps in flexing the thigh while also contributing to knee extension.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Deep peroneal nerve. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscle is responsible for extending the big toe and dorsiflexing the ankle. It is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve, a branch of the common peroneal nerve. The deep peroneal nerve specifically supplies the muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg, including the extensor hallucis longus, which plays an important role in toe extension and foot dorsiflexion. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Superficial peroneal nerve: The superficial peroneal nerve innervates muscles in the lateral compartment of the leg, such as the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis, but it does not supply the extensor hallucis longus. C. Tibial nerve: The tibial nerve innervates muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg, such as the gastrocnemius, soleus, and flexor muscles, but not the extensor hallucis longus. This muscle belongs to the anterior compartment, which is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. D. Sciatic nerve: The sciatic nerve is a major nerve that innervates muscles in the posterior thigh and leg, but it does not directly supply the extensor hallucis longus. The sciatic nerve does contribute to the tibial nerve, which innervates other muscles, but not the anterior compartment muscles like the EHL.",
