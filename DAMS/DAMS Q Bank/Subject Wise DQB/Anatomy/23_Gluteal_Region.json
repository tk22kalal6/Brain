      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gluteus medius. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The Trendelenburg sign is positive when there is weakness or paralysis of the gluteus medius muscle. The gluteus medius is responsible for abducting the hip and stabilizing the pelvis during walking, particularly when standing on one leg. When the gluteus medius is weak or paralyzed, the pelvis drops on the opposite side during the stance phase of walking, causing the individual to lean toward the affected side to compensate. This is known as the Trendelenburg sign, indicating dysfunction in the gluteus medius muscle. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Gluteus maximus: The gluteus maximus is primarily responsible for hip extension and lateral rotation of the hip. Although weakness in the gluteus maximus can affect walking, it does not directly cause the Trendelenburg sign, which is associated with abduction and pelvic stabilization, functions carried out by the gluteus medius. C. Piriformis: The piriformis is a deep hip rotator, and although it contributes to lateral rotation and abduction of the hip, paralysis of the piriformis does not cause the Trendelenburg sign. The piriformis does not have the same significant role in stabilizing the pelvis as the gluteus medius. D. Obturator externus: The obturator externus is a muscle involved in lateral rotation and adduction of the hip. While it plays a role in hip movement, its dysfunction does not lead to the Trendelenburg sign. The gluteus medius is the key muscle responsible for the sign.",

The other nerves listed are not particularly vulnerable to injections into the buttocks. The common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve that diverges from it in the popliteal fossa. It then divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve derives from the lumbar plexus, emerges slightly below the anterior superioriliac spine, and supplies the skin of the anterior thigh down to the knee. The obturator nerve derives from the lumbar plexus, diverges from the femoral nerve in the psoas muscle, and passes medially along the lateral pelvic wall to run in the obturator canal, where it divides into anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior division generally supplies the gracilis, adductor brevis, and adductor longus; the posterior division generally supplies the obturator externus and the adductor part of the adductor magnus.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/12_1(16).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gluteus medius & minimus. A positive Trendelenburg's sign indicates weakness or paralysis of the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles. These muscles are responsible for stabilizing the pelvis during walking by preventing the pelvis from dropping on the opposite side. When the gluteus medius and minimus are weak or paralyzed, the pelvis tilts downward on the unaffected side when the patient stands on one leg. This can be seen as a drooping of the pelvis on the side opposite to the weakness, which is the hallmark of a positive Trendelenburg’s sign. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Gluteus maximus: The gluteus maximus is primarily responsible for hip extension and lateral rotation, not for stabilizing the pelvis during walking. Weakness in the gluteus maximus does not typically cause a positive Trendelenburg’s sign. This muscle is not directly involved in preventing pelvic drop during single-leg stance. C. Adductor longus: The adductor longus is a muscle involved in hip adduction, but it does not play a role in stabilizing the pelvis during walking. Weakness in this muscle would not lead to a positive Trendelenburg's sign, as it does not contribute to controlling the lateral movement of the pelvis during single-leg support. D. Hamstrings: The hamstrings are involved in knee flexion and hip extension but do not significantly contribute to pelvic stability during walking. While hamstring weakness can cause other gait abnormalities, it does not cause the pelvic drop seen in a positive Trendelenburg’s sign, which is related to the abductor muscles (gluteus medius and minimus).",

It is actually innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve (L5, S1, S2). The superior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and the tensor fasciae latae, but not the gluteus maximus. Therefore, option A is the exception. Reasons for Incorrect Options: B. Arises from coccyx, ischium: The gluteus maximus originates from the posterior surface of the sacrum, coccyx, and ischial tuberosity. It is a large muscle in the gluteal region and has broad origins from these areas, making option B true. C. Insertion into iliotibial tract: The gluteus maximus inserts into the iliotibial tract (IT band), a thick band of connective tissue running along the lateral aspect of the thigh. Some fibers also insert into the gluteal tuberosity of the femur. The IT band plays a key role in stabilizing the knee, particularly during walking and running, making option C true. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Make the opposite hip horizontal. When the foot is off the ground (such as in the stance phase of walking or running), the gluteus medius plays a critical role in stabilizing the pelvis. Specifically, it works to prevent the pelvis from tilting downward on the opposite side and helps to keep the opposite hip horizontal. This action is crucial for maintaining pelvic stability and preventing the pelvis from dropping on the unsupported side, which would otherwise cause a compensatory gait. Thus, the gluteus medius ensures the opposite hip remains level, facilitating efficient movement during walking or running. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Flexion: The gluteus medius does not cause flexion of the hip. The main action of the gluteus medius is abduction and pelvic stabilization rather than flexion. Hip flexion is primarily carried out by muscles like the iliopsoas and rectus femoris. B. Abduction: While abduction is a primary function of the gluteus medius, this action occurs when the foot is on the ground and the muscle is actively moving the leg laterally. When the foot is off the ground, the focus of the gluteus medius shifts to stabilizing the pelvis rather than abducting the leg. C. Extension: The gluteus medius is not responsible for hip extension. Hip extension is primarily performed by the gluteus maximus, especially when the leg is moving backward (as in walking or running). The gluteus medius contributes to stability rather than extension when the foot is off the ground.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gluteus Maximus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The superior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus minimus, gluteus medius, and tensor fascia lata muscles. These muscles are involved in the stabilization and abduction of the hip. Specifically: The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are key in stabilizing the pelvis during walking and running by abducting the thigh. The tensor fascia lata assists in stabilizing the hip and knee by tightening the iliotibial band. The gluteus maximus, on the other hand, is a powerful muscle responsible for hip extension and lateral rotation. It is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve, not the superior gluteal nerve, making it the exception in this list. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Gluteus Minimus: The gluteus minimus is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, and it plays a role in hip abduction and medial rotation. It is correctly supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. C. Tensor Fascia Lata: The tensor fascia lata is another muscle supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. It aids in the abduction and flexion of the hip and assists in stabilizing the knee via the iliotibial tract. D. Gluteus Medius: The gluteus medius is also innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. Like the gluteus minimus, it plays a role in hip abduction and stabilization, especially during single-leg support in walking.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Superior gluteal nerve. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The gluteus medius is primarily responsible for hip abduction and stabilization of the pelvis during walking. It is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, which is a branch of the lumbosacral plexus (specifically from the posterior division of the ventral rami of L4, L5, and S1). The superior gluteal nerve supplies both the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus muscles, which are important for the abduction of the hip and maintaining balance during locomotion. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Inferior gluteal nerve: The inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus, not the gluteus medius. It is responsible for hip extension, especially during activities like climbing stairs or rising from a seated position. C. Nerve to obturator internus: The nerve to obturator internus innervates the obturator internus muscle and the superior gemellus, which are involved in lateral rotation of the hip, but not the gluteus medius. D. Nerve to quadratus femoris: The nerve to quadratus femoris innervates the quadratus femoris and the inferior gemellus, which are also involved in lateral rotation of the hip, but not the gluteus medius.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Abduction. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are primary muscles involved in abduction at the hip joint. These muscles are located on the lateral side of the hip, and their main function is to move the thigh away from the midline of the body, which is known as abduction. They also play an important role in stabilizing the pelvis during walking or standing on one leg, preventing the pelvis from dropping to the opposite side. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Flexion: Neither the gluteus medius nor the gluteus minimus primarily perform hip flexion. Hip flexion is mainly carried out by muscles like the iliopsoas and rectus femoris. B. Extension: The gluteus maximus, not the medius or minimus, is primarily responsible for extension at the hip joint. The gluteus medius and minimus contribute to stability and abduction but not to extension. D. Adduction: The gluteus medius and minimus do not perform adduction of the hip. Adduction is mainly performed by the adductor group of muscles, such as the adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Superolateral. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The superolateral quadrant of the gluteus maximus is considered the safest site for intramuscular injections. This area is located in the upper outer portion of the buttocks, away from major blood vessels, nerves, and bone. The sciatic nerve, which is one of the largest nerves in the body, runs close to the gluteus maximus but is located more medially, so injecting into the superolateral region minimizes the risk of damaging it. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Inferomedial: The inferomedial quadrant is not recommended because it is close to the sciatic nerve. Injecting here increases the risk of injuring the nerve. B. Superomedial: The superomedial quadrant is not ideal because it is located near the gluteal vessels and the sciatic nerve, which can pose a risk if damaged during an injection. D. Superomedial (Repeated option): The explanation remains the same—injecting into this area is risky due to proximity to major structures.",
