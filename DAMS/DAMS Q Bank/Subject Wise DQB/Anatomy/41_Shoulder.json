      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Coracoclavicular. The coracoclavicular ligament is not part of the shoulder joint ligaments. Instead, it connects the coracoid process of the scapula to the clavicle, providing stability to the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, not the glenohumeral joint, which is the main shoulder joint. The coracoclavicular ligament plays a role in maintaining the position of the clavicle relative to the scapula, but it does not directly contribute to the stability of the shoulder joint itself. Incorrect Responses: B. Glenohumeral: The glenohumeral ligaments are indeed part of the shoulder joint and are essential for stabilizing the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. These ligaments connect the glenoid cavity of the scapula to the humeral head, contributing to the joint's stability during various arm movements. C. Coracohumeral: The coracohumeral ligament is another important ligament in the shoulder joint. It connects the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tuberosity of the humerus and helps stabilize the shoulder by limiting excessive motion, particularly in the superior direction. D. Transverse humeral: The transverse humeral ligament is also part of the shoulder joint. It spans across the bicipital groove of the humerus and holds the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle in place, preventing it from dislocating during shoulder movements. It is essential for maintaining the integrity of the bicipital tendon within the groove.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) External rotation of the shoulder The latissimus dorsi does not contribute to the external rotation of the shoulder. This muscle primarily acts on the humerus to produce extension, adduction, and medial rotation, as well as assisting in movements such as pulling or climbing. External rotation of the shoulder, however, is primarily performed by other muscles such as the infraspinatus and teres minor, which are part of the rotator cuff group. Since the latissimus dorsi is not involved in this action, option (A) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (B) Extension The latissimus dorsi is a powerful extensor of the shoulder joint. It pulls the humerus posteriorly and contributes significantly to movements like pulling a body upward or backward during climbing or swimming. This is a primary and well-established action of the muscle. (C) Adduction The latissimus dorsi plays a major role in adduction of the shoulder joint by drawing the humerus closer to the body’s midline. This action is important in movements like pulling downwards or bringing the arm from an abducted position to the side. (D) Medial rotation The latissimus dorsi also contributes to medial (internal) rotation of the shoulder. When the arm is rotated inwardly towards the body, the latissimus dorsi works in coordination with other muscles, such as the subscapularis and pectoralis major, to produce this motion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Medial rotation of scapula Medial rotation of the scapula does not occur during shoulder abduction. Instead, during abduction of the shoulder joint, the scapula undergoes lateral (upward) rotation. This movement is essential to elevate the glenoid cavity, allowing the humerus to move freely and achieve full abduction. Medial rotation of the scapula would lower the glenoid cavity, opposing the motion of abduction, making option (A) the correct answer as it is not a part of shoulder abduction. Incorrect Options: (B) Axial rotation of humerus at acromioclavicular joint During abduction, the humerus rotates axially to prevent impingement of the greater tubercle against the acromion. This movement occurs at the glenohumeral joint and is assisted by movements at the acromioclavicular joint to optimize the scapula's position. This axial rotation is a critical component of shoulder abduction. (C) Elevation of humerus The elevation of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint is the primary movement in shoulder abduction. This involves the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles lifting the arm away from the body, contributing significantly to the initial phase of abduction. (D) Movements at clavicular end of sternoclavicular joint During shoulder abduction, the clavicle moves at the sternoclavicular joint to allow scapular motion. This includes elevation, posterior rotation, and slight retraction of the clavicle, which is vital for enabling the full range of scapular rotation and shoulder abduction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Spinal accessory nerve. The trapezius muscle is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI), which provides motor innervation. This nerve originates from the medulla oblongata and is responsible for controlling the trapezius as well as the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The spinal accessory nerve enters the trapezius after traveling down the neck and provides the necessary motor function for actions such as elevating, retracting, and rotating the scapula. Therefore, the spinal accessory nerve is the correct answer. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Axillary Incorrect The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles, not the trapezius. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and is responsible for shoulder abduction and external rotation. The axillary nerve does not contribute to the innervation of the trapezius, making this option incorrect. B. Musculocutaneous Incorrect The musculocutaneous nerve arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus and innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm, such as the biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis. It does not supply the trapezius, making this option incorrect. C. Median Incorrect The median nerve is a major nerve of the upper limb that innervates the muscles of the anterior forearm and the lateral part of the palm. It does not innervate the trapezius, so this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is often referred to as the \"dynamic stabilizer\" of the shoulder joint because it plays a critical role in stabilizing the shoulder during movement. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles not only help with the movement of the shoulder but also provide dynamic stabilization by holding the humeral head firmly in the shallow glenoid cavity, preventing dislocation or instability during various arm movements. Incorrect Responses: B. Glenoid labrum: The glenoid labrum is a static stabilizer, not a dynamic stabilizer. It is a fibrocartilaginous structure that deepens the glenoid cavity to help stabilize the ball-and-socket joint. While it contributes to shoulder stability, it does not actively stabilize the joint during motion like the rotator cuff muscles do. C. Coracohumeral ligament: The coracohumeral ligament helps stabilize the shoulder joint, but it is also considered a static stabilizer. It assists in limiting excessive movement and providing structural support to the joint, especially when the arm is in certain positions. However, it does not play an active role during the dynamic movements of the shoulder in the same way as the rotator cuff. D. Glenohumeral ligament: The glenohumeral ligaments are part of the passive stabilizing structures of the shoulder joint. These ligaments help to limit excessive movement and provide stability to the shoulder, but they do not actively contribute to stabilizing the joint during dynamic movements like the rotator cuff muscles do.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Based on anatomical functions, options A, B, and D are all correct statements regarding the actions of the rhomboid minor muscle A. Retracts the scapula along with the trapezius: This statement describes a core function of the rhomboid muscles. Scapular retraction (or adduction) involves pulling the scapula medially, closer to the vertebral column. The rhomboids are very powerful retractors. The middle fibers of the trapezius muscle also play a significant role in scapular retraction. Therefore, the rhomboid minor indeed retracts the scapula along with the trapezius. This statement is correct. B. Elevates the scapula along with the trapezius: The rhomboid muscles do contribute to scapular elevation, which means lifting the scapula superiorly. While the upper fibers of the trapezius are well-known as strong elevators of the scapula, the rhomboids, by pulling the scapula medially and slightly superiorly, also assist in this action. So, the rhomboid minor can elevate the scapula along with the trapezius (specifically, the upper fibers). This statement is also correct. C. Rotates the scapula so that glenoid cavity tilts upwards: This statement describes upward rotation of the scapula, where the glenoid cavity (the shallow socket that articulates with the head of the humerus) rotates superiorly. This action is primarily performed by the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles. The rhomboid muscles actually have the opposite effect; they cause downward rotation of the scapula. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. D. Rotates the scapula so that glenoid cavity tilts downwards: This statement describes downward rotation of the scapula, where the glenoid cavity tilts inferiorly. This is a very important and direct action of the rhomboid muscles, working in conjunction with muscles like the levator scapulae and pectoralis minor. This statement is correct.",
