      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tibialis anterior The tibialis anterior is the primary muscle responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot at the ankle joint. It lies on the anterior compartment of the leg and is responsible for lifting the foot upwards (dorsiflexion), as well as aiding in inversion of the foot. This makes it the correct choice in this question. Incorrect Responses: (A) Extensor digitorum brevis The extensor digitorum brevis is located on the dorsum of the foot and primarily functions to extend the toes, not to dorsiflex the foot at the ankle joint. Although it plays a role in extending the toes, it does not contribute to the movement of the foot at the ankle joint. (C) Peroneus longus The peroneus longus (also known as fibularis longus) is a muscle that is involved in plantarflexion of the foot and eversion of the ankle. It helps with pushing the foot downward and outward, making it the opposite of dorsiflexion. Therefore, it does not contribute to dorsiflexion of the foot. (D) Flexor hallucis longus The flexor hallucis longus is a muscle that primarily helps in plantarflexion of the foot and flexion of the big toe. It is located on the posterior aspect of the leg and is involved in the downward movement of the foot, not dorsiflexion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Synonymous with plantar calcaneonavicular ligament. Explanation for Correct Answer: The spring ligament is also known as the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament. It is a crucial ligament in the foot that supports the medial longitudinal arch, helping to maintain the arch's integrity. The ligament connects the calcaneus (heel bone) to the navicular bone, contributing to the support and function of the foot during walking and running. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Seen in the spine: The spring ligament is located in the foot, not the spine. It plays a role in the foot's structure and arch support, so this option is incorrect. (C) Seen in hip joint: The spring ligament does not have any role in the hip joint. The ligaments in the hip joint are different, such as the iliofemoral ligament or pubofemoral ligament, so this option is incorrect. (D) Seen in the knee joint: The spring ligament is not located in the knee joint. Knee joint ligaments include the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and others, but the spring ligament is associated with the foot,",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most common type of ankle sprain is lateral, which occurs as a result of excessive inversion of the foot and plantar flexion of the ankle. The calcaneofibular and anterior talofibular ligaments may tear, producing marked swelling and pain. These two ligaments combined with the posterior talofibular ligament constitute the lateral ligament of the ankle.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) The deep peroneal nerve arises from the common peroneal nerve (L4-S2). It innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, which dorsiflex (extend) the foot. Damage to the nerve therefore produces “foot-drop”—a classic clue to deep peroneal nerve pathology. The nerve gives rise to many branches, one of which innervates the skin between the first and second toes. The femoral nerve (choice B) contains fibers from L2-L4. It supplies flexor muscles of the thigh, extensors at the knee joint, and cutaneous areas of the thigh. The saphenous nerve branches off from it and supplies the knee joint and the skin on the medial aspect of the foot.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/19_1(19).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Tibialis posterior. The tibialis posterior is a powerful invertor of the foot and inserts on almost all of the tarsal bones except for the talus. It inserts into the navicular, cuneiforms, cuboid, and the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsals. This muscle plays a key role in foot inversion and supports the medial arch of the foot. Its broad insertion on the tarsal bones (except the talus) makes it the most prominent invertor of the foot. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Tibialis anterior: The tibialis anterior also contributes to foot inversion, but its insertion is at the medial cuneiform and the first metatarsal. While it helps in dorsiflexion and inversion, it does not have as extensive an insertion on the tarsal bones as the tibialis posterior. Therefore, it doesn't insert on most of the tarsal bones. C. Flexor hallucis longus: The flexor hallucis longus primarily acts to flex the big toe and assist in plantarflexion. It also contributes to foot inversion, but its insertion is specifically on the distal phalanx of the big toe. It does not insert on the tarsal bones, and its role in inversion is less significant compared to the tibialis posterior. D. Flexor digitorum longus: The flexor digitorum longus primarily functions to flex the toes and assists in plantarflexion. It inserts on the distal phalanges of the second to fifth toes and does not contribute significantly to inversion of the foot. Its insertion is not on the tarsal bones, making it less relevant in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Talus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The talus is the only tarsal bone in the foot that does not have any muscular attachments. It serves as a key bone in the ankle joint, transferring weight from the tibia to the foot. The talus itself does not provide direct attachment points for muscles. Instead, muscles in the foot and lower leg attach to other tarsal bones like the navicular, cuboid, and cuneiforms, while the talus acts primarily as a support structure. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Navicular: The navicular bone has several muscular attachments, including the tibialis posterior, which attaches to its tuberosity. It plays a key role in foot motion and arch support. C. Cuboid: The cuboid bone also has muscular attachments. The peroneus longus tendon passes along the cuboid, contributing to the lateral aspect of foot motion. D.
