      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Urogenital sinus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The lower part of the vagina develops from the urogenital sinus during embryonic development. The urogenital sinus is a structure derived from the cloaca, and it gives rise to the lower portion of the vagina, as well as the urethra and other components of the lower urinary tract. The upper part of the vagina, however, develops from the paramesonephric ducts (also called Mullerian ducts), but the lower part is specifically derived from the urogenital sinus. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Mesonephric duct: This is incorrect because the mesonephric duct (also known as the Wolffian duct) gives rise to male reproductive structures, such as the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. It does not contribute to the development of the vagina. C. Paramesonephric duct: This is incorrect as it forms the upper part of the vagina, the uterus, and fallopian tubes in females. While the paramesonephric duct contributes to the formation of the vagina, it is the lower part of the vagina that specifically develops from the urogenital sinus. D. Mesonephric tubules: This is incorrect because the mesonephric tubules are involved in the development of structures such as the kidneys and the male reproductive tract, but they do not contribute to the formation of the vagina.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Suprarenal medulla. Explanation for the Correct Answer: A. Suprarenal medulla: The suprarenal medulla (also known as the adrenal medulla) is derived from neural crest cells, not mesoderm. Neural crest cells are a unique group of cells that arise from the ectoderm (the outer germ layer) and migrate to various parts of the body to differentiate into several structures, including the adrenal medulla. Therefore, it is not derived from mesoderm. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Renal cortex: The renal cortex is derived from the mesoderm, specifically from the intermediate mesoderm, which forms the kidneys. The kidneys, including the renal cortex, develop from the metanephric mesoderm during embryogenesis. C. Cardiac musculature: The cardiac musculature is derived from the mesoderm, specifically from the mesodermal layer that forms the heart. The heart develops from a specialized region of mesoderm called the cardiac mesoderm, and the muscles of the heart are formed from this tissue. D. Skeletal musculature: The skeletal musculature is derived from the mesoderm, specifically from the paraxial mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm forms somites, which give rise to the skeletal muscles of the body.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Left umbilical vein. Explanation for the Correct Answer: B. Left umbilical vein: The ligamentum teres of the liver is the remnant of the left umbilical vein. During fetal development, the left umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. After birth, this vein closes off and becomes the ligamentum teres, which is found in the free edge of the falciform ligament of the liver. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Umbilical arteries: The umbilical arteries are responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta. They eventually form the medial umbilical ligaments after birth, not the ligamentum teres. C. Ductus venosus: The ductus venosus is a vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver in the fetus and connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. After birth, it becomes the ligamentum venosum, not the ligamentum teres. D. Ductus arteriosus: The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing blood to bypass the lungs.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Neural crest The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which are ectodermal in origin. Neural crest cells give rise to the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. These chromaffin cells are responsible for producing catecholamines, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, as part of the body's response to stress. The neural crest contributes to the development of several structures, including components of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and certain endocrine structures like the adrenal medulla. Incorrect Responses: (A) Surface ectoderm The surface ectoderm forms structures such as the epidermis, hair, nails, and certain glands like the salivary and sweat glands. It does not contribute to the adrenal medulla, which is an endocrine organ with neural crest origins. (B) Endoderm The endoderm gives rise to the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and associated glands, such as the pancreas and liver. It does not play a role in the formation of the adrenal medulla. (D) Mesoderm While the adrenal cortex is derived from mesoderm, the adrenal medulla is not. The mesoderm contributes to the development of muscles, bones, blood vessels, and the adrenal cortex but not the neural crest-derived medulla.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Takes around 74 days Spermatogenesis is the process by which spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The entire process, from the formation of spermatogonia to the production of mature spermatozoa, takes approximately 74 days in humans. This duration includes mitotic divisions, meiotic divisions, and the process of spermiogenesis, where spermatids are transformed into mature spermatozoa. This timeline ensures a continuous and efficient production of sperm in males. Incorrect Responses: (B) Occurs in spermatic cord This is incorrect because spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, not in the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord contains structures such as the vas deferens, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, which are involved in the support and transport of sperm but not in its production. (C) Meiosis occurs only after the secondary spermatocyte stage This is incorrect because meiosis begins with primary spermatocytes, which undergo the first meiotic division to form secondary spermatocytes. Secondary spermatocytes then undergo the second meiotic division to form haploid spermatids. Therefore, meiosis does not exclusively occur after the secondary spermatocyte stage. (D) Spermatozoa forms spermatids This is incorrect because the reverse is true. Spermatids are the result of the second meiotic division of secondary spermatocytes, and these spermatids undergo morphological changes (spermiogenesis) to form spermatozoa. Spermatozoa do not give rise to spermatids.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cumulus Oophorus The cells that surround the oocyte in the Graafian follicle are called the cumulus oophorus. These cells form a cluster around the oocyte and play an essential role in the development of the egg. The cumulus oophorus provides nourishment to the oocyte and is involved in the signaling processes that regulate the maturation of the egg. As the follicle matures, the cumulus oophorus becomes more prominent and the oocyte is released during ovulation. Incorrect Options: (A) Discus Proligerus The discus proligerus is a term that is sometimes used to describe the layer of granulosa cells that directly surround the oocyte within the early stages of follicular development. However, once the Graafian follicle reaches its mature stage, the cumulus oophorus becomes the more recognized structure surrounding the oocyte, making discus proligerus an outdated or less common term in this context. (C) Luteal Cells Luteal cells are found in the corpus luteum, which forms after ovulation when the Graafian follicle ruptures. These cells are responsible for the secretion of hormones like progesterone. They do not surround the oocyte in the Graafian follicle. Therefore, they are not involved in the pre-ovulatory stages of follicular development. (D) Villus Cells Villus cells are not associated with the Graafian follicle. The term \"villus\" is generally used to describe finger-like projections found in structures like the intestine. Villus cells are not involved in the support or development of the oocyte, making this term irrelevant to the question of cells surrounding the oocyte in the Graafian follicle.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Golgi body The acrosome cap of the sperm is derived from the Golgi body (also known as the Golgi apparatus). During spermatogenesis, the Golgi body forms small vesicles that contain enzymes. These vesicles fuse to form the acrosomal cap, which covers the anterior part of the sperm's nucleus. The acrosome plays a crucial role in fertilization by containing enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the egg's zona pellucida during fertilization. Incorrect Options: (B) Mitochondria The mitochondria are responsible for providing energy to the sperm cell, primarily through ATP production, which powers the movement of the sperm. However, the mitochondria do not contribute to the formation of the acrosome. Their role is more related to energy production and not to the development of the acrosomal cap. (C) Nucleus The nucleus of the sperm contains the genetic material (DNA), but it does not play a direct role in the formation of the acrosome. The acrosome is a separate structure that forms from the Golgi body, not from the sperm's nucleus. (D) Ribosome Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis within the cell. While proteins are essential for the formation of the acrosome, ribosomes themselves do not form the acrosome. They are involved in protein production, but the acrosome is specifically derived from the Golgi apparatus, which processes and packages the enzymes necessary for fertilization.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Fallopian tube Capacitation is the process through which sperm become capable of fertilizing an egg, and it mainly takes place in the fallopian tube. During capacitation, sperm undergo biochemical changes in response to the environment in the female reproductive tract. This process includes changes in the sperm's membrane and motility, which are essential for the sperm to penetrate the egg's zona pellucida during fertilization. Capacitation begins after the sperm enters the female reproductive system and continues as it travels through the fallopian tube, where it becomes fully capable of fertilizing an oocyte. Incorrect Options: (A) Vagina While sperm are deposited in the vagina during intercourse, capacitation does not occur here. The vaginal environment is not conducive to capacitation, as the sperm must first pass through the cervix and uterus before reaching the fallopian tube, where capacitation occurs. The acidic environment of the vagina can actually impair sperm function temporarily, but capacitation itself takes place later in the reproductive tract. (B) Cervix The cervix plays an important role in guiding sperm into the uterus, but capacitation does not occur in this region. The cervical mucus can either aid or hinder sperm movement depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. Capacitation begins in the uterus and completes in the fallopian tube, not in the cervix. (C) Uterus While sperm may undergo some initial changes in the uterus, capacitation is not fully completed here. The uterus is involved in the transport of sperm toward the fallopian tube, but it is the fallopian tube that provides the final conditions necessary for capacitation. Enzymes and changes in ionic conditions within the fallopian tube are crucial for this process to occur.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Haploid (n) and 2N A secondary spermatocyte is haploid (n). During spermatogenesis, after the primary spermatocyte undergoes meiosis I, it divides to form two secondary spermatocytes, each of which contains half the number of chromosomes, or haploid (n). These secondary spermatocytes then undergo meiosis II, which further divides them into spermatids, which are also haploid (n). Therefore, secondary spermatocytes are haploid (n), containing a single set of chromosomes, and are a key stage in the process of forming mature sperm cells. Incorrect Options: (B) Haploid (2n) and 2N This option is incorrect because it suggests that secondary spermatocytes are both haploid and 2n (which is diploid). However, secondary spermatocytes are haploid and contain half the chromosome number of a diploid cell. Therefore, they cannot be both haploid and diploid at the same time. (C) Diploid (2n) and N This option is also incorrect because secondary spermatocytes are haploid (n), not diploid. Diploid cells have two sets of chromosomes, but secondary spermatocytes only have one set (haploid), having undergone the first meiotic division. (D) Diploid (n) and 2N This option is incorrect because secondary spermatocytes are haploid (n), not diploid. The diploid (2n) condition occurs in the primary spermatocyte before meiosis I, and the subsequent division results in haploid secondary spermatocytes, not diploid cells",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Coronary sinus The left common cardinal vein is one of the primary veins in the embryonic circulatory system. It plays a significant role in the early development of venous structures. During fetal development, the left common cardinal vein undergoes regression and transformation. The left common cardinal vein eventually becomes the coronary sinus, which is a vein that collects deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle (myocardium) and returns it to the right atrium. The coronary sinus remains functional throughout life and plays a crucial role in venous return from the heart itself. Incorrect Responses: (A) Great cardiac vein The great cardiac vein is a major vein of the heart, but it is not derived from the left common cardinal vein. The great cardiac vein collects blood from the anterior aspects of the heart and drains into the coronary sinus, but its formation is distinct from that of the left common cardinal vein. (B) Azygos vein The azygos vein is a major vein in the thoracic cavity that drains blood from the posterior walls of the thorax and abdomen. While it does have connections to the cardinal veins during development, the left common cardinal vein does not form the azygos vein. The azygos system develops from other embryonic venous structures, such as the right common cardinal vein and various intercostal veins. (C) SVC (Superior Vena Cava) The superior vena cava (SVC) is formed primarily by the right common cardinal vein and the right anterior cardinal vein, not from the left common cardinal vein. While the SVC does collect venous blood from the upper part of the body and returns it to the right atrium, its origin is different from that of the coronary sinus. The SVC is related to the venous drainage from the upper body, whereas the left common cardinal vein primarily contributes to the coronary sinus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mitochondria The middle piece of the sperm tail is composed of mitochondria. These mitochondria are arranged in a spiral around the central core of the tail. The primary role of the mitochondria in the middle piece is to provide the energy (in the form of ATP) required for the sperm's motility, enabling it to swim towards the egg during fertilization. Incorrect Responses: (A) Golgi body The Golgi body is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids, but it is not directly involved in the composition of the sperm tail's middle piece. The Golgi apparatus plays a role in the formation of the acrosome during sperm development, but it does not contribute to the structure of the tail's middle piece. (B) Centriole The centriole is involved in cell division and is important in the formation of the microtubule organizing center in cells. In sperm, the centriole plays a role in organizing the flagellum (tail) structure, but it is not the main component of the middle piece of the sperm tail. Instead, the centriole is found in the base of the tail, assisting in the development of the tail but not making up the middle piece. (D) Nucleus The nucleus of the sperm is located in the head, not in the tail. It contains the genetic material (DNA) that will combine with the egg's genetic material during fertilization. The middle piece of the sperm tail is made up primarily of mitochondria, not the nucleus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Sertoli cell The Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier in the testes. These cells are located in the seminiferous tubules and surround the developing sperm cells. Sertoli cells create a tight junction between adjacent cells that forms the blood-testis barrier. This barrier isolates the developing sperm from the immune system, preventing an immune response against the haploid sperm cells, which are genetically distinct from the body’s other cells. Additionally, Sertoli cells provide structural support and nutrients to the developing sperm. Incorrect Responses: (A) Spermatogonia Spermatogonia are the stem cells of spermatogenesis and are located at the base of the seminiferous tubules. They are the cells that undergo mitosis to produce primary spermatocytes. However, they do not form the blood-testis barrier. Their role is to undergo differentiation to produce sperm, not to create the physical barrier between blood vessels and sperm cells. (B) Primary spermatocyte Primary spermatocytes are cells that undergo meiosis to give rise to secondary spermatocytes, and ultimately spermatozoa. While they are involved in the process of spermatogenesis, they do not form the blood-testis barrier. Their role is to go through meiotic division to reduce the chromosome number, not to create physical barriers within the testes. (C) Leydig cell Leydig cells are located outside the seminiferous tubules in the interstitial space. Their main function is to produce testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). While they are crucial for regulating spermatogenesis, they do not play a role in forming the blood-testis barrier.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) A primary oocyte undergoes meiosis to form a single ovum (or egg) along with smaller polar bodies. During the process of oogenesis, the primary oocyte undergoes two meiotic divisions, but only one of the resulting cells becomes the functional ovum. The other cells, known as polar bodies, are much smaller and typically degenerate. Therefore, one primary oocyte results in the formation of only one ovum. While it's true that two meiotic divisions occur during oogenesis, the process does not result in two ova. The first division produces a larger secondary oocyte and a smaller polar body. The secondary oocyte undergoes the second division only if fertilization occurs. The secondary oocyte produces one ovum and a polar body",
