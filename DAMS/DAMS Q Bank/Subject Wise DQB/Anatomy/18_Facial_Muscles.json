      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Both of the above The muscles responsible for intorsion of the eye are the superior oblique and the superior rectus. Intorsion refers to the inward rotation of the eye, and both of these muscles contribute to this movement. The superior oblique muscle is primarily responsible for intorsion when the eye is in the primary position or slightly abducted, while the superior rectus assists in intorsion when the eye is elevated. Therefore, both muscles play a role in producing intorsion, making option C the correct answer. Incorrect Answers: A. Superior oblique The superior oblique muscle does contribute to intorsion of the eye, but it is not the sole muscle responsible. This muscle also helps in depression and abduction of the eye, particularly when the eye is in an abducted position. While it plays a significant role in intorsion, it works in conjunction with the superior rectus to perform the complete action, which is why option A is incomplete. B. Superior rectus The superior rectus muscle, although primarily responsible for elevating the eye, also contributes to intorsion, especially when the eye is in an elevated position. However, it does not produce intorsion on its own, which is why it is not the only muscle involved in this movement. Therefore, option B is incorrect as it does not account for both muscles involved in the intorsion of the eye. D. None of the above This option is incorrect because, as explained above, both the superior oblique and superior rectus muscles are involved in the intorsion of the eye. Therefore, saying \"none of the above\" does not reflect the correct anatomical function of these muscles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Greater Auricular Nerve. The skin at the angle of the jaw is primarily supplied by the greater auricular nerve, which is a branch of the cervical plexus (C2 and C3). This nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin over the angle of the jaw, the lower part of the ear, and the area around the mastoid process. The greater auricular nerve runs along the side of the neck and ascends toward the angle of the jaw, making it the correct choice for this region's sensory innervation. Incorrect Options: A. Mandibular Nerve: The mandibular nerve (V3) is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and provides sensory innervation to the lower jaw, teeth, and chin. However, it does not supply the skin at the angle of the jaw; instead, its sensory branches primarily supply the lower part of the face and the lower teeth. Therefore, it is not responsible for the sensory supply to the angle of the jaw. B. Maxillary Nerve: The maxillary nerve (V2) is another branch of the trigeminal nerve that supplies the upper jaw, cheek, and upper teeth. It does not provide sensory innervation to the angle of the jaw, which is innervated by the greater auricular nerve. Thus, the maxillary nerve is not relevant to this region. D. Transverse Cutaneous Nerve of Neck: The transverse cutaneous nerve of the neck (also known as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the cervical plexus) supplies the skin over the anterior and lateral aspects of the neck. While it may provide some sensation to the skin of the neck, it does not supply the angle of the jaw, making it an incorrect choice.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Temporalis. Explanation: Correct Answer: (D) Temporalis: The temporalis muscle plays a key role in retracting the mandible. When the posterior fibers of the temporalis contract, they pull the mandible backward (retraction). This is important in movements like closing the mouth or returning the mandible to its resting position after protrusion. Incorrect Answers: (A) Medial pterygoid: The medial pterygoid primarily assists in elevating the mandible and helps in side-to-side movements. While it is involved in the closing of the jaw, it does not play a significant role in retracting the mandible. (B) Lateral pterygoid: The lateral pterygoid is mainly responsible for protrusion of the mandible and for movements like side-to-side grinding. It does not contribute to the retraction of the mandible. (C) Masseter: The masseter is primarily responsible for the elevation of the mandible during chewing. It helps close the jaw but does not retract the mandible.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lateral pterygoid. Explanation: The lateral pterygoid muscle is the primary muscle responsible for depressing the mandible. It is involved in opening the mouth by pulling the condyle of the mandible forward and downward. The lateral pterygoid works in coordination with other muscles to perform complex movements like chewing and mouth opening. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Median pterygoid The medial pterygoid muscle works in conjunction with the masseter to elevate the mandible, not depress it. It is primarily involved in closing the jaw rather than opening it. B. Masseter The masseter is a powerful muscle responsible for elevating the mandible, which helps in closing the jaw. It is not involved in the depression of the mandible. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Buccinator. Explanation: The buccinator is not classified as a muscle of mastication. It is a facial muscle that is primarily involved in manipulating food during chewing and aiding in actions like blowing and sucking. The buccinator is innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which supplies all muscles of facial expression. While it assists in positioning food between the teeth by compressing the cheeks, it does not contribute directly to the movement of the jaw or mastication, which is why it is excluded from the group of muscles of mastication. Why the other options are incorrect: Masseter (Option B) The masseter is one of the primary muscles of mastication. It is responsible for elevating the mandible, enabling the powerful closing of the jaw. This muscle is innervated by the mandibular nerve (a branch of the trigeminal nerve, cranial nerve V). Temporalis (Option C) The temporalis muscle is also a muscle of mastication. It assists in elevating and retracting the mandible, allowing for the closing of the jaw and fine control of jaw movements. Like the masseter, it is innervated by the mandibular nerve. Pterygoids (Option D) The medial and lateral pterygoid muscles are crucial muscles of mastication. The medial pterygoid assists in elevating the mandible, while the lateral pterygoid is responsible for protrusion and side-to-side (lateral) movements of the mandible. Both are innervated by the mandibular nerve.",
