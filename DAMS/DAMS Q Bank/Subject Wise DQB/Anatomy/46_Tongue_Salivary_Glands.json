      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Deviation of tongue to right side The genioglossus muscle is responsible for moving the tongue. It is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII). If there is palsy of the right genioglossus, the muscle on the right side will not function properly, leading to a lack of movement on that side of the tongue. Consequently, the tongue will deviate to the right side due to the unopposed action of the genioglossus muscle on the left side. The tongue's deviation toward the side of weakness is a classic sign of hypoglossal nerve or genioglossus dysfunction. Incorrect Answers: B. Deviation of tongue to left side This option is incorrect because if the right genioglossus muscle is paralyzed, the tongue will not move towards the left side. Instead, the weakness of the right side causes the tongue to deviate to the right. The muscle on the left side will continue to pull the tongue towards the left, but without the action of the right side, the tongue will move towards the right side. C. Deviation of soft palate to right side This option is incorrect because the genioglossus muscle affects the tongue, not the soft palate. The movement of the soft palate is controlled by muscles innervated by different cranial nerves, particularly the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). A palsy in the genioglossus would not impact the movement of the soft palate, so it would not cause deviation of the soft palate to the right. D. Deviation of soft palate to left side This option is incorrect for the same reason as option C. The genioglossus is not involved in the movement of the soft palate. If the soft palate deviates, it would typically indicate issues with the vagus nerve or the palatal muscles, not the genioglossus. Therefore, palsy of the right genioglossus would not lead to a deviation of the soft palate in any direction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Masseter The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, passes through several structures in the cheek, but it does not pass through the masseter muscle. The masseter is a powerful muscle responsible for elevating the jaw, and although the duct runs near the masseter, it does not pass through it. Instead, the duct travels through the buccal fat pad and the buccinator muscle before opening into the oral cavity. Therefore, the masseter is the exception in this list. Incorrect Answers: A. Buccopharyngeal fascia The parotid duct does pass through the buccopharyngeal fascia. This fascia is a connective tissue layer that covers the pharynx and surrounds structures like the parotid gland. The duct traverses this fascia as it exits the gland and moves towards the oral cavity. B. Buccinator The parotid duct does pass through the buccinator muscle. The buccinator is a thin, flat muscle in the cheek that helps in the manipulation of food within the mouth. The parotid duct traverses through this muscle as it travels toward the mouth, eventually opening opposite the second upper molar. C. Buccal fat pad The parotid duct passes through the buccal fat pad. The buccal fat pad is located in the cheek and provides cushioning for structures like the parotid duct as it travels through the cheek. The duct is positioned near the buccal fat pad, and the fat pad itself plays a role in the structure and movement of the duct within the cheek.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chorda tympani in the middle ear cavity The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) that carries parasympathetic fibers responsible for stimulating saliva production in the submandibular and sublingual glands. The chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve before synapsing at the submandibular ganglion, where postganglionic fibers then stimulate salivation. A lesion affecting the chorda tympani, particularly in the middle ear cavity, can result in a loss of salivation from the submandibular gland, leading to symptoms like dryness of the mouth. Hence, the correct answer is option B. Incorrect Answers: A. Greater petrosal nerve The greater petrosal nerve also carries parasympathetic fibers from the facial nerve (CN VII) but primarily innervates the lacrimal gland and mucosal glands of the nasal cavity and palate. While it is involved in parasympathetic functions, it does not directly affect the submandibular gland, making it an incorrect choice for this specific symptom of dryness of the mouth. C. Superior cervical ganglion The superior cervical ganglion is part of the sympathetic nervous system, providing sympathetic innervation to structures such as the eyes and the salivary glands. It helps regulate blood flow to the glands and can influence secretion, but it does not directly control parasympathetic salivation, particularly from the submandibular gland. A lesion here is less likely to cause the specific dryness of the mouth seen in this patient, which is related to parasympathetic dysfunction. D. Lesser petrosal nerve The lesser petrosal nerve, another branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), innervates the parotid gland, not the submandibular gland. It carries parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion, which then stimulates salivation from the parotid gland. A lesion of the lesser petrosal nerve would affect parotid secretion, not the submandibular gland, making this option incorrect in the context of this patient's symptoms.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) IX nerve. Pain in the posterior third of the tongue after tonsillectomy is due to injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for the sensory innervation of the posterior third of the tongue, including the taste sensation and general sensation. During tonsillectomy, the tonsils are located near the area where the glossopharyngeal nerve provides sensory input. Thus, injury or irritation to this nerve during the procedure can lead to pain in the posterior third of the tongue. This is a common and expected complication following tonsillectomy. Incorrect Options: A. VII nerve: The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is responsible for the motor innervation of the muscles of facial expression and the taste sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It does not provide sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue, so it is not responsible for pain in that region after tonsillectomy. C. V nerve: The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) provides sensory innervation to the face, including parts of the oral cavity, but it does not innervate the posterior third of the tongue. It is more involved in sensation to the face, teeth, and mouth, not the posterior third of the tongue, so it is not responsible for the pain described after tonsillectomy. D. XII nerve: The hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) primarily provides motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue, controlling movements such as speech and swallowing. It does not carry sensory fibers for the posterior third of the tongue, which is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve. Therefore, injury to the hypoglossal nerve is unlikely to cause pain in the posterior third of the tongue following tonsillectomy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Auriculo-temporal nerve. The auriculo-temporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), which is part of the trigeminal nerve. The auriculo-temporal nerve carries secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland. These fibers are parasympathetic fibers that originate in the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX), synapse in the otic ganglion, and then travel via the auriculo-temporal nerve to the parotid gland, stimulating saliva production. Therefore, the auriculo-temporal nerve is the correct pathway for secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland. Incorrect Options: B. Facial nerve: The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) innervates the muscles of facial expression and provides parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal glands, submandibular, and sublingual glands. However, it does not provide secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland, making this option incorrect. C. Trigeminal nerve: The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) provides sensory innervation to the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. While it has branches like the mandibular nerve (V3) that contribute to sensory innervation of the parotid region, it does not carry secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland. The secretomotor fibers specifically travel through the auriculo-temporal nerve, which is a branch of V3, but not through the entire trigeminal nerve itself. D. Maxillary nerve: The maxillary nerve (V2) is another branch of the trigeminal nerve, but it does not supply the parotid gland. It primarily provides sensory innervation to the upper face, including the cheek, upper lip, and nasal cavity, but it does not carry secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In the substance of parotid The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) enters the parotid gland and then divides into its five main branches: temporal, zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and cervical. These branches are located within the substance of the parotid gland, meaning they pass through the gland itself rather than being superficial or deep to it. The facial nerve does not innervate the parotid gland, which is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (via the lesser petrosal nerve), but its branches pass through the parotid to supply the muscles of facial expression. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Incorrect Answers: A. Deep The facial nerve is not located deep to the parotid gland; rather, it passes through the gland. The deep structures, such as the carotid artery, are separate from the facial nerve’s course. Therefore, \"deep\" is not an accurate description of the facial nerve’s relationship with the parotid gland. B. Superficial The facial nerve branches are not superficial to the parotid gland; they travel within the gland. They do not lie directly beneath the skin or on the outermost part of the parotid, so \"superficial\" is incorrect. D. None Since the correct answer is that the facial nerve branches pass through the substance of the parotid gland, \"none\" is not a valid option.",

These branches do not supply the parotid gland but pass through it. The division of the gland into superficial and deep parts is a result of the branching of the facial nerve within the gland. Incorrect Answers: (A) Stenson’s duct opens near 3rd molar: Stenson’s duct actually opens on the buccal mucosa opposite the second upper molar, not the third. This duct is the excretory duct of the parotid gland. (C) Facial nerve supplies it: This is incorrect. The facial nerve does not supply the parotid gland. The parotid gland is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve via the auriculotemporal nerve, which carries parasympathetic fibers. (D) Pierced by retromandibular vein and facial artery: Although it is true that the retromandibular vein and the facial artery are located near or pass through the parotid gland, this statement is misleading. The parotid gland itself is not pierced by these structures, but they run through or are adjacent to the gland. The facial artery actually arises from the external carotid artery and supplies the face, while the retromandibular vein is formed by the union of the superficial temporal and maxillary veins.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Chorda tympani. Explanation: The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), and it carries taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve, V3) to reach the tongue, where it transmits taste information from the anterior portion of the tongue. This is the primary nerve responsible for taste sensation in this region. Incorrect responses: A. Hypoglossal Nerve: The hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) is a motor nerve that innervates the muscles of the tongue (except the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve). It does not carry taste sensation. Therefore, it is not involved in the transmission of taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. C. Glossopharyngeal N.: The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, not the anterior two-thirds. It also provides general sensation and motor innervation to the pharynx and soft palate. However, it does not contribute to the taste sensation in the anterior part of the tongue. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Jugulo-digastric LNs. Explanation: Waldeyer’s ring is a ring of lymphoid tissue located in the pharyngeal region, which plays an important role in the immune system by defending the body against pathogens that enter through the mouth or nose. It consists of several components, but the jugulo-digastric lymph nodes (which are also known as the submandibular or cervical lymph nodes) are not part of this lymphoid ring. The jugulo-digastric lymph nodes are involved in filtering lymph but are not considered part of Waldeyer's ring, which is specifically composed of tonsils and associated lymphoid structures. Incorrect responses: B. Adenoids: The adenoids (or pharyngeal tonsils) are part of Waldeyer’s ring. They are located in the nasopharynx and play a key role in trapping pathogens entering through the nose. These are considered a primary component of Waldeyer’s ring. C. Tubal tonsils: The tubal tonsils are located around the opening of the Eustachian tube in the nasopharynx. They are part of Waldeyer’s ring, contributing to the immune defense against infections that may reach the middle ear or nasopharyngeal area. D. Palatine tonsils: The palatine tonsils are located in the oropharynx and are one of the most well-known components of Waldeyer’s ring.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Deviation of tongue to right. Explanation: The genioglossus muscle is responsible for protruding the tongue and helps in tongue movement. The right genioglossus muscle is controlled by the right hypoglossal nerve. If there is paralysis or weakness in the right genioglossus, the muscle will not be able to exert its force properly on the tongue, leading to a lack of balance between the two sides of the tongue. As a result, the tongue will deviate to the weaker side, which in this case is the right side. This deviation occurs due to the action of the unaffected side of the genioglossus muscle pulling the tongue to the opposite direction. Why the other options are incorrect: B. Deviation of tongue to left This option is incorrect. If the right genioglossus is affected, the tongue will deviate towards the right, not the left. The tongue is pulled to the side of the weakness. C. Deviation of soft palate to right The soft palate is innervated by the vagus nerve (not the hypoglossal nerve), and its movement is not directly related to the action of the genioglossus muscle. Palsy of the genioglossus would affect the tongue, not the soft palate. D. Deviation of soft palate to left Similar to option C, the soft palate movement is controlled by the vagus nerve and not the genioglossus.

These fibers are part of the parasympathetic nervous system and are carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The secretomotor fibers from the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion, and the postganglionic fibers then travel via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), to reach the parotid gland, stimulating the secretion of saliva. This makes the otic ganglion the correct answer for the pathway of secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland. Why the other options are incorrect: Sphenopalatine ganglion (Option B) The sphenopalatine ganglion is involved in the parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland and the nasal mucosa, but it does not play a role in the secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland. It is related to the facial nerve (CN VII) and the lacrimal system, not the parotid gland. Geniculate ganglion (Option C) The geniculate ganglion is associated with the facial nerve (CN VII) and contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons. It is not involved in secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland. It mainly serves the sensory functions of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal and salivary glands, but not to the parotid gland specifically. Lesser ganglion (Option D) The lesser ganglion is not a standard anatomical term used for any specific ganglion involved in secretomotor innervation to the parotid gland. This term does not refer to any ganglion directly related to parasympathetic innervation to the parotid, so it is an incorrect choice in this context.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Genioglossus. Explanation: The genioglossus muscle is often referred to as the \"safety muscle\" of the tongue because it plays a key role in preventing airway obstruction. It is the most important muscle for protruding the tongue and keeping the airway open, especially during sleep. In situations where the tongue might fall back and obstruct the airway (such as during anesthesia or sleep), the genioglossus helps to prevent this by pulling the tongue forward. Therefore, it is known as the safety muscle because of its critical role in maintaining an open airway. Why the other options are incorrect: Hyoglossus (Option A) The hyoglossus muscle is responsible for depressing and retracting the tongue. While important for tongue movements, it does not have the same protective role for the airway as the genioglossus muscle. It is involved in controlling the position and movement of the tongue but is not a \"safety muscle\" in the sense of preventing airway obstruction. Palatoglossus (Option C) The palatoglossus muscle primarily elevates the posterior part of the tongue and helps in swallowing. It does not play a significant role in preventing airway obstruction, so it cannot be considered the safety muscle of the tongue. The palatoglossus is more related to soft palate and tongue coordination during swallowing rather than airway protection. Styloglossus (Option D) The styloglossus muscle functions to retract and elevate the tongue. While it contributes to certain tongue movements, it does not specifically function to keep the airway open or prevent airway obstruction, which is the primary role of the genioglossus. Thus, it is not considered the safety muscle of the tongue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hypoglossal. Explanation: The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is responsible for the motor innervation of the muscles of the tongue. All intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue (except for the palatoglossus) are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. The hypoglossal nerve controls tongue movements such as protrusion, retraction, and elevation, which are essential for actions like speaking, swallowing, and chewing. Why the other options are incorrect: Lingual nerve (Option A) The lingual nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3) and is responsible for sensory innervation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, but it does not supply motor innervation to the tongue muscles. It provides sensation (touch, pain, temperature) and taste via the chorda tympani, but not motor control. Therefore, it is not involved in supplying the muscles of the tongue. Glossopharyngeal nerve (Option B) The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is responsible for taste and sensation from the posterior third of the tongue and provides motor innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle. However, it does not supply the motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue, which is the role of the hypoglossal nerve. Therefore, it is incorrect in this context. Chorda tympani (Option C) The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) and carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. However, it does not provide motor innervation to the tongue muscles. Instead, it is involved in taste sensation and parasympathetic innervation to the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Divided by branches of facial nerve. Explanation: The parotid gland is indeed divided by the branches of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The facial nerve passes through the parotid gland, dividing it into superficial and deep lobes. It is important to understand this division when performing surgical procedures involving the parotid gland, as injury to the facial nerve can cause facial paralysis. Why the other options are incorrect: 2nd largest salivary gland (Option A) The parotid gland is actually the largest of the salivary glands, not the second largest. The second largest salivary gland is the submandibular gland. The parotid gland is located near the ear and produces the majority of the serous saliva in the oral cavity. Stenson’s duct opens behind upper 3rd molar (Option B) Stenson's duct, which drains the parotid gland, opens into the mouth near the upper second molar, not the upper third molar. It is important to note this anatomical feature when examining patients for issues like salivary duct obstructions or infections. Only benign tumors arise from parotid gland (Option D) This statement is incorrect. While benign tumors, such as pleomorphic adenomas, are more common in the parotid gland, malignant tumors can also arise, including mucoepidermoid carcinoma and acinic cell carcinoma. Therefore, the statement that only benign tumors arise from the parotid gland is false.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Genioglossus. Explanation: The genioglossus is a muscle of the tongue, and it plays a major role in controlling the movement and position of the tongue. Ipsilateral deviation of the tongue occurs when the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII), which innervates the genioglossus, is damaged or paralyzed on one side. When the genioglossus muscle on one side is paralyzed, the normal action of pulling the tongue forward is weakened, causing the tongue to deviate towards the side of the paralysis during protrusion. Therefore, paralysis of the genioglossus muscle leads to the ipsilateral deviation of the tongue. Why the other options are incorrect: Medial pterygoid (Option B) The medial pterygoid is a muscle of mastication and is innervated by the mandibular nerve (V3). It is not responsible for tongue movement. The medial pterygoid helps in elevating the mandible and is involved in chewing, so damage to this muscle would not result in tongue deviation. Hyoglossus (Option C) The hyoglossus muscle is involved in depressing the tongue and helping with tongue movements. It is also innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII). While damage to this muscle may affect the function of the tongue, it does not typically cause ipsilateral deviation. The main muscle responsible for tongue deviation due to paralysis is the genioglossus. Lateral pterygoid (Option D) The lateral pterygoid is another muscle of mastication, innervated by the mandibular nerve (V3). It is responsible for moving the jaw side to side and for protracting the jaw. Damage to this muscle would affect jaw movement and not tongue deviation, so it is not involved in the deviation of the tongue.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The large bumps at the back of his tongue are circumvallate papillae. These are large circular structures surrounded by moatlike depressions. The lateral surfaces of these papillae contain taste buds. Aphthous ulcers are small, white or red mouth lesions. Candidal colonies appear in thrush, which occurs more commonly in the immunocompromised host or in those taking antibacterial drugs. You are told that the patient is healthy and not taking medications, making this condition unlikely. Filiform papillae are the most numerous papillae of the tongue. They are elongated cones that create the tongue’s rough texture. They do not contain taste buds.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/5_1(20).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Frey syndrome usually occurs with auriculotemporal nerve injury caused by surgical intervention or trauma in the parotid region, The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve, consists of parasympathetic fibers that signal the parotid gland to produce saliva and sympathetic fibers that innervate the sweat glands of the face and scalp. When an insult to the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibers of the auriculotemporal nerve in the parotid region occurs, the resulting aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers (responsible for salivary secretion) along the pre-existing sympathetic pathways to the vessels and sweat glands of the skin leads to the development of Frey syndrome. Patients with Frey syndrome often present with facial warmth, flushing, and sweating in the territory of the auriculotemporal nerve overlying the parotid gland, which may include the preauricular skin, the temporal skin, the scalp, and the temporomandibular joint region. Symptoms occur during meals, especially with spicy and sour foods.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/43(107).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The most common nerve injury affecting the lower lip after parotidectomy is the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. Since \"Marginal Mandibular branch\" is not an option, there's an issue with the question's options if it expects a single, precise answer. However, let's think if one of the given options could be the intended answer due to some anatomical nuance. The cervical branch innervates the platysma, which can depress the lower lip and angle of the mouth. So, injury to the cervical branch could contribute to perceived lower lip weakness, especially if it's broad depression of the mouth. If the question is well-posed and has a single correct answer among the options, the most plausible link to \"lower lip movement\" amongst the facial nerve branches listed is the Cervical branch, due to its innervation of the platysma. While the marginal mandibular branch is the direct nerve for specific lower lip depressors, the platysma also contributes to lower facial expression. Therefore, the most likely intended answer, if the marginal mandibular branch is not an option, is B. Cervical branch of Facial Nerve",
