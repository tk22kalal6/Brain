      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Tensor fasciae latae The tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle is the primary muscle that inserts into the iliotibial tract (ITB). The TFL is located on the lateral side of the hip and thigh. Its main function is to assist with the stabilization of the pelvis during walking and running, and it helps in flexing, abducting, and medially rotating the hip. The TFL's tendon merges with the iliotibial band, which runs down the lateral aspect of the thigh to insert at the tibia. Additionally, the gluteus maximus muscle also inserts into the iliotibial tract, helping to extend and laterally rotate the hip joint. Therefore, both TFL and gluteus maximus contribute to the ITB, but TFL is specifically responsible for insertion into the ITB, making it the correct answer in this case. Incorrect Responses: (B) Gluteus medius The gluteus medius is a muscle located on the lateral side of the hip. While it plays a crucial role in abducting and medially rotating the thigh, it does not insert into the iliotibial tract. Instead, the gluteus medius inserts into the greater trochanter of the femur. The ITB is not a site of insertion for the gluteus medius. (C) Vastus lateralis The vastus lateralis is part of the quadriceps group and is located on the lateral side of the thigh. It is responsible for knee extension. However, the vastus lateralis does not insert into the iliotibial tract. Instead, it inserts into the patella through the quadriceps tendon, contributing to the extension of the knee joint. Therefore, it is not involved in the iliotibial band. (D) All While both the tensor fasciae latae and gluteus maximus insert into the iliotibial tract, the gluteus medius and vastus lateralis do not. Therefore, this option is incorrect because not all the listed muscles insert into the iliotibial tract.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Femoral vein and femoral artery. Explanation for Correct Answer: The femoral sheath is an anatomical structure that encases several important vessels in the thigh, but notably does not contain the femoral nerve. It is a fascial tunnel that extends from the inguinal ligament down to the femoral canal. The sheath contains: Femoral artery Femoral vein The femoral artery is the main blood supply to the lower limb, and the femoral vein drains blood from the leg back to the heart. These two structures are contained within the femoral sheath and are located in the upper thigh. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Femoral nerve: The femoral nerve is not contained in the femoral sheath. It is actually located outside the femoral sheath, lying lateral to it and running alongside the femoral artery and vein in the femoral triangle. The femoral nerve does not pass through the sheath itself. (B) Femoral vein: The femoral vein is correct because it is one of the structures found within the femoral sheath. (C) Femoral artery: The femoral artery is also correct because it is contained within the femoral sheath.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Nerve to vastus intermedius. Explanation for Correct Answer: The nerve to vastus intermedius does not pass through the subsartorial canal. This nerve, which is a branch of the femoral nerve, innervates the vastus intermedius muscle but does not traverse the subsartorial canal (also known as the adductor canal). The canal primarily allows the passage of the femoral artery, femoral vein, and the saphenous nerve, but the nerve to vastus intermedius runs outside of this canal. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Saphenous nerve: The saphenous nerve is one of the structures that passes through the subsartorial canal. It is a branch of the femoral nerve and provides sensory innervation to the skin on the medial side of the knee, leg, and foot. (B) Femoral artery: The femoral artery also passes through the subsartorial canal. It is a major vessel that supplies the lower limb with oxygenated blood and runs through the canal toward the popliteal fossa. (D) Femoral vein: The femoral vein is another structure that passes through the subsartorial canal. It drains deoxygenated blood from the lower limb and runs alongside the femoral artery within the canal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS). Explanation for Correct Answer: The sartorius muscle originates from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), which is a bony prominence on the pelvis. The sartorius is a long, thin muscle that runs diagonally across the front of the thigh, from the ASIS down to the medial aspect of the tibia. This origin allows it to play a significant role in actions such as flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the hip, as well as knee flexion. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Pectinate line: The pectinate line is found in the pelvic cavity and is associated with the internal iliac artery and veins, as well as parts of the internal pelvic organs. It does not serve as the origin for the sartorius muscle. (C) Body of the ileum: The body of the ileum refers to a portion of the ileum, which is part of the small intestine. This is not related to the origin of the sartorius muscle, which is located on the pelvis, specifically at the ASIS. (D) Ischial tuberosity: The ischial tuberosity is the bony prominence at the lower part of the pelvis, which serves as the origin for other muscles, such as the hamstrings. However, it is not the origin of the sartorius muscle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Iliofemoral ligament. Explanation for Correct Answer: The iliofemoral ligament, also known as the Y ligament of Bigelow, is the strongest ligament in the human body. It is located in the hip joint and connects the ilium (the upper part of the pelvis) to the femur. The iliofemoral ligament plays a critical role in stabilizing the hip joint by preventing excessive extension and ensuring that the hip remains in a stable position during activities like walking and running. Due to its strength and its ability to limit movement at the hip joint, it is considered the strongest ligament in the body. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Inguinal ligament: The inguinal ligament is a strong band of connective tissue that stretches from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the pubic tubercle. While it is important in forming the lower border of the abdomen and in the support of the pelvic region, it is not the strongest ligament in the body. It is more of a structural support ligament rather than one that provides strong resistance to movement. (B) Lacunar ligament: The lacunar ligament is a small ligament that is located at the inguinal region and connects the inguinal ligament to the pubic bone. It is not as strong as the iliofemoral ligament and does not provide the same level of stability or strength. Its role is more about reinforcing the inguinal canal rather than providing strength in joint stability. (C) Ligamentum flavum: The ligamentum flavum is a strong ligament found in the vertebral column. It connects adjacent vertebrae and helps maintain the stability of the spine, particularly during flexion and extension movements. While it is strong, it is not the strongest ligament in the body when compared to the iliofemoral ligament. It also primarily functions in the spine, rather than at the hip joint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Thigh. The fascia cribrosa is a thin layer of fascia found in the thigh, specifically covering the saphenous opening, an oval-shaped aperture in the fascia lata. The fascia cribrosa allows for the passage of the great saphenous vein as it drains into the femoral vein, along with lymphatic vessels and small blood vessels. This structure is significant anatomically as it forms a part of the superficial fascia in the upper part of the thigh and plays a role in vascular and lymphatic drainage. Incorrect Options: (A) Inguinal ring This is incorrect because the inguinal ring refers to an opening in the inguinal canal, which is associated with structures such as the spermatic cord in males and the round ligament of the uterus in females. It is not directly related to the fascia cribrosa, as the latter is part of the thigh region. (B) Femoral canal This is incorrect because the femoral canal is a part of the femoral sheath and contains lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes. While the femoral canal is located near the fascia cribrosa, the fascia itself is part of the fascia lata and specifically associated with the saphenous opening, not the canal. (C) Neck This is incorrect because the neck has no anatomical structure named fascia cribrosa. The fascia cribrosa is specific to the thigh region, and no similar structure is found in the neck.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Medial most compartment of femoral sheath. The femoral canal is the smallest and medial-most compartment of the femoral sheath, which is a funnel-shaped fascial structure surrounding the femoral artery, vein, and canal. The canal is located medial to the femoral vein and is bordered by the femoral ring at its proximal end. The canal's primary function is to allow for the expansion of the femoral vein during periods of increased venous return. It also contains lymphatic vessels, including the deep inguinal lymph node (also called the node of Cloquet), and a small amount of loose connective tissue. Incorrect Options: (A) Smaller in female This is incorrect because the femoral canal is generally larger in females compared to males. This anatomical difference increases the risk of femoral hernia in females, as the wider canal makes it easier for abdominal contents to protrude through the femoral ring. (B) Contains femoral vein This is incorrect because the femoral vein lies in the intermediate compartment of the femoral sheath, not in the femoral canal. The femoral canal contains lymphatic vessels and loose connective tissue, not major blood vessels like the femoral vein. (C) Inferior epigastric artery lies medially This is incorrect because the inferior epigastric artery does not lie medially to the femoral canal. Instead, it arises from the external iliac artery and ascends within the abdomen, running medial to the deep inguinal ring but not directly associated with the femoral canal.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Femoral nerve. The adductor canal (also known as the subsartorial or Hunter's canal) is an anatomical passage in the thigh that serves as a conduit for several important structures. However, the femoral nerve does not pass through the adductor canal. The femoral nerve primarily supplies motor and sensory innervation to the anterior compartment of the thigh, but its branches exit the canal before reaching the adductor hiatus. The saphenous nerve, a branch of the femoral nerve, is the only branch of the femoral nerve that passes through the adductor canal, and it continues to the skin on the medial side of the leg. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Femoral artery: The femoral artery is a primary structure that runs through the adductor canal. It enters the canal and travels down the thigh, eventually passing through the adductor hiatus to become the popliteal artery behind the knee. C. Saphenous nerve: The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve and passes through the adductor canal. It provides sensory innervation to the skin on the medial side of the lower leg and foot. It is the only nerve that traverses the canal. D. Femoral vein: The femoral vein also passes through the adductor canal, running alongside the femoral artery. It drains blood from the lower limb and eventually joins the external iliac vein.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Lacunar ligament. The lacunar ligament forms the medial boundary of the femoral canal. The femoral canal is a small, triangular space located in the upper part of the thigh, just below the inguinal ligament. The lacunar ligament, which is also known as the Gimbernat ligament, extends from the pectineal ligament to the pubic bone and is situated medially to the femoral canal. This ligament helps define the borders of the femoral ring, which is an important area in the context of hernias, particularly femoral hernias. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Pectineal ligament: The pectineal ligament is located lateral to the lacunar ligament, forming part of the lateral boundary of the femoral canal. It connects the pectineal line of the pubis to the iliopubic eminence. It is important for anchoring the femoral artery and other structures but does not form the medial boundary of the femoral canal. C. Pubic ligament: The pubic ligament is not typically recognized as a distinct anatomical structure. While the pubis forms part of the overall boundary of the femoral canal, the lacunar ligament is the specific ligament that forms the medial boundary. Thus, this term is not an appropriate answer in this context. D. Inguinal ligament: The inguinal ligament forms the superior border of the femoral canal, not the medial boundary. It is a band running from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the pubic tubercle and serves as the floor of the inguinal region. While important in the anatomy of the femoral canal, it does not define the medial boundary.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Muscle of the adductor compartment of the thigh. The adductor magnus is a large muscle located in the adductor compartment of the thigh. It has two parts: the adductor part, which is responsible for adducting the thigh, and the hamstring part, which contributes to hip extension. The adductor magnus plays a major role in the movement and stability of the hip and thigh, particularly in activities involving leg adduction and stabilization of the pelvis. Reasons for Incorrect Options: B. Attached to head of fibula: The adductor magnus is not attached to the head of the fibula. It originates from the pubic bone, ischial tuberosity, and ischial ramus, and inserts on the linea aspera of the femur and the adductor tubercle. The head of the fibula is associated with other muscles, such as the biceps femoris, not the adductor magnus. C. Supplied by femoral nerve: The adductor magnus is partially supplied by the femoral nerve, but the majority of the muscle is innervated by the obturator nerve. Specifically, the adductor part of the muscle is innervated by the obturator nerve, while the hamstring part is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. Thus, saying it is completely supplied by the femoral nerve is incorrect. D. Related to the lateral ligament of the knee: The adductor magnus is not directly related to the lateral ligament of the knee. It is more closely associated with the medial side of the thigh and the pelvis. The lateral ligaments of the knee (such as the fibular collateral ligament) do not have a direct anatomical relationship with the adductor magnus muscle, which is positioned medially in the thigh.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Femoral artery. The femoral ring is an anatomical structure forming the upper opening of the femoral canal, which is located in the anterior thigh. It is bounded by specific structures that define its borders. The femoral artery does not contribute to the boundaries of the femoral ring, making it the correct answer. Instead, the femoral artery is located lateral to the femoral canal and outside the femoral ring. The key function of the femoral ring is to provide a passageway for lymphatics and small veins, and it is a site where femoral hernias can occur. Understanding its precise anatomical boundaries is crucial for surgical and diagnostic purposes. Explanation of the incorrect options: (A) Femoral vein: The femoral vein forms the lateral boundary of the femoral ring. It runs alongside the femoral artery but lies closer to the femoral canal, contributing directly to the formation of its borders. (B) Inguinal ligament: The inguinal ligament serves as the anterior boundary of the femoral ring. This ligament is an important structure in the groin region and plays a critical role in separating the femoral ring from other anatomical spaces.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sartorius. The adductor canal, also known as Hunter's canal, is a fascial tunnel in the middle third of the thigh. It serves as a passageway for the femoral artery, femoral vein, and the saphenous nerve, facilitating their travel from the femoral triangle to the popliteal fossa. The canal is covered anteriorly by the sartorius muscle, which forms its roof. The sartorius is a superficial muscle of the anterior thigh and plays an essential role in flexing, abducting, and externally rotating the hip, as well as flexing the knee. Its positioning ensures it covers the adductor canal, providing protection to the structures within. Explanation of the incorrect options: (A) Adductor longus: The adductor longus forms part of the posterior boundary of the adductor canal. It lies deep and medial to the canal, but it does not cover it. Its primary role is to adduct the thigh, and it does not contribute to forming the roof of the canal. (B) Adductor magnus: Similar to the adductor longus, the adductor magnus also forms part of the posterior boundary of the canal. It plays a role in adduction and extension of the thigh, but it does not lie over the canal. (D) Vastus medialis: The vastus medialis forms the anterolateral wall of the adductor canal.

It originates from the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) of the pelvis, which is located just below the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). The ligament then fans out to attach to the femur, helping to limit excessive extension and maintain the stability of the hip joint. Why Other Options Are Incorrect: A. Ischial tuberosity: The ischial tuberosity is an attachment point for muscles, such as the hamstrings, but not for the iliofemoral ligament. B. Anterior superior iliac spine: The anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) is an important landmark, but the iliofemoral ligament originates from the AIIS, which is slightly below it. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Femoral nerve. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The femoral sheath is a fascial compartment that surrounds the structures in the femoral triangle. It contains the following structures: Femoral artery: This is a major artery supplying the lower limb. Femoral vein: The vein that drains the lower limb into the external iliac vein. Lymphatics: These are contained within the femoral sheath as well. However, the femoral nerve is not part of the femoral sheath. The femoral nerve is located outside the femoral sheath, running laterally to the femoral artery and vein. It supplies motor and sensory innervation to the thigh and is not encased within the sheath. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Femoral artery: The femoral artery is a key structure contained within the femoral sheath. It is the primary blood supply to the lower limb. C. Femoral vein: The femoral vein is also a component of the femoral sheath. It lies medial to the femoral artery within the sheath. D. Genitofemoral nerve: The genitofemoral nerve is not a primary content of the femoral sheath. It runs outside the femoral sheath, passing through the femoral triangle, and supplies sensory innervation to the skin of the thigh and genital region.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Both. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The inguinal ligament forms boundaries for both the femoral triangle and Hesselbach's triangle. Femoral triangle: The inguinal ligament serves as the superior boundary of the femoral triangle, which is a triangular region located in the upper thigh. This region contains important structures like the femoral artery, femoral vein, and femoral nerve. Hesselbach’s triangle: The inguinal ligament forms the inferior border of Hesselbach's triangle, which is an anatomical area in the lower abdomen. It is clinically significant because direct inguinal hernias may occur in this region. The other borders of this triangle are the rectus abdominis muscle (medially) and the inferior epigastric vessels (laterally). Thus, the inguinal ligament contributes to the boundaries of both anatomical regions, making C. Both the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Femoral triangle: The inguinal ligament does form the superior border of the femoral triangle, but this option is incomplete as it doesn't acknowledge the ligament's role in Hesselbach's triangle as well. B. Hesselbach's triangle: The inguinal ligament does form the inferior border of Hesselbach’s triangle, but this answer ignores the ligament's contribution to the femoral triangle as well, which is why it is not fully correct. D. None: This option is incorrect because the inguinal ligament does indeed form boundaries for both the femoral triangle and Hesselbach's triangle, making it an important anatomical landmark.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) All of the above. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The adductor hiatus is a passage in the adductor magnus muscle that allows important structures to pass between the anterior and posterior compartments of the thigh. The key points are: A. Opening in aponeurosis of adductor magnus: The adductor hiatus is an opening in the aponeurosis of the adductor magnus muscle. This opening allows structures such as the femoral artery and femoral vein to pass from the anterior compartment into the popliteal fossa. B. Lies close to adductor tubercle: The adductor hiatus is located just above the adductor tubercle of the femur, which serves as a landmark for identifying the location of the hiatus. C. Important vessels pass through it: The femoral artery and femoral vein pass through the adductor hiatus to enter the popliteal fossa, where they become the popliteal artery and popliteal vein, respectively. These vessels are critical for blood supply to the lower leg.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nerve to pectineus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The nerve to pectineus is not a content of the femoral triangle. The pectineus muscle is supplied by both the femoral nerve and the obturator nerve, but its nerve to pectineus does not lie within the femoral triangle itself. The femoral triangle is a space in the upper thigh, and while the femoral nerve provides innervation to muscles like the sartorius and quadriceps femoris, the nerve to pectineus is a separate branch that originates more distally, not from within the femoral triangle. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Superficial inguinal lymph nodes: This is correct. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes are part of the contents of the femoral triangle. These lymph nodes are located in the region and help drain lymph from the lower limb and other areas of the body. B. Femoral artery: This is correct. The femoral artery is one of the primary contents of the femoral triangle. It is located in the femoral sheath, which forms part of the structure of the femoral triangle. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Femoral artery. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The line from the midinguinal point to the adductor tubercle represents the course of the femoral artery. The midinguinal point is located halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the pubic symphysis, and the adductor tubercle is located on the medial side of the distal femur. The femoral artery passes through this line and is palpable in the femoral triangle, making this anatomical line significant for identifying the femoral artery's path. The femoral artery is a continuation of the external iliac artery and travels down the thigh to provide blood supply to the lower limb. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Inferior epigastric artery: This is incorrect because the inferior epigastric artery arises from the external iliac artery, but it runs in a different direction, supplying the lower abdominal wall. It does not follow the path from the midinguinal point to the adductor tubercle. C. Superior epigastric artery: This is incorrect because the superior epigastric artery branches from the internal thoracic artery and ascends toward the anterior abdominal wall. It does not have any relation to the midinguinal point or adductor tubercle. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) It extends the hip. The sartorius muscle does not extend the hip. Instead, it flexes the hip, along with other movements such as abduction and lateral rotation of the thigh. It is involved in activities like crossing the legs, which is why it is commonly referred to as the \"tailor's muscle.\" The sartorius does not contribute to extending the hip joint. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it is an incorrect statement. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. It is known as the “tailor’s muscle”: This statement is correct. The sartorius muscle is known as the \"tailor’s muscle\" because it is used when sitting cross-legged, similar to the position tailors traditionally used when sewing. Therefore, option A is correct. B. It is the longest muscle in the body: This statement is also correct. The sartorius is the longest muscle in the human body, extending from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the medial aspect of the tibia, across both the hip and knee joints. Therefore, option B is correct. C. It acts across two joints: This statement is correct as well. The sartorius crosses both the hip joint and the knee joint, allowing it to perform actions at both joints, such as flexion, abduction, and rotation of the thigh at the hip, as well as flexion of the knee.",
