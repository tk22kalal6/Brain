      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Saphenous nerve The saphenous nerve is the correct answer because it provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the foot, including the great toe. The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve and runs along the medial side of the leg. During a venesection procedure involving the great saphenous vein, there is a possibility that the saphenous nerve could be injured or compressed, especially when the incision is made over the vein or when the vein is ligated. This could result in symptoms such as pain and paresthesia (abnormal sensations like tingling or numbness) in the area of its sensory distribution, including the medial aspect of the great toe. Therefore, the nerve most likely involved in this scenario is the saphenous nerve. Incorrect Responses: (A) Sural nerve The sural nerve is a sensory nerve that provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle. It does not supply the medial side of the foot, particularly the medial aspect of the great toe, which is the area affected in this case. The sural nerve is located more on the lateral side of the lower leg and would not typically be affected during a procedure involving the great saphenous vein, which runs medially. (B) Deep peroneal nerve The deep peroneal nerve innervates muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg and provides sensory innervation to the web space between the first and second toes. However, it does not supply the medial aspect of the great toe. The deep peroneal nerve is not likely to be involved in this case, as the symptoms described are localized to the medial side of the foot and toe. (C) Medial plantar nerve The medial plantar nerve is a branch of the tibial nerve that supplies the medial side of the sole of the foot and the first three toes, but it does not typically provide sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the great toe. Its distribution is focused more on the plantar surface of the foot rather than the dorsomedial area. Therefore, it is not the nerve involved in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Knee joint The posterior division of the obturator nerve innervates muscles that primarily act on the hip and knee joints. Among these muscles, it specifically innervates the adductor magnus, which is responsible for adduction of the thigh and has some role in extending the hip joint. However, the posterior division also contributes branches that provide sensory and motor innervation to the knee joint, making it the correct answer. The knee joint receives innervation from both the femoral and obturator nerves, and the posterior division plays a crucial role in providing motor innervation to muscles that affect knee stability and movement. Incorrect Responses: (A) Hip joint The obturator nerve, including both its anterior and posterior divisions, does contribute to the innervation of muscles that affect hip joint movement (such as adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor magnus). However, the obturator nerve itself does not directly innervate the hip joint. The innervation of the hip joint comes more directly from other sources such as the femoral nerve, the sciatic nerve, and the nerve to the quadratus femoris. Therefore, this is not the correct answer. (C) Adductor longus The adductor longus muscle is innervated by the anterior division of the obturator nerve, not the posterior division. The anterior division of the obturator nerve supplies this muscle, which is involved in thigh adduction and flexion at the hip joint. As such, the posterior division does not innervate the adductor longus. (D) Pectineus The pectineus muscle is innervated by both the femoral nerve and the obturator nerve, but the innervation comes from the anterior division of the obturator nerve rather than the posterior division. This muscle is responsible for flexion, adduction, and medial rotation of the thigh at the hip joint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tensor fasciae lata. Explanation for Correct Answer: The femoral nerve does not supply the tensor fasciae lata muscle. This muscle, which is responsible for stabilizing the hip and the knee joint, is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, not the femoral nerve. Despite its location in the anterior thigh region, the tensor fasciae lata is not part of the group of muscles innervated by the femoral nerve. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (A) Sartorius: The sartorius muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve. It is the longest muscle in the body and plays a key role in hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation. Therefore, the femoral nerve provides motor innervation to this muscle. (B) Rectus femoris: The rectus femoris is part of the quadriceps group, and it is innervated by the femoral nerve. It is involved in knee extension and also assists in hip flexion, making it one of the key muscles that the femoral nerve supplies. (D) Articularis genu: The articularis genu muscle is also innervated by the femoral nerve. It is a small muscle located near the knee joint, and it functions to pull the synovial membrane of the knee joint during extension, helping prevent the membrane from being pinched.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Deep peroneal nerve. Explanation for Correct Answer: Foot drop occurs when there is weakness or paralysis of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion (lifting the foot) and eversion of the foot. The deep peroneal nerve (also known as the deep fibular nerve) innervates the muscles that control dorsiflexion, primarily the tibialis anterior, which is crucial for lifting the foot. When the deep peroneal nerve is damaged, the affected individual cannot dorsiflex the foot properly, leading to foot drop, a condition where the foot hangs limp and the individual struggles to lift it while walking. Therefore, the injury to the deep peroneal nerve causes foot drop, making option (A) correct. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (B) Superficial peroneal nerve: The superficial peroneal nerve innervates the muscles responsible for eversion (turning the foot outward) and some cutaneous sensation on the dorsum of the foot. However, it does not directly control the muscles involved in dorsiflexion. Injury to the superficial peroneal nerve does not cause foot drop, which makes this option incorrect. (C) Tibial nerve: The tibial nerve innervates the muscles involved in plantarflexion (pointing the toes downwards), such as the gastrocnemius and soleus. While damage to the tibial nerve can lead to difficulties with plantarflexion, it does not cause foot drop, which is related to the inability to dorsiflex the foot. Therefore, this option is also incorrect. (D) Deltoid ligament: The deltoid ligament is a ligament in the ankle joint and has no involvement in the motor function of the foot. It is responsible for stabilizing the ankle, particularly preventing excessive eversion of the foot. Injury to the deltoid ligament does not lead to foot drop, as it does not affect the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tibial N. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Injury to the head of the fibula often affects the common peroneal nerve because it passes around the neck of the fibula and is vulnerable to compression or trauma at this site. When the common peroneal nerve is injured, it can lead to damage to its branches, including the superficial peroneal nerve and the deep peroneal nerve, which are responsible for the motor and sensory functions of the lower leg and foot. The common peroneal nerve provides motor function to the muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg, and sensory input to parts of the foot. The superficial peroneal nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve, and it supplies the muscles in the lateral compartment of the leg and provides sensation to the dorsum of the foot. The anterior tibial nerve is the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve and innervates the anterior compartment of the leg. However, the tibial nerve is not directly affected by an injury to the head of the fibula, as it travels down the posterior side of the leg. It is not a branch of the common peroneal nerve and is not involved in injuries to the head of the fibula. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Common peroneal N.: The common peroneal nerve is directly involved in an injury to the head of the fibula. It can be compressed or injured due to its proximity to the fibular head. B. Superficial peroneal N.: The superficial peroneal nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve, and it would be affected in an injury to the fibula. C. Anterior Tibial N.: The anterior tibial nerve is a continuation of the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve, so it would also be involved in a fibular head injury.",

Medial cutaneous nerve of arm: This is incorrect because the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm supplies sensory innervation to the skin of the medial side of the upper arm, not the thigh. Meralgia paraesthesia is not related to this nerve. C. Ilioinguinal nerve: This is incorrect because the ilioinguinal nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lower abdomen, groin, and upper thigh, but it does not cause meralgia paraesthesia. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, not the ilioinguinal nerve, is responsible for this condition. D. Tibial nerve: This is incorrect because the tibial nerve is a major nerve in the leg that innervates muscles involved in plantarflexion and foot sensation, but it is not involved in meralgia paraesthesia, which specifically involves the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh.",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Saphenous nerve. The saphenous nerve is the most likely nerve involved in this case. The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve and provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the lower leg and foot, including the medial side of the great toe. During venesection or surgery on the great saphenous vein, the saphenous nerve can be inadvertently injured due to its anatomical proximity to the vein, especially around the medial aspect of the knee and lower leg. This can lead to symptoms such as pain and parasthesia (tingling) in the areas it innervates, including the medial side of the great toe. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Sural nerve: The sural nerve is a sensory nerve that provides innervation to the posterior and lateral aspects of the lower leg and foot. While the sural nerve might be affected by lower leg procedures, it does not supply the medial side of the great toe. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause parasthesia in this location after surgery on the great saphenous vein. B. Deep peroneal nerve: The deep peroneal nerve provides motor innervation to the anterior compartment of the leg and sensory innervation to the first web space of the foot (between the first and second toes). It does not innervate the medial side of the great toe, so it is not involved in this scenario. The symptoms described are not consistent with deep peroneal nerve involvement. C. Medial plantar nerve: The medial plantar nerve is a branch of the tibial nerve and innervates the sole of the foot, including the medial aspect of the first three toes, but it does not supply the medial side of the great toe. The medial plantar nerve is less likely to be involved in this case because the described symptoms occur more distally on the medial side of the great toe, which is supplied by the saphenous nerve.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Popliteal lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage from the heel and the lateral part of the foot primarily drains into the popliteal lymph nodes. These nodes are located in the posterior knee region and are responsible for draining lymph from the lower leg, including the heel and lateral aspects of the foot. The popliteal nodes receive lymph from superficial structures, including the foot and toes, and are part of the path that eventually leads to deeper lymphatic nodes further upstream. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Superficial inguinal lymph nodes: The superficial inguinal lymph nodes primarily receive lymph from the superficial tissues of the lower abdomen, external genitalia, and the anterior aspect of the thigh, but not from the heel or lateral part of the foot. Lymph from these areas typically drains into the popliteal nodes first, before being transported to the inguinal nodes. B. Deep inguinal lymph nodes: The deep inguinal lymph nodes are located near the femoral vessels and drain deeper structures of the lower limb, including the deep tissues of the thigh and lower leg. However, lymph from the heel and lateral foot predominantly first reaches the popliteal nodes before any further drainage toward the deep inguinal nodes. C. External iliac lymph nodes: The external iliac lymph nodes are responsible for draining lymph from deeper pelvic structures and the lower limb, but lymph from the heel and lateral part of the foot does not directly drain into them. The lymph from these areas would be filtered first through the popliteal nodes, then possibly through the deep inguinal nodes before reaching the external iliac nodes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. The cremaster muscle, which is responsible for elevating the testis, is innervated by the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. This nerve arises from the lumbar plexus and specifically provides motor innervation to the cremaster muscle. The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve travels with the spermatic cord and is responsible for the function of the cremaster muscle, which contracts during the cremasteric reflex. Therefore, option A is correct. Reasons for Incorrect Options: B. Ilioinguinal: The ilioinguinal nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lower abdomen and the upper thigh, but it does not innervate the cremaster muscle. The ilioinguinal nerve passes through the inguinal canal but does not provide motor fibers to the cremaster muscle. Therefore, option B is incorrect. C. T12: T12 refers to the 12th thoracic spinal nerve, which is primarily involved in providing sensory innervation to the lower abdomen but does not innervate the cremaster muscle. The motor innervation to the cremaster muscle is specifically from the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. Therefore, option C is incorrect. D. Femoral: The femoral nerve supplies motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior thigh, such as the quadriceps, but it does not innervate the cremaster muscle. The femoral nerve does not have any direct role in the motor function of the cremaster muscle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Neck. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The common peroneal nerve (also called the common fibular nerve) wraps around the neck of the fibula, making it an area where the nerve can be easily palpated or \"rolled\" against the bone. This nerve is particularly vulnerable to compression or injury in this location because it passes superficially just behind the fibula's neck. Compression in this region can lead to sensory and motor deficits in the areas supplied by the nerve, including the foot and lower leg. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Styloid process: The styloid process is a bony prominence found on the distal end of the radius (in the forearm) and is unrelated to the common peroneal nerve, which is located in the lower leg. B. Head: While the head of the fibula is close to the common peroneal nerve's course, it is not the typical location where the nerve is easily rolled against the bone. The nerve tends to pass more prominently around the neck of the fibula, rather than the head. D. Shaft: The shaft of the fibula is too far away from the common peroneal nerve's path to be a location where the nerve could be easily rolled. The nerve travels around the neck of the fibula, not the shaft.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Deep peroneal nerve. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The deep peroneal nerve (or deep fibular nerve) is responsible for providing sensory innervation to the skin of the dorsum of the first web space of the foot. This nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve and supplies the skin between the first and second toes. Additionally, it innervates muscles responsible for dorsiflexion and extension of the toes, such as the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Sural nerve: The sural nerve is a sensory nerve that innervates the posterolateral aspect of the lower leg and the lateral side of the foot, including the little toe. It does not provide sensation to the dorsum of the first web space. B. Saphenous nerve: The saphenous nerve is a branch of the femoral nerve and provides sensory innervation to the medial side of the lower leg and medial aspect of the foot. It does not supply the dorsum of the first web space, which is the domain of the deep peroneal nerve. D. Lateral plantar nerve: The lateral plantar nerve is a branch of the tibial nerve and primarily supplies muscles and skin on the lateral side of the sole of the foot, including the little toe and the lateral half of the fourth and fifth toes. It does not provide sensation to the dorsum of the first web space.",
