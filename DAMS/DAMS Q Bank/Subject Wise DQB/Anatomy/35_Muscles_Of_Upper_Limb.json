      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Teres minor The teres minor is not involved in elbow flexion. It is one of the rotator cuff muscles and functions to laterally rotate the arm and stabilize the shoulder joint. Its origin is on the lateral border of the scapula, and its insertion is on the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Since it does not cross the elbow joint, it cannot contribute to flexion at the elbow. This makes it the correct answer as an exception. Incorrect Responses: (A) Biceps The biceps brachii is a primary flexor of the elbow joint. Its short head originates from the coracoid process of the scapula, and its long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle. Both heads insert on the radial tuberosity. In addition to flexing the elbow, it also acts as a powerful supinator of the forearm, making it essential for elbow movements. (B) Brachialis The brachialis is another primary flexor of the elbow. It lies deep to the biceps brachii and originates from the anterior surface of the distal humerus, inserting on the ulnar tuberosity. Its sole function is flexion of the elbow, making it a key player in this movement. (C) Brachioradialis The brachioradialis is a flexor of the elbow that is particularly active during rapid movements or when the forearm is in a neutral position (thumb-up). It originates from the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and inserts on the styloid process of the radius. Despite being located in the forearm, it is classified as an elbow flexor due to its function.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Serratus anterior The serratus anterior muscle plays a crucial role in the abduction of the shoulder joint above 90°. While the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles initiate and continue abduction up to 90°, further abduction requires scapular rotation, which is facilitated by the serratus anterior. This muscle works in conjunction with the trapezius to rotate the scapula upward, allowing the arm to elevate beyond 90°. Without the serratus anterior, as in cases of long thoracic nerve injury, this movement is severely impaired, leading to a characteristic \"winged scapula.\" Incorrect Responses: (A) Biceps The biceps brachii is primarily a flexor of the elbow and a weak supinator of the forearm. It has minimal or no role in shoulder abduction, especially above 90°. While it assists in shoulder flexion, it does not contribute to scapular rotation required for abduction beyond 90°. (B) Deltoid The deltoid muscle is responsible for abduction of the shoulder up to 90°, especially the middle fibers. However, it cannot elevate the arm above this range as it does not contribute to scapular rotation. Beyond 90°, the movement relies on the serratus anterior and trapezius. (D) Supraspinatus The supraspinatus muscle initiates the first 15–20° of shoulder abduction and assists the deltoid up to 90°. However, like the deltoid, it does not play a role in scapular rotation required for abduction above 90°.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Subscapularis muscle The subscapularis muscle, a part of the rotator cuff group, is attached to the lesser tubercle of the humerus, not the greater tubercle. It is the only rotator cuff muscle that inserts on the lesser tubercle and is primarily responsible for medial rotation of the arm. This distinct insertion site differentiates it from the other rotator cuff muscles, which attach to the greater tubercle, making it the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (A) Supraspinatus muscle The supraspinatus muscle attaches to the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. It initiates abduction of the arm for the first 15 degrees and plays a role in stabilizing the shoulder joint. (C) Teres minor muscle The teres minor muscle attaches to the inferior facet of the greater tubercle.

This attachment lies above the glenoid cavity, inside the shoulder joint capsule. While the short head of the biceps attaches to the coracoid process, the long head has a distinct origin, making this option the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (A) Short head of biceps The short head of the biceps brachii originates from the coracoid process, making it one of the three structures that attach to this bony projection. This is an important point of attachment for the biceps muscle. (B) Coracobrachialis The coracobrachialis muscle also originates from the coracoid process.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Originates from lower 8 ribs The serratus anterior muscle originates from the upper 8 or 9 ribs (not the lower 8 ribs). Specifically, it arises from the external surfaces of the first to the eighth (and sometimes ninth) ribs and their intercostal spaces. This makes the statement incorrect, as it erroneously attributes the origin to the lower ribs. Incorrect Responses: (A) Helps in punching The serratus anterior is commonly referred to as the \"boxer’s muscle\" because it plays a crucial role in protraction of the scapula, which is necessary for actions like punching and pushing. This statement is correct. (B) Lifts arm above the shoulder The serratus anterior is critical for upward rotation of the scapula, which is essential for raising the arm above the shoulder. This movement is a coordinated action between the serratus anterior and trapezius muscles, making this statement correct. (C) Supplied by long thoracic nerve The serratus anterior is innervated by the long thoracic nerve, which arises from the roots of C5, C6, and C7 in the brachial plexus. This nerve runs superficially on the muscle, and damage to it can result in winging of the scapula. This statement is also correct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Serratus anterior The serratus anterior is referred to as the \"boxer's muscle\" because of its key role in protracting the scapula (moving it forward along the ribcage). This action is essential for delivering a punch or pushing motions, making it critical for boxers and other activities involving forceful forward arm movements. Additionally, the serratus anterior assists in stabilizing the scapula and performing upward rotation, enabling the arm to lift above shoulder height. Incorrect Responses: (A) Trapezius The trapezius muscle is involved in scapular movements such as elevation, retraction, and rotation, but it does not play a significant role in protraction or pushing movements. While important for shoulder mechanics, it is not termed the \"boxer's muscle.\" (C) Psoas major The psoas major is a hip flexor muscle that helps in movements of the thigh, such as raising the leg and stabilizing the lumbar spine. It is unrelated to scapular or arm movements, and thus not the \"boxer's muscle.\" (D) Latissimus dorsi The latissimus dorsi is involved in actions like adduction, extension, and medial rotation of the arm. While it contributes to pulling and overhead motions, it is not involved in protraction or punching, and thus it is not the \"boxer's muscle.\"",

The third head of the coracobrachialis muscle, also known as the \"Struthers ligament,\" is an anatomical variant where a fibrous band extends from the coracoid process to the medial humeral epicondyle. This structure is not present in everyone, but when it does occur, it can be mistaken for an additional muscle head. The Struthers ligament is important because it can potentially compress the ulnar nerve, leading to neurological symptoms. Incorrect Responses: B. Brachioradialis: The brachioradialis is a separate muscle that originates from the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and inserts into the radius. It is involved in flexion of the forearm at the elbow joint, particularly when the forearm is in a neutral position. It is not related to the coracobrachialis or the Struthers ligament. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Flexor carpi radialis. The flexor carpi radialis muscle does not pass through the carpal tunnel. Instead, it passes outside the carpal tunnel, lying in a separate compartment within the wrist. The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis travels through a separate sheath, not the carpal tunnel, which is primarily occupied by structures responsible for flexion of the fingers and thumb. Incorrect Responses: A. Median Nerve: The median nerve is one of the key structures that passes through the carpal tunnel. It innervates several important muscles in the hand, including the thenar muscles, and provides sensory innervation to the palmar side of the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring fingers. Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. B. Flexor pollicis longus: The tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, which is responsible for flexing the thumb, passes through the carpal tunnel. It is one of the tendons that help facilitate movements of the thumb, and it is included in the structures passing through the carpal tunnel. D. Flexor digitorum superficialis: The tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis also pass through the carpal tunnel. This muscle plays an important role in flexing the middle phalanges of the fingers, and its tendons travel through the carpal tunnel alongside those of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Blood supply by perforating branch of internal thoracic artery The pectoralis major muscle is primarily supplied by the perforating branches of the internal thoracic artery, which is the main blood supply to the anterior chest wall muscles. The internal thoracic artery arises from the subclavian artery and gives off perforating branches that provide vascular support to the pectoralis major. These branches penetrate the muscle's deep surface, ensuring proper blood flow for its function. Thus, option (B) is the correct answer. Incorrect Options: (A) Abductor & Internal Rotator of Shoulder While the pectoralis major is involved in shoulder movements, it is not an abductor of the shoulder. The muscle primarily acts as an adductor, flexor, and internal (medial) rotator of the shoulder joint. It helps in bringing the arm toward the body and rotating it inward, rather than moving it away from the body (abduction). Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. (C) Blood Supply by Intercostal Artery Although the intercostal arteries do provide some blood supply to the chest wall, they do not primarily supply the pectoralis major. The primary blood supply to this muscle comes from the perforating branches of the internal thoracic artery, not the intercostal arteries, making option (C) incorrect. (D) Nerve Supply by Intercostal Nerve The pectoralis major muscle is innervated by the lateral and medial pectoral nerves, which are branches of the brachial plexus, not by the intercostal nerves. The lateral pectoral nerve supplies the clavicular head, and the medial pectoral nerve supplies the sternocostal head. Intercostal nerves are involved in innervating the intercostal muscles, not the pectoralis major.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Palmaris longus The palmaris longus tendon is the most commonly absent tendon in the upper limb. It is present in only about 70-85% of individuals, meaning that it is frequently absent on one or both sides. The palmaris longus is a superficial flexor muscle of the forearm, but its absence does not cause significant functional impairments, as other muscles in the forearm compensate for its role in wrist flexion. Incorrect Options: (A) Flexor carpi ulnaris The flexor carpi ulnaris tendon is not frequently absent. It is a stable and consistent tendon in the forearm that contributes to wrist flexion and ulnar deviation. Its absence is quite rare, and it is essential for wrist movement, particularly when the hand is positioned in ulnar deviation. (B) Flexor digitorum profundus The flexor digitorum profundus tendon is not typically absent. This tendon is crucial for the flexion of the distal phalanx of the fingers, and its absence would result in significant loss of finger movement and functionality. Variations in the number of tendons or their insertion sites are very uncommon. (C) Extensor carpi radialis brevis The extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon is not frequently absent. It plays a significant role in wrist extension and radial deviation. Although anatomical variations can exist, its absence is quite rare, and its function is essential for normal wrist movement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Flexor digitorum superficialis The flexor digitorum superficialis is not a composite muscle. A composite muscle is one that has multiple functions or receives innervation from more than one nerve. The flexor digitorum superficialis is innervated solely by the median nerve and is responsible for flexing the middle phalanx of the fingers. It does not have dual functions or nerve supply, which distinguishes it from composite muscles. Incorrect Options: (A) Adductor magnus The adductor magnus is a composite muscle because it has two parts with different functions and innervation. The adductor part is responsible for adducting the thigh and is innervated by the obturator nerve, while the hamstring part helps in extending the thigh and is innervated by the tibial nerve. This combination of functions and nerve supplies makes it a composite muscle. (B) Pectineus The pectineus is also considered a composite muscle. It has both motor functions (flexion and adduction of the thigh) and is innervated by two nerves: the femoral nerve (primarily) and the obturator nerve (partially). Its mixed functions and innervation classify it as a composite muscle. (C) Flexor digitorum profundus The flexor digitorum profundus is another composite muscle. It has two functions: it flexes the distal phalanx of the fingers and also assists with flexing the wrist. This muscle is innervated by two nerves: the median nerve (for the lateral half) and the ulnar nerve (for the medial half). This dual innervation and function make it a composite muscle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Brachialis The brachialis muscle has a dual nerve supply. It is innervated by both the musculocutaneous nerve (which is the primary nerve supply) and the radial nerve (which provides a small branch to the lateral part of the muscle). The brachialis is responsible for elbow flexion, and its dual nerve supply allows for some redundancy in motor function, ensuring the muscle's action remains effective even if one of the nerve supplies is damaged. Incorrect Options: (A) FDS (Flexor Digitorum Superficialis) The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) is innervated by the median nerve and does not have a dual nerve supply. It is responsible for flexing the middle phalanges of the fingers, and its motor function is entirely dependent on the median nerve. (B) Deltoid The deltoid muscle is innervated by the axillary nerve only and does not have a dual nerve supply. It is responsible for shoulder abduction, and any injury to the axillary nerve can result in a loss of deltoid function. (D) FCU (Flexor Carpi Ulnaris) The flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) is innervated solely by the ulnar nerve, not by a dual nerve supply. It is involved in flexing and adducting the wrist. Damage to the ulnar nerve can impair the function of this muscle, but it is not innervated by another nerve.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Coracoclavicular ligament The coracoclavicular ligament plays a crucial role in transferring weight from the upper limb (peripheral skeleton) to the axial skeleton. It consists of two parts: the conoid ligament and the trapezoid ligament, which connect the coracoid process of the scapula to the clavicle. This ligament helps stabilize the acromioclavicular joint and allows the transfer of forces, such as those from the arm, to the axial skeleton, particularly the sternum. The coracoclavicular ligament acts as a vital structure in supporting the shoulder girdle and facilitating force transmission. Incorrect Options: (B) Acromio-clavicular ligament The acromioclavicular ligament connects the acromion of the scapula to the clavicle but does not directly transfer weight from the peripheral to the axial skeleton. While it plays a role in stabilizing the acromioclavicular joint, it is not responsible for transferring weight between the limbs and the axial skeleton. (C) Ligament of Bigelow The ligament of Bigelow, also known as the iliofemoral ligament, is found in the hip joint. It prevents hyperextension of the hip and helps to stabilize the pelvis during standing and movement. It is not involved in transferring weight between the upper limb and the axial skeleton, as it is more relevant to the lower limb. (D) Sterno-clavicular ligament The sterno-clavicular ligament stabilizes the sternoclavicular joint, connecting the sternum to the clavicle. While it contributes to the overall stability of the shoulder girdle and upper limb, it does not play a primary role in transferring weight from the peripheral skeleton to the axial skeleton.

This small muscle is located in the hypothenar region of the hand and is involved in tensing the skin of the palm, particularly during gripping activities. The palmaris brevis assists in protecting the underlying ulnar nerve and artery as they travel through the hand. The superficial branch also provides sensory innervation to the palmar surface of the little finger and half of the ring finger. Incorrect Options: (B) Opponens pollicis The opponens pollicis is not supplied by the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve. Instead, it is innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve. This muscle is involved in the opposition of the thumb, a function unrelated to the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve. (C) Adductor pollicis The adductor pollicis, responsible for adducting the thumb, is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, not the superficial branch. This muscle plays a key role in pinch grip and has no connection to the sensory or motor functions of the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve. (D) Abductor digiti minimi The abductor digiti minimi, a hypothenar muscle that abducts the little finger, is also innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, not its superficial branch.

The axillary nerve also provides sensory innervation to the skin over the lateral aspect of the shoulder, called the \"regimental badge area.\" Therefore, the axillary nerve is the correct nerve supply for the deltoid. Evaluation of Each Option: B. Musculocutaneous Incorrect The musculocutaneous nerve is responsible for innervating muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm, such as the biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis. It does not supply the deltoid, so this option is incorrect. C. Median Incorrect The median nerve innervates muscles of the anterior forearm, such as the flexor muscles and some intrinsic muscles of the hand.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Musculocutaneous nerve. The musculocutaneous nerve pierces the coracobrachialis muscle during its course in the arm. This nerve originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus (C5–C7 roots) and supplies the coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, and brachialis muscles. After piercing the coracobrachialis, it travels between the biceps and brachialis, providing motor innervation to these muscles and eventually terminating as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, supplying sensation to the lateral forearm. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Axillary nerve Incorrect The axillary nerve does not pierce the coracobrachialis. Instead, it travels through the quadrangular space along with the posterior circumflex humeral artery, innervating the deltoid and teres minor muscles. This nerve's pathway and function are unrelated to the coracobrachialis muscle, making this option incorrect. B. Median nerve Incorrect The median nerve runs in the arm without piercing the coracobrachialis. It travels medial to the brachial artery and enters the forearm by passing between the two heads of the pronator teres. It primarily supplies muscles in the anterior forearm and hand, not the coracobrachialis, making this option incorrect. D. Ulnar nerve Incorrect The ulnar nerve does not pierce the coracobrachialis. Instead, it descends in the arm medial to the brachial artery, bypassing the coracobrachialis entirely, and enters the forearm behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus. It has no functional or anatomical connection to the coracobrachialis, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL). The radial bursa is the synovial sheath that surrounds the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) as it passes through the carpal tunnel to the thumb. This sheath allows smooth gliding of the FPL tendon during movements of the thumb and extends from the distal forearm to the insertion of the FPL tendon on the distal phalanx of the thumb. The presence of the radial bursa ensures efficient function and reduces friction in this high-mobility region. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS) Incorrect The tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) are surrounded by the ulnar bursa, not the radial bursa. The ulnar bursa envelops both the FDS and FDP tendons as they pass through the carpal tunnel. Thus, this option is incorrect. B. Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP) Incorrect Similar to the FDS, the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) are enclosed within the ulnar bursa, not the radial bursa. The ulnar bursa provides a shared sheath for the FDS and FDP tendons in the carpal tunnel, making this option incorrect. D. Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) Incorrect The flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendon is not enclosed within the radial bursa. Instead, it has its own synovial sheath as it passes through the groove on the trapezium before attaching to the base of the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal bones. Therefore, this option is incorrect.",

The ulnar nerve in the forearm provides muscular branches to both the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and the medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP). The ulnar nerve directly innervates the FCU, which is responsible for wrist flexion and ulnar deviation, and the medial portion of the FDP, which flexes the distal phalanges of the ring and little fingers (4th and 5th digits).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Rhomboideus major. The rhomboideus major muscle is primarily responsible for retraction (adduction) of the scapula, meaning it pulls the scapula medially toward the vertebral column. This action is facilitated by the muscle's origin on the spinous processes of T2–T5 vertebrae and its insertion on the medial border of the scapula. Rhomboideus major works in coordination with rhomboideus minor and other muscles to stabilize and retract the scapula, essential for upper limb movements. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Serratus anterior Incorrect The serratus anterior is responsible for the protraction of the scapula, which moves the scapula away from the midline and toward the front of the body. It is also involved in upward rotation of the scapula. This is the opposite action of retraction, making this option incorrect. B. Levator scapulae Incorrect The levator scapulae primarily performs elevation of the scapula (lifting the scapula upward) and assists in downward rotation. It does not contribute significantly to retraction of the scapula, so this option is incorrect. D. Supraspinatus Incorrect The supraspinatus is part of the rotator cuff muscles and is primarily responsible for initiating abduction of the arm at the shoulder joint. It plays no role in the retraction of the scapula, making this option incorrect.",

Incorrect Responses: A. FDS (Flexor Digitorum Superficialis): The FDS is a muscle in the superficial anterior compartment of the forearm. It is responsible for flexing the middle phalanges of the fingers (except for the thumb), and it lies just beneath the skin and the fascia of the forearm. C.

This is a bony prominence located just below the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The long head of the triceps is responsible for extending the forearm at the elbow joint, as well as contributing to shoulder extension. Its origin at the infraglenoid tubercle distinguishes it from the other heads of the triceps. Incorrect Responses: A. Long head of biceps: The long head of the biceps brachii does not arise from the infraglenoid tubercle; rather, it originates from the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, which is located above the glenoid cavity. This muscle is involved in flexing the elbow and supinating the forearm. C. Short head of biceps: The short head of the biceps brachii originates from the coracoid process of the scapula, not the infraglenoid tubercle. The short head, along with the long head, works together to perform elbow flexion and supination. D. Coracobrachialis: The coracobrachialis muscle originates from the coracoid process of the scapula.

The brachioradialis is a muscle located in the posterior compartment of the forearm, typically associated with the extension of the wrist and fingers. However, it is a unique muscle in that despite its position in the extension compartment, it functions primarily as a flexor of the elbow when the forearm is in a neutral position (such as when the thumb is pointing upwards). This muscle is activated during flexion of the elbow, especially when rapid movements or lifting objects require a quick, strong contraction. Explanation for incorrect options: B. Abductor pollicis longus: This muscle is responsible for abducting the thumb and does not participate in elbow flexion. It is located in the forearm but in the group of muscles that facilitate thumb movement, not elbow flexion. C. Extensor pollicis longus: The extensor pollicis longus is involved in extending the thumb. It does not influence the elbow joint and thus cannot be responsible for elbow flexion. D.
