      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Superior gluteal artery. Explanation for the Correct Answer: A. Superior gluteal artery: The superior gluteal artery is a branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery. It supplies the gluteal muscles, specifically the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles. This artery exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle and is the largest branch of the posterior division. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Inferior gluteal artery: The inferior gluteal artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, not the posterior division. It supplies the gluteus maximus, the piriformis, and other muscles in the pelvic region. C. Superior vesical artery: The superior vesical artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It supplies the upper part of the bladder and also contributes to the vas deferens in males. It is not a branch of the posterior division. D. Middle rectal artery: The middle rectal artery is also a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It supplies the rectum and is not a branch of the posterior division.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Portal. Explanation for the Correct Answer: C. Portal vein: The superior mesenteric vein drains into the portal vein. The superior mesenteric vein collects blood from the small intestine, the cecum, and the ascending colon, and then drains into the portal vein. The portal vein is responsible for carrying blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen to the liver for processing. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Splenic vein: The splenic vein drains blood from the spleen, pancreas, and part of the stomach, and it merges with the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein. However, the superior mesenteric vein does not directly drain into the splenic vein. B. Hepatic vein: The hepatic veins drain blood from the liver into the inferior vena cava. These veins do not receive blood from the superior mesenteric vein, as the latter drains into the portal vein. D. Inferior vena cava: The inferior vena cava collects blood from the lower body and the liver through the hepatic veins, but it is not involved in the drainage of blood from the superior mesenteric vein.",

The right adrenal gland (suprarenal gland) has its venous drainage through the right suprarenal vein, which does not pass through the left renal vein but instead drains directly into the IVC. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Left testicular vein: This is incorrect because the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein, which then drains into the IVC. The left testicular vein does not directly drain into the IVC, unlike the right testicular vein, which drains directly into the IVC. C. Left ovarian vein: This is incorrect because the left ovarian vein also drains into the left renal vein before draining into the IVC.

Passes through diaphragm at level of T10 vertebra: This statement is incorrect because the inferior vena cava passes through the diaphragm at the level of the T8 vertebra, not T10. The T10 vertebra is associated with the passage of the esophagus through the diaphragm, not the inferior vena cava. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: B. Right suprarenal vein directly drains to it: This statement is correct. The right suprarenal vein directly drains into the inferior vena cava, while the left suprarenal vein typically drains into the left renal vein before reaching the inferior vena cava. C. It lies anterior to the right renal artery: This statement is correct. The inferior vena cava is positioned anterior to the right renal artery as it ascends along the right side of the vertebral column. D.

Left gonadal vein: The left gonadal vein (which drains the left ovary or left testicle) does not cross the midline. It drains into the left renal vein, which then drains into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The left gonadal vein remains on the left side of the body and does not cross the midline, unlike some other veins that cross to the right side. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Left brachiocephalic vein: The left brachiocephalic vein crosses the midline. It is formed by the union of the left subclavian and left internal jugular veins and travels across the midline to join the right brachiocephalic vein, forming the superior vena cava. B. Hemiazygous vein: The hemiazygous vein is another vein that crosses the midline. It runs along the left side of the vertebral column and eventually drains into the azygous vein, which crosses the midline at the level of the T8 vertebra to enter the superior vena cava. C. Left renal vein: The left renal vein does cross the midline as it drains the left kidney into the inferior vena cava.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anteriorly, below the superior mesenteric artery The left renal vein crosses the aorta anteriorly and lies below the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). This anatomical relationship is important in vascular and surgical procedures, as the left renal vein can sometimes be compressed between the aorta and the SMA, a condition known as nutcracker syndrome. In this situation, the left renal vein is compressed between the two vessels, leading to symptoms like hematuria and flank pain. Incorrect Responses: (A) Anteriorly, above the superior mesenteric artery The left renal vein does not cross the aorta above the superior mesenteric artery. This would be anatomically incorrect, as the left renal vein passes beneath the SMA, not above it. Therefore, A is incorrect. (C) Posteriorly, at the level of superior mesenteric artery The left renal vein does not cross the aorta posteriorly at the level of the superior mesenteric artery. It crosses anteriorly to the aorta, so this description does not accurately reflect the correct anatomy. Therefore, C is incorrect. (D) Anteriorly, below the inferior mesenteric artery The left renal vein crosses the aorta below the superior mesenteric artery, not the inferior mesenteric artery. The inferior mesenteric artery arises at a much lower level and does not influence the path of the left renal vein.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) External iliac artery The superior epigastric artery, which is a terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery (arising from the subclavian artery), descends within the rectus sheath and anastomoses with the inferior epigastric artery. The inferior epigastric artery is a branch of the external iliac artery, which arises from the aorta. This anastomosis occurs in the rectus sheath posterior to the rectus abdominis muscle. This connection is clinically important as it provides collateral blood flow between the subclavian and external iliac arteries. Incorrect Responses: (A) Subclavian artery Although the subclavian artery is the source of the internal thoracic artery, which gives rise to the superior epigastric artery, it does not directly contribute to the anastomosis with the inferior epigastric artery. Thus, A is incorrect. (C) Internal iliac artery The internal iliac artery primarily supplies the pelvic organs, perineum, and gluteal regions. It does not directly participate in the anastomosis with the superior epigastric artery. Therefore, C is incorrect. (D) External carotid artery The external carotid artery supplies the head and neck region and is not involved in the blood supply of the rectus sheath or abdominal wall. Hence, D is incorrect. (E) Axillary artery The axillary artery supplies the upper limb, chest wall, and shoulder region. It does not have any direct role in the blood supply of the rectus sheath or the anastomosis between the superior and inferior epigastric arteries.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Each pharyngeal arch has an aortic arch that passes through it. The aortic arches connect the aortic sac with the right and left dorsal aortas. Normally, the left fourth aortic arch is retained as the definitive aortic arch. The right fourth aortic arch normally forms the proximal part of the right subclavian artery. The distal part of this artery is formed by the right seventh intersegmental artery. Normally, most of the right dorsal aorta between these two vessels disappears. The presence of a right aortic arch in addition to the normal left aortic arch indicates that the portion of the right dorsal aorta that should have disappeared did not. The right fourth aortic arch normally persists. It forms the proximal part of the right subclavian artery. The right seventh intersegmental artery normally persists. It forms the distal part of the right subclavian artery. The proximal part of the right sixth aortic arch normally persists.

It begins at the cecum, where the ileum of the small intestine connects to the large intestine, and ascends along the right side of the abdomen to the hepatic flexure. Its short, vertical course makes it the shortest section of the colon compared to the other parts. Incorrect Responses: (B) Transverse colon The transverse colon is longer than the ascending colon. It runs horizontally across the abdominal cavity from the right to the left side, connecting the hepatic flexure on the right with the splenic flexure on the left. This makes it longer than the ascending colon, so B is incorrect. (C) Descending colon The descending colon extends downward on the left side of the abdomen, from the splenic flexure to the sigmoid colon. While it is relatively short, it is still longer than the ascending colon. Therefore, C is incorrect. (D) Sigmoid colon The sigmoid colon is also longer than the ascending colon. It has an S-shaped curve, extending from the descending colon to the rectum. This makes it one of the longer segments of the colon.",
