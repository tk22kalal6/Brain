      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Adductor magnus The ischial tuberosity is a bony prominence located on the inferior part of the ischium in the pelvis. The adductor magnus muscle has an attachment at the ischial tuberosity. The adductor magnus is a large muscle that plays a significant role in hip adduction and is involved in extending the thigh at the hip joint. Its attachment to the ischial tuberosity contributes to its function in both the adductor and hamstring actions, particularly in movements like squatting. Incorrect Responses: (A) Obturator internus The obturator internus muscle originates from the pelvic surface of the obturator membrane and the surrounding bones, not the ischial tuberosity. It passes through the lesser sciatic foramen to insert on the greater trochanter of the femur. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (B) Quadratus femoris The quadratus femoris muscle originates from the ischial tuberosity, but it inserts on the intertrochanteric crest of the femur. However, it is not primarily known for its attachment at the ischial tuberosity but rather for its action at the hip joint. Thus, this option is not the best answer for the question, as it pertains to a different action and origin. (C) Gluteus maximus The gluteus maximus muscle has its origin from the posterior part of the ilium, sacrum, and coccyx, as well as from the sacrotuberous ligament. While it is involved in the gluteal region, it does not originate from the ischial tuberosity.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Psoas major. Explanation for Correct Answer: The psoas major is primarily a hip flexor, not a lateral rotator. It plays a significant role in flexing the hip joint, which involves bringing the thigh towards the torso. However, the psoas major can assist in the lateral rotation of the hip when the hip is in a flexed position, especially when combined with other muscles like the iliacus. It is an important muscle involved in the movement of the lower limb, and it plays a role in several movements including flexion and stabilization of the hip joint. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: (B) Quadratus femoris: The quadratus femoris is a lateral rotator of the hip. It is one of the muscles responsible for external rotation of the hip joint. It is located in the posterior hip region and is an important muscle in stabilizing and rotating the femur laterally. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that psoas major is a lateral rotator while quadratus femoris is not. (C) Obturator internus: The obturator internus is another muscle that acts as a lateral rotator of the hip. It originates from the inner surface of the obturator membrane and the surrounding bones and inserts into the greater trochanter of the femur. It plays a critical role in laterally rotating the hip when the hip is extended. While the obturator internus is involved in lateral rotation, it does not make psoas major the correct answer for the question. (D) Obturator externus: The obturator externus is also a lateral rotator of the hip. It acts to externally rotate the hip and stabilize the joint. It is located in the lateral aspect of the hip and originates from the outer surface of the obturator membrane. While the obturator externus is important for lateral rotation, it does not make psoas major a lateral rotator.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Nerve to obturator internus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The nerve to obturator internus is the only structure that passes through both the greater and lesser sciatic foramen. The nerve originates from the sacral plexus (L5, S1, S2) and initially exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It then loops around the ischial spine and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen to innervate the obturator internus muscle. This pathway through both foramina is unique to this nerve. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Nerve to quadratus femoris: The nerve to quadratus femoris only passes through the greater sciatic foramen and does not pass through the lesser sciatic foramen. It innervates the quadratus femoris and the inferior gemellus muscles. B. Superior gluteal nerve: The superior gluteal nerve exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen but does not pass through the lesser sciatic foramen. It innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae muscles. D. Piriformis muscle: The piriformis muscle passes through the greater sciatic foramen, but it does not pass through the lesser sciatic foramen. It plays a role in lateral rotation and abduction of the hip joint.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Psoas major. The psoas major is a primary muscle involved in hip flexion. It originates from the lumbar vertebrae (T12-L5) and inserts on the lesser trochanter of the femur. Its primary function is to flex the hip joint by bringing the thigh toward the abdomen or moving the trunk toward the thigh. The psoas major is often considered a powerful and essential hip flexor because of its deep anatomical positioning and ability to generate significant force. Incorrect Options: (B) Vastus medialis This is incorrect because the vastus medialis is part of the quadriceps femoris group, located in the anterior compartment of the thigh. Its main function is knee extension, not hip flexion. While the quadriceps may stabilize the knee during certain movements, it does not act as a flexor of the hip. (C) Quadratus femoris This is incorrect because the quadratus femoris is a small, flat muscle located in the posterior aspect of the hip joint. It primarily functions as a lateral rotator of the hip, helping to externally rotate the thigh. It does not contribute to flexion of the hip joint. (D) Gluteus maximus This is incorrect because the gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in the body and a powerful extensor of the hip. It plays a crucial role in movements like rising from a seated position, climbing stairs, or running but is involved in hip extension, not flexion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Superior gluteal nerve and vessels. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The greater sciatic foramen is a large opening in the pelvis that allows several structures to pass between the pelvis and the gluteal region. The superior gluteal nerve and the superior gluteal vessels (artery and vein) are among the structures that exit the pelvis through this foramen. These structures provide innervation and blood supply to the gluteal muscles, particularly the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Tendon of obturator internus: The tendon of obturator internus passes through the lesser sciatic foramen, not the greater sciatic foramen. This tendon passes through the lesser sciatic foramen to insert on the greater trochanter of the femur, contributing to hip rotation. C. Anterior cutaneous nerve of thigh: The anterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh is a branch of the femoral nerve and does not pass through the greater sciatic foramen.
