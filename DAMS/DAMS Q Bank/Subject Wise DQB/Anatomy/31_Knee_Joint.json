      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) primarily prevents anterior dislocation of the tibia relative to the femur. Here's why: Explanation: The ACL runs diagonally within the knee joint, from the posterior part of the femur to the anterior part of the tibia. Its function is to stabilize the knee joint by: Preventing anterior translation (dislocation) of the tibia relative to the femur. Limiting excessive rotation of the knee. Incorrect Options: A. Anterior dislocation of femur: The femur typically does not dislocate anteriorly due to the anatomy of the joint and the action of other structures. B. Posterior dislocation of femur: This is rare and not prevented by the ACL; other ligaments play a role in this stabilization. D. Posterior dislocation of tibia: This is primarily prevented by the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Thus, the correct answer is C. Anterior dislocation of tibia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Medial part of lateral condyle of femur. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key stabilizing structures of the knee joint. It is attached to the medial part of the lateral condyle of the femur and the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia. The ACL runs diagonally across the knee joint, preventing excessive forward movement of the tibia relative to the femur, and limiting rotational movements. Its attachment to the medial part of the lateral femoral condyle is critical for its function in stabilizing the knee during dynamic activities. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Medial part of posterior intercondylar area of tibia: The medial part of the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia is the attachment site of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), not the ACL. The ACL attaches to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia, not the posterior region. B. Lateral part of medial condyle of femur: This option is incorrect because the ACL does not attach to the lateral part of the medial condyle of the femur.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Its posterior surface is indented by the popliteus muscle. The lateral meniscus of the knee has a unique feature in that its posterior surface is indented by the popliteus muscle. The popliteus muscle, which is located at the back of the knee, has a tendon that passes along the lateral aspect of the knee joint and inserts on the posterior part of the lateral meniscus. This anatomical relationship helps with the function of the popliteus muscle, which is responsible for unlocking the knee from full extension, particularly during the initial phase of knee flexion. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. It is nearly semilunar: The lateral meniscus is not nearly semilunar in shape. It is more circular or \"O\" shaped, unlike the medial meniscus, which is more crescent or semilunar. The shape of the lateral meniscus helps with better mobility and stability within the knee joint, especially with lateral movements. B. It is more liable to injury: The medial meniscus is actually more prone to injury than the lateral meniscus. The medial meniscus is more firmly attached to the tibia and the joint capsule, which makes it less mobile and more susceptible to tears, especially in activities involving sudden twisting or pivoting. In contrast, the lateral meniscus has greater mobility and is less likely to be injured. D. Fibular collateral ligament is attached to it: The fibular collateral ligament (FCL) does not attach to the lateral meniscus. The FCL, also known as the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), attaches to the femur and fibula but is not directly connected to the meniscus. The lateral meniscus is instead connected to the tibia and the joint capsule but not to the fibular collateral ligament.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) More liable to injury than lateral meniscus. The medial meniscus is more prone to injury than the lateral meniscus due to its anatomical and functional characteristics. It is firmly attached to the tibial plateau and to the medial collateral ligament (MCL), which restricts its mobility. This lack of mobility makes the medial meniscus more susceptible to damage from rotational forces, especially during activities such as twisting or pivoting. The lateral meniscus, on the other hand, has more freedom of movement, making it less prone to injury. Thus, option A is correct. Incorrect Options: B. Attached to fibular collateral ligament: The medial meniscus is not attached to the fibular collateral ligament (also known as the lateral collateral ligament). Instead, the medial meniscus is primarily attached to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and to the tibia. The fibular collateral ligament is associated with the lateral meniscus, not the medial one. Therefore, option B is incorrect. C. It is circular in shape: The medial meniscus is C-shaped (semilunar) and not circular. The lateral meniscus, on the other hand, is more circular in shape. The C-shape of the medial meniscus allows it to better accommodate the femoral condyle and provide cushioning. Therefore, option C is incorrect. D. Wider in front: The medial meniscus is wider at the back than at the front. This anatomical feature allows it to better adapt to the shape of the femoral condyle and helps distribute the load more evenly. The lateral meniscus is more symmetrical in width.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is primarily responsible for preventing the forward displacement (or anterior translation) of the tibia relative to the femur. It attaches to the anterior part of the tibia and extends to the femur, and its main function is to resist forward movement of the tibia during activities such as running, jumping, or quick directional changes. This stabilization is crucial for the proper functioning of the knee joint. Reasons for Incorrect Options: B. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL): The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) prevents the posterior displacement of the tibia (i.e., stops the tibia from moving backward relative to the femur). It works in opposition to the ACL and does not play a role in preventing forward displacement. Therefore, option B is incorrect. C. Medial collateral ligament (MCL): The medial collateral ligament (MCL) provides stability to the medial side (inner side) of the knee joint, primarily preventing excessive side-to-side movement (valgus stress). While it contributes to overall knee stability, it does not prevent the tibia from shifting forward. Therefore, option C is incorrect. D. Lateral collateral ligament (LCL): The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) stabilizes the lateral (outer) side of the knee joint and resists varus stress (inward bending of the knee). Similar to the MCL, it provides side-to-side stability but does not control forward displacement of the tibia. Therefore, option D is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Middle genicular artery. The middle genicular artery is the primary blood supply to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This artery is a branch of the popliteal artery and it enters the knee joint to provide blood to the ACL, along with other structures within the knee joint. The middle genicular artery supplies the central region of the ACL, which is vital for its metabolic needs and proper function. Therefore, option C is correct. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Medial genicular artery: The medial genicular artery supplies the medial structures of the knee joint, such as the medial femoral condyle and parts of the medial meniscus, but it does not primarily supply the anterior cruciate ligament. Therefore, option A is incorrect. B. Lateral genicular artery: The lateral genicular artery supplies the lateral structures of the knee, including the lateral femoral condyle and parts of the lateral meniscus. It is not the main source of blood supply to the ACL. Therefore, option B is incorrect. D. None of the above: Since the middle genicular artery is indeed the major supplier of blood to the ACL, option D (None of the above) is incorrect. The middle genicular artery does provide the primary blood supply to the ACL.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Prevents posterior dislocation of tibia. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is one of the two cruciate ligaments in the knee joint, the other being the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Its primary function is to prevent the posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur. The PCL is stronger and thicker than the ACL and plays a vital role in stabilizing the knee, especially during activities like walking downhill or descending stairs. It also resists hyperflexion of the knee and maintains joint stability under load. Explanation of the incorrect options: (A) Attached to the lateral femoral condyle: This statement is incorrect because the PCL attaches to the medial femoral condyle, not the lateral. Specifically, it originates from the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and inserts into the anterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. (B) Intrasynovial: The PCL is not intrasynovial; it is extrasynovial but remains intracapsular. While it is located within the joint capsule, it is outside the synovial membrane. This anatomical arrangement provides lubrication while protecting the ligament from direct exposure to synovial fluid. (D) Relaxed in full flexion: This statement is incorrect because the PCL is taut during full flexion of the knee. Its fibers remain under tension to maintain posterior stability and prevent excessive posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Anterior cruciate ligament. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the two cruciate ligaments of the knee joint. Its primary function is to prevent the posterior displacement of the femur on the tibia (or, conversely, anterior displacement of the tibia on the femur). The ACL is attached to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and ascends posteriorly to attach to the lateral femoral condyle. It is taut during knee extension and prevents hyperextension, providing significant stability to the knee during activities like walking, running, and jumping. Explanation of the incorrect options: (B) Posterior cruciate ligament: The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) prevents anterior displacement of the femur on the tibia (or posterior displacement of the tibia on the femur). While it complements the ACL in stabilizing the knee, it is not responsible for preventing posterior dislocation of the femur. (C) Medial collateral ligament: The medial collateral ligament (MCL) provides stability to the knee against valgus forces (forces pushing the knee inward). It stabilizes the medial side of the knee joint but does not play a role in preventing posterior dislocation of the femur. (D) Lateral collateral ligament: The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) provides stability against varus forces (forces pushing the knee outward). Like the MCL, it stabilizes the lateral side of the knee but is not involved in preventing posterior dislocation of the femur.",
