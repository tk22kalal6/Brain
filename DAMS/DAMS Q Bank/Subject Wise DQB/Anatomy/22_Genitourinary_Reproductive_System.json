      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Inferior mesenteric artery. Explanation for the Correct Answer: A horseshoe kidney is a congenital condition where the two kidneys are fused at the lower poles, forming a \"U\" shape. This fusion typically results in the kidney being positioned lower than usual in the abdomen. In most cases, the horseshoe kidney lies below the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), which is at the level of the L3 vertebra. The IMA arises from the abdominal aorta and supplies the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. The horseshoe kidney is generally found just below the IMA, around the L4 vertebral level. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Coeliac trunk: This is incorrect because the coeliac trunk is higher in the abdomen, arising from the abdominal aorta at the level of T12. The horseshoe kidney is positioned lower, typically at the level of L3-L4, beneath the coeliac trunk. B. Superior mesenteric artery: This is incorrect because the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) arises from the abdominal aorta at the level of L1 and supplies the small intestine and part of the large intestine. The horseshoe kidney lies below this level, closer to the IMA, which is situated at a lower vertebral level. D. Median sacral artery: This is incorrect because the median sacral artery arises from the posterior aspect of the abdominal aorta, usually at the level of L4-L5. The horseshoe kidney is generally located above this level, near the L3-L4 region.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Ilio-inguinal nerve. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The ilio-inguinal nerve is not a constituent of the spermatic cord. It is a branch of the first lumbar nerve and primarily provides sensory innervation to the skin over the lower abdomen, upper thigh, and the scrotum. It does not travel within the spermatic cord, though it may pass superficially to it, providing sensation to the scrotum and upper medial thigh. The spermatic cord contains structures that pass to the testes and other related areas, but the ilio-inguinal nerve is not enclosed within it. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Ductus deferens: The ductus deferens (or vas deferens) is a key component of the spermatic cord. It carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra during ejaculation. The vas deferens is enclosed within the spermatic cord, along with the testicular artery and other structures. B. Testicular artery: The testicular artery is also a vital component of the spermatic cord. It supplies blood to the testes, and it is a branch of the abdominal aorta. The testicular artery travels through the spermatic cord to reach the testes, providing their main blood supply. D. Genital branch of genitofemoral nerve: The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve is another important structure within the spermatic cord. It provides motor innervation to the cremaster muscle, which is involved in the raising and lowering of the testes. It also provides sensory innervation to the scrotum.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) At the crossing by external iliac artery. Explanation for the Correct Answer: Constrictions in the ureter are areas where the ureter is more likely to become obstructed, often leading to kidney stones or other urinary problems. These constrictions occur at the following typical sites: At the pelvi-ureteric junction: Where the renal pelvis transitions into the ureter. At the brim of the lesser pelvis: As the ureter enters the pelvic cavity. At the passage through the bladder wall: Where the ureter passes through the bladder wall and enters the bladder. However, the crossing by the external iliac artery is not considered a typical constriction site for the ureter. While the external iliac artery passes over the ureter near the pelvic brim, this is not considered a significant constriction or narrowing of the ureter. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. At the pelvi-ureteric junction: This is a common site for constriction, where the renal pelvis connects to the ureter. It is one of the primary sites where obstructions can occur, leading to hydronephrosis. B. At the brim of the lesser pelvis: This is another common constriction point where the ureter transitions from the abdomen to the pelvis. D. Passage through bladder wall: This is the point where the ureter passes through the bladder wall, forming another constriction. This area is a frequent site of obstruction, often related to stones.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Bulbourethral glands. Explanation for the Correct Answer: C. Bulbourethral glands: The bulbourethral glands (also known as Cowper's glands) do not open into the prostatic urethra. These glands secrete a clear fluid that lubricates the urethra during sexual arousal. They open into the membranous urethra, not the prostatic urethra, which makes option C the correct choice. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Prostatic utricle: The prostatic utricle is an embryological remnant of the Müllerian duct, and it opens into the prostatic urethra. It is a small blind pouch located within the prostatic urethra. B. Ejaculatory duct: The ejaculatory ducts are formed by the union of the ductus deferens and the seminal vesicles. These ducts open into the prostatic urethra and play a key role in the expulsion of semen. D. Prostatic ducts: The prostatic ducts open into the prostatic urethra.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Lymphatics drain to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. Explanation for the Correct Answer: C. Lymphatics drain to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes: The lymphatic drainage of the penis follows a distinct path, with most of the lymphatic vessels draining to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes are located in the groin area and receive drainage from the skin and superficial tissues of the penis. Therefore, option C is correct. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. External pudendal artery supplies body of penis: The external pudendal artery does contribute to the blood supply of the penis, but it primarily supplies the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the penis, not the body of the penis itself. The main blood supply to the body of the penis comes from the internal pudendal artery, which gives rise to the deep artery of the penis and other branches. B. Nerve supply is derived from obturator nerve: The obturator nerve does not contribute to the nerve supply of the penis. The primary nerve supply to the penis comes from the pudendal nerve, which provides both sensory and motor innervation. Additionally, the pelvic splanchnic nerves also contribute autonomic innervation to the penis. D. Deep artery of penis is derived from the external pudendal artery: The deep artery of the penis, which supplies the erectile tissue, is actually derived from the internal pudendal artery, not the external pudendal artery. The external pudendal artery primarily supplies the skin and superficial tissues, not the erectile structures.",

Gonadal artery: The gonadal artery (testicular or ovarian artery) does provide a blood supply to the ureter, particularly to its lower part. This artery is one of the sources of arterial blood to the ureter, making A correct. B. Middle rectal: The middle rectal artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery, supplies the lower part of the ureter, especially in the pelvic region. Therefore, B is correct. C.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sympathetic chain. Explanation for the Correct Answer: C. Sympathetic chain: The sympathetic chain is not a posterior relation of the kidney. While the sympathetic chain runs along the lateral aspects of the vertebral column, it is not directly in contact with the kidneys. Therefore, C is the correct answer, as it does not belong to the posterior relations of the kidney. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Psoas major: The psoas major muscle is one of the key posterior structures related to the kidneys. It lies in front of the kidney and is important for flexion of the hip. Hence, A is a correct option for posterior relation. B. Quadratus lumborum: The quadratus lumborum muscle is also a posterior relation of the kidney. It is located laterally to the kidney and helps in stabilizing the lower back. Therefore, B is a correct answer. D. Ilioinguinal nerve: The ilioinguinal nerve is a branch of the lumbar plexus, and it runs anteriorly to the kidney, but it can be considered a posterior relation of the upper pole of the kidney. Therefore, D is a correct option.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 15-20 cm. Explanation for the Correct Answer: D. 15-20 cm: The male urethra is approximately 18-20 cm in length. It runs through the penis and extends from the internal urethral orifice at the bladder to the external urethral orifice at the tip of the penis. The male urethra has several parts: the prostatic urethra, membranous urethra, and spongy (penile) urethra. The length can vary slightly between individuals, but it generally falls within this range. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. 3-5 cm: This length is too short for the male urethra. A length of 3-5 cm would be more typical for the female urethra, which is much shorter than the male urethra. B. 5-10 cm: Again, this is too short for the male urethra. The male urethra is significantly longer, typically measuring between 18 and 20 cm. C. 10-15 cm: While closer, this length still falls short of the actual average length of the male urethra, which is around 18-20 cm. This range could describe some cases, but the more accurate answer is the 15-20 cm range.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Completely lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Explanation for the Correct Answer: A. Completely lined by stratified squamous epithelium: This statement is incorrect because the anal canal is not completely lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The upper part of the anal canal (above the pectinate line) is lined by columnar epithelium, while the lower part (below the pectinate line) is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The junction between these two types of epithelium is the pectinate line. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: B. Supplied by pudendal nerve: This statement is true. The pudendal nerve (S2, S3, S4) provides sensory and motor innervation to the anal canal, especially below the pectinate line. This nerve is responsible for sensation and voluntary control of the anal sphincter. C. Drained by veins forming portosystemic anastomosis: This statement is true. The anal canal has veins that form part of the portosystemic anastomosis, which connects the portal venous system to the systemic circulation. In cases of portal hypertension, these anastomoses can lead to hemorrhoids. D. Part below pectinate line is painful: This statement is true. The part of the anal canal below the pectinate line is sensitive to pain because it is supplied by somatic nerves, which transmit pain sensations. Above the pectinate line, the innervation is autonomic, and it is less sensitive to pain.",

Explanation for Incorrect Responses: B. Femoral branch of genitofemoral nerve: This is incorrect because the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve does not innervate the cremasteric muscle. Instead, it provides sensory innervation to the anterior thigh region and is not involved in motor functions like the genital branch. C. Lateral femoral nerve: This is incorrect because the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is primarily a sensory nerve that innervates the skin of the lateral thigh.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Left gonadal vessels. Explanation for the Correct Answer: B. Left gonadal vessels: The left ureter passes posterior to the left gonadal vessels (testicular or ovarian) in the abdomen. The ureter runs along the psoas major muscle and is related to these vessels, which cross over the ureter at this point. Therefore, the left gonadal vessels are an important anatomical structure related to the left ureter. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Quadratus lumborum: This statement is incorrect. The quadratus lumborum muscle is located in the posterior abdominal wall and is related to the posterior aspects of the ureter but not in direct relation with it as the gonadal vessels are. The ureter runs anterior to the quadratus lumborum, not through it. C. Superior mesenteric vein: This statement is incorrect. The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is located more anteriorly in the abdomen and does not directly interact with the left ureter. The left ureter is primarily related to structures such as the gonadal vessels and the psoas muscle, not the SMV. D. Internal iliac artery: This statement is incorrect. The internal iliac artery is not a structure that the left ureter is directly related to in the abdominal or pelvic regions.

Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh: The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is not typically in danger when exposing the kidney from behind. This nerve arises from the lumbar plexus (L2, L3) and runs along the iliac crest, passing beneath the inguinal ligament. While it supplies sensory innervation to the skin over the lateral aspect of the thigh, its course is not close to the kidney, and it is less likely to be injured during a posterior approach to the kidney. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: B. Ilioinguinal nerve: The ilioinguinal nerve (L1) is in close proximity to the abdominal wall and is at risk of injury during surgeries in the lower abdomen or posteriorly in the region of the kidney. It typically runs along the iliac crest and may be at risk during procedures involving the kidney or lower abdominal wall. C. Subcostal nerve: The subcostal nerve (T12) lies just below the 12th rib and is closely related to the kidney's posterior surface. It is at risk during procedures to expose the kidney, as it runs along the lower border of the ribs and passes through the muscles of the abdominal wall. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Median lobe. Explanation for the Correct Answer: C. Median lobe: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) typically results in the enlargement of the median lobe of the prostate. This enlargement causes obstruction of the urethra, leading to urinary tract symptoms such as difficulty in urination, frequency, and weak urine flow. The median lobe protrudes into the bladder neck and obstructs the flow of urine from the bladder, which is characteristic of BPH. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Entire prostate gland: While BPH involves the enlargement of the prostate gland, it does not affect the entire gland uniformly. It specifically affects the median lobe (also referred to as the anterior lobe in some texts) and, to a lesser extent, the lateral lobes. The entire gland is not typically enlarged in the same manner as the median lobe in BPH. B. Lateral lobes: Enlargement of the lateral lobes is a common feature of prostatic hypertrophy but typically does not directly cause obstruction in the way that enlargement of the median lobe does. In some cases, the lateral lobes can contribute to the overall enlargement, but it is the median lobe that primarily causes the obstructive symptoms in BPH. D. Posterior lobes: The posterior lobes of the prostate are less commonly involved in BPH, and they are not the specific lobe responsible for urinary tract obstruction. BPH generally affects the transitional zone of the prostate, which includes the median lobe and lateral lobes, but not the posterior lobes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Presents a concavity posteriorly. Explanation for the Correct Answer: B. Presents a concavity posteriorly: The prostatic urethra does not present a concavity posteriorly. Instead, it has a relatively smooth, slightly convex posterior surface. The concavity mentioned in the option is not a characteristic of the prostatic urethra itself. This feature is generally seen in the anterior wall of the urethra, which may curve during normal anatomy but not posteriorly. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Is the widest and most dilatable part: This is true. The prostatic urethra is the widest and most dilatable part of the male urethra. It is the portion that runs through the prostate gland and is the largest segment in terms of both diameter and ability to expand. C. Lies closer to the anterior surface of the prostate: This is true. The prostatic urethra is positioned near the anterior surface of the prostate gland, running through the central part of the gland from the bladder neck to the membranous urethra. D. Receives prostatic ductules along its posterior wall: This is true. The prostatic urethra receives the prostatic ductules (small ducts from the prostate glands) along its posterior wall. These ducts deliver the prostatic fluid that is part of the seminal fluid.",

This part of the urethra is the shortest and most narrow segment, situated between the prostatic urethra and the spongy urethra. The sphincter is a voluntary muscle that allows for control over urination. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Prostatic urethra: The prostatic urethra is the longest segment of the male urethra, running through the prostate gland. It does not contain the sphincter urethrae. This part of the urethra is involved in the passage of urine and seminal fluid but lacks voluntary control from the sphincter. B. Spongy urethra: The spongy urethra (also known as the penile urethra) runs through the penis. It is surrounded by erectile tissue (corpus spongiosum) but does not contain the sphincter urethrae.

The deep inguinal nodes typically receive lymphatics from deeper structures of the lower limb and perineum rather than from the uterus. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. External iliac: This group of lymph nodes is an important drainage site for the upper part of the uterus, including the fundus and part of the body. Lymphatic vessels from these regions commonly pass to the external iliac nodes. Hence, this option is correct in relation to uterine lymphatic drainage. B. Internal iliac: The internal iliac nodes drain lymph from the lower part of the uterus, including the cervix. This drainage is critical for the lymphatic network of the pelvic organs, including the uterus. C.

The deep inguinal lymph nodes are more involved in the drainage of structures like the lower limb, external genitalia, and perineum, not the cervix. Explanation for Incorrect Options: A. Parametrial lymph nodes: The parametrial lymph nodes are a key group receiving lymph from the cervix.

Therefore, the statement in option D is incorrect. Now, let's look at the other options: A. The terminal part is dilated to form ampulla: The ampulla of the vas deferens is indeed a dilated portion located just before the duct joins the seminal vesicle. This ampulla stores sperm before ejaculation. Therefore, this statement is true. B.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Superficial perineal pouch. Injury to the male urethra below the perineal membrane (such as in cases of penile or bulbar urethral injury) causes urine to accumulate in the superficial perineal pouch. The superficial perineal pouch lies below the perineal membrane and contains structures like the bulbospongiosus muscle and the erectile tissue of the penis. Since the rupture occurs below the perineal membrane, the urine extravasates into this superficial space. Now, let's examine the other options: B. Deep perineal pouch: The deep perineal pouch is located above the perineal membrane and contains structures such as the sphincter urethrae, the deep transverse perineal muscles, and part of the urethra. Injury below the perineal membrane does not lead to urine accumulation in this deeper space, so this option is incorrect. C. Space of Retzius: The space of Retzius is a potential space between the bladder and the pubic symphysis. It is more commonly involved in cases of extraperitoneal bladder injury. Urine does not typically accumulate here when the urethra is injured below the perineal membrane, making this option incorrect. D. Pouch of Douglas: The pouch of Douglas (or rectouterine pouch in females) is a peritoneal recess located between the uterus and rectum in females, or between the rectum and bladder in males. Urine extravasation from a male urethral injury does not affect the pouch of Douglas, making this option incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Broad Ligament The broad ligament is incorrect as a support of the uterus in the strict anatomical sense. Although the broad ligament provides some support to the uterus, its primary function is to provide a passage for blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to the uterus, rather than directly supporting it. The broad ligament connects the sides of the uterus to the walls and floor of the pelvis. However, it does not have the same degree of support as other ligaments that directly help stabilize and suspend the uterus. Incorrect Responses: (A) Uterosacral ligament The uterosacral ligament is a correct support of the uterus. It extends from the uterus to the sacrum and helps to stabilize the uterus by anchoring it to the posterior pelvic wall. It plays a significant role in maintaining the position of the uterus within the pelvic cavity. Therefore, A is correct. (C) Mackenrodt's ligament The Mackenrodt's ligament (also known as the cardinal ligament) is a correct support for the uterus. This ligament is crucial in supporting the uterus laterally and also provides support for the cervix. It helps maintain the position of the uterus within the pelvis and prevents it from prolapsing. Therefore, C is correct. (D) Levator ani The levator ani muscles, a group of pelvic floor muscles, are correct supports of the uterus. These muscles form part of the pelvic floor and provide support for the uterus by helping to maintain its position in the pelvic cavity. They are essential in preventing uterine prolapse.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 12th rib & lateral border of sacrospinalis The renal angle (also known as the costovertebral angle) is formed between the 12th rib and the lateral border of the sacrospinalis muscle (also called the erector spinae muscle). This angle is clinically significant as it is where the kidneys are located, and tenderness in this area can indicate issues such as kidney infection or renal stones. Therefore, A is correct. Incorrect Responses: (B) 11th rib & lateral border of sacrospinalis The 11th rib is not the correct rib involved in the formation of the renal angle. The renal angle is specifically defined by the 12th rib, not the 11th. While the lateral border of the sacrospinalis muscle is part of the angle, the use of the 11th rib in this context makes B incorrect. (C) 12th rib & lateral border of quadratus lumborum The quadratus lumborum is a muscle located deeper in the back, and it is not involved in the formation of the renal angle. The correct muscle involved is the sacrospinalis or erector spinae muscle, not the quadratus lumborum. Therefore, C is incorrect. (D) 11th rib & lateral border of quadratus lumborum As in B and C, the use of the 11th rib makes this option incorrect. The renal angle is formed by the 12th rib, not the 11th.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Straight tubules → Rete testis → Efferent tubules The correct order of the pathway for sperm development and transport is as follows: Straight tubules (tubuli recti) are the initial part of the seminiferous tubules that lead sperm to the rete testis, a network of tubules. From the rete testis, sperm move into the efferent tubules which transport sperm to the epididymis. This sequence correctly follows the path that sperm take as they travel from the site of sperm production to the epididymis for maturation. Therefore, A is the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (B) Rete tubules → Efferent tubules → Straight tubules This sequence is incorrect because it places the straight tubules after the efferent tubules, which is anatomically incorrect. The straight tubules are the first structures that collect sperm from the seminiferous tubules, leading to the rete testis, not the efferent tubules. Therefore, B is incorrect. (C) Efferent → Straight tubules → Rete testis This is incorrect because efferent tubules come after the rete testis. The efferent tubules collect sperm from the rete testis, not the straight tubules, making this sequence anatomically incorrect. Therefore, C is incorrect. (D) Straight tubules → Efferent tubules → Rete tubules This sequence is incorrect because the rete testis should come after the straight tubules and before the efferent tubules, as described in option A.

They supply the erectile tissue of the penis (corpora cavernosa) and play a key role in the process of erection. These arteries spiral through the erectile tissue and dilate when blood flow increases during sexual arousal. Therefore, A is the correct answer.

As a result, their lymphatic drainage follows their embryological origin rather than their final anatomical position. The para-aortic lymph nodes are located around the abdominal aorta, near the renal arteries. This makes C the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (A) Inguinal lymph nodes The inguinal lymph nodes receive lymphatic drainage from the scrotum, perineum, and skin of the lower abdomen. However, the testes themselves do not drain into the inguinal lymph nodes. Hence, A is incorrect. (B) Mesenteric lymph nodes The mesenteric lymph nodes are associated with the intestines and provide drainage for the gastrointestinal tract.

These nodes are located along the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta and collect lymph from the mesenteric lymph nodes (intermediate lymph nodes). They are critical in draining lymph from the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon, and ultimately drain into the cisterna chyli. Since lymphatic drainage follows the arterial supply, these nodes correspond to the distribution of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Incorrect Responses: (A) Paracolic Paracolic lymph nodes are located near the colon along the mesocolon. These nodes are part of the initial lymphatic drainage system of the colon and drain into intermediate lymph nodes such as the mesenteric nodes. They are not the terminal lymph nodes but play an intermediary role. (B) Epicolic Epicolic lymph nodes are small nodes found directly on the colon's surface, within the serosal layer. They are the first group of lymph nodes to receive drainage from the colon. However, their role is proximal in the lymphatic chain and not terminal. (D) Ileocolic Ileocolic lymph nodes are located near the junction of the ileum and colon and are responsible for draining lymph from the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Internal urethral sphincter The vaginal sphincter refers to a group of muscles that help control the opening and closing of the vaginal canal. The internal urethral sphincter is located around the internal urethral orifice, and it primarily functions to control the passage of urine from the bladder. It is not directly involved in the formation of the vaginal sphincter. Therefore, it does not contribute to the sphincter mechanism around the vagina, making it the correct answer in this context. Incorrect Responses: (B) External urethral sphincter The external urethral sphincter is part of the pelvic floor muscles and encircles the urethra. Although its primary role is to control urinary flow, it also plays a role in the vaginal sphincter mechanism, especially in maintaining continence and assisting with pelvic floor support. It is a significant muscle that contributes to the control around the vaginal opening. Hence, this is incorrect as it is part of the vaginal sphincter. (C) Pubovaginalis The pubovaginalis is a part of the pelvic floor muscles that forms a supportive sling around the vagina. It is a component of the levator ani muscle group and plays a crucial role in supporting the vagina and assisting in the vaginal sphincter mechanism. This muscle is directly involved in controlling the opening and closing of the vaginal canal. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (D) Bulbospongiosus The bulbospongiosus muscle is another important component of the pelvic floor that contributes to the vaginal sphincter. It surrounds the vaginal orifice and plays a role in closing the vagina, particularly during activities like sexual intercourse and childbirth. It is also involved in the contraction of the perineal muscles that support the vagina.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Accessory pancreatic duct The minor duodenal papilla is the opening for the accessory pancreatic duct (also called the duct of Santorini). This duct is an additional duct that drains pancreatic secretions from the pancreas into the duodenum, though it is usually less prominent than the major pancreatic duct. The minor duodenal papilla is located slightly above the major duodenal papilla, and it is where the accessory pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, thus making option C the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (A) Hepatic duct The hepatic ducts are involved in the transport of bile from the liver to the gallbladder and duodenum, but they do not open at the minor duodenal papilla. Instead, they combine to form the common hepatic duct, which later joins with the cystic duct to form the common bile duct, which opens at the major duodenal papilla. Therefore, option A is incorrect. (B) Hepatopancreatic ampulla The hepatopancreatic ampulla (also known as the ampulla of Vater) is formed by the union of the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct. It opens into the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, not the minor duodenal papilla. Therefore, option B is incorrect. (D) Bile duct The bile duct (common bile duct) carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the duodenum, but it opens at the major duodenal papilla, not the minor duodenal papilla. The minor papilla is the opening for the accessory pancreatic duct, not the bile duct.",

The minor calyces , of which there are usually 7 to 14, first unite into 2 (sometimes 3) major calyces before emptying into the renal pelvis. The renal pyramids represent the region where the collecting tubules of the kidney are located (separated from each other by renal columns in which glomeruli and convoluted tubules are located). At their apices (renal papilla), the collecting tubules constituting the renal pyramids discharge urine into the minor calyces.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mucosa is loosely associated to the underlying musculature This statement is incorrect because the mucosa of the urinary bladder, particularly in the trigone region, is tightly associated with the underlying musculature. The mucosa is firmly attached to the muscularis layer (detrusor muscle), especially in the trigone area, which does not have the loose attachment typically seen in other parts of the bladder. Therefore, A is false, and hence, the answer to the question. Incorrect Responses: (B) Mucosa is smooth This statement is true. The trigone of the urinary bladder is characterized by a smooth mucosal surface. Unlike the rest of the bladder, where the mucosa forms folds (rugae), the trigone has a flat and smooth appearance. Therefore, B is correct. (C) It is lined by transitional epithelium This statement is true. The entire urinary bladder, including the trigone, is lined by transitional epithelium (also known as urothelium). This specialized epithelial lining allows the bladder to stretch as it fills with urine. Therefore, C is correct. (D) It is derived from the absorbed part of the mesonephric duct This statement is true. The trigone of the bladder is formed from the mesonephric duct (also known as the Wolffian duct) during embryonic development. Specifically, it is derived from the absorbed part of the mesonephric ducts, which forms the posterior wall of the bladder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ischial spine The ischial spine is not a site of ureteric constriction. The ureters pass anteriorly to the ischial spine, and this is not a region where the ureter undergoes narrowing or constriction. The common constriction sites of the ureter are typically at anatomical landmarks that are closer to the renal pelvis and bladder, rather than in the vicinity of the ischial spine. Therefore, A is the correct answer, as the ischial spine is not associated with ureteric constriction. Incorrect Responses: (B) Pelvi-ureteric junction The pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) is one of the most common sites of constriction of the ureter. It is the point where the renal pelvis meets the ureter, and it can often be a site of narrowing, causing obstruction in conditions such as hydronephrosis. This makes B incorrect. (C) Uretero-vesical junction The uretero-vesical junction (UVJ) is another common site where the ureter is constricted as it enters the bladder. This constriction can lead to issues like vesicoureteral reflux, where urine flows backward into the ureters. Therefore, C is incorrect. (D) Crosses the internal iliac artery The area where the ureter crosses over the internal iliac artery is another common site of constriction. This region is particularly important in the context of kidney stone formation, as the crossing can create an obstruction or narrowing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Internal Vertebral Plexus of Veins The internal vertebral plexus, also known as Batson's plexus, is a network of valveless veins located within the vertebral column. This venous system provides a direct route for metastatic cancer cells, such as those from the prostate, to spread to the vertebrae. Because it is valveless, blood flow within this plexus can occur bidirectionally, facilitating the dissemination of cancer cells into the bones of the spine. The involvement of T10 and T11 vertebrae in this patient is consistent with this mechanism of hematogenous spread. Incorrect Responses: (A) Sacral Canal While the sacral canal houses the sacral portion of the spinal cord and nerve roots, it is not a direct route for the spread of cancer to the thoracic vertebrae. Prostatic cancer commonly spreads through hematogenous routes, such as Batson's plexus, rather than directly through the sacral canal. (B) Lymphatic Vessels Lymphatic spread of prostate cancer typically leads to involvement of regional lymph nodes, such as the pelvic and para-aortic nodes. It does not directly account for the spread to distant vertebrae like T10 and T11. (D) Superior Rectal Veins The superior rectal veins drain the rectum and ultimately communicate with the portal venous system, not with the vertebral column. Therefore, they do not serve as a pathway for prostate cancer to metastasize to the thoracic vertebrae.",
