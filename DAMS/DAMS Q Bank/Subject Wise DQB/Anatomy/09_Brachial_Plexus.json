      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Upper trunk of brachial plexus involved This statement is false because Klumpke's paralysis results from injury to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8 and T1 nerve roots), not the upper trunk. The lower trunk provides innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand and some of the forearm muscles. Damage to this region can occur due to excessive traction on the arm during delivery or trauma, leading to the characteristic symptoms of Klumpke’s paralysis. The upper trunk, which includes C5 and C6 nerve roots, is involved in Erb’s palsy, a different condition. Incorrect Responses: (A) Claw hand deformity This statement is correct. Klumpke’s paralysis often results in a claw hand deformity due to paralysis of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The flexors of the digits (innervated by the ulnar and median nerves) are unopposed by the extensor muscles, leading to hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the interphalangeal joints. (B) Intrinsic muscles of hand involved This statement is correct. The intrinsic muscles of the hand (lumbricals, interossei, thenar, and hypothenar muscles) are supplied by the C8 and T1 nerve roots via the ulnar and median nerves. Injury to these roots in Klumpke’s paralysis results in weakness or paralysis of these muscles, contributing to the claw hand deformity and impaired fine motor control. (C) Horner’s syndrome This statement is correct. In severe cases of Klumpke’s paralysis, involvement of the T1 root can extend to the sympathetic chain, leading to Horner’s syndrome. Symptoms include ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (loss of sweating) on the affected side of the face due to sympathetic dysfunction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Nerve to subclavius The nerve to subclavius arises directly from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (formed by the union of the C5 and C6 roots). It innervates the subclavius muscle, which stabilizes the clavicle and protects the underlying neurovascular structures during shoulder movement. As it is a direct branch of the trunk, this option is correct. Incorrect Responses: (A) Suprascapular nerve The suprascapular nerve also originates from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5 and C6). It supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which are involved in shoulder abduction and external rotation. While the nerve to subclavius may be considered the primary branch associated with the trunk, the suprascapular nerve is equally valid as a branch. (B) Long thoracic nerve The long thoracic nerve arises directly from the roots of the brachial plexus (C5, C6, and C7), not the trunk. It innervates the serratus anterior muscle, which is critical for scapular protraction and stabilization. Damage to this nerve can lead to a \"winged scapula,\" but its origin excludes it as a correct answer. (C) Anterior thoracic nerve The term \"anterior thoracic nerve\" is often used interchangeably with the lateral and medial pectoral nerves, which arise from the cords of the brachial plexus (not the trunks). These nerves supply the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles, ruling them out as correct answers.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Radial nerve arises from the posterior cord The radial nerve is a terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, which is derived from the posterior divisions of all three trunks (upper, middle, and lower). The radial nerve is responsible for motor innervation to the extensor muscles of the arm and forearm and sensory innervation to the posterior surface of the arm, forearm, and hand. Its origin from the posterior cord makes this the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: (A) Cervical rib involves lateral cord This is incorrect because a cervical rib typically compresses the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8 and T1 roots), not the lateral cord. The lower trunk contributes to the medial cord, not the lateral cord, so symptoms such as weakness or sensory loss are more likely to involve the ulnar nerve and parts of the median nerve derived from the medial cord. (B) Musculocutaneous nerve arises from medial cord The musculocutaneous nerve arises from the lateral cord, not the medial cord, of the brachial plexus. It innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm (biceps brachii, brachialis, and coracobrachialis) and provides sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the forearm. (D) Postfixed plexus is formed by C4,5,6,7,8 T1 This is incorrect because a postfixed brachial plexus is formed by C6, C7, C8, T1, and T2, not by C4. The usual configuration of the brachial plexus includes roots C5–T1. A prefixed plexus, by contrast, includes contributions from C4 and terminates at T1.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Prevertebral Fascia The fascia surrounding the nerve bundle of the brachial plexus is derived from the prevertebral fascia. This deep fascia originates from the cervical region and envelops the muscles associated with the vertebral column, such as the scalene muscles. As the brachial plexus emerges from the neck through the interscalene space (between the anterior and middle scalene muscles), the prevertebral fascia extends laterally to form a sheath around the plexus. This sheath provides structural support and protection to the nerves as they pass into the axilla. Incorrect Options: (B) Pretracheal Fascia The pretracheal fascia is located anteriorly in the neck and encloses structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and thyroid gland. It does not extend posteriorly or laterally to surround the brachial plexus, making it unrelated to the fascia of the nerve bundle. (C) Investing Layer The investing layer of deep cervical fascia is the most superficial layer of deep fascia and encircles the neck, enclosing the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. While it contributes to enclosing some superficial structures, it does not form the sheath for the brachial plexus. (D) Superficial Cervical Fascia The superficial cervical fascia is a layer of connective tissue that lies just beneath the skin and contains structures such as the platysma muscle. It does not extend to deeper structures like the brachial plexus and therefore does not form its fascia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Radial nerve. The radial nerve is the largest branch of the brachial plexus. It arises from the posterior cord and is formed by contributions from the C5 to T1 nerve roots. The radial nerve is responsible for motor innervation to the muscles of the posterior arm and forearm, including the triceps brachii, brachioradialis, and extensor muscles of the forearm. It also provides sensory innervation to much of the posterior arm, forearm, and hand. Due to its wide distribution and extensive motor and sensory functions, the radial nerve is considered the largest branch of the brachial plexus. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Ulnar nerve Incorrect The ulnar nerve is an important branch of the brachial plexus but is not the largest. It arises from the medial cord and innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand, as well as some forearm muscles. However, compared to the radial nerve, its distribution is smaller, making this option incorrect. B. Median nerve Incorrect The median nerve arises from both the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus and innervates most of the flexor muscles in the forearm and some intrinsic muscles in the hand. While it has a significant distribution, it is not the largest branch of the brachial plexus in terms of size or functional reach, making this option incorrect. D. Axillary nerve Incorrect The axillary nerve is a smaller branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. While important for shoulder movement, it is smaller in comparison to the radial nerve,",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Long thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve arises from the roots of the brachial plexus (C5, C6, and C7), which are considered supraclavicular branches because they emerge from the neck region above the clavicle. In contrast, the infraclavicular branches of the brachial plexus originate below the clavicle. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, which is involved in the protraction of the scapula. Since the long thoracic nerve is a root-level branch and not an infraclavicular branch, it is the correct answer to the question. Evaluation of Each Option: A. Ulnar nerve Incorrect The ulnar nerve is an infraclavicular branch of the brachial plexus. It originates from the medial cord and supplies the muscles of the forearm and hand, as well as providing sensory innervation to the ulnar side of the hand. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Axillary nerve Incorrect The axillary nerve is an infraclavicular branch of the brachial plexus. It arises from the posterior cord and innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles, as well as providing sensory innervation to the skin over the shoulder. Therefore, this option is incorrect. D. Thoracodorsal nerve Incorrect The thoracodorsal nerve is also an infraclavicular branch of the brachial plexus, arising from the posterior cord. It innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle, which is involved in movements such as adduction, extension, and internal rotation of the arm.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Erb's palsy. Policeman's tip hand is a characteristic deformity seen in Erb’s palsy, which results from an injury to the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5 and C6 nerve roots). This injury often occurs during birth (e.g., due to shoulder dystocia) or from trauma (e.g., a fall). The resultant nerve damage leads to weakness or paralysis in muscles innervated by C5 and C6 roots, including the deltoid, biceps, and brachialis muscles. As a result, the arm is held in an adducted, internally rotated position, with the forearm extended and pronated, which resembles the \"tip\" position of a policeman signaling \"stop,\" hence the term \"policeman's tip hand.\" Evaluation of Each Option: B. Klumpke’s paralysis Incorrect Klumpke’s paralysis results from injury to the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8 and T1), often caused by excessive traction on the arm during delivery or trauma. This condition causes paralysis of the intrinsic hand muscles, leading to a \"claw hand\" deformity rather than the policeman’s tip hand. It affects the small muscles of the hand but not the upper arm muscles in the way Erb's palsy does. C. Axillary nerve injury Incorrect An injury to the axillary nerve typically causes weakness or paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor muscles. However, it does not cause the characteristic position of the policeman's tip hand. Instead, there would be difficulty in shoulder abduction and a flattened shoulder contour due to deltoid weakness, making this option incorrect. D. None of the above Incorrect Since Erb’s palsy is the condition associated with policeman’s tip hand, option (A) is the correct answer,",

The teres minor is a rotator cuff muscle that helps with lateral (external) rotation of the arm and stabilizes the glenohumeral joint. The posterior cord primarily supplies muscles of the shoulder and posterior arm through its branches, including the axillary and radial nerves. Evaluation of Each Option: B. Pectoralis minor Incorrect The pectoralis minor is innervated by the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, which arise from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus, respectively. Since these nerves do not originate from the posterior cord, this option is incorrect. C. Coracobrachialis Incorrect The coracobrachialis is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, which arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. It is not supplied by the posterior cord, making this option incorrect. D.

Therefore, the median nerve has contributions from every root of the brachial plexus, making it unique in this aspect. Incorrect Responses: A. Axillary nerve: The axillary nerve arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, specifically carrying fibers from C5 and C6. It does not have contributions from all the roots of the brachial plexus, so it is not the correct answer. B. Ulnar nerve: The ulnar nerve is formed from the medial cord of the brachial plexus, primarily carrying fibers from C8 and T1.
