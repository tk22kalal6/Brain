      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The ligamentum flavum connects the lamina of two adjacent vertebrae and forms the posterior wall of the vertebral canal. It is the only choice that is in direct contact with the vertebral foramen.Therefore, hypertrophy of only the ligamentum flavum would present as spinal stenosis. The supraspinousand interspinous ligaments connect spinous processes. The anterior longitudinal ligament connects the anterior portion of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disks. Finally, the nuchal ligament is a thickened extension of the supraspinous ligament above the level of C7.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/qid 69914.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Transection of all dorsal rootlets of the nerves from the hip area is also known as a dorsal rhizotomy. This type of surgical procedure is performed to eliminate pain sensation from whichever dermatome level transected. Rami contain mixed fibres so their transection will lead to motor loss as well. Transecting sympathetic is not desirable because these contain visceral efferent and afferent fibres.",
