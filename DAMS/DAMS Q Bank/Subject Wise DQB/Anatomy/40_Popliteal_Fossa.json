      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Talipes equinovarus. Injury to the lateral popliteal nerve (also known as the common fibular nerve) can lead to a condition called talipes equinovarus, which is commonly known as clubfoot. The lateral popliteal nerve innervates the peroneal (fibular) muscles that control dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. When this nerve is damaged, it results in the inability to dorsiflex the foot, causing the foot to point downwards and inwards (plantarflexed and inverted position). This deformity is called talipes equinovarus. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Loss of sensation in sole: The sole of the foot is primarily innervated by the medial and lateral plantar nerves, which are branches of the tibial nerve. The lateral popliteal nerve does not supply sensation to the sole, so injury to this nerve would not cause loss of sensation in the sole. Therefore, option A is incorrect. B. Paralysis of sole muscles: The muscles of the sole (such as the flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus, and the intrinsic foot muscles) are innervated by the tibial nerve. The lateral popliteal nerve does not supply these muscles, so injury to the lateral popliteal nerve would not result in paralysis of sole muscles. Therefore, option B is incorrect. D. Talipes calcaneovalgus: Talipes calcaneovalgus is a deformity characterized by dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, which is typically caused by an imbalance in the muscles controlling the foot. Injury to the lateral popliteal nerve usually leads to equinus (downward pointing foot), not calcaneus (upward pointing foot). Therefore, option D is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) The common peroneal nerve passes superficially through the central portion of the popliteal fossa. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The common peroneal nerve does not pass superficially through the central portion of the popliteal fossa. Instead, it courses around the neck of the fibula, where it is more vulnerable to injury. In the popliteal fossa, the common peroneal nerve is actually found in a more superficial position along the lateral side, but it is not in the central portion. It runs along with the tibial nerve, but the tibial nerve is more centrally located, while the common peroneal nerve remains more lateral and superficial as it exits the fossa. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. The popliteal fossa is bounded above by tendons of the hamstring muscles and below by two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle: This statement is true. The popliteal fossa is a diamond-shaped area at the back of the knee. It is bordered above by the tendons of the semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles (part of the hamstring group) and below by the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. B. The deepest structure in the popliteal fossa is the popliteal artery: This statement is true. The popliteal artery is the deepest structure in the fossa, situated beneath the veins and nerves. It lies between the tibial nerve and the femur. C. The popliteal and femoral vessels are continuous through the adductor hiatus: This statement is true. The femoral artery and femoral vein become the popliteal artery and popliteal vein as they pass through the adductor hiatus in the adductor magnus muscle. This passage allows the vessels to transition from the anterior thigh into the posterior leg.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Semimembranosus. The oblique popliteal ligament is a strong fibrous structure in the posterior part of the knee joint. It is formed as an extension of the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle, which is one of the hamstring muscles. The semimembranosus tendon sends a fascial expansion obliquely across the posterior aspect of the knee joint to attach to the lateral condyle of the femur. This ligament plays a crucial role in reinforcing the posterior capsule of the knee joint, providing stability during movements and resisting hyperextension of the joint. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Semitendinosus: The semitendinosus muscle is another hamstring muscle, but it does not contribute to the formation of the oblique popliteal ligament. Its tendon primarily inserts into the pes anserinus region on the medial side of the tibia, helping in knee flexion and medial rotation of the tibia. C. Biceps femoris: The biceps femoris muscle is also part of the hamstring group, but it is located on the lateral side of the thigh. Its insertion is on the head of the fibula, and it plays a role in knee flexion and lateral rotation. It does not have any connection to the oblique popliteal ligament. D. Adductor magnus: The adductor magnus is a large muscle located in the medial compartment of the thigh. Its primary function is adduction of the thigh, and its tendinous part (adductor tubercle) forms part of the adductor hiatus for the passage of vessels. It does not contribute to the oblique popliteal ligament.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Tibial nerve. The popliteus muscle is innervated by the tibial nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve. The tibial nerve provides motor innervation to most of the muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg, including the popliteus muscle. The popliteus muscle plays an important role in the flexion and medial rotation of the knee joint, especially in unlocking the knee from full extension. It is located in the deep posterior compartment of the knee and is innervated specifically by the tibial nerve. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Femoral nerve: The femoral nerve supplies the muscles of the anterior thigh, such as the quadriceps, sartorius, and iliopsoas, but it does not supply the popliteus muscle. The femoral nerve does not innervate muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg, which includes the popliteus. B. Sciatic nerve: While the sciatic nerve is the parent nerve of the tibial nerve, it does not directly innervate the popliteus muscle. The sciatic nerve is a major nerve of the lower limb and branches into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. The popliteus is innervated by the tibial nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve. D. Peroneal nerve: The peroneal nerve (or fibular nerve) is responsible for innervating muscles in the lateral and anterior compartments of the leg, such as the fibularis muscles and the tibialis anterior, but it does not supply the popliteus muscle. The popliteus is innervated by the tibial nerve, which is a distinct branch of the sciatic nerve.",

Medial superior genicular artery: The medial superior genicular artery supplies the medial femoral condyle and parts of the medial side of the knee joint but does not pierce the oblique popliteal ligament.

Lateral superior genicular artery: The lateral superior genicular artery supplies the lateral femoral condyle and surrounding structures, but like the medial superior genicular artery, it does not pierce the oblique popliteal ligament. It is also located above the joint and does not pass through the ligament. Therefore, option B is incorrect. D.
