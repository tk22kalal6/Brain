      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Has branches that anastomose freely within the spleen. Explanation for the Correct Answer: C. Has branches that anastomose freely within the spleen: This statement is incorrect. While the splenic artery supplies blood to the spleen, its branches do not freely anastomose within the spleen. The branches of the splenic artery enter the spleen and form a series of branches that do not freely connect or form significant anastomoses. Instead, the blood supply to the spleen is divided into a series of end arteries that do not significantly anastomose with each other. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Has a tortuous course: The splenic artery does indeed have a tortuous course. It is known for its winding or twisted path, which is a distinctive characteristic as it travels along the upper border of the pancreas and towards the spleen. B. Is a branch of the celiac trunk: The splenic artery is a direct branch of the celiac trunk, which is the main arterial supply to many abdominal structures, including the spleen, stomach, and liver. D. Supplies the greater curvature of the stomach: The splenic artery gives off the left gastroepiploic artery, which supplies the greater curvature of the stomach. This is a true statement, as the left gastroepiploic artery is a major contributor to the blood supply of the stomach's greater curvature.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Gives short gastric arteries along the fundus. Explanation for the Correct Answer: B. Gives short gastric arteries along the fundus: The splenic artery gives off the short gastric arteries that supply the fundus of the stomach. These arteries are key branches that arise from the splenic artery as it travels towards the spleen. These branches provide blood to the upper part of the stomach (fundus). Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Smaller than left gastric artery: The splenic artery is actually larger than the left gastric artery. The splenic artery supplies a larger area, including the spleen, pancreas, and parts of the stomach, while the left gastric artery mainly supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach. C. Curves around the fundus: This statement is incorrect. The splenic artery does not curve around the fundus. It runs along the upper border of the pancreas and gives off branches such as the short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery, which supply the stomach. D. Arises from abdominal aorta: While the splenic artery does arise from the celiac trunk, not directly from the abdominal aorta. The celiac trunk is the direct branch of the abdominal aorta, but the splenic artery itself originates from the celiac trunk.",

The right gastroepiploic artery specifically supplies the right part of the greater curvature of the stomach and the omentum. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Right gastric artery: The right gastric artery is not a branch of the gastroduodenal artery. It typically arises from the common hepatic artery or directly from the proper hepatic artery, and it supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach. B. Left gastric artery: The left gastric artery is a branch of the celiac trunk, not the gastroduodenal artery. It supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach and the esophagus. C.

Has branches that anastomose freely within the spleen: This statement is incorrect because while the splenic artery does give rise to branches that supply the spleen, these branches do not freely anastomose. Instead, the branches are end arteries that do not form significant anastomoses with other arterial sources within the spleen, meaning that if any branch is occluded, it could result in localized ischemia of the spleen. Explanation for Incorrect Responses: A. Has a tortuous course: This statement is true. The splenic artery is known for its tortuous (twisting and turning) course as it travels along the superior border of the pancreas toward the spleen. This tortuosity is a characteristic feature of the artery. B. Is a branch of the coeliac trunk: This statement is true.

They supply the fundus and upper part of the greater curvature of the stomach. These arteries arise as the splenic artery passes through the hilum of the spleen. (B) Hilar Branches Hilar branches are direct branches of the splenic artery that supply the spleen. They enter the spleen at the hilum, providing the arterial supply to this organ.
