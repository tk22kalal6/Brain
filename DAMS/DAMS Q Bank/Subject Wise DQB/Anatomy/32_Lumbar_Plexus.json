      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Femoral nerve. The femoral nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus, arising from the L2, L3, and L4 spinal nerves. It is a mixed nerve, meaning it contains both sensory and motor fibers. The femoral nerve supplies motor innervation to the anterior compartment of the thigh, responsible for hip flexion and knee extension, and provides sensory innervation to the anterior and medial aspects of the thigh and leg. Its large size and the important functions it performs in both motor and sensory areas make it the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Sciatic nerve: The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body but is not a branch of the lumbar plexus. It originates from the lumbosacral plexus, specifically from the L4 to S3 spinal nerves. It is responsible for innervating the posterior thigh, lower leg, and foot, and although large, it is not part of the lumbar plexus. C. Obturator nerve: The obturator nerve arises from the L2, L3, and L4 spinal segments, similar to the femoral nerve, but it is smaller and innervates the medial compartment of the thigh, primarily responsible for hip adduction. While important, it is not the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. D. Pudendal nerve: The pudendal nerve is derived from the S2, S3, and S4 spinal nerves, not the lumbar plexus. It is involved in the sensory and motor innervation of the pelvic floor, genital organs, and perineum, but it is not a branch of the lumbar plexus, making it the incorrect option.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is not a branch of the lumbar plexus. It arises from both the lumbar and sacral plexus, specifically from the L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3 spinal nerve roots. While the lumbar plexus contributes to the formation of the sciatic nerve through the L4 and L5 roots, the majority of its fibers come from the sacral plexus. Therefore, option C is correct as the sciatic nerve is not exclusively a branch of the lumbar plexus. Reasons for Incorrect Options: A. Obturator nerve: The obturator nerve is a direct branch of the lumbar plexus, arising from the L2, L3, and L4 spinal nerves. It provides motor innervation to the adductor muscles of the thigh and sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the thigh. Therefore, option A is incorrect. B. Femoral nerve: The femoral nerve is also a branch of the lumbar plexus, specifically arising from the L2, L3, and L4 spinal nerves. It supplies the anterior thigh muscles and provides sensory innervation to the anterior and medial aspects of the thigh and lower leg. Therefore, option B is incorrect. D. Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh: The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, also known as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, is a branch of the lumbar plexus, arising from the L2 and L3 spinal nerves. It provides sensory innervation to the skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh.",
