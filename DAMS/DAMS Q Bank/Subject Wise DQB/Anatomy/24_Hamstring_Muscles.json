      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Adductor magnus is a hybrid muscle as the adductor and hamstring portions of the muscle are innervated by two different nerves. The adductor portion is innervated by the posterior division of the obturator nerve while the hamstring portion is innervated by the sciatic nerve.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Dorsiflexion of foot. Explanation: Compartment syndrome is a condition that occurs when there is increased pressure within a muscle compartment, leading to reduced blood flow and potential damage to muscles and nerves. The deep posterior compartment of the leg contains muscles such as the tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. In deep posterior compartment syndrome, dorsiflexion (pulling the foot upward) stretches the muscles in the compartment, increasing pressure and causing pain. This is a classic passive movement that can trigger pain in this syndrome. A. Foot abduction and D. Foot adduction: These movements do not typically involve the deep posterior compartment muscles in a way that would cause pain in compartment syndrome. C. Plantar flexion of foot: While plantar flexion does involve the posterior compartment muscles, it usually relieves the pressure in the compartment and does not exacerbate pain in this particular syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vastus intermedius. Explanation for the Correct Answer: The articularis genu is a small muscle that lies deep to the vastus intermedius, which is one of the muscles of the quadriceps femoris group. The primary function of the articularis genu is to prevent the synovial membrane of the knee joint from being pinched during knee extension by pulling the synovial membrane upward. This muscle is closely associated with the vastus intermedius due to its position deep to it. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Vastus lateralis: The vastus lateralis is located on the lateral side of the thigh, and although it is part of the quadriceps group, it is not anatomically related to the articularis genu. The vastus lateralis does not share the same location or function in relation to the knee joint synovial membrane. C. Vastus medialis: The vastus medialis is located on the medial side of the thigh and is part of the quadriceps group. Like the vastus lateralis, it does not have a direct relationship with the articularis genu, which is more closely associated with the vastus intermedius. D. Rectus femoris: The rectus femoris is one of the four quadriceps muscles, but it is situated on the anterior thigh and does not have a direct connection with the articularis genu, which is deep to the vastus intermedius.",
