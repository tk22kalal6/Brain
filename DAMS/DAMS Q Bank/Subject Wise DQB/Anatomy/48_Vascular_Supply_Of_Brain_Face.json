      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome), which occurs due to an ischemic event in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or one of its branches. PICA supplies the lateral aspect of the medulla and the cerebellum. The symptoms described—such as loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side of the face (due to the trigeminal nerve involvement) and on the left side of the body (due to spinothalamic tract involvement), ataxia, intention tremor, and hoarseness (due to vagus nerve involvement), as well as Horner’s syndrome (ptosis, pupillary constriction, and anhidrosis)—are characteristic of PICA stroke. This makes right PICA blockage the most likely cause of this patient's condition, as the affected side of the body and face corresponds with the lesion's location on the right side of the medulla. Option B (Left posterior inferior cerebellar artery) is incorrect because the left PICA would typically affect the left side of the body and face, leading to symptoms such as loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the face and body, and left-sided ataxia. However, in this case, the patient exhibits right-sided symptoms, so the lesion cannot be due to left PICA occlusion. Option C (Right anterior inferior cerebellar artery) is incorrect because the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) primarily supplies the anterior and inferior parts of the cerebellum and the pons. Occlusion of this artery typically leads to cerebellar signs such as ataxia and dysmetria, along with cranial nerve involvement (such as facial weakness, hearing loss), but it does not produce the classic symptoms of Wallenberg syndrome, such as the pattern of sensory loss, hoarseness, and Horner’s syndrome, as seen with a PICA stroke. Option D (Basilar artery) is incorrect because basilar artery occlusion would lead to a more widespread, often bilateral, brainstem syndrome with severe impairment of vital functions, such as breathing and consciousness. The signs would include more global involvement, including both sides of the body, and would not be confined to the unilateral deficits seen in this patient, making basilar artery occlusion an unlikely cause in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lateral to the external carotid At the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery is located lateral to the external carotid artery. The common carotid artery bifurcates into the internal and external carotid arteries, with the internal carotid artery positioned laterally and the external carotid artery more medially and anteriorly. This anatomical relationship is important for surgical procedures and understanding carotid artery anatomy. Incorrect Answers: B. Medial to external carotid This option is incorrect because the internal carotid artery is not medial to the external carotid artery. It is positioned laterally at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, not on the medial side. C. Post to external carotid This option is incorrect. The internal carotid artery is not posterior to the external carotid artery at the bifurcation. The external carotid is more anterior and medial compared to the internal carotid at the point of bifurcation. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Inferior anastomotic vein The Vein of Labbé, also known as the inferior anastomotic vein, is a venous structure that provides an anastomosis between the superficial middle cerebral vein and the transverse sinus. It plays an important role in the venous drainage of the brain, particularly in the lower part of the cerebral hemisphere. The vein runs along the lateral surface of the brain and connects the superficial venous system to deeper venous structures. This anastomotic vein is crucial in maintaining venous drainage, especially in cases of pathologies that alter normal venous flow. Hence, option B is correct. Incorrect Answers: A. Superior anastomotic vein The superior anastomotic vein (also known as the vein of Trolard) connects the superior cerebral veins with the superficial middle cerebral vein. It is not the same as the Vein of Labbé, which is an inferior anastomotic vein. Therefore, option A is incorrect. C. Superior cerebral vein The superior cerebral veins drain the superior parts of the cerebral hemisphere and empty into the superior sagittal sinus. However, the Vein of Labbé is not a superior cerebral vein, but an inferior anastomotic vein connecting the superficial middle cerebral vein to the transverse sinus. Hence, option C is incorrect. D. Superficial middle cerebral vein The superficial middle cerebral vein is one of the main veins of the brain, draining the lateral aspects of the cerebral hemisphere. While the Vein of Labbé does connect to the superficial middle cerebral vein, it is not the vein itself.",

It originates from the vertebral artery, which itself is a branch of the subclavian artery. The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior portion of the spinal cord and is crucial for maintaining its blood supply. Incorrect responses: A. Internal Carotid artery: The internal carotid artery is primarily responsible for supplying blood to the brain, particularly to the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries. It does not give rise to the anterior spinal artery, which comes from the vertebral artery. B. Basilar artery: The basilar artery forms from the fusion of the two vertebral arteries at the base of the skull. While it supplies the brainstem and other structures, it does not give rise to the anterior spinal artery, which is a branch of the vertebral artery before they merge to form the basilar artery. D.

Incorrect responses: A. IVC (Inferior Vena Cava): The inferior vena cava (IVC) collects blood from the lower body and returns it to the heart, but it is not directly related to the drainage of the vein of Galen. The vein of Galen drains into the venous sinuses of the brain, not the IVC. C. Superior sagittal sinus: The superior sagittal sinus is a major venous sinus that runs along the top of the skull and drains into the confluence of sinuses. However, the vein of Galen drains into the straight sinus, not the superior sagittal sinus. D.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Buccinator. Explanation: The buccinator muscle is not innervated by the trigeminal nerve. Instead, it is supplied by the facial nerve (CN VII). The buccinator is a muscle of facial expression that is responsible for compressing the cheek, which aids in actions like blowing and chewing. Therefore, the correct response is B, as the trigeminal nerve does not innervate the buccinator muscle. Why the other options are incorrect: A. Masseter The masseter is a muscle of mastication that is innervated by the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve. The masseter plays a key role in the elevation of the mandible for chewing. Therefore, the trigeminal nerve does supply the masseter muscle, making option A incorrect. C. Anterior belly of digastric The anterior belly of the digastric muscle is also innervated by the trigeminal nerve, specifically by a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), the mylohyoid nerve. This muscle plays a role in depressing the mandible and elevating the hyoid bone. Therefore, the trigeminal nerve does supply the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, making option C incorrect. D. Lateral Pterygoid The lateral pterygoid is another muscle of mastication that is innervated by the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal nerve. It is responsible for the movement of the jaw during chewing, including the protrusion and lateral movements of the mandible.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Superior sagittal sinus. Explanation: The superior cerebral veins primarily drain into the superior sagittal sinus. These veins collect blood from the cortical areas of the brain and carry it towards the superior sagittal sinus, which runs along the midline of the brain, inside the dura mater. The superior sagittal sinus is one of the major dural venous sinuses and ultimately drains into the confluence of sinuses at the back of the head. This makes the superior sagittal sinus the correct drainage point for the superior cerebral veins. Why the other options are incorrect: Great cerebral vein (Option A) The great cerebral vein (also called the vein of Galen) is a deep venous structure formed by the union of the internal cerebral veins. It drains into the straight sinus, not the superior sagittal sinus. While the great cerebral vein is closely related to venous drainage in the brain, it is not the destination for the superior cerebral veins, making this option incorrect. Vein of Galen (Option B) The vein of Galen is another name for the great cerebral vein, and it collects blood from deep brain structures.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Superior petrosal sinus. Explanation: The superior petrosal sinus is not a tributary of the cavernous sinus. Instead, it acts as a drainage pathway, carrying blood away from the cavernous sinus to the transverse sinus. It is a connection between the cavernous sinus and the posterior venous system, but it does not contribute blood directly to the cavernous sinus. This role as an efferent venous structure rather than an afferent tributary distinguishes it from the other options. Why the other options are incorrect: Sphenoparietal sinus (Option A) The sphenoparietal sinus is a tributary of the cavernous sinus. It runs along the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone and empties directly into the anterior aspect of the cavernous sinus, contributing to its venous blood flow. Superficial middle cerebral vein (Option C) The superficial middle cerebral vein is a tributary of the cavernous sinus, either directly or indirectly via the sphenoparietal sinus or basal vein. This vein drains blood from the lateral surface of the brain into the venous system, including the cavernous sinus. Inferior ophthalmic vein (Option D) The inferior ophthalmic vein is also a tributary of the cavernous sinus.
