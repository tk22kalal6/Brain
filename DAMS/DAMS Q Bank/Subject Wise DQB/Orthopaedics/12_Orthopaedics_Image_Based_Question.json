Chance fracture is also known as seat-belt injury or the jack- knife injury. This injury is typically located in the upper lumbar spine in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing a lap seat belt without a shoulder harness. The sudden deceleration causes flexion and posterior distraction of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axis anterior to the vertebral column.",
