      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Option A-Most common nerve injury involved in intramuscular injection injury is sciatic nerve > radial nerve and the type of palsy is neurotmesis.A neurotmesis injury can occur at different levels. A 3rd-degree neurotmesis injury is the disruption of the axon and endoneurium. when this occurs the perineurium and epineurium remain intact. Disruption of the axon and perineurium is considered a 4th-degree injury. And a complete disruption of the entire nerve trunk is classified as a 5th-degree injury. Option B-Neuropraxia:-This type of nerve injury is usually secondary to compression pathology. This is the mildest form of peripheral nerve injury with minimal structural damage. This allows for a complete and relatively short recovery period. In a neuropraxic injury, a focal segment of the nerve is demyelinated at the site of injury with no injury or disruption to the axon or its surroundings. Option C-Axonotmesis:-An axonotmesis injury involves damage to the axon and its myelin sheath. However, the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium remain intact. This type of nerve injury also results in a complete recovery although it does take longer than a neuropraxic injury.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Tinel's test is used to test for compression neuropathy, commonly in diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome.It is performed by lightly tapping (percussing) over the nerve to elicit a sensation of tingling or \"pins and needles\" in the distribution of the nerve.The Tinel sign is the tingling or prickling sensation elicited by the percussion of an injured nerve trunk at or distal to the site of the lesion. The sign also indicates nerve regeneration. Positive test: The test is positive when a tingling or prickling sensation is felt in the distribution of the nerve. hence,Tinel’s sign is used to assess the recovery after nerve injury.<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Ortho46.jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",
