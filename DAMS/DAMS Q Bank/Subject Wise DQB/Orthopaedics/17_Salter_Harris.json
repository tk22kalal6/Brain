Type I fractures are due to the longitudinal force applied through the physis which splits the epiphysis from the metaphysis. Type II extends through the metaphysis and the growth plate. There is no involvement of the epiphysis. This is the most common of the Salter-Harris fractures. Type III is an intra-articular fracture through the growth plate and the epiphysis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) • In type II Salter Harris fracture, Metaphyseal fragment is known as “Thurston Holland fragment”. Type I is a fracture through the growth plate. The fracture line extends through the physis or within the growth plate. Type I fractures are due to the longitudinal force applied through the physis which splits the epiphysis from the metaphysis. Type II extends through the metaphysis and the growth plate. There is no involvement of the epiphysis. This is the most common of the Salter-Harris fractures. Type III is an intra-articular fracture through the growth plate and the epiphysis. This is rare and when it does occur, it is usually at the distal end of the tibia. If the fracture extends the complete length of the physis, this type of fracture may form two epiphyseal segments. Since the epiphysis is involved, damage to the articular cartilage may occur. One example of this is a Tillaux fracture of the ankle, which is a fracture of the anterolateral aspect of the growth plate andepiphysis. Type IV extends through the epiphysis, the growth plate and the metaphysis.
