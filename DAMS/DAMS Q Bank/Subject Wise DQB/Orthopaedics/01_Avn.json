      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Avascular necrosis (AVN), also known as osteonecrosis, is a condition resulting from the temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to a bone. This lack of blood flow causes the bone tissue to die, leading to collapse of the bone. The susceptibility of a bone part to AVN is largely dependent on its vascular supply, particularly if it relies on a few end-arteries with limited collateral circulation, making it vulnerable to ischemia if these vessels are damaged. The femoral neck (C) itself is generally not considered prone to AVN in the same way as its more distal counterpart, the femoral head. While fractures of the femoral neck can disrupt blood supply to the femoral head, leading to AVN of the head, the neck bone itself typically has a more robust blood supply from multiple arteries, making primary AVN of the neck itself less common. Let's examine why the other options are prone to AVN: A. Proximal scaphoid: The scaphoid bone in the wrist has a precarious blood supply, with the primary blood flow entering distally and then traveling proximally. The proximal pole of the scaphoid is particularly vulnerable to AVN if the blood supply is disrupted, typically due to a fracture through the waist of the scaphoid. This is why non-union and AVN are significant complications of scaphoid fractures. B. Body of talus: The talus bone in the ankle has a somewhat limited and tenuous blood supply, particularly to its body, which is mostly covered by articular cartilage and receives blood from various anastomosing arteries. Fractures of the talar neck or body can significantly disrupt this blood flow, making the body of the talus highly susceptible to AVN. D. Femoral head: The femoral head is highly susceptible to AVN. Its blood supply comes from several arteries that are vulnerable to disruption, especially after trauma (e.g., femoral neck fractures or dislocations of the hip). Non-traumatic causes like corticosteroid use or alcohol abuse also commonly lead to AVN of the femoral head due to impaired blood flow or cellular processes within the bone. The reliance on limited, terminal arteries makes it a classic site for AVN.",
