      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Type I. Explanation for Correct Answer (B): In the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) classification system, submucous fibroids are categorized based on the extent of their projection into the uterine cavity. A Type I submucous fibroid is defined as a fibroid where more than 50% of the fibroid's bulk is within the uterine cavity but the remaining portion is still embedded in the myometrium. This classification is clinically important because Type I fibroids can significantly impact fertility and menstrual symptoms. They are also amenable to hysteroscopic removal due to their intracavitary component. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Type 0: A Type 0 submucous fibroid is entirely within the uterine cavity without any myometrial involvement. These fibroids are pedunculated and protrude fully into the cavity, making them different from Type I fibroids. C. Type II: A Type II submucous fibroid is primarily embedded in the myometrium, with less than 50% of the fibroid protruding into the uterine cavity. These fibroids are more challenging to treat hysteroscopically compared to Type I. D. Type III: A Type III fibroid does not have any portion of its bulk within the uterine cavity but is in close contact with the endometrium. These fibroids are classified as intramural rather than submucous.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) A broad ligament fibroid is a rare type of uterine leiomyoma that grows in the broad ligament, the peritoneal fold that connects the sides of the uterus to the pelvic wall. The ureter runs in close proximity to the broad ligament, making it the most critical structure to consider when managing a broad ligament fibroid. Compression of the ureter by the fibroid can lead to hydronephrosis, obstruction, or damage during surgical removal. The anatomical relationship of the ureter to the broad ligament is crucial during surgical interventions, as inadvertent injury to the ureter can lead to significant morbidity. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Ovaries: The ovaries are located near the broad ligament but are not directly related to the development or complications of a broad ligament fibroid. While fibroids may displace the ovaries, they are not anatomically or functionally connected to the fibroid. B. Fallopian tube: The fallopian tubes are associated with the broad ligament through the mesosalpinx, a subdivision of the broad ligament. However, broad ligament fibroids typically do not directly impact the fallopian tubes. Displacement may occur, but they are not a primary concern in this context. D. Gartner’s duct: Gartner’s duct is a vestigial remnant of the Wolffian duct, located near the lateral vaginal wall. It is not related to the broad ligament or fibroid development. Gartner’s duct cysts are unrelated to uterine fibroids.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hyaline degeneration Explanation for Correct Answer (B): Hyaline degeneration is the most common type of degeneration seen in uterine fibroids, accounting for approximately 60% of cases. In this type of degeneration, the smooth muscle cells in the fibroid are replaced by an amorphous, eosinophilic hyaline material. It occurs due to a reduction in blood supply, leading to fibrotic changes. This process is generally asymptomatic and detected incidentally during imaging or histopathological examination after surgical removal of the fibroid. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Red degeneration: Red degeneration (also called carneous degeneration) is most commonly associated with pregnancy, occurring due to acute ischemia and necrosis of the fibroid caused by rapid growth and increased vascular demand. While it is a well-known type of degeneration, it is less common compared to hyaline degeneration and typically presents with acute abdominal pain during pregnancy. C. Calcific degeneration: Calcific degeneration occurs when calcium deposits form within a fibroid, often as a late-stage process in postmenopausal women. It is not as common as hyaline degeneration and is generally a chronic process. D. Malignant transformation: Malignant transformation of a fibroid into leiomyosarcoma is exceedingly rare, occurring in less than 0.5% of cases. While it is a concern, it is not considered a common degeneration type.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Placenta previa Explanation for Correct Answer (D): Placenta previa is not directly associated with fibroids. Placenta previa refers to the abnormal implantation of the placenta over the cervical os, which is primarily related to conditions like previous cesarean sections, uterine surgeries, or a history of placenta previa itself. Although fibroids may distort the uterine cavity and alter implantation sites, they are not a common cause of placenta previa. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Red degeneration: Red degeneration is a well-known complication of fibroids during pregnancy, particularly in the second trimester. It occurs due to rapid growth and ischemia of the fibroid caused by hormonal changes and increased vascular demand during pregnancy. This can cause acute abdominal pain and tenderness. B. Obstructed labor: Fibroids, especially large or lower-segment fibroids, can obstruct the birth canal and lead to obstructed labor. This is a significant complication when fibroids are located in positions that interfere with the descent of the fetus. C. PPH (Postpartum Hemorrhage): Fibroids can interfere with uterine contractions and increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Poor uterine contractility due to fibroids leads to retained placenta and increased bleeding after delivery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) CT scanning is an alternative to MRI. Correct Response: (D) CT scanning is an alternative to MRI CT scanning is not considered an alternative to MRI for imaging uterine fibroids. MRI is superior in providing detailed images of the uterus and is particularly helpful in identifying the exact location, size, and characteristics of fibroids. CT scans have limited utility in gynecological imaging and are generally not recommended for diagnosing or evaluating uterine fibroids due to poor soft tissue resolution compared to MRI. Incorrect Responses: (A) Ultrasound is ideal to confirm the diagnosis Ultrasound (USG), particularly transvaginal ultrasound, is the first-line imaging modality for confirming the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. It is widely available, cost-effective, and highly accurate in detecting and assessing fibroids. (B) Saline Infusion Sonography (SIS) is more sensitive to detect any submucous fibroid Saline Infusion Sonography (SIS), a specialized ultrasound technique, enhances the visualization of the uterine cavity by introducing saline into the cavity. This makes it more sensitive for detecting submucous fibroids and assessing their impact on the endometrial cavity. (C) MRI is superior to USG to identify the exact location of myoma MRI is indeed superior to USG in accurately identifying the location, size, and type of fibroids. It provides high-resolution images and is particularly useful in complex cases, such as distinguishing fibroids from other pelvic masses or evaluating fibroids prior to surgery.",

Correct Response: (B) Myoma screw The myoma screw is a specialized surgical instrument used during procedures such as myomectomy to extract fibroids (myomas). It features a screw-like tip that allows the surgeon to grasp and manipulate the fibroid securely for easier dissection and removal. It is especially useful for mobilizing larger or deeply located fibroids. This tool helps in reducing tissue trauma and improving surgical precision. Incorrect Responses: (A) Myoma clamp A myoma clamp is another surgical instrument used during myomectomy but is different from a myoma screw. The clamp is used to grasp and hold fibroids or uterine tissue during the procedure. Unlike the screw, it does not have a spiral tip and is less effective for deep or embedded fibroids. (C) Uterine manipulator A uterine manipulator is a surgical instrument used during laparoscopic gynecological procedures to move and stabilize the uterus, providing better visualization of pelvic structures. It does not have a screw-like tip and is not used specifically for fibroid removal.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Hysteroscopic myomectomy. Correct Response: (C) Hysteroscopic myomectomy Hysteroscopic myomectomy is the best treatment option for a submucosal fibroid, particularly in a woman with heavy menstrual bleeding and a desire to preserve fertility. Submucosal fibroids are located within the uterine cavity, and hysteroscopy allows direct visualization and precise removal of the fibroid with minimal invasiveness. It preserves the uterus and reduces symptoms such as heavy bleeding, making it the most suitable choice in this case. The patient’s hemoglobin level (10.5 g/dL) indicates mild anemia, which is expected in cases of heavy bleeding but can be managed without extensive surgical procedures. Incorrect Responses: (A) GnRH injection GnRH analogs can temporarily reduce the size of fibroids and control bleeding by inducing a hypoestrogenic state. However, this is not a definitive treatment. Fibroid size reduction is temporary, and the symptoms typically recur once the therapy is stopped. It is not a curative approach, especially for a young patient with a single submucosal fibroid. (B) UAE (Uterine Artery Embolization) UAE is an effective treatment for reducing fibroid size and controlling bleeding, but it is typically reserved for patients who do not desire future fertility. The procedure can impact uterine and ovarian blood supply, potentially compromising fertility. This makes it less ideal for this patient. (D) Laparoscopic myomectomy Laparoscopic myomectomy is a minimally invasive surgical option for intramural or subserosal fibroids, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for a submucosal fibroid. Submucosal fibroids are better addressed through hysteroscopic techniques, which directly access the uterine cavity without requiring abdominal intervention. (E) TAH (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy) TAH is a definitive treatment for fibroids and eliminates the possibility of recurrence, but it is inappropriate for a young woman with a single fibroid and a desire to preserve fertility. This approach is overly aggressive given the patient’s clinical scenario.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) • Adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium. • It causes the uterus to become diffusely enlarged, but not to the extent of forming a palpable abdominal lump. • The enlargement is typically boggy, symmetrical, and mild to moderate, usually confined to the pelvis. • A palpable abdominal lump suggests much larger masses, like fibroids, not adenomyosis. Option A: Menorrhagia – True Heavy menstrual bleeding is a classic symptom due to increased surface area of endometrial tissue and poor contractility of the uterus. Option B: Infertility – True Though less common than in endometriosis, adenomyosis can affect fertility, possibly due to inflammation or interference with implantation. Option C: Dysmenorrhea – True Painful menstruation is a very common symptom, often progressive and severe, due to trapped endometrial tissue bleeding into the myometrium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Histopathology. (C) Histopathology Histopathological examination is the gold standard for diagnosing adenomyosis. This involves taking a biopsy of the uterine tissue, which can reveal the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium (muscular layer of the uterus). Since adenomyosis is characterized by the invasion of the endometrial lining into the uterine muscle, histopathology provides the most definitive diagnosis. However, this is typically done after a hysterectomy, as biopsy during routine examinations is not always feasible. Incorrect Responses: (A) MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI is highly accurate in diagnosing adenomyosis, with sensitivity and specificity ranging between 85-95%. It can provide detailed images of the uterus and detect characteristic signs of adenomyosis, such as asymmetric uterine enlargement, myometrial cysts, and junctional zone thickening. MRI is often used when non-invasive diagnostic methods are needed and is considered an excellent imaging modality for suspected adenomyosis. However, it is not the \"gold standard\" since histopathology remains definitive. (B) USG (Ultrasound) Ultrasound is commonly used as an initial imaging modality due to its accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to identify signs of adenomyosis. Features such as an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus, myometrial cysts, and heterogeneous myometrial echotexture can suggest adenomyosis. However, ultrasound has a lower sensitivity and specificity compared to MRI, and it is not considered the gold standard for diagnosis. (D) Saline infusion sonography (SIS) Saline infusion sonography (SIS) is an advanced ultrasound technique where sterile saline is injected into the uterine cavity to enhance visualization. While it can improve the detection of intrauterine abnormalities like fibroids or polyps, it is not particularly useful for diagnosing adenomyosis. The technique cannot adequately visualize the myometrium or the presence of endometrial glands within the uterine muscle, making it less effective for this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Endometrial polyp. Correct Response: (C) Endometrial polyp Endometrial polyps are common benign growths that develop from the endometrial lining. They can present with symptoms such as intermenstrual bleeding, which is typically described as fresh red blood, as seen in this patient. The absence of pain, normal uterine size, and non-tender bimanual examination also support the possibility of an endometrial polyp. Ultrasound is often used to identify these polyps, as they appear as localized thickening of the endometrial lining, sometimes with a stalk or pedunculated mass. These polyps can cause bleeding but are not usually associated with significant pain or uterine enlargement, making them a likely diagnosis in this case. Incorrect Responses: (A) Cervical cancer Cervical cancer can cause abnormal bleeding, including intermenstrual bleeding, but it is often associated with other symptoms such as pain, vaginal discharge, or a visible cervical lesion on speculum examination. In this case, the speculum examination showed a slightly atrophic-looking vagina and cervix without apparent cervical lesions, which makes cervical cancer less likely. Additionally, the patient does not have risk factors such as HPV infection or smoking that would strongly suggest cervical cancer. Hence, cervical cancer is not the most likely diagnosis. (B) Atrophic vaginitis Atrophic vaginitis is common in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women due to the decline in estrogen levels. It typically presents with vaginal dryness, itching, and sometimes bleeding. However, the bleeding associated with atrophic vaginitis is usually light and intermittent, and the examination would often show a pale, dry, and thin vaginal mucosa. While this patient has some atrophic changes in the vagina and cervix, the presentation of fresh red bleeding without associated pain, and normal-sized uterus, is more indicative of an endometrial source of bleeding, not atrophic vaginitis. (D) Submucosal fibroid Submucosal fibroids are fibroids located just under the inner lining of the uterus and can cause abnormal bleeding. However, the bleeding associated with submucosal fibroids is often more irregular and heavier, and these fibroids may cause enlargement or tenderness of the uterus on bimanual examination. In this case, the patient has a normal-sized uterus and no tenderness, which makes submucosal fibroids less likely. Additionally, ultrasound would likely show a well-defined mass if a fibroid were present, which doesn't appear to be the case here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Adenomyosis. Correct Response: (B) Adenomyosis Adenomyosis is a condition where the endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus. It commonly presents with symptoms of heavy, painful periods (dysmenorrhea) and prolonged menstrual bleeding. This patient describes heavy and painful periods that have worsened over the last 2-3 years, along with a bulky, tender uterus on bimanual examination, which is typical of adenomyosis. The ultrasound image is likely to show an enlarged, soft uterus with areas of heterogeneity in the myometrial layer, suggesting the presence of endometrial tissue within the muscle. This is consistent with the diagnosis of adenomyosis, a common cause of such symptoms in women of reproductive age or perimenopausal women. Incorrect Responses: (A) Endometriosis Endometriosis is another condition associated with painful periods, but it typically causes pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and sometimes infertility. Endometriosis lesions are usually found on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum, not within the muscular layer of the uterus as in adenomyosis. Additionally, while endometriosis can cause heavy periods, the patient's primary symptoms (bulky uterus, tenderness, and heavy bleeding) are more indicative of adenomyosis rather than endometriosis, especially given the normal bimanual findings and lack of adnexal masses. (C) Fibroid Fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus that can also cause heavy bleeding and pain. However, fibroids typically present with a discrete, firm, palpable mass on bimanual examination, and they may cause an irregularly enlarged uterus. While fibroids can cause heavy periods, the \"bulky\" and \"soft\" description of the uterus in this patient, along with the tenderness and lack of a palpable fibroid mass, makes adenomyosis a more likely diagnosis. Ultrasound would typically show well-defined masses in fibroids, which is not described here. (D) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) PID is an infection of the reproductive organs and can cause pelvic pain, fever, abnormal discharge, and tenderness. However, PID usually presents with more acute symptoms, including fever, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness, which were not observed in this patient. Additionally, the ultrasound image would typically show signs of infection, such as tubo-ovarian abscesses, free fluid, or thickened fallopian tubes, which are not consistent with this patient's presentation. The lack of fever and other acute signs makes PID unlikely.",

Symptomatic disease primarily occurs in multiparous women over the age of 35 years, compared to endometriosis, in which onset is considerably younger. Patients with adenomyosis complain of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and the classical examination findings include a tender, symmetrically enlarged uterus without adnexal tenderness. Although patients with endometriosis can have similar complaints, the physical examination of these patients more commonly reveals a fixed, retroverted uterus, adnexal tenderness and scarring, and tenderness along the uterosacral ligaments. Leiomyoma is the most common pelvic tumor, but the majority are asymptomatic and the uterus is irregular in shape.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Submucosal fibroid. Correct Response: (B) Submucosal fibroid Submucosal fibroids are a common cause of heavy menstrual bleeding. These fibroids grow just beneath the lining of the uterus and can protrude into the uterine cavity, which often results in heavy menstrual bleeding and irregular periods. The hysteroscopic finding for a submucosal fibroid typically shows a smooth, well-defined mass protruding into the uterine cavity. This would explain the patient's presentation of heavy menstrual bleeding for the past 6 months. Hysteroscopy is an ideal tool for visualizing submucosal fibroids, as it allows direct visualization and evaluation of the size and location of the fibroid, helping to guide treatment decisions. Incorrect Responses: (A) Endometrial polyp Endometrial polyps are benign growths in the uterine lining and can also cause heavy bleeding. However, they usually present as a pedunculated or sessile mass arising from the endometrial lining. While hysteroscopy can identify endometrial polyps, they typically appear differently compared to fibroids. Polyps are often smaller and have a smoother appearance with a softer texture, whereas fibroids have a more firm and irregular appearance. The clinical history of heavy bleeding over a prolonged period may fit a polyp, but submucosal fibroids are more commonly associated with this pattern of heavy bleeding. (C) Endometrial cancer Endometrial cancer could cause abnormal bleeding, particularly in postmenopausal women or those with risk factors such as obesity or hormonal imbalances. However, the appearance of a submucosal fibroid on hysteroscopy would not be indicative of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer typically presents with irregular or postmenopausal bleeding, and hysteroscopy might reveal an irregular, friable endometrial surface with abnormal vascularity, which differs from the appearance of a submucosal fibroid. Furthermore, endometrial cancer is more likely to be suspected in women with risk factors like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. (D) Adenomyosis Adenomyosis occurs when the endometrial tissue invades the muscular wall of the uterus. It usually presents with heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea (painful periods), and a uniformly enlarged and tender uterus on bimanual examination. However, adenomyosis does not present as a discrete mass on hysteroscopy. The hysteroscopic finding in adenomyosis is typically absent or shows diffuse thickening or irregularity of the endometrial lining rather than a well-defined mass, which would be more indicative of a fibroid.",

They are present in about 30% of American women; most women with fibroids are asymptomatic and do not require therapy. Uterine myomas are hormonally responsive and grow in response to estrogen exposure. Therefore, during pregnancy a woman with fibroids may have an increase in size of these fibroids to the point where they outgrow their blood supply (carneous degeneration). In pregnancy, uterine fibroids can also be associated with fetal malpresentation due to distortion of the endometrial cavity, postpartum atony due to inability of the uterine muscle to contract normally after delivery, and preterm labor. Uterine leiomyosarcomas are smooth muscle malignancies characterized by more than 5 mitoses per 10 hpf. These malignancies are not thought to arise from benign fibroids but occur de novo.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) FIBROID is the most common pelvic benign tumour seen in females and is typically seen in wiomen beyond 35 years of age with highest prevalence between 35-45 years . it is a benign tumour with a very small risk of malignancy about less than 0.5% It is dependent on estrogen for growth and hence nulliparity leads to longer exposure to estrogen and is therefore is a risk factor for fibroids. GnRH analogues definitely cause shrinkage of fibroid but the fibroid shows regrowth after stopping the drug. Hence these drugs cannot be given for long duration also because they have significant hypoestrogenic state Most common presentation of fibroid is asymptomatic and only symptomatic fibroids needs to be treated.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Carneous degeneration. Correct Response: (C) Carneous degeneration Carneous degeneration (also known as red degeneration) is a type of fibroid degeneration that commonly occurs during pregnancy, especially in the second trimester. It is typically associated with fibroids that enlarge during pregnancy due to increased blood flow. This condition can present suddenly with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness of the uterus, as described in the patient. The pain is due to the ischemia or necrosis of the fibroid, which is a result of its increased size and the reduced blood supply. This is a known complication of fibroids during pregnancy, and the symptoms are often aggravated by uterine contractions. Incorrect Responses: (A) Ectopic pregnancy Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. It typically presents with abdominal pain, irregular bleeding, and sometimes signs of shock if rupture occurs. However, the patient's pregnancy is already confirmed to be intrauterine (as she is in her second trimester), making ectopic pregnancy an unlikely cause of her symptoms. The severe pain and uterine tenderness described here are more consistent with a complication related to the fibroids. (B) Ovarian torsion Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists around the supporting ligaments, cutting off its blood supply. This can cause sudden severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, ovarian torsion typically presents with unilateral lower abdominal pain and is often associated with ovarian cysts or masses, not fibroids. The patient's symptoms of uterine tenderness and the background of fibroid uterus make this diagnosis less likely. (D) Uterine sarcoma Uterine sarcoma is a rare and aggressive form of uterine cancer. It can present with abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, and an enlarged uterus. However, it typically does not cause the sudden onset of pain, nausea, and vomiting as seen in this patient. The absence of other signs of malignancy (like abnormal bleeding or a rapid increase in uterine size) makes uterine sarcoma an unlikely diagnosis in this case.",
