      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Resumed due to LH. Correct Response: Resumed due to LH (B) The resumption of Meiosis I in oocytes (egg cells) is primarily triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). During the menstrual cycle, the LH surge occurs just before ovulation and causes the resumption of meiosis in the oocyte that was arrested at prophase I. This surge in LH is a key factor in initiating the completion of Meiosis I, leading to the formation of a secondary oocyte and the arrest at metaphase II, until fertilization occurs. Thus, LH is the primary hormone responsible for resuming Meiosis I. Incorrect Responses: A. It is not hormone dependent (A) This statement is incorrect because the resumption of Meiosis I in oocytes is highly hormone-dependent. The hormonal regulation, particularly the rise in LH and FSH, is essential for the resumption of meiosis. Without these hormones, oocytes would remain arrested in prophase I. Therefore, the statement that it is \"not hormone dependent\" is incorrect. C. Resumed due to FSH (C) While follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) plays a crucial role in the early stages of follicular development, it is LH that specifically triggers the resumption of Meiosis I in the oocyte. FSH works more on promoting the growth and maturation of the ovarian follicle, but it does not directly resume meiosis. Hence, FSH is not the hormone responsible for the resumption of Meiosis I, making this option incorrect. D. Resumed due to GnRH (D) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is important for stimulating the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary, but it does not directly cause the resumption of Meiosis I. GnRH triggers the release of LH, and it is the LH surge that directly causes the resumption of meiosis in the oocyte.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mitotic division. Correct Response: Mitotic division (C) The primary oocyte is formed as a result of mitotic division of oogonia during fetal development. Oogonia are the germ cells in the ovaries that undergo several rounds of mitotic division to proliferate. Once they reach a certain stage of development, they enter meiosis but get arrested at prophase I, thus becoming primary oocytes. This arrest in meiosis occurs before the first meiotic division, and these primary oocytes will remain in this arrested state until puberty, when they resume meiosis. Therefore, the primary oocyte is formed after mitotic division. Incorrect Responses: A. 1st meiotic division (A) The first meiotic division does not result in the formation of a primary oocyte. The primary oocyte is formed earlier, during mitotic division of oogonia. After this division, the primary oocyte enters prophase I of meiosis, where it remains arrested until ovulation. Therefore, the first meiotic division occurs after the formation of the primary oocyte, making this option incorrect. B. 2nd meiotic division (B) The second meiotic division takes place after the primary oocyte has completed meiosis I. The oocyte completes meiosis I during ovulation, resulting in the formation of a secondary oocyte and the first polar body. The secondary oocyte is then arrested in metaphase II of meiosis, which will only be completed upon fertilization. The primary oocyte is formed before the second meiotic division, so this option is incorrect. D. None of the above (D) Since the primary oocyte is indeed formed after mitotic division of oogonia, this option is incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 1. Correct Response: 1 (A) Each primary oocyte undergoes meiosis to produce one mature ovum (egg). During the meiotic process, meiosis I results in the formation of a secondary oocyte and a polar body. The secondary oocyte continues through meiosis II but arrests in metaphase II until fertilization. Once fertilized, it completes meiosis II to produce one mature ovum and another polar body. Therefore, from one primary oocyte, only one viable ovum is produced, along with two non-functional polar bodies. This is why the correct answer is A. Incorrect Responses: B. 2 (B) Two viable ova are not produced from a single primary oocyte. While meiosis results in two cells, one is always a secondary oocyte and the other is a polar body, and the polar body does not contribute to the formation of a mature ovum. Thus, two viable eggs do not come from one primary oocyte, so this option is incorrect. C. 3 (C) In the process of oogenesis, three cells are produced, but only one of them becomes a viable ovum, and the other two are polar bodies. Therefore, three viable ova are not produced, making this option incorrect. D. 4 (D) Four cells are produced during oogenesis, but only one of them is a mature ovum, while the remaining three are polar bodies, which are non-functional. The number of viable ova from one primary oocyte is one, so four viable ova is not the correct outcome. This makes option D incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 26th day. Correct Response: C. 26th day In a typical 40-day menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs approximately 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. Since the cycle is 40 days long, ovulation would typically happen around day 26 of the cycle. This is because ovulation is determined by the length of the luteal phase, which remains relatively consistent at about 14 days, regardless of the overall cycle length. So, if the cycle is longer, ovulation will occur later, in this case, on the 26th day. Incorrect Responses: A. 14th day (A) Ovulation occurring on the 14th day is common for women with a 28-day menstrual cycle. However, in a 40-day cycle, ovulation would be expected later, around day 26, as the luteal phase length remains roughly constant at 14 days. So, ovulation on the 14th day does not apply to a 40-day cycle, making this option incorrect. B. 20th day (B) Ovulation on the 20th day would be too early for a 40-day cycle, as ovulation occurs closer to the 26th day. The timing of ovulation in a 40-day cycle typically aligns more with day 26, not day 20, which is why this option is incorrect. D. 30th day (D) Ovulation on the 30th day would be too late. Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days before the next period, which in a 40-day cycle would be around the 26th day, not the 30th. So, this option is also incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 8-9 days after ovulation. Correct Response: D. 8-9 days after ovulation The maximum function of the corpus luteum occurs around 8-9 days after ovulation. During this period, the corpus luteum reaches its peak secretion of progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining in preparation for a possible pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum begins to regress and its hormone production decreases. Incorrect Responses: A. At ovulation (A) Although the corpus luteum begins its formation immediately after ovulation, its maximum function (in terms of hormone production, primarily progesterone) is not reached at the time of ovulation. At ovulation, the dominant follicle ruptures, and ovulation occurs, but it takes a few days for the corpus luteum to mature and begin its full secretion of hormones. B. Before ovulation (B) The corpus luteum is not formed before ovulation. It is formed after the release of the egg during ovulation from the ruptured follicle. Therefore, the corpus luteum has no functional role before ovulation. C. 3 days after ovulation (C) While the corpus luteum starts producing hormones shortly after ovulation, it has not yet reached its maximum functional capacity at 3 days. The peak of progesterone secretion happens around 8-9 days after ovulation, not at 3 days.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Occurs 36 hours before ovulation. Correct Response: B. Occurs 36 hours before ovulation The LH surge (Luteinizing Hormone surge) is a key event in the menstrual cycle that triggers ovulation. It typically occurs approximately 36 hours before ovulation. This surge causes the final maturation of the egg and triggers its release from the ovary. The timing of the LH surge is critical for successful ovulation and fertility. Incorrect Responses: A. Occurs 12 hours before ovulation (A) While the LH surge is closely timed with ovulation, it does not occur as early as 12 hours before ovulation. It typically happens about 36 hours before ovulation, so this option is incorrect. C. Occurs 24 hours before ovulation (C) Although it is close, the LH surge does not occur exactly 24 hours before ovulation. The typical timing is around 36 hours, so this is an inaccurate estimate. D. Occurs 24 hours after ovulation (D) This statement is completely incorrect. The LH surge occurs before ovulation, not after.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Estrous cycle. Correct Response: C. Estrous cycle The estrous cycle is a reproductive cycle seen in many non-human mammals, in which animals go through periods of estrus or heat. This cycle is different from the menstrual cycle seen in humans, where menstruation (shedding of the endometrial lining) occurs if fertilization doesn't take place. In contrast, most animals with an estrous cycle reabsorb the endometrial lining rather than shedding it. Therefore, the estrous cycle is not directly related to the menstrual cycle in humans. Incorrect Responses: A. Hormonal changes (A) Hormonal changes are an essential component of the menstrual cycle. The fluctuations in levels of estrogen and progesterone control the various stages of the menstrual cycle, including the follicular phase, ovulation, luteal phase, and menstruation. Therefore, hormonal changes are very much related to the menstrual cycle. B. Vaginal cytology (B) Vaginal cytology involves the study of cells shed from the vaginal lining. In humans, this can be used to assess the phases of the menstrual cycle. For example, the appearance of epithelial cells varies during different phases of the cycle (follicular, ovulation, luteal phases). Therefore, vaginal cytology is related to the menstrual cycle. D. Endometrial sampling (D) Endometrial sampling involves collecting tissue from the lining of the uterus, often to assess its response to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. This is commonly used in clinical settings to assess the health of the endometrium and detect abnormalities. Therefore, endometrial sampling is related to the menstrual cycle.",

Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is well established where it originates in the endometrium and traverses the utero-ovarian vasculature to reach the corpus luteum. luteolytic effect of PGF2α acting to decrease perfusion of the corpus luteum, and vascular regression is observed in the aging corpus luteum. Estrogen has a luteolytic effect. The direct luteolytic action of estrogen esult from estrogen-induced increases of PGF2a production by luteal cells. Regression of the corpus luteum is accompanied by programmed cell death, or apoptosis",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Aromatase. Correct Response: B. Aromatase Granulosa cells in the ovaries produce estrogen through the action of the enzyme aromatase. Aromatase is responsible for converting androgens (like testosterone) into estrogens (like estradiol) in the granulosa cells. This is an essential process in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and in the development of female secondary sexual characteristics. Aromatase plays a crucial role in estrogen biosynthesis, making this the correct answer. Incorrect Responses: A. Alkaline phosphatase (A) Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme involved in various metabolic processes, including the breakdown of phosphate groups from molecules. However, it is not involved in estrogen production. Therefore, this option is incorrect. C. Acid phosphatase (C) Acid phosphatase is another enzyme that catalyzes the removal of phosphate groups from molecules, but it is primarily found in lysosomes and is not associated with estrogen production. Thus, this option is also incorrect. D. Glucuronidase (D) Glucuronidase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of glucuronic acid conjugates, which are often associated with the metabolism of various substances, including drugs. It does not play a role in the synthesis of estrogen.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 15 ng/ml. Correct Response: C. 15 ng/ml During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which follows ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes progesterone to prepare the endometrium for possible implantation of a fertilized egg. The peak plasma progesterone levels during this phase generally reach around 15 ng/ml. This surge in progesterone is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy if fertilization occurs. Incorrect Responses: A. 5 ng/ml (A) A plasma progesterone level of 5 ng/ml is below the typical peak seen during the luteal phase. While progesterone levels can fluctuate, this value is too low to reflect the peak of progesterone in the luteal phase, making this option incorrect. B. 10 ng/ml (B) A level of 10 ng/ml is still below the peak progesterone levels observed during the luteal phase. Although progesterone levels do rise after ovulation, they typically do not reach their maximum at 10 ng/ml, making this option incorrect as well. D. 30 ng/ml (D) A plasma progesterone level of 30 ng/ml would be unusually high for the luteal phase. While levels can vary slightly, typical levels peak at around 15 ng/ml.

The completion of Meiosis II occurs after fertilization, where the oocyte completes the second meiotic division only if fertilization happens. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. The second meiotic division does not require the same hormonal regulation that Meiosis I does during oocyte maturation before ovulation. Incorrect Responses: A. LH surge is initiated due to sustained levels of 200 pg of estrogen for 48 hours (A) This statement is correct. The LH surge is indeed triggered by a sustained increase in estrogen levels (around 200 pg/ml) for about 48 hours. This is a well-known phenomenon in the hormonal regulation of ovulation, where a positive feedback loop of estrogen on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland leads to the LH surge, which induces ovulation. B. LH surge is maintained by estrogen and progesterone both (B) This statement is correct. The LH surge is not only triggered by high levels of estrogen, but it is also maintained through the combined effects of estrogen and progesterone. After the initial surge, progesterone levels increase, and together with estrogen, they continue to support the luteal phase and prevent further ovulations during the current cycle. C. Meiosis I is hormone dependent (C) This statement is correct. Meiosis I in the female oocyte is hormone-dependent, specifically under the control of FSH and LH. These hormones regulate the process of oocyte maturation and the completion of the first meiotic division, which is necessary for ovulation to occur.",

Prostaglandin released at the time of menstruation is PGE2 This statement is incorrect. The primary prostaglandin released during menstruation is PGE2 for causing uterine contractions, but PGF2? is typically considered to play the most significant role in menstruation and uterine contractions. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2?) is largely responsible for the painful uterine contractions that occur during menstruation. While PGE2 does play a role, PGF2? is the more dominant prostaglandin in the process of shedding the uterine lining and causing pain. Incorrect Responses: A. Menstrual blood is mainly arterial (A) This statement is correct. The blood lost during menstruation is primarily arterial, as it originates from the breakdown of blood vessels in the uterine lining. The menstrual flow typically consists of blood from small arteries in the endometrial lining, which are disrupted during menstruation. C. Zona basalis regenerates the endometrium during the next cycle (C) This statement is correct. The zona basalis, which is the deeper part of the endometrium, plays a critical role in regenerating the endometrial tissue during the next menstrual cycle. This regenerative capacity ensures that the functional layer of the endometrium, which is shed during menstruation, is replaced in preparation for potential pregnancy. D. Anovulatory cycles are painless (D) This statement is incorrect. Anovulatory cycles, or cycles in which ovulation does not occur, can still be painful. The lack of ovulation often leads to hormonal imbalances, and these cycles can be associated with symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, pain, and discomfort, similar to normal menstrual cycles.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Anovulatory infertility. Correct Response: D. Anovulatory infertility Pulsatile GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) is used in the treatment of anovulatory infertility. In women with anovulatory infertility, GnRH is administered in a pulsatile manner to mimic the natural secretion of GnRH, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinizing Hormone). This helps in the induction of ovulation, which is crucial for fertility. Pulsatile GnRH therapy is commonly used in women who have hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to anovulation. It helps to restore the normal cyclical release of gonadotropins, thus stimulating ovulation and improving fertility. Incorrect Responses: A. Precocious puberty (A) This statement is incorrect. In the case of precocious puberty, treatment typically involves the use of GnRH analogs (agonists) in a continuous form, not pulsatile. The goal of using continuous GnRH analogs is to suppress the early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and delay further sexual maturation until the appropriate age. Pulsatile GnRH is not used in this scenario. B. Fibroid (B) This statement is incorrect. Fibroids, or uterine leiomyomas, are not directly managed by pulsatile GnRH therapy. However, GnRH analogs (in a continuous form) can be used to reduce fibroid size by inducing a temporary menopause-like state, which lowers estrogen levels. Pulsatile GnRH is not indicated for fibroids treatment. C. DUB (Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) (C) This statement is incorrect. DUB (Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) is typically managed with hormonal treatments like oral contraceptives, progestins, or GnRH analogs, but pulsatile GnRH is not a first-line treatment. Pulsatile GnRH may be used in some cases of DUB related to anovulation, but it is not the primary treatment for this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer C Enhanced by Estrogen and inhibited by Progesterone. Correct Response: C. Enhanced by Estrogen and inhibited by Progesterone This statement is correct. The sensitivity of uterine musculature (the myometrium) to stimuli, particularly oxytocin, is influenced by the balance of estrogen (E) and progesterone (P). Estrogen increases the sensitivity of the uterine muscle to oxytocin, promoting uterine contractions, which is important for labor and menstruation. On the other hand, progesterone has an inhibitory effect on the uterine muscles, reducing their responsiveness to stimuli and preventing contractions during pregnancy. Thus, estrogen enhances uterine sensitivity, while progesterone inhibits it. Incorrect Responses: A. Enhanced by Estrogen This statement is partially correct, but it is incomplete. While estrogen does enhance the sensitivity of the uterine musculature to stimuli like oxytocin, progesterone has the opposite effect by inhibiting uterine contractions. Therefore, this response overlooks the role of progesterone and does not fully explain the balance required for uterine function. B. Enhanced by Progesterone This statement is incorrect. While progesterone is important for maintaining pregnancy by reducing uterine contractions, it does not enhance the sensitivity of uterine musculature. In fact, progesterone decreases uterine muscle responsiveness, making this answer incorrect. D. Enhanced by Progesterone and inhibited by Estrogen This statement is incorrect. It mistakenly suggests that progesterone enhances uterine muscle sensitivity and that estrogen inhibits it. In reality, progesterone inhibits uterine muscle sensitivity, while estrogen enhances it, making this response reversed and incorrect.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) E2-E1-E3. Explanation for Correct Answer (B): Estradiol (E2) is the most potent and biologically active form of estrogen. It plays the primary role in regulating the menstrual cycle and reproductive functions. Estrone (E1) is weaker in its effects compared to estradiol but still contributes to estrogenic activity. Estriol (E3) is the weakest form of estrogen and has the least potency among the three. Therefore, in decreasing order of potency, the sequence is E2 > E1 > E3. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. E3-E2-E1: This order is incorrect because estriol (E3) is the weakest estrogen, so it should not be placed first. The correct sequence should start with estradiol (E2), followed by estrone (E1), and then estriol (E3). C. E1-E2-E3: This order incorrectly places estrone (E1) before estradiol (E2). Since estradiol is the most potent form of estrogen, it should be placed at the beginning of the sequence, not estrone. D. E2-E3-E1: This option starts with estradiol (E2), which is correct, but then incorrectly places estriol (E3) before estrone (E1). Estrone (E1) has more potency than estriol (E3), so it should be listed after estradiol and before estriol.",

Explanation for Correct Answer (D): The corpus luteum primarily produces progesterone and a small amount of estrogen during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. However, it is not a major source of androgens. Androgen production in females is primarily through other sources such as the adrenals and ovaries. Therefore, the corpus luteum is not a significant contributor to androgen production in females. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Adrenals: The adrenal glands are a significant source of androgens in females. They produce adrenal androgens like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, which are important precursors for the production of estrogen and other hormones. B. Ovaries: The ovaries also produce androgens, mainly androstenedione and testosterone. These are important for the synthesis of estrogen in females, and thus the ovaries are a key source of androgens. C. Peripheral conversion to androgen precursors in the liver, gastro-intestinal tract, and adipose tissue: Peripheral tissues, including the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and adipose tissue, can convert estrogen precursors such as androstenedione into active androgens like testosterone. This peripheral conversion is an important source of androgens in females.",

Explanation for Correct Answer (D): The primary source of testosterone in females is through the peripheral conversion of androstenedione, a precursor hormone that is produced by both the adrenal glands and ovaries. Androstenedione is converted into testosterone by various peripheral tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle. This process is responsible for the majority of the testosterone found in females. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Adrenal gland: The adrenal glands do produce small amounts of testosterone, but they are not the primary source. The main role of the adrenal glands is to produce adrenal androgens like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, which can be converted into testosterone peripherally, but they do not directly produce significant quantities of testosterone. B. Ovary: The ovaries also produce testosterone, but they are not the main source in females. Testosterone is produced in smaller amounts in the ovaries compared to its peripheral conversion from androstenedione. C. Both a and b: While both the adrenal glands and ovaries contribute to the production of androgens and testosterone, the peripheral conversion of androstenedione is the primary source. Thus, this answer is not fully accurate as it overstates the contributions of the adrenal glands and ovaries compared to peripheral conversion.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Mittelschmerz syndrome. Explanation for Correct Answer (D): Mittelschmerz syndrome refers to mid-cycle pain that occurs around ovulation, typically occurring 14 days before menstruation, which aligns with the timing described in the question. The pain is often sharp and localized to one side of the lower abdomen, reflecting the side of ovulation. This pain usually lasts for a few hours to a couple of days and is generally not associated with any other underlying pathology, making it the most probable diagnosis for this woman's symptoms. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of it, often causing chronic pelvic pain. However, the pain is typically more continuous and occurs throughout the menstrual cycle, not specifically 2-3 days before menses or tied to ovulation. The timing and nature of the pain described in the question are not characteristic of endometriosis. B. Dysmenorrhea: Dysmenorrhea refers to pain associated with menstruation, usually occurring just before or during the onset of menses. The pain described in the question happens 2-3 days before menses and is sharp and localized, which is more typical of ovulatory pain (Mittelschmerz) than menstrual cramps associated with dysmenorrhea. C. Pelvic tuberculosis: Pelvic tuberculosis can cause chronic pelvic pain, but it usually presents with more severe symptoms, often accompanied by other signs like weight loss, fever, and irregular menstrual cycles. The pain described in the question is too short-lived and has a specific timing related to ovulation, making pelvic tuberculosis less likely in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Hyperthyroidism. Explanation for Correct Answer (D): Hyperthyroidism typically does not cause precocious puberty. In fact, it is more commonly associated with delayed puberty or other endocrine disturbances rather than the early onset of puberty. Hyperthyroidism increases metabolic rate, which might lead to other symptoms such as weight loss, increased heart rate, and irritability, but it does not directly stimulate early sexual development or lead to precocious puberty. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Granulosa-cell tumour: Granulosa-cell tumors of the ovary can produce estrogen, leading to early onset of puberty in girls, particularly before the age of 8. This increased estrogen production can result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus leading to precocious puberty. B. Head injury: Head injuries, particularly those involving the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, can disrupt the normal regulation of puberty, potentially leading to precocious puberty. This is known as central precocious puberty, where hormonal signals that trigger puberty are released prematurely due to brain injury. C. Corticosteroid intake: Corticosteroid use, especially in high doses or over a long period, can affect the endocrine system and lead to early puberty. Corticosteroids can sometimes stimulate the adrenal glands, contributing to changes in the body’s hormonal balance, which may cause precocious puberty in some cases.",

McCune-Albright Syndrome is characterized by the classic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone, irregular cafe au lait spots on skin and GnRH independent sexual precocity The precocious puberty is the result of secretion of estrogen from functioning ovarian cysts.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Thelarche. Explanation for Correct Answer (A): Thelarche, which is the development of breast tissue, is the first physical sign of puberty in girls. It typically occurs between the ages of 8 and 13 and is one of the earliest indicators of the onset of puberty. Thelarche marks the beginning of the hormonal changes that lead to further sexual maturation, such as the growth of pubic hair and menstruation. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Menarche: Menarche, which is the first menstrual period, is a later event in puberty. It typically occurs about 2-3 years after the onset of thelarche. Therefore, menarche is not the first sign of puberty but rather one of the later stages of development. C. Adrenarche: Adrenarche refers to the increased secretion of adrenal androgens, which leads to the early development of pubic hair and other signs of sexual maturation. While it occurs around the same time as thelarche, it is not the first sign of puberty in girls, as thelarche typically occurs slightly earlier. D. Pubarche: Pubarche refers to the appearance of pubic hair, which generally follows thelarche and is part of the process of adrenarche. Pubarche happens after the onset of thelarche, so it is not the first sign of puberty.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Inhibin secreted by Sertoli cells. Explanation for Correct Answer (A): In males, the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is primarily regulated by a negative feedback mechanism involving inhibin. Inhibin is secreted by Sertoli cells, which are located in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. When inhibin levels increase, they act on the anterior pituitary to decrease the secretion of FSH, thus helping to regulate spermatogenesis and maintain the appropriate levels of FSH in the bloodstream. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Inhibin secreted by Leydig cells: Leydig cells secrete testosterone, not inhibin. While testosterone also plays a role in the feedback regulation of FSH through negative feedback, Leydig cells do not secrete inhibin, and therefore, they cannot directly inhibit FSH secretion. C. Testosterone secreted by Sertoli cells: Sertoli cells are responsible for nurturing developing sperm, and while they do secrete some estrogen and other factors, they do not secrete testosterone. Testosterone, which is mainly secreted by Leydig cells, does play a role in feedback regulation, but it is not the direct cause of FSH inhibition by Sertoli cells. D. Testosterone secreted by Leydig cells: Testosterone secreted by Leydig cells does contribute to the negative feedback regulation of both LH and FSH levels. However, the direct inhibition of FSH secretion by the pituitary is primarily due to inhibin secreted by Sertoli cells, not testosterone. Testosterone's role is more focused on inhibiting LH secretion and maintaining the overall function of the testes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Visual changes. Explanation for Correct Answer (C): Visual changes are not considered a classic symptom of menopause. Menopause primarily affects the reproductive and endocrine systems, leading to symptoms like hot flashes, insomnia, and vaginal atrophy. While hormonal changes may indirectly impact vision (e.g., through dry eyes or changes in the lens), visual disturbances are not commonly associated with the onset of menopause. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Hot flashes: Hot flashes are one of the most common and classic symptoms of menopause. They occur due to fluctuations in estrogen levels, leading to sudden feelings of intense heat, often accompanied by sweating and flushing, especially during the night. B. Insomnia: Insomnia or sleep disturbances are frequently reported during menopause due to hormonal changes, particularly the decrease in estrogen levels, which can affect the regulation of sleep patterns and contribute to difficulties falling or staying asleep. D. Vaginal atrophy: Vaginal atrophy, which involves thinning and dryness of the vaginal walls, is another common symptom of menopause. It occurs as a result of reduced estrogen levels, leading to a decrease in vaginal lubrication and elasticity, which can cause discomfort or pain during intercourse.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) The endometrium does not produce progesterone. The corpus luteum produces progesterone to maintain the endometrium until the placenta takes over at 8 to 10 weeks of gestation. In the absence of fertilization, the corpus luteum degenerates, and the progesterone levels fall, so the endometrium is unable to be maintained, resulting in a menstruation. The follicle produces progesterone in response to the LH surge and results in ovulation. This follicle then becomes the corpus luteum after ovulation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) In premenopausal adult women, most of the estrogen in the body is derived from ovarian secretion of estradiol, but a significant portion comes also from the extraglandular conversion of androstenedione to estrone. To a lesser extent, testosterone conversion to estradiol also contributes to the estrogen milieu. Muscle and adipose tissue are the major sites of aromatization. When there is an increase in fat cells, as in obese persons, estrogen levels will be higher, because adipose tissue exhibits a greater aromatization of androstenedione to estrone than does muscle.",
