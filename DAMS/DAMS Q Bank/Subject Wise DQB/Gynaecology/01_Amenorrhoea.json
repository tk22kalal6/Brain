      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Explanation: Correct Answer: (D) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): CAH is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in female children. It is caused by a deficiency in enzymes involved in cortisol production, most commonly 21-hydroxylase. This deficiency leads to an overproduction of androgens (male hormones) by the adrenal glands, which can cause virilization of the external genitalia in females. As a result, the child may have ambiguous genitalia, with the presence of masculinized features such as an enlarged clitoris or fused labia. Incorrect Answers: (A) Placenta steroid sulfatase deficiency: This is a rare condition that affects the metabolism of estrogens in the placenta. It can lead to maternal virilization during pregnancy, but it does not typically result in ambiguous genitalia in female infants. The condition is more related to maternal symptoms than to those of the newborn. (B) Fetal aromatase deficiency: Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens. Fetal aromatase deficiency can result in a lack of estrogen production, leading to impaired sexual differentiation in females. However, this condition is quite rare and less commonly associated with ambiguous genitalia than CAH. (C) Wnt4 mutation: Mutations in the Wnt4 gene can lead to disorders of sexual differentiation, such as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, where females may have underdeveloped or absent uteruses. However, this is a rare condition and not as common a cause of ambiguous genitalia as CAH.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Explanation: Correct Answer: (D) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): CAH is the most common cause of female pseudohermaphroditism. It is an inherited condition where a defect in the enzymes of the adrenal glands, most commonly 21-hydroxylase deficiency, results in overproduction of androgens (male hormones) during fetal development. In females, this leads to virilization of the external genitalia, such as an enlarged clitoris and fused labia, despite having a female chromosomal pattern (46,XX). Thus, the infant may present with genital ambiguity, but the internal sex organs (ovaries and uterus) are typically female, making it a case of pseudohermaphroditism. Incorrect Answers: (A) Virilizing ovarian tumor: A virilizing ovarian tumor, such as a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, can produce excess androgens, leading to virilization in females. However, it is much less common than CAH and would typically occur in an older girl or woman, not as a congenital condition, and is not the most common cause of female pseudohermaphroditism. (B) Ovarian dysgenesis: Ovarian dysgenesis refers to abnormal development of the ovaries, often leading to a lack of ovarian function. This condition can result in ambiguous genitalia or lack of puberty. However, it does not typically lead to virilization, making it less likely to cause female pseudohermaphroditism compared to CAH. (C) Exogenous androgen: Exogenous androgen exposure, such as from maternal use of androgens during pregnancy, can cause virilization in a female fetus. However, this is a rare cause and not as common as CAH in the pathogenesis of female pseudohermaphroditism. Moreover, it is avoidable and not a primary cause of congenital ambiguous genitalia.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Cortisone. Explanation: Correct Answer: (D) Cortisone: The treatment for virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is corticosteroid therapy, typically cortisone or hydrocortisone. In CAH, there is a deficiency of an enzyme (usually 21-hydroxylase), which impairs cortisol production, leading to an overproduction of androgens by the adrenal glands. By administering corticosteroids, cortisol levels are normalized, which helps suppress the production of excessive androgens through negative feedback mechanisms. This treatment aims to prevent further virilization, correct hormonal imbalances, and manage symptoms of the disease. Incorrect Answers: (A) Estrogens: Estrogens are not used to treat CAH. Although they are important for the development of secondary sexual characteristics in females, they do not address the underlying cause of CAH, which is androgen overproduction. Estrogen therapy may be used later in life, particularly if puberty is delayed or there are issues with fertility, but it is not the first-line treatment for virilizing CAH. (B) Antiandrogens: Antiandrogens, such as spironolactone, can block the effects of androgens, but they do not address the root cause of androgen overproduction in CAH. Antiandrogens may be used as adjunctive therapy in some cases, but they are not the primary treatment. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for CAH, as they reduce the production of androgens in the first place. (C) ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic hormone): ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol and androgens. In CAH, the adrenal glands are already producing excessive androgens due to a deficiency in cortisol production. Administering ACTH would only worsen the androgen overproduction, not alleviate the condition. Therefore, ACTH is not used to treat CAH.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) • The Sertoli cells in the developing testis produce Müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) that causes regression of the Müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts. In the absence of MIS, Müllerian ducts develop passively to form the fallopian tubes, uterus and upper vagina. Female internal organs and external genitalia develop partially without the need for ovarian hormones and differentiate even in the absence of the gonads, unless interrupted by the regressive influence of MIS. With above explanation we can understand that anti mullerian hormone deficiency result in formation of female genitalia hence this cant be the answer here. • In placental aromatase deficiency there is reduced level of female sex hormone estrogen n likewise increased level of testosterone which can result in male external genitalia with 46 XX • In maternal androgen adrenal tumor similar features are seen due to excessive production of androgens and such newborn often present with virilisation • In WNT 4 gene mutation – WNT 4 Gene is responsible for production of protein that plays important role in production mullerian ducts and female reproductive system so its deficiency can present with above picture",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Ovarian agenesis. Explanation: Correct Answer: (D) Ovarian agenesis: Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is characterized by the underdevelopment or complete absence of the Mullerian ducts, which give rise to the uterus, cervix, and upper two-thirds of the vagina. However, the ovaries are typically present and functional in individuals with this condition. Therefore, ovarian agenesis is not a feature of Mullerian agenesis. The presence of functional ovaries results in normal levels of female sex hormones, which allows for normal breast development and secondary sexual characteristics. Incorrect Answers: (A) 46 XX karyotype: This is the typical chromosomal pattern in individuals with Mullerian agenesis. The 46 XX karyotype indicates that the individual has two X chromosomes, which is typical for females. In Mullerian agenesis, the person has a normal female chromosomal pattern but with absent or underdeveloped Mullerian structures (uterus and upper vagina). (B) Normal breast development: Individuals with Mullerian agenesis usually have normal breast development due to the presence of functioning ovaries, which produce estrogen. This hormone stimulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast tissue. Therefore, normal breast development is a feature of this condition. (C) Absent vagina: One of the hallmark features of Mullerian agenesis is the absence of the vagina or its underdevelopment. This results from the incomplete or absent formation of the Mullerian ducts, which are responsible for the development of the vagina, uterus, and cervix. The vagina may be absent or present in a rudimentary form, but this is a characteristic feature of the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Anovulation. Explanation: Correct Answer: (C) Anovulation: While anovulation (lack of ovulation) is commonly associated with conditions affecting the ovaries or hormonal regulation, it is not a characteristic feature of Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). In MRKH syndrome, the ovaries are normal and functional in most cases, which means the individual produces hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, leading to normal secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development. Because the ovaries are typically functional, ovulation can still occur, meaning anovulation is not a feature of this syndrome. Incorrect Answers: (A) Absent uterus: A key characteristic of Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome is the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus. This results from the agenesis (lack of formation) of the Mullerian ducts, which are responsible for the development of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. Therefore, absence of the uterus is a defining feature of the syndrome. (B) Absent vagina: Another hallmark of MRKH syndrome is the absence or underdevelopment of the vagina. The absence of the vagina is due to the underdevelopment or agenesis of the Mullerian ducts, which also give rise to the uterus and cervix. This is a common feature seen in individuals with this syndrome. (D) 46-XX: Individuals with Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome typically have a 46,XX karyotype, meaning they have two X chromosomes and are genetically female. This is consistent with their secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development, despite the absence of internal female reproductive organs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Low oocytes in ovary. Explanation: Correct Answer: (A) Low oocytes in ovary: A 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, rising FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and short stature (56 inches) is most likely experiencing primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), which is also known as premature ovarian failure. In this condition, the ovaries lose their normal function before the age of 40, resulting in a low number of oocytes (eggs) and a subsequent rise in FSH levels. The elevated FSH reflects the body's attempt to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, but the ovaries are unable to respond due to their reduced oocyte count. Histologically, this would show a low number of oocytes, often with some ovarian follicles present but no mature follicles or corpus luteum formation. Incorrect Answers: (B) Corpus luteum hemorrhage: Corpus luteum hemorrhage typically occurs after ovulation when the corpus luteum (the structure left behind after an egg is released) ruptures or bleeds. This is not associated with primary ovarian insufficiency or rising FSH levels. In primary ovarian insufficiency, the ovaries fail to release eggs, so there would be no corpus luteum formation or hemorrhage. (C) Marfan syndrome: Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder and is typically associated with features like tall stature, long limbs, and cardiovascular problems such as aortic aneurysms. While it can sometimes cause reproductive issues, it is not directly associated with primary amenorrhea and rising FSH levels. The ovarian histology in Marfan syndrome would not be consistent with a low oocyte count. (D) Pituitary apoplexy: Pituitary apoplexy is an acute hemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland, which typically results in symptoms like sudden headache, vision changes, or hypopituitarism. Although it can lead to hormonal imbalances, it is not likely to cause primary amenorrhea or rising FSH levels. Instead, it might cause low levels of FSH if the pituitary is severely damaged.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Streak ovaries should be removed surgically due to 25% chances of turning malignant. Explanation: Correct Answer: (A) Streak ovaries should be removed surgically due to 25% chances of turning malignant: This statement is incorrect. In Turner's syndrome, individuals often have streak ovaries, which are underdeveloped and nonfunctional ovaries. While these streak ovaries are generally incapable of producing eggs or hormones, the risk of malignancy (such as gonadoblastoma) is low. In fact, the general recommendation is to monitor streak ovaries and remove them only if there is any suspicion of malignancy or if there are other indications like gonadoblastoma. The risk of cancer in streak ovaries is not as high as 25%, and routine removal is not a standard practice unless malignancy is suspected. Incorrect Answers: (B) High FSH levels: In Turner syndrome, due to ovarian insufficiency and the absence of functional ovaries, there is a failure to produce estrogen, which leads to an increase in FSH and LH levels. Elevated FSH levels are a common finding in Turner syndrome, reflecting the body's attempt to stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen. (C) Female internal genitalia present: Individuals with Turner's syndrome typically have female internal genitalia including a uterus and fallopian tubes. Although their ovaries are nonfunctional (streak ovaries), the internal genitalia are typically normal, allowing for the development of female reproductive structures. Therefore, this statement is true. (D) Have normal but infantile external genitalia: In Turner syndrome, the external genitalia are typically normal but infantile. This means that although the external genitalia appear female, they may be underdeveloped due to the lack of estrogen production and ovarian function. As a result, individuals may have underdeveloped breasts and a small stature, but their external genitalia remain within the female range..",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Normal breast size is observed. Explanation: Correct Answer: (B) Normal breast size is observed: In Testicular Feminization Syndrome (also known as Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or CAIS), individuals have a 46 XY karyotype (male chromosomes) but the body cannot respond to androgens (male hormones) due to defective androgen receptors. Despite having male chromosomes, these individuals develop female external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics, including normal breast development. This is because the lack of response to androgens allows for normal breast development driven by estrogen, and normal breast size is typically observed. Incorrect Answers: (A) Buccal smear is chromatin positive: In Testicular Feminization Syndrome, individuals with a 46 XY karyotype typically have XY chromosomes, and a buccal smear would be negative for Barr bodies (chromatin-positive cells) because Barr bodies are associated with female XX karyotypes. Since individuals with CAIS are genetically male (XY), the buccal smear would not show a chromatin-positive result. (C) Menstruation is scanty and infrequent: Individuals with Testicular Feminization Syndrome or Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome do not have functioning ovaries; instead, they have undescended testes (often within the abdomen or inguinal canal). Since their bodies cannot respond to androgens, and they lack functional ovaries, they do not experience menstruation at all. Therefore, menstruation is absent, not scanty or infrequent. (D) Streak gonads seen: Streak gonads refer to underdeveloped gonads, which are typically seen in conditions like Turner's syndrome or gonadal dysgenesis, but not in Testicular Feminization Syndrome. In CAIS, individuals typically have undescended testes, which are functional in terms of producing testosterone but ineffective due to the absence of androgen receptors. These testes do not develop into ovaries or streak gonads.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. Explanation: Correct Answer: (B) Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome: This condition is characterized by partial resistance to androgens, which means that the individual has a 46 XY karyotype (male chromosomes), but the body does not fully respond to male hormones (androgens). In Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS), the individuals may present with primary amenorrhea, normal breast development (due to estrogen activity), and absent axillary hair (because of partial androgen resistance). The vagina is normally developed because of the lack of response to androgens, and in some cases, clitoromegaly can occur due to the partial masculinization effect of androgens. On ultrasound, gonads (testes) are typically located in the inguinal region, which is consistent with the findings in PAIS, where the testes may not descend into the scrotum. This presentation is typical for Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, where the individual has a mosaic or partial response to androgens, leading to ambiguous genitalia and incomplete masculinization. Incorrect Answers: (A) Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS): In CAIS, the individual has a 46 XY karyotype (male chromosomes), but due to a complete lack of androgen receptor function, the body cannot respond to androgens at all. This leads to the development of female external genitalia, including normal breast development. However, CAIS typically presents with absent vagina or a shortened vagina (due to the failure of Müllerian ducts to develop), and there is typically no clitoromegaly. Gonads in CAIS are typically undescended testes, often located in the inguinal region or abdomen, but the absence of clitoromegaly and the presence of a normally developed vagina make this diagnosis less likely. (C) Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome (MRKH): MRKH syndrome is characterized by congenital absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and vagina, despite having normal ovaries and a 46 XX karyotype (female chromosomes). The vagina is either absent or rudimentary in MRKH, and gonads are typically normal ovaries, not testes. Since this patient has a normally developed vagina and testes in the inguinal region, MRKH syndrome is not the correct diagnosis. (D) Gonadal dysgenesis: Gonadal dysgenesis refers to underdeveloped or malformed gonads (often streak gonads), and it can occur in conditions like Turner's syndrome. In Turner syndrome, individuals often present with primary amenorrhea, absent secondary sexual characteristics, and streak gonads. The presence of normal breast development and gonads visible in the inguinal region makes this diagnosis unlikely, as gonadal dysgenesis usually presents with poorly developed or absent gonads.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Can be fertile with surrogacy. Explanation: Correct Answer: (A) Can be fertile with surrogacy: This statement is not true because individuals with Swyer syndrome (46, XY gonadal dysgenesis) have non-functional streak gonads and do not produce gametes (sperm or eggs). Since they lack the ability to produce viable gametes, surrogacy using their own genetic material is not possible. However, they can achieve fertility using ovum donation from another individual, as their uterus is functional and can support a pregnancy with assisted reproductive techniques like in vitro fertilization (IVF). Incorrect Answers: (B) Can be fertile with ovum donation: This statement is true. Individuals with Swyer syndrome have a normal female internal genital tract, including a uterus, despite having a 46, XY karyotype. They can carry a pregnancy if a donor ovum is fertilized and implanted into their uterus via assisted reproductive techniques. Hormonal therapy is typically required to prepare the uterus for implantation. (C) Presents with primary infertility: This statement is true. Swyer syndrome often presents with primary amenorrhea and infertility due to the absence of functional ovaries and gametes. These individuals have streak gonads that fail to produce sex hormones or mature oocytes, resulting in infertility. (D) Gonadectomy is indicated for all patients: This statement is true. In Swyer syndrome, the streak gonads have a high risk (up to 30%) of developing gonadoblastoma or dysgerminoma. Therefore, prophylactic gonadectomy is recommended for all patients to prevent malignancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Mullerian agenesis. Explanation: Correct Answer: (A) Mullerian agenesis: This condition, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is the most likely diagnosis for a 19-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics (breast and pubic hair development), and a blind-ending vagina with no palpable uterus. In Mullerian agenesis, the uterus, upper two-thirds of the vagina, and fallopian tubes fail to develop due to failure of the Mullerian ducts during embryogenesis. However, since ovarian development is normal, these individuals produce normal levels of estrogen, resulting in normal secondary sexual characteristics and breast development. Incorrect Answers: (B) Asherman syndrome: This condition is characterized by intrauterine adhesions, often resulting from prior uterine surgeries like dilation and curettage (D&C). It leads to secondary amenorrhea (not primary amenorrhea) and is associated with a history of uterine trauma or infection. Unlike Mullerian agenesis, the uterus is present but scarred, and the vagina is not blind-ending. (C) Gonadal dysgenesis: This condition, including variants like Swyer syndrome, involves underdeveloped gonads (streak gonads) that fail to produce hormones, leading to primary amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development. This is inconsistent with the patient’s presentation of normal breast and pubic hair development. (D) Turner’s syndrome: Turner syndrome (45, X) is associated with primary amenorrhea, streak ovaries, and absent or underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics like breast development. Physical features such as short stature, webbed neck, and cubitus valgus may also be present. These features do not match the case described.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Perform a hormone profile. Explanation: Correct Answer: (B) Perform a hormone profile: The most logical next step in diagnosing primary amenorrhea in a 15-year-old girl with short stature, absent secondary sexual characteristics, and failure to attain menarche is to evaluate her hormonal status. A hormone profile, including FSH, LH, estradiol, and thyroid hormones (TSH, T3, T4), helps determine whether the underlying cause is central (hypothalamic or pituitary) or peripheral (gonadal or ovarian failure). Elevated FSH and LH with low estradiol indicate primary gonadal failure, while low FSH and LH suggest central causes like hypothalamic or pituitary disorders. A hormone profile is essential to guide further investigations, such as imaging or genetic testing. Incorrect Answers: (A) Perform a CT of brain: While imaging of the brain might be necessary later if central causes (e.g., hypothalamic or pituitary tumors) are suspected, it is not the first step. The absence of secondary sexual characteristics and short stature suggests a more likely peripheral cause like gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome, or other endocrinological issues that can initially be evaluated with a hormone profile. (C) Do a karyotype: Karyotyping is a critical test if a chromosomal abnormality like Turner syndrome (45, X) is suspected, especially in cases of short stature and primary amenorrhea. However, it is not the immediate first step because a hormone profile provides a broader understanding of the problem and can suggest whether chromosomal analysis is needed. (D) Do a TVS (Transvaginal Ultrasound): A transvaginal ultrasound is often helpful in evaluating pelvic anatomy (e.g., uterus and ovaries) but is not the most appropriate initial step in a young girl without secondary sexual development. If gonadal dysgenesis or anatomic abnormalities are suspected after the hormonal evaluation, ultrasound may be performed.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) DEXA scan of the spine. Explanation: Correct Answer: (A) DEXA scan of the spine: Hyperprolactinemia leads to suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), causing decreased levels of estrogen. Chronic estrogen deficiency affects bone metabolism, leading to reduced bone density and an increased risk of osteoporosis. A DEXA scan (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) of the spine would likely reveal decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia or osteoporosis) in a patient with prolonged amenorrhea and low estrogen levels, as is often seen in hyperprolactinemia. Incorrect Answers: (B) Endometrial biopsy: In hyperprolactinemia-induced amenorrhea, the endometrium is generally thin due to chronic hypoestrogenism. While this may be evident in an endometrial biopsy, it is not the most specific or clinically relevant test in this scenario. The biopsy would not provide additional diagnostic or management information compared to hormone level assessments. (C) Mammography of the breasts: Mammography is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate breast tissue for structural abnormalities, such as masses or calcifications. Galactorrhea in hyperprolactinemia is a functional issue caused by elevated prolactin levels and does not usually necessitate mammography unless there are other indications, such as a palpable mass or high-risk family history. (D) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level: While it is true that hypothyroidism can lead to elevated prolactin levels (via increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH), this scenario specifically describes a prolactin-secreting adenoma as the cause. TSH levels would likely be normal unless there is concurrent hypothyroidism, which is not indicated in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Ultrasound of Uterus Ultrasound of the uterus is the most appropriate next investigation in a patient presenting with primary amenorrhea and normal secondary sexual characteristics. The presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is functional and estrogen is being produced. The next logical step is to evaluate the anatomy of the reproductive system to check for the presence of the uterus and vagina and rule out anatomical anomalies, such as Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) or imperforate hymen. An ultrasound is a non-invasive, easily accessible, and effective tool for this purpose. Incorrect Answers: (B) Serum FSH: Measuring serum FSH levels is typically done when there is a suspicion of ovarian insufficiency or gonadal dysgenesis (e.g., Turner syndrome). However, in a patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics, this is less likely the cause, as estrogen production would already indicate functional ovarian activity. This test is not the first-line investigation in this scenario. (C) Serum LH: Like FSH, serum LH levels are more useful when there is suspicion of hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Since the presence of secondary sexual characteristics indicates a functional hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, LH measurement is not the next investigation. (D) Karyotyping: Karyotyping is useful in cases where gonadal dysgenesis or chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Turner syndrome or androgen insensitivity syndrome) are suspected. However, in a patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics, anatomical anomalies are more likely than chromosomal issues, making ultrasound a more appropriate first step. Karyotyping may be performed later if the ultrasound findings suggest a condition like Müllerian agenesis or androgen insensitivity syndrome.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Anovulation The diagnosis is anovulation, as indicated by the patient’s history of irregular and infrequent menstrual cycles, her inability to conceive, and a day 21 progesterone level of 1.2 ng/ml, which is below the threshold for ovulation (>5 ng/ml is indicative of ovulation). Anovulation is a common cause of infertility in women and is associated with irregular menstrual cycles and variable bleeding patterns. In this case, the hormonal profile also shows an increased serum prolactin level (120 ng/ml), which can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and contribute to anovulation. The high prolactin level may be due to the use of metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist known to increase prolactin secretion, leading to a secondary anovulatory state. Incorrect Answers: (A) PCOS: While polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common cause of anovulation and infertility, this patient does not have the classic hormonal profile of PCOS. Typically, PCOS is associated with elevated LH:FSH ratio, signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Here, the LH:FSH ratio is 10:6 (not significantly elevated), and there is no mention of hyperandrogenic symptoms such as hirsutism or acne, making PCOS less likely. (C) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: This condition is characterized by low FSH and LH levels due to decreased stimulation of the gonads by the hypothalamus or pituitary. However, this patient has normal FSH and slightly elevated LH, which does not align with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. (D) Pituitary microadenoma: A pituitary microadenoma could lead to hyperprolactinemia and subsequent anovulation. However, the patient’s hyperprolactinemia is more likely drug-induced due to her use of metoclopramide rather than a pituitary adenoma. Imaging studies such as an MRI would be necessary to confirm a microadenoma, and there is no mention of symptoms like headaches or visual disturbances, which are commonly associated with pituitary adenomas.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Serum FSH levels The next step in evaluating this patient with secondary amenorrhea and menopausal symptoms (vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats) is to measure serum FSH levels. Elevated FSH levels would indicate primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition where ovarian function declines prematurely, leading to cessation of menstruation. This patient’s history of normal menstrual cycles followed by abrupt cessation and her symptoms of estrogen deficiency strongly suggest ovarian dysfunction. Measurement of FSH is a simple and reliable test to assess ovarian reserve and function. If FSH levels are elevated (>25 IU/L), it confirms a diagnosis of POI. Incorrect Answers: (A) Serum estradiol levels: While estradiol levels would provide information about estrogen status, they are less sensitive and reliable for diagnosing ovarian insufficiency. Low estradiol levels are expected in cases of POI but can fluctuate, especially in the early stages of ovarian failure, leading to possible false negatives. (C) Karyotype: Karyotype analysis is used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities, such as Turner syndrome or fragile X syndrome premutation carriers, which can cause POI. However, karyotyping is typically performed after confirming POI with elevated FSH levels. It is not the first-line test. (D) Ultrasound pelvis: Ultrasound can help visualize the ovaries and assess follicular development, but it is not the most direct test for evaluating ovarian function. It may show reduced ovarian volume or absence of follicles in POI, but these findings are less definitive compared to hormonal assessment with FSH.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Serum prolactin This patient presents with secondary amenorrhea, headaches, and a history of initially irregular and then absent menstrual cycles. These clinical features raise suspicion for hyperprolactinemia, which can result from a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma). MRI findings consistent with a pituitary lesion strongly support this diagnosis. Measuring serum prolactin levels is the most appropriate initial investigation to confirm hyperprolactinemia. Elevated prolactin suppresses gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, menstrual irregularities, and amenorrhea. Incorrect Answers: (A) Serum FSH: FSH levels are useful in diagnosing ovarian dysfunction, such as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). However, the patient’s clinical picture (normal menstrual cycles initially, followed by irregular periods and amenorrhea) is more indicative of central (pituitary) dysfunction rather than ovarian failure. (B) Serum LH: LH, like FSH, reflects ovarian function and would be low or normal in cases of hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, it is not specific and does not help diagnose the underlying cause of amenorrhea, making it less valuable as an initial investigation. (D) Serum TSH: Thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism, can lead to hyperprolactinemia due to increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulating prolactin secretion. However, TSH testing is a secondary investigation after confirming hyperprolactinemia or if hypothyroidism is suspected clinically (e.g., fatigue, weight gain, bradycardia).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Gonadal dysgenesis Gonadal dysgenesis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient has primary amenorrhea, Tanner stage I breast development (indicating lack of estrogen), and a high probability of malignant transformation in her gonads. Gonadal dysgenesis refers to underdeveloped, streak gonads that do not produce adequate sex hormones, leading to delayed or absent puberty and primary amenorrhea. A significant concern in gonadal dysgenesis, particularly in Swyer syndrome (46,XY gonadal dysgenesis), is the increased risk of gonadal malignancy, such as gonadoblastoma or dysgerminoma, due to the presence of a Y chromosome. Gonadectomy is indicated to prevent this malignant transformation. Incorrect Answers: (A) Müllerian agenesis: This condition, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, causes primary amenorrhea due to absent uterus and upper vagina but normal ovarian function. Breast development is normal, as ovarian hormone production is unaffected. Malignant transformation of gonads is not associated with this condition, making it an unlikely diagnosis here. (B) Androgen insensitivity: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) occurs in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype who are resistant to androgens. They develop normal breasts due to peripheral aromatization of androgens to estrogens but lack pubic and axillary hair. Gonadal malignancy risk exists due to undescended testes, but Tanner stage I breast development is inconsistent with this diagnosis. (D) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): PCOS causes irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism but does not typically present with primary amenorrhea or Tanner stage I breast development. It is also not associated with a high risk of gonadal malignancy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vaginal agenesis The most likely diagnosis is vaginal agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This condition is characterized by congenital absence or underdevelopment of the vagina, with the presence of functional ovaries. The clinical presentation in this case includes primary amenorrhea, cyclic pelvic pain due to hematometra (accumulation of menstrual blood), and normal secondary sexual characteristics, which are consistent with ovarian estrogen production. Ultrasound findings of hematometra suggest a functional uterus, but the absence of a vaginal introitus prevents blood drainage. Incorrect Answers: (A) Transverse vaginal septum: A transverse vaginal septum could also cause primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain by obstructing menstrual flow. However, in this case, the absence of a vaginal introitus is more consistent with vaginal agenesis than a transverse septum, which typically presents with a small opening or a thin membrane during examination. (B) Imperforate hymen: This is a common cause of primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain in adolescents. It results from incomplete canalization of the vaginal plate, leading to a membrane that obstructs menstrual flow. Unlike vaginal agenesis, an imperforate hymen typically presents with a bulging, bluish membrane visible at the vaginal introitus, which is not mentioned here. (D) Bicornuate uterus: A bicornuate uterus is a structural abnormality of the uterus and does not cause obstruction of menstrual flow. It would not explain the absence of a vaginal introitus, and it is unrelated to primary amenorrhea or hematometra due to outflow obstruction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Estrogen plus progesterone In a 15-year-old patient with Turner syndrome and delayed puberty, the appropriate treatment is estrogen plus progesterone. Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition where females typically have only one functional X chromosome. This leads to underdeveloped ovaries (often streak ovaries), causing insufficient estrogen production. Estrogen therapy is necessary to initiate secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development and menstruation), but progesterone is also added to simulate a natural menstrual cycle and protect the endometrial lining after estrogen therapy. The combined therapy helps stimulate normal pubertal development and supports long-term reproductive health. Incorrect Answers: (A) Growth hormone therapy: While growth hormone therapy is beneficial for increasing height in patients with Turner syndrome (due to growth failure), it does not address the primary concern of delayed puberty or secondary sexual characteristic development. Growth hormone is used for growth-related issues, not for initiating puberty. (B) Gonadotropin therapy (FSH and LH): Gonadotropin therapy, which involves the use of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone), is typically used in cases where there is primary ovarian insufficiency, and the ovaries are still capable of responding to stimulation. However, in Turner syndrome, the ovaries are usually non-functional (streak ovaries), making gonadotropins ineffective in inducing puberty. (D) Estrogen alone: Estrogen alone can initiate some aspects of puberty, such as breast development, but it is insufficient for complete pubertal development. Without progesterone, the endometrial lining can thicken, which can lead to potential complications such as endometrial hyperplasia. Progesterone is needed to prevent this and induce a natural menstruation pattern.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Test her sense of smell This 18-year-old female has primary amenorrhea, with the key findings being absent breast development and absent axillary or pubic hair. Additionally, the uterus and ovaries are palpable, and the vagina is well-formed. Given these features, Kallmann syndrome is a likely diagnosis. Kallmann syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, where there is a failure in the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. It leads to a lack of pubertal development, including failure to initiate menstruation. In addition to primary amenorrhea, Kallmann syndrome is often associated with anosmia (a lack of sense of smell). Therefore, testing her sense of smell is a diagnostic step that would support the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome. Incorrect Answers: (A) Draw her blood for a karyotype: A karyotype is useful in diagnosing Turner syndrome, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, or other chromosomal abnormalities associated with primary amenorrhea. However, this patient's physical exam findings, particularly the palpable uterus and ovaries, make these conditions less likely. Karyotyping would be more relevant if other signs such as short stature or ambiguous genitalia were present, which is not the case here. (C) Draw her blood for TSH, FSH, and LH levels: Blood tests measuring TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), and LH (luteinizing hormone) would help assess thyroid function and ovarian reserve. However, the absence of breast development and pubic hair points more towards a GnRH deficiency or hypothalamic issue rather than thyroid dysfunction or ovarian failure. The first step should be assessing the sense of smell, as anosmia is a hallmark of Kallmann syndrome, which would help guide further testing. (D) Order an MRI of the brain to evaluate the pituitary gland: Although MRI of the brain might be necessary if there is suspicion of a pituitary abnormality, such as a pituitary adenoma or hypothalamic tumor, this patient's clinical presentation (with the uterus and ovaries palpated normally) is more suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (like in Kallmann syndrome) rather than a structural brain lesion. The initial step is to check for anosmia, a key feature of Kallmann syndrome, before moving to imaging studies",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Pelvic ultrasound This 18-year-old woman presents with primary amenorrhea and normal secondary sexual characteristics (axillary and pubic hair, breast development). The key finding is a shortened vagina ending in a blind pouch, which suggests a congenital anomaly of the reproductive tract. Given this presentation, Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) is a likely diagnosis. Pelvic ultrasound is the most appropriate first test to evaluate the reproductive anatomy. It can help identify the presence or absence of the uterus and assess the length and structure of the vagina. If the ultrasound shows a blind-ending vagina and absence of the uterus, this confirms the diagnosis of Müllerian agenesis. The presence of ovaries would also suggest normal ovarian function, which is consistent with the normal secondary sexual characteristics. Incorrect Answers: (A) Karyotype: A karyotype is important in cases where gonadal dysgenesis or Turner syndrome is suspected, especially if there is a presence of ambiguous genitalia or other physical features suggesting chromosomal abnormalities. However, in this patient, the clinical findings point more toward Müllerian agenesis. While a karyotype would be helpful to confirm the patient's 46,XX karyotype (normal female chromosomes), pelvic ultrasound is the more appropriate first step as it directly assesses the reproductive tract abnormalities. (C) Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): Measuring FSH would be useful in evaluating ovarian function, particularly if there is suspicion of gonadal dysfunction (e.g., premature ovarian failure, gonadal dysgenesis, or polycystic ovary syndrome). However, in this patient with a shortened vagina and normal secondary sexual characteristics, ovarian function is likely normal. Therefore, FSH levels would not be the first test; an ultrasound of the pelvic anatomy is the most appropriate initial test. (D) Diagnostic laparoscopy: Diagnostic laparoscopy is an invasive procedure used to directly visualize the pelvic organs. It is generally considered a last resort when other less invasive diagnostic tests are inconclusive. Since a pelvic ultrasound is non-invasive and can provide detailed information about the reproductive tract, it should be performed first before considering laparoscopy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Asherman syndrome The patient presents with secondary amenorrhea following a postpartum dilation and curettage (D&C). This raises suspicion for Asherman syndrome, a condition where intrauterine adhesions (scar tissue) form after trauma to the endometrium, often due to procedures like D&C. The characteristic symptom of Asherman syndrome is secondary amenorrhea (absence of menses) following a traumatic uterine procedure like a D&C. In this patient, the enlarged, tender uterus and the worsening monthly cramping suggest intrauterine adhesions, which can lead to painful menstruation that is often a result of the accumulation of menstrual blood in the uterus due to a blocked cervix (hematometra). Incorrect Answers: (A) Sheehan syndrome: Sheehan syndrome is characterized by hypopituitarism following postpartum hemorrhage. This occurs due to ischemic injury to the pituitary gland as a result of severe blood loss during childbirth. Symptoms include failure to lactate, amenorrhea, fatigue, and hypothyroidism. However, this patient has no signs of lactation failure or pituitary insufficiency. The normal physical examination and lack of other signs of hypopituitarism make Sheehan syndrome unlikely. (B) New pregnancy: The absence of menses and the presence of painful cramping make pregnancy unlikely in this patient, particularly given that she has negative pregnancy tests. The cramping is described as progressively worsening, which further supports a diagnosis other than pregnancy. Additionally, a slightly enlarged, tender uterus could indicate endometrial pathology rather than pregnancy. (D) Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI): Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves the premature loss of ovarian function before the age of 40, resulting in amenorrhea and symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and infertility. However, this patient is presenting with secondary amenorrhea after a known traumatic event (D&C), and POI would be less likely in the absence of other signs or symptoms of premature menopause.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Kallman syndrome Kallman syndrome is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, where there is a deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) due to a developmental defect in the hypothalamus. This results in minimal or absent pubertal development despite normal stature. Patients with Kallman syndrome typically have delayed or absent puberty, normal height, and may also have associated symptoms like anosmia (loss of sense of smell) due to a defect in the migration of neurons. The absence of pubertal development occurs due to the lack of stimulation of the gonads by LH and FSH. Incorrect Answers: (A) Testicular feminization: Also known as androgen insensitivity syndrome, this condition occurs in individuals with a 46, XY karyotype where the body is resistant to androgens. Individuals with testicular feminization have normal stature but develop female secondary sexual characteristics due to the lack of androgen action. The absence of pubertal development in this condition is not due to a lack of hormones but rather the body's inability to respond to them. Thus, it does not typically present with minimal or absent pubertal development, as the individual may still develop female secondary sexual characteristics despite lacking functional ovaries. (C) Pure gonadal dysgenesis: This refers to a condition where individuals may have gonadal dysgenesis (i.e., underdeveloped or absent gonads), often associated with a 46, XX karyotype. This condition is characterized by short stature and absence of pubertal development, but it is usually associated with gonadal failure and often leads to infertility. While this condition can result in delayed puberty, normal stature is less commonly seen as part of the presentation, as individuals often experience growth delays or a short final height. (D) Turner syndrome: Turner syndrome is a condition where there is a monosomy X (45,X), leading to short stature, absence of puberty, and ovarian failure. Individuals with Turner syndrome typically have short stature along with other features like webbed neck, low-set ears, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Although absent pubertal development is present in Turner syndrome, it is usually associated with short stature rather than normal height.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Lack of Müllerian-inhibiting factor The presence of a uterus and fallopian tubes in a phenotypically normal male is usually due to a lack of Müllerian-inhibiting factor (MIF), also known as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). MIF is produced by the Sertoli cells in the testes during embryonic development. This hormone is responsible for the regression of the Müllerian ducts (which would otherwise develop into female internal genitalia like the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper two-thirds of the vagina) in a male embryo. If there is a deficiency or absence of this factor, the Müllerian ducts do not regress, resulting in the retention of female reproductive structures, such as a uterus and fallopian tubes, in an otherwise male individual. Incorrect Answers: (B) Lack of testosterone: Testosterone is essential for the development of male external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics, such as the penis, scrotum, and deep voice. However, testosterone does not directly affect the regression of the Müllerian ducts. In a typical male with a functioning Y chromosome, testosterone is produced, and the presence of Müllerian-inhibiting factor ensures the regression of female reproductive structures. A lack of testosterone would lead to ambiguous genitalia, but not to the retention of the uterus and fallopian tubes. (C) Increased levels of estrogens: While estrogens do play a role in female reproductive tract development, they do not prevent the regression of the Müllerian ducts in a male. In fact, increased estrogens would likely lead to feminization of external characteristics but would not specifically result in the retention of Müllerian structures in a normal male. The key factor responsible for the regression of the Müllerian ducts is the presence of Müllerian-inhibiting factor, not an absence of estrogens. (D) 46,XX karyotype: A 46,XX karyotype is associated with individuals who are biologically female, possessing two X chromosomes. This is unrelated to the presence of a uterus and fallopian tubes in a phenotypically male individual. In a 46,XY male, a lack of Müllerian-inhibiting factor can lead to the development of Müllerian structures despite the typical male chromosomal makeup.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Her condition usually occurs after uterine curettage for a pregnancy-related process. The ultrasound image suggests Asherman syndrome, which is a condition involving intrauterine adhesions or scarring. This condition most commonly occurs after uterine curettage, particularly following a pregnancy-related process, such as a miscarriage or elective abortion. The scarring can obstruct the normal endometrial lining and lead to amenorrhea, infertility, or abnormal menstrual cycles. When a patient has a history of uterine curettage and presents with normal hormonal levels but a lack of menstrual bleeding following hormonal therapy, Asherman syndrome should be strongly suspected. The absence of response to hormone therapy (like sequential estrogen and progestin therapy) supports the diagnosis, as the adhesions prevent normal endometrial shedding. Incorrect Answers: (B) She would best be diagnosed by laparoscopy: Laparoscopy is not the primary diagnostic method for Asherman syndrome. The diagnosis is typically made through hysterosalpingography (HSG) or hysteroscopy, which are the gold standard for visualizing intrauterine adhesions. Laparoscopy may be helpful in some cases when there is concern about other pelvic pathology, but it is not the first-line diagnostic tool for this condition. (C) The patient likely has cramping pain every month: While Asherman syndrome can cause abnormal menstrual cycles, the condition itself is more commonly associated with amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) rather than cramping. Additionally, the condition is due to uterine scarring that prevents proper menstruation, so the absence of bleeding and cramping is more typical in these cases. Cramping pain is more commonly seen in conditions like endometriosis or adenomyosis rather than in Asherman syndrome. (D) Her treatment includes endometrial ablation: Endometrial ablation is a procedure used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding, particularly in patients with conditions like dysfunctional uterine bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia. It is not appropriate for the treatment of Asherman syndrome. The primary treatment for Asherman syndrome involves hysteroscopic surgical resection of adhesions to restore the uterine cavity, followed by hormone therapy to promote endometrial regeneration. Endometrial ablation would not address the underlying intrauterine scarring.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) No bleeding with a progestin challenge test The elevated FSH level (40 IU/L) in this patient strongly suggests primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure. In POI, the ovaries stop functioning properly before the age of 40, leading to elevated FSH levels, as the pituitary gland compensates for the lack of ovarian activity. Since the ovaries are not producing sufficient amounts of estrogen, the progestin challenge test would not induce menstrual bleeding. In a progestin challenge test, a patient is given a course of progestin, and if bleeding occurs, it indicates that the endometrium has been stimulated by estrogen. In primary ovarian insufficiency, estrogen levels are typically low, and no bleeding would occur after progestin administration, as the endometrium has not been primed. Incorrect Answers: (A) Obliterated uterine cavity on saline infusion sono-HSG: In primary ovarian insufficiency, the uterine cavity is typically normal, as the condition primarily affects the ovaries, not the uterus. The saline infusion sonohysterography (sono-HSG) would not show obliterated uterine cavities in this case. Uterine abnormalities such as Asherman syndrome (intrauterine adhesions) may show obliterated uterine cavities on HSG, but this is not a characteristic of primary ovarian insufficiency. (C) Normal level of estradiol: In primary ovarian insufficiency, estradiol levels are typically low, not normal. This is because the ovaries are not producing sufficient estrogen, which results in the elevated FSH levels. A low estradiol level is one of the hallmarks of primary ovarian insufficiency, and it would not be normal in this case. (D) Abnormal MRI of the brain: An abnormal MRI of the brain is typically seen in conditions like pituitary tumors (e.g., prolactinomas) or hypothalamic disorders. However, in primary ovarian insufficiency, the problem lies with the ovaries, not the brain. Normal TSH and prolactin levels indicate that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is functioning normally. An abnormal MRI would not be expected in this case.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Müllerian agenesis Müllerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus, cervix, and upper two-thirds of the vagina, while the external genitalia are typically normal. In this case, the patient has primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) and Tanner stage IV breast development, which suggests normal ovarian function. However, the absence of menstruation is due to the lack of a uterus and upper vaginal segment, which is characteristic of Müllerian agenesis. Additionally, renal anomalies, such as a pelvic kidney, are commonly associated with Müllerian agenesis. Incorrect Answers: (B) Androgen insensitivity: Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition where individuals with an XY karyotype (genetically male) have defective androgen receptors, leading to an incomplete response to androgens. This results in female external genitalia and the development of normal breasts at puberty, but primary amenorrhea due to the absence of a uterus (since the individual has male internal genitalia). Although androgen insensitivity could cause primary amenorrhea, the presence of a pelvic kidney is not typically associated with this condition. (C) Gonadal dysgenesis: Gonadal dysgenesis, also known as streak gonads, refers to a condition where the gonads (ovaries or testes) fail to develop properly. This can result in primary amenorrhea. In gonadal dysgenesis, ovarian function is often impaired, leading to low or absent estrogen production, which would typically result in underdeveloped breasts (not Tanner stage IV). The presence of Tanner stage IV breast development makes this diagnosis less likely. (D) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea (irregular or absent periods in women who previously had normal menstrual cycles) due to hormonal imbalances that affect the ovaries. However, primary amenorrhea in a patient with normal breast development is unlikely to be due to PCOS. Additionally, PCOS does not cause structural abnormalities such as a pelvic kidney.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vaginal pH < 4.5 range The patient in this case has amenorrhea, and after receiving oral progestin for 7 days, vaginal bleeding occurred, suggesting that the patient has an ovarian source of estrogen production. A normal estrogen level is necessary to maintain the vaginal epithelium and its pH. When estrogen levels are normal or near normal, the vaginal pH will be less than 4.5, which is the acidic range. Vaginal pH < 4.5 indicates the presence of sufficient estrogen, which is necessary for the acidic environment of the vagina. Given that this patient has responded to progestin with vaginal bleeding, this suggests an adequate estrogenic effect on the endometrium, hence the vaginal pH would most likely be in the acidic range. Incorrect Answers: (A) Gonadotropin levels elevated in the menopausal range: Elevated gonadotropin levels (FSH and LH) in the menopausal range typically occur in conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency or premature ovarian failure, where there is reduced ovarian function. However, this patient had a positive response to the progestin challenge, which suggests that the ovaries are still capable of producing estrogen, and gonadotropin levels would likely be normal or not elevated in this case. Therefore, menopausal range gonadotropin levels are unlikely in this patient. (C) Ultrasound shows the endometrial stripe to be thin (<5 mm): A thin endometrial stripe (less than 5 mm) can be seen in conditions of hypoestrogenism, where estrogen levels are low and the endometrium does not respond well to hormonal stimulation. However, this patient's response to progestin with vaginal bleeding suggests that the endometrium is still capable of secretory transformation in response to progestin, which would indicate adequate estrogen exposure. Thus, the endometrial stripe is unlikely to be thin in this patient. (D) Atrophy noted of the vulvar and vaginal epithelium: Vulvar and vaginal atrophy can be seen in conditions of low estrogen, leading to thinning and dryness of the vaginal and vulvar tissues. This is typically seen in postmenopausal women or those with hypoestrogenism. However, this patient does not have symptoms suggestive of hypoestrogenism, such as vulvar or vaginal atrophy. The response to progestin with bleeding suggests that the estrogen levels are not low enough to cause such atrophy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Absent secondary sexual characters Imperforate hymen is a congenital malformation in which the hymen (a thin membrane at the vaginal opening) is closed or partially closed, preventing menstrual blood from exiting the body. This condition results in primary amenorrhea but does not affect the development of secondary sexual characteristics. In most cases, secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, pubic hair, and axillary hair develop normally because the ovaries are still functional and produce the necessary hormones (estrogen) to promote their development. Therefore, absent secondary sexual characteristics is not associated with imperforate hymen. Incorrect Answers: (A) Primary amenorrhea: Primary amenorrhea is one of the hallmark features of imperforate hymen. In this condition, menstrual blood is trapped within the uterus and vagina, leading to primary amenorrhea. The individual does not have menstruation due to the obstruction caused by the hymen. This is a true and common association with imperforate hymen. (C) Colicky abdominal pain: Colicky abdominal pain is often experienced in patients with imperforate hymen due to menstrual blood accumulation in the uterus and vagina. This leads to distension and pressure in the pelvic region, which can result in crampy or colicky pain. This is a typical symptom of imperforate hymen and is usually observed when the blood begins to accumulate. (D) Urinary retention: Urinary retention can occur in some cases of imperforate hymen due to the increased pressure in the pelvic cavity from the accumulated menstrual blood. This pressure can interfere with the bladder function, leading to urinary retention or difficulty in urination. This is a known potential complication of imperforate hymen.",
