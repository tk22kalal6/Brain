High power view of normal proliferative endometrium shows regularly spaced glands composed of stratified columned epithelium with bland, slightly elongate nuclei. ? .

In this case of simple hyperplasia with atypia, glands are only mildly crowded. Occasional glands show nuclear atypia characterized by nuclear rounding and visible nucleoli. ? In complex hyperplasia, glands are more markedly crowded. Some specimens show architectural abnormalities such as papillary infoldings, although the gland profiles in this case are fairly regular. ? In complex hyperplasia with atypia, glands are markedly crowded and some have papillary infoldings. Nuclei show variable atypia.",

The presence of the uterine fundus suggests a septate uterus. ? Ultrasonography—septate uterus appears as two cavities without sagittal notching and the intercornual distance is less than 4.0 cm. Diagnosis of bicornuate uterus is favoured, if the fundal midpoint indentation is more than 5 mm above the inter-ostial line. ? Hysterosalpingography (HSG)— If the angle of divergence between the two uterine cavities is less then 75°, the defect is most likely to be septate uterus. If the angle of divergence is more then 75° but less then 105° a diagnosis of bicornuate uterus is made . ? Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—it is an accurate and noninvasive investigation to make a diagnosis of septate uterus. If the septum extends to more the. 30% of the septal cav- ity, surgical resection is indicated.",

Type 1: >50% within the endometrial cavity, but partially in the myometrium. Type 2: <50% in the cavity, mostly in the myometrium. Subserosal Fibroids (Projecting from the Outer Uterine Surface) Type 5: Mostly intramural, but extends to the serosal surface. Type 6: Predominantly subserosal, but with some myometrial involvement.

It is most commonly performed in women who present with infertility, as it helps identify conditions such as tubal blockage, uterine anomalies, or intrauterine adhesions that may interfere with conception. A. Heavy bleeding is incorrect because HSG is not typically done for evaluating heavy menstrual bleeding. While uterine abnormalities that cause heavy bleeding might be visualized, it is not the main indication. B. Dysmenorrhea is incorrect because HSG is not the primary investigation for painful menstruation. Conditions like endometriosis or adenomyosis are better assessed with ultrasound or MRI. D. Vaginal discharge is incorrect because HSG is not done to evaluate infections or discharge. In fact, active vaginal or pelvic infection is a contraindication for the procedure.",
