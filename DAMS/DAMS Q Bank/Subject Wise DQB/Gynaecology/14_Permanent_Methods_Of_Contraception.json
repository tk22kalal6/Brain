      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 120 hours. Correct Response: (D) 120 hours Emergency contraceptives are most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. However, they can still provide some level of efficacy up to 120 hours (5 days) after the event. The effectiveness of emergency contraception, such as the morning-after pill, decreases with time. Within this 120-hour window, the pill can prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation, fertilization, or implantation. It's important to note that the sooner emergency contraception is taken, the higher the effectiveness. Incorrect Responses: (A) 24 hours While taking emergency contraception within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse provides the highest efficacy, it is not the only effective time frame. Although emergency contraception is more effective the sooner it is taken, it can still be effective up to 120 hours. Therefore, the answer (A) is incorrect because it does not cover the full range of effective time. (B) 48 hours Emergency contraception is effective within 48 hours, but it can still be used up to 120 hours. However, as time progresses beyond 48 hours, the effectiveness decreases. Therefore, (B) is incorrect as it does not reflect the full window of effectiveness, which extends beyond 48 hours. (C) 72 hours Although many emergency contraceptives are often recommended to be taken within 72 hours, the effectiveness can still extend up to 120 hours (5 days). After 72 hours, the effectiveness of emergency contraception diminishes, but it can still be an option within the 120-hour period. Thus, (C) is incorrect because the correct answer is a longer timeframe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Laparoscopic tubal ligation with clips. Correct Response: (D) Laparoscopic tubal ligation with clips Laparoscopic tubal ligation with clips has the maximum chances of reversal because the clips can be removed or repositioned with relative ease. This technique involves placing small clips on the fallopian tubes, which can be undone if a woman decides to reverse her sterilization. The clips do not damage the tube permanently and offer the possibility of restoring tubal patency more successfully compared to other methods of tubal ligation. The success rate of reversal is highest in this method, making it the most reversible procedure for sterilization. Incorrect Responses: (A) Pomeroy’s tubal ligation Pomeroy’s technique involves excising a portion of the fallopian tube and tying the remaining ends. While this is a commonly used method, it involves more permanent changes to the tubes, and the success rate of reversal is lower compared to methods like clips or bands. The excision of a portion of the tube makes it difficult to restore tubal patency, thus reducing the chances of successful reversal. (B) Irwing’s technique The Irwing’s technique is another form of tubal ligation where the fallopian tubes are ligated and cut, sometimes with a portion being removed. Similar to the Pomeroy technique, this method involves a more permanent alteration to the fallopian tubes, making reversal more difficult and less likely to succeed compared to laparoscopic tubal ligation with clips. (C) Laparoscopic tubal ligation with silastic bands Laparoscopic tubal ligation with silastic bands involves placing rubber bands around the fallopian tubes to block them. While this method is effective at preventing pregnancy, the chances of reversal are not as high as with clips. The silastic bands can sometimes cause damage to the fallopian tubes during removal, making the reversal more difficult and less successful compared to clip-based ligation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 0.2%. Correct Response: (A) 0.2% Vasectomy is a highly effective form of contraception, with a failure rate of approximately 0.2%. This means that in about 2 out of every 1,000 men who undergo a vasectomy, the procedure may fail, resulting in unintended pregnancies. The failure can occur due to issues such as recanalization of the vas deferens or incorrect post-operative sperm clearance. Despite its very low failure rate, vasectomy is considered one of the most reliable permanent contraception methods. Incorrect Responses: (B) 1% A failure rate of 1% is higher than the actual failure rate of vasectomy. While vasectomy is highly effective, a 1% failure rate is not accurate based on current medical data. The true failure rate is closer to 0.2%, as mentioned above. (C) 3% A 3% failure rate is significantly higher than the actual rate of failure for vasectomy. While failure is possible due to recanalization or other rare factors, it is much less common than a 3% rate. This figure would indicate a much higher risk of failure than is typical for this procedure. (D) 10% A 10% failure rate would be far too high for a procedure like vasectomy, which is considered one of the most reliable forms of contraception. A failure rate this high would suggest that the procedure is not nearly as effective as it is, and it would not be considered a viable option for contraception with such a high likelihood of failure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vasectomy. Correct Response: (C) Vasectomy In a vasectomy, the procedure involves cutting or blocking the vas deferens (the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra), but it does not involve opening the peritoneum. The procedure is typically performed through small incisions in the scrotum, with no need to enter the abdominal cavity or the peritoneal space. Therefore, the peritoneum is not opened during this procedure. Incorrect Responses: (A) Mini lap In a mini-laparotomy (mini-lap) procedure, which is commonly used for female sterilization, a small incision is made on the abdomen, and the peritoneum is opened to access the fallopian tubes. This allows for tubal ligation to be performed, making the peritoneum an integral part of the procedure. (B) Laparoscopy In laparoscopy, which is another common method of female sterilization, small incisions are made in the abdomen, and the peritoneum is opened to allow access to the reproductive organs, including the fallopian tubes. The procedure is minimally invasive but still requires the peritoneum to be opened to access the tubal structures. (D) Transvaginal tubectomy A transvaginal tubectomy involves accessing the fallopian tubes through the vaginal route, with instruments inserted into the vagina. While the approach is different, the peritoneum is still opened in this procedure, as the tubes need to be accessed through the pelvic cavity.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Irving. Correct Response: (B) Irving The Irving method is not used for laparoscopic sterilization. This technique refers to a type of tubal ligation that involves cutting and tying the fallopian tubes through an abdominal incision, typically using a mini-laparotomy approach. It is a traditional, open procedure and is not performed laparoscopically. Therefore, it is the exception in this list of laparoscopic sterilization methods. Incorrect Responses: (A) Fallope ring The Fallope ring is one of the methods used in laparoscopic sterilization. In this procedure, a small ring is applied to the fallopian tube to block it, preventing the egg from meeting the sperm. This technique is commonly performed during laparoscopy, where the surgeon can visually confirm the placement of the ring. (C) Filshie clip The Filshie clip is another widely used method for laparoscopic sterilization. In this technique, a small titanium clip is placed around the fallopian tube to occlude it. The clip causes the tube to close off, preventing passage of eggs from the ovaries. This is a minimally invasive approach typically used in laparoscopic procedures. (D) Electrocoagulation Electrocoagulation is a method used in laparoscopic sterilization where the fallopian tubes are cauterized or sealed using electrical energy. This technique is effective in blocking the tubes and preventing fertilization. It is one of the standard methods used during laparoscopic tubal ligation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 10-15 mm Hg. Correct Response: (B) 10-15 mm Hg During laparoscopy, the intra-abdominal pressure is typically set between 10-15 mm Hg. This pressure range is considered optimal because it provides sufficient pneumoperitoneum (insufflation of carbon dioxide gas) to allow for proper visualization and space for the surgeon to operate, while also minimizing the risk of complications. Pressures higher than this range can lead to excessive discomfort, compromised blood flow, or damage to abdominal organs, while lower pressures might not provide adequate visualization or space for surgical manipulation. Incorrect Responses: (A) 5-8 mm Hg An intra-abdominal pressure of 5-8 mm Hg is too low for laparoscopy. It is generally not sufficient to create the pneumoperitoneum needed for proper visualization during the procedure. This pressure range may limit the working space and may not provide optimal conditions for laparoscopic surgery. (C) 20-25 mm Hg An intra-abdominal pressure of 20-25 mm Hg is too high and could lead to several complications, such as increased risk of injury to the bowel, diaphragm, or major blood vessels. High pressures can also compromise the venous return, leading to hypotension, and cause significant discomfort to the patient. Such high pressures are generally avoided unless required for specific surgical conditions and should only be maintained under close monitoring. (D) 30-35 mm Hg An intra-abdominal pressure of 30-35 mm Hg is considered excessive for standard laparoscopy. This high pressure increases the risk of significant complications, including impaired respiratory mechanics, compromised venous return, and potential injury to organs. This pressure range is typically avoided except in very rare and specific situations that require it, and only with very careful monitoring.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Leads to immediate sterility. Correct Response: (A) Leads to immediate sterility This statement is incorrect because vasectomy does not lead to immediate sterility. After a vasectomy, sperm may still be present in the semen for several months or several ejaculations before sterility is achieved. It typically takes around 3 months or 20-30 ejaculations for all remaining sperm to be cleared from the reproductive tract. Therefore, contraception should still be used during this period after the procedure until the semen analysis confirms azoospermia (absence of sperm). Incorrect Responses: (B) Failure rate is 0.1% The failure rate of vasectomy is indeed very low, around 0.1%. This means that in less than 1 out of 1000 cases, the procedure may fail, and the individual could still be able to father a child, typically due to failure of the sperm to be fully blocked by the procedure or recanalization of the vas deferens. (C) Involves ligation and division of spermatic cord This statement is correct. Vasectomy involves the ligation (tying off) and division (cutting) of the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the urethra. This effectively prevents sperm from mixing with the ejaculate, leading to male sterility. While the spermatic cord contains other structures such as blood vessels and nerves, it is primarily the vas deferens that is ligated and cut during the procedure. (D) Partner (wife) may be given DMPA for 3 months This statement is also correct. After a vasectomy, some couples may choose to use temporary contraception until the male partner’s sperm count is confirmed to be zero. One option is for the female partner to use DMPA (Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate), a form of injectable birth control, for about 3 months as a precautionary measure while waiting for the post-vasectomy semen analysis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Pomeroy method: It is a method for performing abdominal sterilization in females. A loop is formed 2 cm lateral to the uterine fundus. Avoiding the blood vessels, a round-bodied needle with 0 chromic catgut is passed through the mesosalpinx. The base of the loop is tied leaving about 2 cm of loop above the tie. Then about 1.5 cm of the loop is removed. The stumps are carefully inspected to ensure haemostasis. The rationale of the procedure is that since catgut suture is used, there will be prompt absorption of the ligature and subsequent separation of the cut ends. This will reduce the chance of failure. Hence, permanent suture material should not be used.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Vasectomy consists of dividing the vas deferens and disrupting the passage of sperms. It is done through a small incision in the scrotum, under local anaesthesia. The sterility is not immediate. The sperms are stored in the reproductive tract for up to 3 months. The couple must therefore abstain from intercourse during this period or use other methods of contraception. Approximately, 20 ejaculates clear the semen of all sperms. Two semen analysis reports must confirm the absence of sperms before the man can be declared sterile.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Falope rings are applied on mesosalpinx of the Fallopian tube. The statement about the image showing Falope rings not being true is D because the described object is not applied directly to the mesosalpinx of the Fallopian tube. The mesosalpinx is the portion of the broad ligament that supports the fallopian tube, but such devices (usually a form of intrauterine or tubal device like a sterilization clip or implant) are typically placed on the fallopian tube itself, not the mesosalpinx. Therefore, this is the incorrect option. Incorrect Options: A. Made of silicone: This is correct. The device in question is typically made of silicone, which is a material known for its flexibility and biocompatibility, making it suitable for medical applications, including those in the fallopian tube. B. Radio-opaque: This is correct. Devices like these are radio-opaque, meaning they are visible under X-ray or fluoroscopy. This feature is important for imaging and confirming the correct placement of the device in the body. C. Destroys 1.5-2 cm of tube length: This is correct. Many devices used for fallopian tube sterilization or blockage (like implants or clips) are designed to disrupt a specific portion of the tube, typically 1.5-2 cm in length, to prevent passage and achieve permanent sterilization.",
