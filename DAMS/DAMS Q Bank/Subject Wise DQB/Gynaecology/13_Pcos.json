      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Luteinizing hormone (LH). Explanation for Correct Answer (C): In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), there is an imbalance between the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Typically, LH levels are elevated in PCOS, which contributes to the anovulatory cycles (lack of ovulation) and the formation of multiple ovarian cysts. The elevated LH levels lead to increased androgen production (testosterone) by the ovaries, contributing to symptoms such as hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and scalp hair thinning. This hormonal imbalance is one of the key features of PCOS, making this the correct answer. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. 17-OH progesterone: 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) is a precursor in the synthesis of cortisol and is primarily involved in the adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis pathway. Elevated levels of 17-OHP can be seen in conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), but not typically in PCOS. In PCOS, the primary hormonal imbalance is related to LH and androgens, not 17-OHP. Therefore, this option is incorrect. B. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): In PCOS, FSH levels are often low or normal, but they are not elevated. The imbalance between low FSH and elevated LH is what leads to the failure of the follicles to mature properly, causing anovulation and cyst formation. Thus, elevated FSH is not a feature of PCOS, making this option incorrect. D. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is involved in regulating thyroid function and is not typically elevated in PCOS unless there is an underlying thyroid disorder. PCOS is not directly associated with abnormal TSH levels.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Hormonal changes in PCOD are : Enhanced serine phosphorylation unification activity in the ovary (hyperandrogen) and reduced insulin reception activity peripherally (insulin resistance). Insulin induces LH to cause thecal hyperplasia and secrete androgens, testosterone and epi-androstenedione which are converted to oestrogen in the granulose cells. Epi-androstenedione is converted in the peripheral fat to oestrone. This leads to rise in the oestrogen and inhibin level. These in turn cause high LH surge. LH level is raised over 10 IU/mL. FSH level remains normal, but FSH/LH ratio falls. While oestrone level increases, oestradiol level remains normal with the result that the oestrone/oestradiol ratio rises Prolactin is mildly raised in 15% cases. Fasting insulin is more than 10 mIU/L in PCOS in 50–70/cases. 9.

Menstruation for a couple of years may be normal, but clinical features of PCOS develop early with oligomenorrhoea (87%) or with a short period of amenorrhoea (26%) followed by prolonged or heavy periods ( a common complaint in a majority of cases). Dysmenorrhoea is absent. In the reproductive years, infertility accounts for about 20% cases. This is due to anovulatory cycles. During pregnancy, if the woman conceives, carbohydrate intolerance, diabetes and hypertension may develop. Pregnancy loss occurs in 20–30%.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) OCP (Oral Contraceptive Pills). Explanation for Correct Answer (A): The first step in the management of hirsutism in Stein-Leventhal syndrome (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - PCOS) is the use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). OCPs help by reducing the production of androgens (male hormones) from the ovaries, which is a key factor in the development of hirsutism in PCOS. They also help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. The hormonal components of OCPs, which include estrogen and progestin, work together to lower androgen levels and improve symptoms like excessive hair growth. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. HMG (Human Menopausal Gonadotropin): HMG is used in cases of infertility and works by stimulating the ovaries to produce eggs. While it can help with ovulation in women with PCOS who are trying to conceive, it does not directly address the issue of hirsutism. Thus, HMG is not the first line of treatment for hirsutism associated with PCOS. C. Spironolactone: Spironolactone is an anti-androgen medication that can be used to treat hirsutism by blocking the effects of androgens at the receptor level. However, it is typically used as a second-line treatment or in combination with OCPs after the initial control of androgen levels with hormonal contraception. Therefore, while effective, spironolactone is not the first step. D. Bromocriptine: Bromocriptine is used to treat conditions related to hyperprolactinemia, such as galactorrhea or infertility due to high prolactin levels. It is not commonly used for managing hirsutism or PCOS-related symptoms unless hyperprolactinemia is present. Thus, bromocriptine is not the first-line treatment for hirsutism in PCOS.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Osteoporosis. Explanation for Correct Answer (D): Osteoporosis is not typically associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). In fact, women with PCOS may have higher levels of estrogen, especially in the early years of the condition, which provides some protection against bone loss. However, later in life, especially after menopause, they may be at increased risk of osteoporosis due to lower levels of estrogen. But osteoporosis is not a common direct consequence of PCOS. The main metabolic concerns related to PCOS include insulin resistance and obesity, but not osteoporosis. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Ovarian Carcinoma: Women with PCOS are thought to have a slightly increased risk of ovarian carcinoma due to hormonal imbalances, such as elevated levels of androgens, and potentially the long-term lack of ovulation in some women. The chronic anovulation seen in PCOS is thought to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may, in rare cases, progress to endometrial cancer. B. Endometrial Carcinoma: The chronic anovulation in PCOS leads to unopposed estrogen exposure, which can cause the endometrium to become thickened, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma. This risk is particularly high in women with PCOS who are obese and have insulin resistance, which further exacerbates the condition. C. Insulin Resistance: Insulin resistance is a well-documented feature of PCOS, especially in women who are overweight or obese. Insulin resistance leads to compensatory high levels of insulin, which may exacerbate androgen production and result in symptoms like hirsutism and infertility. Therefore, insulin resistance is a hallmark of PCOS and plays a significant role in the metabolic abnormalities associated with the condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Insulin induces LH to cause thecal hyperplasia and secrete androgens, testosterone and epi-androstenedione which are converted to oestrogen in the granulose cells. Epi-androstenedione is converted in the peripheral fat to oestrone. This leads to rise in the oestrogen and inhibin level. These in turn cause high LH surge. LH level is raised over 10 IU/mL. FSH level remains normal, but FSH/LH ratio falls. While oestrone level increases, oestradiol level remains normal with the result that the oestrone/oestradiol ratio rises Prolactin is mildly raised in 15% cases. Fasting insulin is more than 10 mIU/L in PCOS in 50–70/cases. 9. Thyroid function tests may be abnormal (hypothyroidism). 17-a-hydroxyprogesterone in the follicular phase .300 ng/dL suggests adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Hyperandrogenism lowers the level of hepatic sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), so that the level of free testosterone rises leading to hirsutism. Normal androstenedione level is 1.3–1.5 ng/mL. DHEA .700 ng/mL suggests adrenal tumour. Hence answer here is option D",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Visual symptoms. Explanation for Correct Answer (D): Visual symptoms are a significant side effect of clomiphene citrate, and if they occur, the medication should be immediately stopped. These symptoms can include blurred vision, seeing spots, or flashes of light, and may indicate potential damage to the retina or other eye structures. This side effect is considered serious and requires discontinuation of the medication to prevent further complications. Regular monitoring of patients on clomiphene is important, especially if visual symptoms develop. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Hot flashes: While hot flashes are a common side effect of clomiphene citrate, they are not a reason to stop the medication. Hot flashes occur due to the medication’s action on the hypothalamus and can be uncomfortable, but they are typically not harmful. They are a temporary side effect that can be managed without discontinuing treatment. B. Multiple pregnancy: Multiple pregnancies, including twins or higher-order multiples, are an increased risk with clomiphene citrate use due to its stimulation of multiple follicles. However, this is a known and accepted risk when using clomiphene for infertility treatment. It does not require stopping the medication unless the pregnancy is deemed problematic or complications arise. C. Teratogenicity: Clomiphene citrate is not generally considered to be teratogenic (causing birth defects). Although there have been concerns about its long-term use and its potential to increase the risk of ovarian tumors or endometrial hyperplasia, clomiphene is not associated with significant teratogenic effects. Therefore, concerns about teratogenicity do not warrant immediate discontinuation of the medication.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) S. testosterone levels. Explanation for Correct Answer (B): The first investigation needed for a 30-year-old female with facial hair growth (hirsutism) and oligomenorrhea is measuring serum testosterone levels. Elevated testosterone levels can indicate hyperandrogenism, which is commonly associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of both hirsutism and menstrual irregularities. Testing for testosterone is critical in identifying whether the symptoms are related to PCOS or another condition involving excess androgens, such as adrenal disorders or ovarian tumors. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. TVS (Transvaginal Ultrasound): While a TVS can help assess the presence of polycystic ovaries (which is often seen in PCOS), it is not the first-line investigation for a patient with symptoms of hirsutism and oligomenorrhea. Testosterone levels should be checked first to rule out an androgen excess, and imaging like TVS can follow if needed for further evaluation. C. S. DHEAS levels: DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) is an androgen precursor that can be elevated in conditions like adrenal hyperplasia or adrenal tumors, but testosterone levels are more directly related to the presentation of hirsutism and oligomenorrhea. Testing serum DHEAS would be appropriate if an adrenal cause for the symptoms is suspected after evaluating testosterone levels. D. 17-OH progesterone levels: The measurement of 17-OH progesterone is typically used in the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), particularly if there is suspicion of adrenal disorders. However, in a patient presenting with hirsutism and oligomenorrhea, serum testosterone levels are more informative as an initial test to determine androgen excess from ovarian or adrenal sources before considering testing for CAH.",

This enlargement can be a sign of excessive androgen exposure, often seen in conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It can also be associated with virilization in females due to androgen excess from various causes. Measurement of clitoral size is important for diagnosing the underlying cause of the enlargement. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. >5 mm: A clitoris measuring 5 mm is still within the normal range and does not meet the criteria for clitoromegaly. A threshold of 10 mm is generally used to define clitoromegaly, as smaller measurements are not indicative of significant enlargement or androgen excess. B. >7 mm: While a 7 mm clitoris may be larger than usual, it still falls short of the 10 mm threshold for defining clitoromegaly. Clitoral enlargement is typically considered clinically significant at greater than 10 mm in length. D. >15 mm: A clitoris measuring greater than 15 mm is indeed significantly enlarged and would certainly indicate clitoromegaly. However, the standard cutoff for defining this condition is 10 mm, and this threshold is more commonly used in clinical practice for diagnosing and monitoring conditions related to androgen excess.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 25 – 29. Explanation for Correct Answer (B): The Body Mass Index (BMI) range of 25–29 is classified as overweight according to standard BMI categorization. BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters). This range indicates a higher weight than is typically considered normal, but not yet in the obese category. People in this range may be at increased risk for health issues like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, which makes it important to monitor their weight and overall health. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. 19 – 24: This range falls under the normal weight category for BMI, not overweight. A BMI of 19–24 is considered within the healthy weight range, where the risk for various diseases associated with underweight and obesity is generally lower. C. 30 – 34: This range is classified as obese (Class I) according to BMI standards. A BMI of 30–34 is considered a higher level of obesity, which carries a higher risk for serious health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. D. Less than 19: A BMI of less than 19 falls under the underweight category. Being underweight can lead to a range of health issues, including malnutrition, weakened immune system, and hormonal imbalances.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Danazol. Explanation for Correct Answer (C): Danazol is not typically used for managing hirsutism because it can actually increase the levels of testosterone and worsen symptoms of hirsutism. It is a synthetic androgen that works by inhibiting the secretion of gonadotropins and decreasing estrogen production, but it has androgenic side effects, such as promoting the development of male characteristics, including excessive hair growth. Therefore, it is contraindicated in women with hirsutism or other signs of excess androgen. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Spironolactone: Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is commonly used to treat hirsutism. It works by acting as an androgen receptor antagonist, which blocks the effect of androgens on the hair follicles, thus reducing excessive hair growth. It is one of the first-line treatments for hirsutism in women. B. GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone): GnRH agonists, such as leuprolide, are used in the treatment of hirsutism, especially when the cause is related to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). By suppressing ovarian steroidogenesis, they reduce the levels of testosterone, which helps manage hirsutism. D. OCPs (Oral Contraceptive Pills): Oral contraceptives, particularly those containing ethinyl estradiol and progestin, are commonly used to manage hirsutism. They work by reducing the levels of androgens (like testosterone) and preventing ovulation, which can help reduce the severity of hirsutism. OCPs can also regulate menstrual cycles and improve skin conditions such as acne and excess hair growth.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Spironolactone. Explanation for Correct Answer (A): Spironolactone is not used for infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is primarily used for managing hirsutism in women with PCOS because it works as an androgen receptor antagonist, blocking the effects of androgens (male hormones) like testosterone. However, it does not have a role in enhancing fertility, as it does not help stimulate ovulation or regulate menstrual cycles, which are necessary for conception. Therefore, it is not used for treating infertility in women with PCOS. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: B. Tamoxifen: Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor modulator, is used off-label to treat infertility in women with PCOS, especially when they do not respond to clomiphene. It works by stimulating the hypothalamus to release gonadotropins (FSH and LH), which help induce ovulation. Therefore, tamoxifen can be used for fertility treatment in PCOS. C. Clomiphene: Clomiphene citrate is the first-line treatment for infertility in women with PCOS. It is an estrogen receptor antagonist that works by stimulating ovulation. By blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, it increases the release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), which promote follicular development and ovulation. D. OC pill (Oral Contraceptive Pills): While oral contraceptives are primarily used for managing menstrual irregularities and controlling symptoms like acne and hirsutism in PCOS, they are not used for infertility directly. However, OC pills can help regulate cycles and reduce hyperandrogenism, thus creating a more conducive environment for fertility treatment later on. In some cases, they are used as part of a pre-treatment regimen to help manage symptoms before using other fertility treatments.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Cytokine involved in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is VEGF. OHSS: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome • OHSS is a medical complication that is both completely iatrogenic and unique to stimulatory infertility treatment. Its symptoms are the result of ovarian enlargement and fragility, extravascular fluid accumulation, and intravascular volume depletion. • Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), whose expression in granulosa cells and serum is augmented by hCG, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. • Two distinct patterns of OHSS onset have been described. Early OHSS occurs 3 to 7 days following the hCG trigger and is associated with the administration of exogenous hCG. • Late onset disease occurs 9 days after the hCG trigger; it is the result of endogenous hCG secretion from the pregnancy and tends to be more severe with multiple gestation. Severity Classification: Mild OHSS (grades 1 and 2) is associated with high serum estradiol levels and ovarian enlargement to less than 5 cm and has minimal clinical significance. Grade 3 moderate OHSS is accompanied by mild abdominal distention and has minimal clinical significance. Grade 4 moderate OHSS is accompanied by gastrointestinal upset and ovarian enlargement to 5 to 12 cm. The presence of fluid shift from intra- to extravascular spaces are the hallmark of severe disease. Grade 5 OHSS includes tense ascites or hydrothorax. Grade 6 OHSS is accompanied by haemoconcentration, coagulation abnormalities, respiratory failure, and renal dysfunction.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Raised SHBG. Explanation for Correct Answer (C): In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) levels are typically low, not raised. SHBG binds to sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen, and lower levels of SHBG can result in higher free testosterone levels, contributing to the hyperandrogenism seen in PCOS. Therefore, a raised SHBG is not consistent with PCOS and is the incorrect answer here. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Raised LH (Luteinizing Hormone): A raised LH is a classic finding in PCOS. Elevated LH relative to FSH is often observed in women with PCOS and is thought to be a key factor contributing to the ovarian dysfunction seen in the syndrome. The elevated LH levels drive the production of androgens in the ovaries, leading to symptoms like hirsutism and acne. B. Normal FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone): In PCOS, FSH levels are often normal or low, but it is the elevated LH that causes an abnormal LH:FSH ratio. This disrupted ratio is a hallmark of the syndrome, and the fact that FSH is normal is consistent with the diagnosis of PCOS. D. Normal prolactin: In women with PCOS, prolactin levels are typically normal. Elevated prolactin is more commonly associated with other conditions, such as prolactinoma, but not with PCOS. Therefore, normal prolactin levels are typical in PCOS, making this statement correct. In summary, raised SHBG (option C) is not associated with PCOS, while the other laboratory findings (raised LH, normal FSH, and normal prolactin) are consistent with the syndrome.",

DHEAS is a marker of adrenal androgen producTIon; when normal, it essenTIally excludes adrenal sources of hyperandrogenism. Several medications have been used to treat hirsutism associated with PCOS. For many years, contraceptives were the most frequently used agents; they can suppress hair growth in up to two-thirds of treated patients. They act by directly suppressing ovarian steroid production and increasing hepatic-binding globulin production, which binds circulating hormone and lowers the concentration of metabolically active (free unbound) androgen. However, clinical improvement can take as long as 6 months to manifest. Other medications that have shown promise include medroxyprogesterone acetate, spironolactone, cimetidine, and GnRH agonists, which suppress ovarian steroid production. However, GnRH analogues are expensive and have been associated with signi?cant bone demineralization after only 6 months of therapy in some patients.

She started having heavy vaginal bleeding 8 days ago. On arrival at the emergency room, the patient has a supine blood pressure of 102/64 mm Hg with a pulse of 96 bpm but has orthostatic hypotension. While you wait for lab work to come back, you order intravenous fluids. After 2 hours, the patient is no longer orthostatic. A transvaginal ultrasound showed an atrophic appearing endometrial stripe. She continues to have heavy bleeding. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) The transvaginal ultrasound helps to direct the next step in the care of this patient. Her endometrial stripe is thin suggesting that she has shed her endometrium to its basalis layer. In women who have su?ered heavy and acute bleeding and have an atrophic endometrium, 25 mg of conjugated estrogen should be administered every 4 hours until the bleeding subsides. Estrogen will help stop the bleeding by rebuilding the endometrium and stimulating clotting at the capillary level. Since this patient’s bleeding is due to an atrophic endometrium, estrogen therapy is the preferred treatment. Had the transvaginal ultrasound shown a thickened endometrial stripe, hysteroscopy and D&C is indicated as it will stop the bleeding more rapidly than medical treatment. In older women, a D&C might be helpful in obtaining tissue for pathology to rule out endometrial cancer. In this young patient who is resuscitated and stabilized with intravenous ?uids, there is no indication for a blood transfusion as long as the bleeding abates. Iron therapy alone would not be adequate for this patient; the bleeding must be stopped ?rst.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Vaginal bleeding after a 5-day course of progesterone oral therapy. Explanation for Correct Answer (C): In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), anovulation is a common feature, which results in irregular or absent menstrual cycles. Progesterone therapy is used to induce a withdrawal bleed, and vaginal bleeding after a 5-day course of progesterone is consistent with this condition. The presence of vaginal bleeding after progesterone therapy indicates that the endometrium was not continuously exposed to estrogen, and progesterone was able to induce a shedding of the endometrial lining, a sign that the patient is likely not ovulating regularly. Explanation for Incorrect Answers: A. Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level: An elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is more suggestive of a condition like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is characterized by an enzyme deficiency in the adrenal glands leading to an increase in androgens. This is not typical in PCOS, where the hormonal imbalance is usually due to an increase in LH and testosterone but does not involve a significant elevation in 17-hydroxyprogesterone. B. Finding of a 9-cm right ovarian mass: A 9-cm ovarian mass is more concerning for a benign ovarian tumor or potentially an ovarian cyst, but it is not characteristic of PCOS. In PCOS, the ovaries often contain multiple small cysts, typically measuring 2-9 mm, rather than a large solitary cystic mass. A large ovarian mass warrants further investigation to rule out conditions such as an ovarian neoplasm. D. DEXA scan showing osteopenia: Although women with PCOS can have an increased risk of insulin resistance and obesity, which can indirectly affect bone health, osteopenia is not a characteristic finding of PCOS itself. In fact, some studies suggest that women with PCOS may actually have a higher bone density due to the effects of elevated androgens or estrogen dominance, though long-term effects on bone health still require attention. Osteopenia is not a direct feature of PCOS. In conclusion, vaginal bleeding after a 5-day course of progesterone oral therapy (option C) is the most consistent finding with PCOS, while the other options describe findings that are more indicative of other conditions.",
