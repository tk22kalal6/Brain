These include:\r\n\r\n• Lower end of femur — appears before birth (around 9th month of intrauterine life).\r\n\r\n• Upper end of tibia — appears just before or at birth.\r\n\r\n• Calcaneus — the primary ossification center appears during fetal life.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the radius ossifies after birth (around 5 years of age). Hence, it is not ossified at birth.",
