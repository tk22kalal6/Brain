      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nOn exposure to hypoxia, there is closure and decreased potassium conductance through O2 sensitive potassium channels on glomus cells. Accumulation of positive charge within the glomus cells depolarizes the cells. This leads to opening of voltage gated calcium channels and calcium influx. Increase in intracellular calcium causes release of dopamine by the glomus cells. Dopamine combines with its receptors (D2) on the ninth nerve terminal, exciting the nerve terminals. Impulses go to the respiratory centre in the medulla resulting in an increase in rate and depth of ventilation.\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nAcclimatization to high altitude is due to the operation of a number of compensatory mechanisms.\r\nThese include:-\r\n- Increased urinary excretion of bicarbonates. High altitude results in hypoxic hypoxia stimulating the peripheral chemoreceptors. The resulting hyperventilation results in respiratory alkalosis. Alkalosis suppresses the chemoreceptor response. Kidneys increase the urinary excretion of bicarbonates reducing the pH bringing it back towards normal. This increases the response to hypoxia.\r\n- Shift of OHDC to the right- respiratory alkalosis at high altitude causes a shift of the OHDC to the left, but a concomitant increase in red blood cell 2,3- DPG shifts the OHDC to the right. The net effect is shift to right and a small increase in P50.\r\n- Increased secretion of erythropoietin- hypoxia is potent stimulus for secretion of EPO from the kidneys.\r\n- Hypoxia causes increase in the number of mitochondria, which are the site of oxidative\r\nreactions. \r\n-Myoglobin also increases which facilitates the movement of O2 to the tissues. The tissue\r\ncontent of cytochrome enzymes also increases.\r\n\r\n",

Acetylcholine diffuses to nicotinic cholinergic (NM) receptors that are concentrated at the tops of the junctional folds of the membrane of the motor endplate. Binding of acetylcholine to these receptors increases the Na+ and K+ conductance, though the movement of sodium predominates. The resultant influx of Na+ produces a depolarizing potential, the endplate potential. The current sink created by this local potential depolarizes the adjacent muscle membrane to its firing level. Action potentials are generated on either side of the endplate and are conducted away from the endplate in both directions along the muscle fiber. The muscle action potential, in turn, initiates muscle contraction. Acetylcholine is then removed from the synaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase, which is present in high concentration at the neuromuscular junction.</span></span></p>\r\n",

The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence of surfactant in the fluid lining the alveoli. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like an alveolus, the distending pressure (P) equals two times the tension (T) divided by the radius (r; P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force; such a force would greatly favor transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli.</span></span></p>\r\n",

Its secretion is stimulated by glucose and fat in the duodenum, and because in large doses it inhibits gastric secretion and motility, it was named gastric inhibitory peptide. However, it now appears that it does not have significant gastric inhibiting activity when administered in smaller amounts comparable to those seen after a meal. In the meantime, it was found that GIP stimulates insulin secretion. Gastrin, CCK, secretin, and glucagon also have this effect, but GIP is the only one of these that stimulates insulin secretion when administered at blood levels comparable to those produced by oral glucose. For this reason, it is often called <strong>glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide</strong>. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The glucagon derivative GLP-1 (7&ndash;36) also stimulates insulin secretion and is said to be more potent in this regard than GIP.

Urea transport is mediated by urea transporters, presumably by facilitated diffusion. There are at least four isoforms of the transport protein UT-A in the kidneys (UT-A1 to UT-A4); UT-B is found in erythrocytes and in the descending limbs of the vasa recta. Urea transport in the collecting duct is mediated by UT-A1 and UT-A3, and both are regulated by vasopressin. During antidiuresis, when vasopressin is high, the amount of urea deposited in the medullary interstitium increases, thus increasing the concentrating capacity of the kidney. In addition, the amount of urea in the medullary interstitium and, consequently, in the urine varies with the amount of urea filtered, and this in turn varies with the dietary intake of protein. Therefore, a high- protein diet increases the ability of the kidneys to concentrate the urine and a low-protein diet reduces the kidneys&rsquo; ability to concentrate the urine.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/A79.jpg\" style=\"height:237px; width:333px\" />​​​​​​​</span></span></p>\r\n",
