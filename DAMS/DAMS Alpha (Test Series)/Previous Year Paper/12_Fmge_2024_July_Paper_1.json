Hence this patient will benefit from nicotinamide supplements.\r\nNiacin deficiency is mostly seen among people eating corn/maize-based diets, which are low in niacin and tryptophan. Excess leucine in jowar and maize disrupts the conversion of tryptophan to niacin.\r\n",

This allows it to replicate unchecked. M. tuberculosis recruits a host protein coronin to block the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. Th1 response to M. tuberculosis is mounted about three weeks following the infection. The antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present mycobacterial antigens to the T-cells in the lymph nodes and release IL-12 and IL-18 to cause the differentiation of T-cells into Th1 cells. Th1 cells produce IFN-Y. IFN-y is the critical step in the body’s defense against M. tuberculosis. It acts by activating macrophages, causing phagolysosome maturation, and inducing nitric oxide synthase enzyme to form more reactive nitrogen species. It also mobilizes anti- bacterial compounds like defensins and stimulates autophagy.\r\n",

Metoclopramide is useful in this condition because it increases LES tone, preventing acid reflux, and enhances gastric emptying by promoting gastrointestinal motility.

It is characterized by excessive flaccidity of the supraglottic larynx which is sucked in during inspiration producing stridor and sometimes cyanosis. The presentation is just after birth and subsides by 2 years. Stridor improves(decreases) in the prone position, and worsens during feeding. The cry is normal. Laryngomalacia leads to the collapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration which results in airway obstruction.\r\n",

This discoloration is due to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, which can occur from smoke in an enclosed space.\r\nThe colour of postmortem staining in CO poisoning is cherry red. Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of organic materials, such as wood. When inhaled, CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood with an affinity approximately 240 times greater than that of oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). This reduces the oxygen- carrying capacity of the blood, leading to tissue hypoxia.\r\n\r\n",

It is likely to be caused by vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D, also known as cholecalciferol, plays a significant role in calcium and phosphate levels homeostasis. Its active form, calcitriol or 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol is produced by sequential hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys. It primarily increases the serum calcium and phosphate levels.
