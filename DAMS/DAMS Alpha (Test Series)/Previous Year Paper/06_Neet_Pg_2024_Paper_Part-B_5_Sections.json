      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) Systemic Isoretinoin The presence of multiple nodular and cystic lesions over the face and upper back implies that this is a case of acne vulgaris. Systemic Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne. Systemic retinoids are a very efficient treatment for acne vulgaris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their mechanism of action is&nbsp;by inhibiting the&nbsp;formation of keratin, a protein that can clog pores and cause&nbsp;acne. Oral retinoids are usually reserved for severe cases of acne&nbsp;that do not respond to topical creams and gels.&nbsp;Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous<br />\r\nunit. Comedonal lesions are the earliest lesions of acne. They&nbsp;represent the keratin plugs of the pilosebaceous duct.&nbsp;When the keratin plug is inside the follicle, it is called a closed&nbsp;comedone (whitehead). When the keratin plug is exposed to the&nbsp;environment, it gets oxidized by the air and turns black which is&nbsp;known as open comedone (blackhead).</p>\r\n",

Age-specific IGF-1 levels are used for screening. Diagnosis is confirmed by administering a 75g oral glucose load; normally, growth hormone (GH) should suppress to less than 0.4 &micro;g/L. Failure to suppress GH confirms acromegaly, caused by growth hormone hypersecretion from a pituitary adenoma or extra pituitary lesions. If it occurs before growth plate fusion at puberty, it leads to gigantism.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This condition may present as a solitary adenoma or as part of genetic syndromes like MEN syndromes. Elevated parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium through bone resorption, intestinal absorption, and renal reabsorption. Primary hyperparathyroidism is often asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as bone pain, renal stones, abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric issues, fatigue, and proximal muscle weakness. Excess calcium may also deposit in the cornea, blood vessels, and other tissues.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Affected children often have oral thrush, extensive diaper rash, and failure to thrive. Some may develop a morbilliform rash shortly after birth due to maternal T cells causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). SCID patients are highly susceptible to recurrent severe infections from pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Pseudomonas, cytomegalovirus, and varicella. Thymus biopsy shows remnants of Hassall&rsquo;s corpuscles, indicating severe immune impairment, primarily affecting T cells and leading to significant underdevelopment of lymphoid tissues.</p>\r\n",

If left untreated, congenital cataracts, especially unilateral cataracts, can lead to amblyopia, a condition where one eye fails to develop normal vision due to insufficient visual input. Immediate surgical intervention is crucial not only to remove the cataract and restore visual clarity but also to minimize the risk of amblyopia, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the child&rsquo;s visual and developmental health.

That lies in the range of 110-130 mmHg. Applying negative pressure appears to hasten debridement and the formation of granulation tissue in chronic wounds and ulcers. It acts by decreasing edema, by removing interstitial fluid, and as a result, helps in decreasing bacterial counts and cell proliferation increases.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This effect of competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration by which maximum velocity can still be achieved. Therefore, Vmax (maximum velocity of the reaction) is unaltered in this type of inhibition. However, the concentration of the substrate required to achieve half of the maximum velocity is increased.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPendrin\r\nPendrin is the channel responsible for transporting iodine from\r\nthe follicle to the colloid in thyroid hormone synthesis. The\r\nprocess begins with iodide uptake via the sodium-iodide\r\nsymporter (NIS) in the basolateral membrane, which actively\r\ntransports iodide into follicular cells. Then, pendrin transports it\r\ninto the colloid. Thyroglobulin (Tg), a glycoprotein rich in\r\ntyrosine, is synthesized by follicular cells. Iodination of Tg is\r\nregulated by thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which oxidizes iodide to\r\niodine, links iodine to tyrosine residues to form\r\nmonoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT), and couples\r\nthese to produce triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine\r\n(T4). Thyroid hormones are stored in colloid form bound to Tg\r\nfor 2-3 months. Upon release, iodinated Tg is endocytosed,\r\ncleaved by lysosomal enzymes into MIT, DIT, T3, and T4, with\r\nT4 (80%) and T3 (20%) released into the bloodstream. T4 is\r\nconverted to the active form T3 in peripheral tissues. Pendred\r\nsyndrome, caused by mutations in pendrin, results in goiter and\r\nsensorineural hearing loss.",
