During angina episodes, as well as during\r\nasymptomatic ischemia, the characteristic ECG change is horizontal or downsloping ST-segment\r\ndepression that reverses after the ischemia disappears. T wave flattening or inversion may also\r\noccur. Beta-blockers should be considered for first-line therapy in most patients with chronic angina.\r\nPatients should receive a combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents on presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 30: 2 Explanation: For basic life support trained healthcare provider\r\nshould check for a pulse (taking no longer than 10 s) and assess breathing and start chest\r\ncompressions without delay and administered at a rate of 100-120/min depressing the sternum by 5\r\ncm. ? For advanced life support, the initial priority is to assess the patient's cardiac rhythm by\r\nattaching a defibrillator or monitor and start CPR at a rate of 30:2 by the resuscitation team. (For one\r\nhealthcare provider, the compression-ventilation ratio should be 30:2 for all age groups, and for two\r\n2\r\nrescuers; the compression-ventilation ratio should be 30:2 in adults and 15:2 in infants, children, and\r\nadolescents (Ghai). Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia should be treated with\r\nimmediate defibrillation by a biphasic shock defibrillator. Defibrillation is usually administered using a\r\n150-joule biphasic shock, and CPR resumed immediately for 2 minutes without confirming the\r\nrestoration of a pulse because restoration cardiac output rarely occurs immediately after\r\ndefibrillation, biphasic shocks of 150-200 joules should be given every 2 minutes after each cycle of\r\nCPR. Pulseless electrical activity should be treated by continuing CPR and adrenaline and looking for\r\nthe cause. Asystole should be treated similarly, with the additional support of atropine and\r\nsometimes external or transvenous pacing to generate electrical rhythm. After the restoration of\r\nnormal rhythm, the ABCDE approach, aiming for Sp02 of 94-99%, aim for normal PaCO2, 12-lead\r\nECG, to treat the precipitating cause, and management target temperature should be done. ? During\r\nCPR following should be ensured: high-quality chest compressions, minimizing interruptions to\r\ncompressions, providing oxygen, use of waveform capnography, performing continuous compressions\r\nwhen advanced airway in place, IV cannulation (intravenous or interosseous), giving adrenaline every\r\n3-5 min, give amiodarone after 3 shocks ? Reversible causes are (4H) ie. Hypoxia, Hypovolaemia,\r\nHypokalaemia (Davidson)/hyperkalemia/ metabolic imbalance, Hypothermia/ hyperthermia\r\n(Davidson) and (4T) ie. Thrombosis ( coronary or pulmonary), Tension pneumothorax, Tamponade (\r\ncardiac), Toxins and drugs (ghai)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Overnight Polysomnogram Explanation: This is a case of Obstructive\r\nSleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome. Some important points regarding OSASH ? Clinical feature: -\r\nSnoring (a most common complaint) gasping or snorting during sleep, dyspnea is unusual, and its\r\nabsence usually distinguishes OSAHS from paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, nocturnal asthma, and\r\nacid reflux with laryngospasm. Frequent awakening or sleep disruption, which is more common\r\namong women and older (M>F as in Davidson). The most common daytime symptom is excessive\r\nsleepiness, difficulty maintaining alertness or involuntary periods of dozing, and fatigue. Other\r\nsymptoms are dry mouth, nocturnal heartburn, diaphoresis of the chest and neck, nocturia, morning\r\nheadaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, and mood disturbances. Difficulty falling asleep and\r\nmaintaining sleep are characteristics of insomnia disorders but may occur with OSAHS, especially in\r\nwomen. Patients may exhibit hypertension and regional (central) obesity, as indicated by a large\r\nwaist and neck circumference. ? An overnight polysomnogram is the gold standard for diagnosis. A\r\nnegative in-laboratory polysomnogram usually rules out OSAHS. False-negative studies can result if\r\nthere was insufficient REM sleep or inadequate supine sleep during testing. Various imaging studies,\r\nincluding cephalometric radiography, MRI, CT, and fiberoptic endoscopy, can be used to identify\r\nanatomic risk factors for OSAHS. ? As appropriate, treatment should aim to reduce weight, optimize\r\nsleep duration (7-9 h), regulate sleep schedules, avoid sleeping in the supine position, treat nasal\r\nallergies, increase physical activity, and eliminate alcohol ingestion. ? The major risk factors are\r\nobesity (40-60%) and male sex. Others include mandibular retrognathia and micrognathia, a positive\r\nfamily history of OSAHS, genetic syndromes that reduce upper airway patency (e.g., Down syndrome,\r\nTreacher-Collins syndrome), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (especially in children), menopause (in\r\nwomen), and endocrine (e.g., acromegaly, hypothyroidism). ? High risks for OSAHS-related\r\nmorbidities are hypertension, DM, and cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. ? CPAP is the standard\r\nmedical therapy with the highest level of evidence for efficacy.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 1, 2 and 4 1. Intestinal lymphangiectasia: This condition is characterized\r\nby dilated and dysfunctional lymphatic vessels in the small intestine. This directly leads to the\r\nleakage of lymph (which is rich in protein) into the intestinal lumen, causing protein-losing\r\nenteropathy. This is a primary cause. 2. Constrictive pericarditis: This is a heart condition where the\r\npericardium (the sac around the heart) becomes thick and stiff, impairing the heart's ability to fill\r\nwith blood. This can lead to increased systemic venous pressure, which in turn can increase\r\nlymphatic pressure in the abdomen and cause secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia and thus\r\nprotein-losing enteropathy. 3. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: This is an inflammatory condition\r\ncharacterized by eosinophil infiltration of parts of the gastrointestinal tract. While it can cause\r\nmalabsorption and other GI symptoms, its primary mechanism for protein loss is typically not\r\nobstruction of intestinal lymphatic vessels, but rather inflammation and mucosal damage. 4.\r\nWhipple's disease: This is a rare systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma\r\nwhipplei. It primarily affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption. A key feature of Whipple's\r\ndisease is the infiltration of the lamina propria with foamy macrophages, which can obstruct\r\nlymphatic flow in the intestine. This lymphatic obstruction is a known cause of protein-losing\r\nenteropathy in Whipple's disease. Based on this analysis, the conditions that cause protein-losing\r\nenteropathy due to obstruction of intestinal lymphatic vessels are: 1. Intestinal lymphangiectasia\r\n(primary lymphatic obstruction) 2. Constrictive pericarditis (leading to secondary lymphatic\r\nobstruction/lymphangiectasia due to increased venous pressure) 4. Whipple's disease (due to\r\nmacrophage infiltration causing lymphatic obstruction)",

The enzyme (G6PD) have a role in the hexose\r\nmonophosphate shunt pathway. It is the most common human enzymopathy, affecting 10% of the\r\npopulation, with a geographical distribution that parallels the malaria belt because heterozygotes are\r\nprotected from malarial parasitization. The enzyme is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome. The\r\ndeficiency affects males and rare homozygous females but females are carriers. The most common\r\ntypes associated with normal activity are the B+ enzyme present in most Caucasians and 70% of\r\nAfro-Caribbeans; deficiency in Caucasian and East Asian populations is more severe, with enzyme\r\nlevels as low as 1%. ? Clinical features: Acute drug-induced hemolysis due to analgesics( aspirin,\r\nphenacetin, etc), antimalarials (primaquine, quinine, chloroquine, pyrimethamine), antibiotics (\r\nsulphonamides, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin), miscellaneous (quinidine, probenecid, vitamin K,\r\ndapsone), chronic compensated hemolysis, infection or acute illness, neonatal jaundice (may be a\r\nfeature of the B- enzyme), favism (acute hemolysis after ingestion of broad beans) ? Lab diagnosis:-\r\nThe blood film will show: bite cells (red cells with a 'bite' of membrane missing), blister cells (red cells\r\nwith surface blistering of the membrane), irregularly shaped small cells, polychromasia reflecting the\r\nreticulocytosis, Heinz bodies within the red cell, cytoplasm with a supravital stain such as methyl\r\nviolet. Indirect or direct assessment of G6DP level, increase reticulocyte level. ? Treatment is blood\r\ntransfusion, withdrawal of cause.",

Necrobiosis lipoidica is an uncommon disorder that has some histological features in common with granuloma annulare. The\r\nlesion has a characteristic yellow, waxy, atrophic appearance, often with a violaceous edge: typically appears on the shins and is prone to ulceration after trauma. There is a strong association with diabetes: most patients with necrobiosis lipoidica have or develop diabetes, although less than 19% of diabetic patients develop necrobiosis lipoidica. Treatment is difficult and includes very potent topical or intralesional glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, PUVA or UVAl phototherapy, and systemic immunosuppression. Acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmented velvety plaques seen on the neck, axilla, or extensor surfaces) is sometimes a feature of severe insulin resistance and\r\naccompanying diabetes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) sGLT-2 inhibitors Explanation: Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2\r\n(SGLT2) Inhibitors (Empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin) These agents lower the blood\r\nglucose by selectively inhibiting this co-transporter, which is expressed almost exclusively in the\r\nproximal, convoluted tubule of the kidney. It inhibits glucose reabsorption, leading to increase\r\nglycosuria. Inhibition of SGLT2 on the alpha cell may lead to increased glucagon and consequently\r\nliver production of glucose and ketones. SGLT2 act on distal tubules Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors\r\n(Acarbose and miglitol) delay carbohydrate absorption in the gut by inhibiting disaccharidases. The\r\nincretin effect is the augmentation of insulin secretion when a glucose stimulus is given orally rather\r\nthan IV, which reflects the release of incretin peptides from the gut.The incretin hormones are\r\nprimarily glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which potentiate\r\ninsulin secretion. These are rapidly broken down by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). The incretin effect\r\nis diminished in type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and\r\nalogliptin), prevent breakdown and therefore enhance concentrations of endogenous GLP-1 and GIP\r\nGLP-1 receptor agonists (? Insulin, ? glucagon, slow gastric emptying, satiety) have a similar structure\r\nto GLP-1. Given subcutaneously. It delays gastric emptying and, at the level of the hypothalamus,\r\ndecreases appetite. GLP-1 receptor agonists include exenatide (twice daily), exenatide modifiedrelease\r\n(once weekly), liraglutide (once daily), lixisenatide (once daily), and albiglutide (once weekly).\r\nThiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone) reduce insulin resistance by binding to the peroxisome proliferatoractivated\r\nreceptor Y (PPAR-Y) nuclear receptor.",

Autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and iatrogenic thyroid failure following \"I or surgical treatment of thyrotoxicosis account for over 90% of cases,\r\nexcept in areas where iodine deficiency is endemic. Some patients remain symptomatic despite normalization of TSH after taking levothyroxine and may wish to take extra levothyroxine, which suppresses TSH. However, suppressed TSH is a risk factor for osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation. Thyroid hormone requirements are increased by up to 45% during pregnancy in levothyroxinetreated hypothyroid women. Investigation: In primary hypothyroidism due to intrinsic cause Measurements of serum T3 are unhelpful because they do not differentiate between euthyroidism and hypothyroidism. If the TSH is elevated, serum T4 is low and TSH is elevated, usually in excess of 20 mIU/L. an unbound T4 level is needed to confirm the presence of clinical hypothyroidism, but T4 is 25 inferior to TSH as a screening test because it does not detect subclinical hypothyroidism. Etiology may be identified by the presence of TPO and Tg antibodies, which are present in >95% of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism. Other laboratory findings in hypothyroidism may include increased creatine phosphokinase, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, and anemia (usually normocytic or macrocytic) Treatment - Levothyroxine replacement. Start with a low dose of 50 ug per day for 3 weeks, then 100 μg per day for 3 weeks, and finally to a maintenance dose of 100-150 μg per day. Levothyroxine has a half-life of 7 days so always be taken as a single daily dose and TSH repeat after 6 weeks to adjust the dose. Reduction in weight and periorbital puffiness occurs quickly but the restoration of skin and hair texture and resolution of any effusions may take 3-6 months.

When there is\r\nuncertainty, drugs effective against resistant P. falciparum should be used which are atovaquone+\r\nproguanil (Malarone), doxycycline, or mefloquine. Pregnant women planning to visit malarious areas\r\nshould be warned about the potential risks and advised to avoid all nonessential travel. Mefloquine is\r\nthe only drug used in the second and third trimesters for pregnant women traveling to areas with\r\ndrug-resistant malaria. Chloroquine and proguanil are regarded as safe, but there are now very few\r\nregions where these drugs can be recommended for protection. Travelers should start taking\r\nantimalarial drugs 2 days to 2 weeks before departure and continue for 4 weeks after the traveler has\r\nleft the endemic area, except if atovaquone+ proguanil or primaquine has been taken; these drugs\r\nhave significant activities against the liver stage of the infection and can be discontinued 1 week\r\nafter departure from the endemic area. Mefloquine is contraindicated in persons allergic to this drug\r\nor related compounds (eg, quinine and quinidine) and persons with active or recent depression,\r\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, other major psychiatric disorders, or seizures.\r\nDoxycycline is contraindicated in children c8 years and in pregnant women > 15 weeks of gestation.\r\nAtovaquone-proguanil is contraindicated in persons with severe renal impairment (creatinine\r\nclearance rate, 30 mL/min). It is not recommended for children weighing 5 kg, pregnant women, or\r\nwomen breastfeeding infants weighing &lt;5 kg.",

This is most commonly\r\nobserved in hands (adduction of thumbs along with extension of the proximal interphalangeal joints\r\nand flexion of distal interphalangeal joints) and feet (flexion and internal rotation of lower limbs)\r\nresulting in carpopedal spasm. ? Tapping the facial nerve at the angle of jaw results in contraction of\r\nfacial muscles (Chvostek sign). Inflating blood pressure cuff above the chillie blood pressure for more\r\nthan 5 minutes triggers spasm of the hand muscles (Trousseau sign). Hypocalcemia should be\r\nconsidered in children with seizures, dilated cardiomyopathy and unexplained stridor. ? The diagnosis\r\nis confirmed by the demonstration of prolonged QT.",
