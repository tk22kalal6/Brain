      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trigeminal nerve</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The response of blinking when the clinician touches the patient&rsquo;s eye with a piece of cotton is known as the corneal reflex. The sensation is transmitted by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), while the motor response Is controlled by the facial nerve (CN VII).<br />\r\nThe corneal reflex Is an involuntary, protective response that causes blinking when the cornea is stimulated, such as by a light touch. It serves as a defence mechanism to prevent foreign objects from entering the eye and causing damage. The reflex involves two main components: sensory input and motor output. The sensation of touch or irritation on the cornea is detected by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V), specifically its nasociliary branch, which sends the signal to the brainstem.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The tract responsible for maintaining balance in this situation is the vestibulospinal tract.<br />\r\nVestibular nuclei are situated in the pons and medulla oblongata beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle. The vestibular nuclei receive afferent fibres from the inner ear through the vestibular nerve and from the cerebellum. Neurons of the lateral vestibular nucleus give rise to the axons that form the vestibulospinal tract. The tract descends uncrossed through the medulla and through the length of the spinal cord in the anterior white column. The fibres terminate by synapsing with internuncial neurons of the anterior grey column of the spinal cord.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The blue color represents the left ear, with bone conduction (BC) thresholds above 25 dB, indicating sensorineural impairment. Air conduction (AC) thresholds are also elevated above 15 dB, suggesting abnormal AC. The presence of both abnormal AC and BC, along with an air-bone gap, confirms mixed hearing loss, which involves both conductive and sensorineural pathways. This type of hearing loss is commonly seen in conditions like chronic suppurative otitis media and otosclerosis.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Rabies vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease after exposure.<br />\r\nThe post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen includes thorough wound cleaning, administration of the rabies vaccine, and in severe cases (Category 3 exposure), rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) for immediate virus neutralization. The rabies vaccine is administered in a series of intramuscular or intradermal doses, following schedules like the Essen regimen (0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days) or the Zagreb regimen (0, 7, and 21 days). Immediate treatment is crucial, as rabies is nearly 100% fatal once symptoms appear.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The antigens used in Widal&rsquo;s test include:<br />\r\n- O antigens of S. typhi (TO)<br />\r\n- H antigens of S. typhi (TH)<br />\r\n- H antigens of S. paratyphi A (AH)<br />\r\n- H antigens of S. paratyphi B (BH)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interpretation:<br />\r\nDemonstration of a rise in titre of antibodies by testing two or more serum samples is more meaningful than a single test.<br />\r\nThe agglutination titer will depend on the stage of the disease: Agglutinins usually appear by the end of the first week. The titer increases steadily till the third or fourth week, after which it declines<br />\r\nThe H agglutinins persist longer than O agglutinins.<br />\r\nH antibodies appear earliest after infection and persist for several months.<br />\r\nThe O antibodies follow the appearance of H antibodies and disappear in a few weeks.<br />\r\nH agglutinin titer &gt; 1/640 and O agglutinin titer &gt;1/320 considered significant for active infection.<br />\r\nHigh H antigen titer (&gt;1:380) with low O antigen titer (1:20) is characteristic of the recovery phase after typhoid infection hence reconvalescence phase is the correct diagnosis.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
