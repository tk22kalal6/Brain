      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) Lymphangiosarcoma\r\nExplanation: Some important point regarding breast cancer surgery:\r\nBreast conservative breast surgery means wide local excision of the primary tumour, whole breast\r\nradiation and a separate axillary dissection The main indications for breast conservative surgery are\r\nas follows:\r\n(i) Tumour size is of paramount importance. A single clinical and mammographic lesion measuring 4\r\ncm or less without signs of local advancement (T1, T2, < 4> 4 cm may also be treated by breast conserving surgery in patients\r\nwith large breast. In case of small breasts even smaller tumours may require mastectomy\r\n(ii) There is no age limit. Primary systemic chemotherapy may reduce size of large tumours to allow\r\nsuch surgery Contraindications of breast conservation surgery are-Tumours> 4 cm in size (T4),\r\nextensive nodal metastasis (N2) with distant metastasis (M1), Fixity of tumour with underlying\r\nmuscles or overlying skin, multicentricity of the tumour which is determined by mammography,\r\ncentral lesions when nipple has to be sacrificed, poor tumour differentiation, multifocal disease, local\r\nrecurrence, patient preference. Relative contraindications are-young patient (under 35 years),\r\nextensive ductal carcinoma-in-situ and widespread lymphatic invasion.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/5525394Q.6.jpg\"></p><p><br></p><p>Local recurrence is more common in younger women and in those with high-grade tumours and\r\ninvolved resection margins.\r\n? The presence of metastatic disease within the axillary lymph nodes remains the best single\r\nmarker for prognosis; although treatment of the axilla not affect long-term survival, indicating that\r\nthe axillary nodes act not as a 'reservoir for disease but as a marker for metastatic potential.\r\n? Axillary surgery should not be combined with radiotherapy to the axilla because of excess\r\nmorbidity</p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1, 3 and 4 The MELD score calculation incorporates three key variables\r\nthat reflect different aspects of liver function and overall systemic health in patients with advanced\r\nliver disease: Serum Bilirubin: This measures the liver's ability to process and excrete bile. Elevated\r\nbilirubin levels indicate impaired liver function in this regard, often due to cholestasis or severe\r\nhepatocellular damage, and are associated with a worse prognosis. Serum Creatinine: This parameter\r\nassesses kidney function. In advanced liver disease, renal impairment (e.g., hepatorenal syndrome) is\r\na common and severe complication, significantly worsening the patient's outlook. Therefore, higher\r\ncreatinine levels contribute to a higher MELD score. International Normalized Ratio (INR): The INR\r\nreflects the liver's synthetic function, specifically its ability to produce clotting factors (e.g., factors II,\r\nVII, IX, X). A prolonged INR indicates impaired synthetic function, suggesting severe liver damage and\r\na higher risk of bleeding complications. These three variables are combined using a specific\r\nmathematical formula to calculate the MELD score, which provides a numerical value that correlates\r\nwith the 90-day mortality risk in patients with chronic liver disease. Incorrect Options: A. 1, 2 and 3:\r\nThis option includes Serum albumin (2) instead of INR (4). While serum albumin is an important\r\nindicator of liver synthetic function and is included in other liver scoring systems like the Child-Pugh\r\nscore, it is not a component of the standard MELD score calculation. B. 1, 2 and 4: This option also\r\nincludes Serum albumin (2) and omits Serum creatinine (3). As explained above, serum albumin is\r\nnot part of the standard MELD score, and serum creatinine is a critical component reflecting renal\r\nfunction, which is highly relevant in end-stage liver disease. D. 2, 3 and 4: This option entirely omits\r\nSerum bilirubin (1) and includes Serum albumin (2). Serum bilirubin is one of the foundational\r\nvariables of the MELD score, reflecting the liver's excretory capacity, and its exclusion makes this\r\noption incorrect. Serum albumin, again, is not a MELD variable.",

Occur most commonly in adults with a mean age of 45 years, twice as common in\r\nwomen, one third in &lt;15 years ages, mean age of children affected is 4.9 years ? Most common\r\npresentation is of a painless abdominal fluctuant swelling near the umbilicus, swelling moves freely in\r\na plane at right angles to the attachment of the mesentery (Tillaux's sign), a zone of resonance\r\naround the cyst. Other features are recurrent attacks of abdominal pain with or without vomiting\r\n(pain resulting from recurring temporary impaction of a food bolus in a segment of bowel narrowed\r\nby the cyst or possibly from torsion of the mesentery) and acute abdominal catastrophe, due to:\r\ntorsion of that portion of the mesentery, rupture of the cyst as a result of a comparatively trivial\r\naccident, haemorrhage into the cyst, infection. Chylolymphatic cyst ? Commonest variety. ? Arises in\r\ncongenitally misplaced lymphatic tissue that has no efferent communication with lymphatic system. ?\r\nArises most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum. ? Thin-walled cyst composed of connective\r\ntissue lined by flat endothelium, is filled with clear lymph or less frequently with chyle. ? Cyst is\r\nalmost often unilocular than multilocular. ? Cyst is almost invariably solitary. ? Cyst has a blood\r\nsupply independent of that of adjacent intestine, thereby enucleation is possible without the\r\nnecessity of resection of gut. Enterogenous cyst ? Derived either from diverticulum of the mesenteric\r\nborder of the intestine, which becomes sequestrated from the intestinal canal during embryonic life\r\nor from a duplication of intestine. ? Thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous\r\nmembrane, sometime ciliated, content is mucinous and either colorless or yellowish brown from\r\nbygone hemorrhage. ? Muscle in the wall of an enterogenous cyst. and the bowel with which it is in\r\ncontact has a common blood supply, consequently removal of the cyst always entails resection of\r\nrelated portion of intestine. Urogenital remnant ? A cyst developing in the retroperitoneal space ?\r\nD/D- large hydronephrosis (confirmed by scanning or urography) ? Retroperitoneal cyst can seldom\r\nbe distinguished with certainty from a retroperitoneal tumour until displayed at operation. ?\r\nUunilocular or multilocular. ? Cysts are believed to be derived from a remnant of the wolffian duct, in\r\nwhich case they are filled with clear fluid.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) Distant metastatic disease Explanation: Some important investigation in\r\nesophageal carcinoma • Endoscopy is the first-line investigation. It provides direct view of the\r\noesophageal mucosa and any lesion. Specimens taken for cytology and/ or histology via the\r\nendoscope are crucial for accurate diagnosis. The combination of histology and cytology is having\r\ndiagnostic accuracy to more than 95%.. It is difficult to visualise mediastinal structures with\r\ntranscutaneous ultrasonography. Therefore used mainly to assess spread to the liver. • CT from the\r\nneck to the pelvis with intravenous contrast is mostly used to identify distant haematogenous\r\nmetastases with high accuracy (94-100% ). MRI doesn't have additional benefit over CT except\r\nexposure of ionising radiation. • Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) determines the depth of spread of\r\na malignant tumour through the oesophageal wall (T1-3), the invasion of adjacent organs (T4) and\r\nmetastasis to lymph nodes (NO or N1). Structures smaller than 5 mm can be clearly seen which CT\r\ncan't detect. • Positron emission tomography (PET) with CT (PET-CT) in the context of cancer staging\r\nrelies on the generally high metabolic activity of tumours compared with normal tissues. The patient\r\nis given a small dose of the [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The main value of PET-CT is the\r\nidentification of distant metastatic disease not seen on CT alone. In responders PET activity after\r\nchemotherapy might reduce and persistence of PET activity seems to be a poor prognostic sign.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 2, 3 and 4 Explanation: Ectopic Ureters:- Almost always associated with\r\nureteric duplication and 10% are bilateral. Female: male = 7:1. It drains the upper pole of the kidney\r\nand inserts into the bladder more distally towards the bladder neck. In females, it opens either into\r\nthe urethra below the sphincter or into the vagina and may be incontinent. A female voids normally\r\nbut complain dribbling of urine. In male, opening is above the external urethral sphincter so the\r\npatient is continent. An ectopic ureteric orifice in a male at the apex of the trigone, in the posterior\r\nurethra, in a seminal vesicle or in an ejaculatory duct is likely to be functionally abnormal and\r\ninfection is common. A refluxing ureter may need re-implanting. In female it often drains\r\nhydronephrotic and chronically infected renal tissue and is best excised. Duplex renal pelvis and\r\nureter:- It is a common anomaly. Unilateral duplication is six times more common than bilateral and\r\nin left side is more common; more common in girls. It may be complete of incomplete (Y shaped)\r\nUreter develop from normal bud is non refluxing and from lower bud, which will drain the lower pole\r\nof the kidney and ends in laterally to ureteric orifice with short submocosal tunnel and vice versa. It is\r\nassociated with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). In adults the condition is usually asymptomatic but\r\nchildren with duplex ureters often have VUR. Ureterococle:- A ureterocoele is a cystic enlargement of\r\nthe intramural ureter, due to atresia of the ureteric orifice. F:M-4:1, 10% are bilateral; Almost\r\nexclusively in Caucasians. Ureters frequently drain the upper pole and are often associated with\r\ndysplastic or non-functional renal tissue. Children they usually present with infection, in adults with\r\nstones in the lower ureter. The classic sign of a ureterocoele on excretion urography is 'cobra head.\r\nOn cystoscopy, a bulging, translucent swelling involving the ureteric orifice is typical which fills with\r\nand empties of urine with ureteric peristalsis. Treatment is surgical excision with re-implantation of\r\nthe ureter. Endoscopic incision may cause reflux Congenital megaureter: - Uncommon condition,\r\nureteric dilatation with or without obstruction; may be bilateral and associated with other congenital\r\nabnormalities. Ureteric orifice looks normal on cystoscopy. Renal stones can easily form in the dilated\r\nsystems. Obstruction excluded by antegrade pressure-flow study (Whitaker test) in which a\r\nnephrostomy. Retrocaval ureter:- Rarely, the right ureter passes behind the inferior vena cava rather\r\nwhich lead to obstruction and the need to surgically move the ureter to lie anterior to the IVC.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 1 and 2 1. Constitutional (Idiopathic) Precocious Puberty: Explanation:\r\nThis is the most common cause of central precocious puberty, especially in girls. \"Idiopathic\" means\r\nthere's no identifiable underlying medical condition or structural abnormality causing it. It's simply an\r\nearly activation of the normal puberty process. Is it GnRH-dependent? YES. By definition, this is a\r\nform of central precocious puberty, which is driven by the premature pulsatile release of GnRH from\r\nthe hypothalamus. 2. Tubercular Encephalitis (and other CNS lesions): Explanation: The\r\nhypothalamus, where GnRH is produced, is located in the brain. Various central nervous system\r\n&#40;CNS&#41; conditions can disrupt the normal regulation of the HPG axis, leading to its premature\r\nactivation. These conditions can include tumors (like hypothalamic hamartomas, astrocytomas),\r\nhydrocephalus, radiation to the brain, and inflammatory or infectious processes like tubercular\r\nencephalitis or sarcoidosis. These lesions can either directly stimulate GnRH neurons or remove\r\nnormal inhibitory influences on them. Is it GnRH-dependent? YES. The pathology directly affects the\r\nbrain's control over GnRH release, leading to its premature and pulsatile secretion. 3. McCune-\r\nAlbright Syndrome: Explanation: This is a genetic disorder caused by a somatic mutation in the GNAS\r\ngene. This mutation leads to autonomous hyperfunction of various endocrine glands. In the context of\r\nprecocious puberty, it primarily causes the ovaries (in girls, more rarely testes in boys) to produce\r\nestrogen independently of pituitary stimulation. This is often due to recurring ovarian cysts that\r\nsecrete estrogen. Is it GnRH-dependent? NO (primarily). The precocious puberty in McCune-Albright\r\nSyndrome is a classic example of GnRH-independent (peripheral) precocious puberty. The gonads are\r\nproducing hormones autonomously, not in response to premature GnRH/LH/FSH secretion. While\r\nprolonged exposure to high levels of sex steroids in these children can eventually \"centralize\" and\r\nlead to secondary GnRH-dependent puberty, the primary mechanism of precocity in McCune-Albright\r\nSyndrome itself is peripheral. 4. Primary Hypothyroidism: Explanation: Severe, long-standing primary\r\nhypothyroidism (where the thyroid gland is underactive) can occasionally lead to precocious puberty,\r\na condition known as Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome. In primary hypothyroidism, the pituitary gland\r\noverproduces Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) in an attempt to stimulate the failing thyroid. At\r\nvery high concentrations, TSH can cross-react with and activate FSH receptors on the gonads, leading\r\nto independent sex steroid production. Is it GnRH-dependent? NO. This is another classic example of\r\nGnRH-independent (peripheral) precocious puberty. The high TSH levels directly stimulate the\r\ngonads, bypassing the GnRH-LH-FSH axis. The gonadotropin levels (LH/FSH) are typically low or\r\nprepubertal in this condition.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) Statement-2 is true but Statement-l is false Explanation: Statement 1 is\r\nnot true. Amniotic fluid can be normal in early IUGR. As severity of IUGR increases hypoxia sets in\r\nand hence the limited blood supply to the fetus is redistributed. Blood flow is more towards brain and\r\nrelatively less to the renal arteries. This is seen as brain sparing effect by doppler studies. Decreased\r\nblood flow to renal arteries leads to less production of fetal urine. Fetal urine has major contribution\r\nto amniotic fluid. Hence oligohydroamnios sets in. If there is oligohydroamnios along with IUGR, it is\r\nassociated with more morbidity. Fetal Growth Restriction is said to be present in those babies whose\r\nbirth weight is below the 10th percentile of the average for the gestational age. It is due to reduced\r\navailability of nutrients in the mother or its reduced transfer to fetus by placenta, ultimately reduced\r\nutilization by fetus. Liver glycogen content is reduced. Renal and pulmonary contribution to amniotic\r\nfluid is diminished due to reduction in blood flow to these organs which leads to oligohydramnios. As\r\nH& B writes, chronic fetal distress means intrauterine fetal growth restriction and low volume of\r\nliquor, and acute fetal distress means Bradycardia and meconium stained liquor. In 5% of IUGR\r\namniotic fluid are normal, in oligohydramnios the incidence of IUGR is 40%.",
