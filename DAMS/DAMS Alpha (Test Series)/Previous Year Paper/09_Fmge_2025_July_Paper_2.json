      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nThe 38-year-old farmer presenting with fever, malaise, and diarrhea, who has regular exposure to livestock (cattle and goats) and no history of tick or flea bites or a rash, is most likely infected with Coxiella burnetii. \r\nCoxiella burnetii causes Q fever, typically acquired by farmers via inhalation of contaminated dust or unpasteurized dairy from cattle, sheep, or goats. Acute Q fever often presents with fever, malaise, myalgias, and can include GI symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea; about half of infections are symptomatic. The patient’s farming exposure markedly increases risk, and the lack of a rash helps distinguish it from rickettsial diseases.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nMalignancy\r\nGiven the persistent hypercalcemia with normal PTH levels, the most likely cause is Malignancy. Can often cause hypercalcemia due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrp) by tumor cells, which mimics the action of PTH and leads to elevated calcium levels even with normal PTH levels. \r\nHypercalcemia with a normal or low PTH points to a non–PTH–mediated cause, such as malignancy.\r\nIn sarcoidosis, granulomas increase production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, leading to hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH. In contrast, parathyroid hyperplasia and chronic kidney disease usually cause elevated PTH levels, not normal ones.\r\n",

This is a rare tumor, usually benign, that develops in the adrenal glands and releases excessive amounts of hormones called catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline). These hormones can cause symptoms like those described: high blood pressure, headaches, sweating, and palpitations. The elevated levels of metanephrines (breakdown products of catecholamines) in the 24-hour urine test are a key diagnostic indicator for pheochromocytoma. \r\nCarcinoid tumor releases serotonin (and 5-HIAA); causes flushing, diarrhea, sometimes palpitations, but not elevated metanephrines.\r\nCarcinoid crisis is life-threatening carcinoid syndrome flare (flushing, hypotension, bronchospasm, confusion) triggered by stress or surgery; metanephrine elevation is not typical.\r\nNeuroblastoma is pediatric cancer that can raise catecholamines and blood pressure; however, the presentation with high metanephrines favors pheochromocytoma over neuroblastoma.\r\n",

Symptoms of mitral stenosis may not appear for years or even decades after the initial rheumatic fever episode. A loud S1 (first heart sound), often described as palpable, is a characteristic finding in mitral stenosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\r\nThe presentation of progressive limb weakness, muscle fasciculations (muscle twitches), and hypertonia (increased muscle tone), along with preserved sensation, strongly suggests ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis.  While most cases are sporadic, around 10% of ALS cases have a genetic component, with over 40 genes now linked to the disease. These genes, such as SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS, play roles in motor neuron function and are implicated in the disease's development. \r\nB. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is early-onset via lower motor neuron degeneration; prominent muscle atrophy rather than hypertonia, and it mainly affects LMNs (not the UMN involvement seen in ALS).\r\nC. Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is rare, focal, asymmetrical motor nerve disease causing weakness, cramps, and fasciculations; gradual onset and cramping/spasms are common, with less hypertonia and widespread involvement unlike ALS.\r\nD. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is genetic progressive muscle weakness, mainly in hips/thighs with waddling gait; onset earlier than described, no upper motor neuron signs, and weakness/atrophy without ALS-like hypertonia or fasciculations.\r\n",

The shock is primarily hemorrhagic/hypovolemic, though early neurogenic shock may occur. Immediate management is Johnson’s manual repositioning in the labor room; do not delay for surgery.

Cooper’s ligaments are connective tissue bands that span the breast, attaching tissue to the skin and chest muscles. If a tumor grows, it can cause fibrosis and invasion of these ligaments, shortening them and pulling the skin inward to create a dimple or puckering. Dimpling due to ligament shortening is a strong sign of a potential malignancy.\r\n",

On IVP, it appears as a round filling defect with a surrounding halo, known as the \"cobra head sign,\" often accompanied by hydronephrosis or displacement of the kidney pole in duplicated systems. Other options are less likely: ureter duplication involves multiple ureters but doesn't show the characteristic sign; posterior urethral valves cause bladder outlet obstruction without the cobra head appearance; and vesicoureteral reflux involves urine backflow, not the cystic dilation seen in ureterocele. The presence of the cobra head sign makes ureterocele the most probable diagnosis.\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)<br><br>McRobert's maneuver<br>The first maneuver recommended for shoulder dystocia is the McRoberts maneuver. McRoberts maneuver involves a sudden flexion and abduction of the maternal thighs onto the maternal abdomen. This maneuver does not change the actual dimensions of the pelvis but increases the available space by rotating the symphysis pubis cephalad, which in turn flattens the sacral promontory.If McRoberts fails, the next step is to apply suprapubic pressure while maintaining the McRoberts position. If these external maneuvers are unsuccessful, internal rotational maneuvers such as delivery of the posterior arm, Wood's corkscrew maneuver, or Rubin's maneuver are performed. These typically require more expertise.<br>The Zavanelli maneuver is a last-resort maneuver where the fetal head is pushed back into the uterus, followed by an immediate Cesarean section.<br>Cleidotomy (surgical cutting of the anterior clavicle) is a destructive procedure, rarely performed in modern obstetrics and usually as a final resort for shoulder dystocia.<br>It is crucial to never apply fundal pressure and to instruct the woman not to push during shoulder dystocia.<br><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/712338013.png\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) \r\n\r\nMobilise and Start physiotherapy under supervision \r\nEarly mobilization within 7–10 days after grafting supports graft take and helps prevent contractures. In the subacute phase, the aim is to maintain joint movement, reduce swelling, and prevent tight scar tissue through active and active-assisted range of motion, proper positioning, and splinting. Scar tissue from deep burns and full-thickness grafts tightens over time, but mobilization guides collagen alignment to produce a more flexible scar. Delaying mobilization increases the risk of contractures and may necessitate additional surgery later.\r\n",
