      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s disease is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder that often presents in young adults, especially males, and is characterized by a triad of recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis (eye inflammation). In this case, the patient has recurrent oral ulcers, eye redness (likely uveitis or conjunctivitis), and a history of venous thrombosis, which is a well-known vascular complication in Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s due to its predilection for causing both arterial and venous inflammation (vasculitis). The presence of mucocutaneous, ocular, and vascular symptoms in a young adult strongly supports the diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s disease. This condition is common along the &ldquo;Silk Road&rdquo; region (Middle East to East Asia), but it can be seen globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nWhile SLE can present with oral ulcers and vascular thrombosis (especially in antiphospholipid syndrome), it is more common in females, and ocular involvement typically presents as retinal vasculitis or lupus retinopathy rather than uveitis. Genital ulcers are not typical of SLE, making Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s more likely in this presentation.<br />\r\nB. Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome (Reactive arthritis) &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nReiter&rsquo;s syndrome presents with the triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, often after a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection. However, oral ulcers and venous thrombosis are not characteristic, and the absence of arthritis or a preceding infection argues against this diagnosis.<br />\r\nD. Wegener&rsquo;s Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) &ndash; Incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wegener&rsquo;s typically involves upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., sinusitis, nasal ulcers, hemoptysis) and glomerulonephritis. Although it may cause oral or nasal ulcers, it does not typically present with venous thrombosis or conjunctival injection without respiratory or renal signs. Also, it&#39;s rare in young adults.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

MR produces a high-pitched, blowing holosystolic murmur that begins with S1 (first heart sound) and continues through S2 (second heart sound) without a gap. It is best heard at the apex of the heart and typically radiates to the axilla. This murmur results from retrograde blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole due to an incompetent mitral valve. MR can occur due to causes such as mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic heart disease, or infective endocarditis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Aortic regurgitation &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nAortic regurgitation produces an early diastolic decrescendo murmur, not a systolic one. It is best heard at the left sternal border with the patient leaning forward and holding their breath in expiration. The murmur occurs after S2, which doesn&rsquo;t match the timing of the murmur seen in MR.<br />\r\nC. Aortic stenosis &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nAortic stenosis presents with a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, best heard at the right upper sternal border and radiating to the carotids. While it&#39;s a systolic murmur like MR, it has a diamond- shaped (ejection) profile, not a flat, holosystolic one.<br />\r\nD. Mitral stenosis &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nMitral stenosis causes a low-pitched, rumbling diastolic murmur, often preceded by an opening snap. It&rsquo;s best heard at the apex in the left lateral position. It occurs after S2, during diastole, and is not a systolic murmur like in MR.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ankylosing Spondylitis<br />\r\nThe most probable diagnosis is Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to stiffness and pain. This patient presents with early morning backache and stiffness that improves with exercise, a hallmark of AS. The persistent red eyes are likely due to associated iritis or uveitis, which are common extra-articular manifestations of AS. The reduced lung expansion (&lt;3 cm) can be explained by the progressive spinal involvement and thoracic cage stiffness, which limits lung expansion. On X-ray, characteristic findings of AS, such as sacroiliitis and the bamboo spine, may be visible, confirming the diagnosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Paget&rsquo;s Disease<br />\r\nPaget&#39;s disease of bone typically causes bone deformities and fractures, but it does not commonly present with early morning backache or stiffness improving with exercise. The hallmark feature of Paget&#39;s disease is abnormal bone remodeling, often seen in the pelvis, spine, and skull. However, it is not typically associated with red eyes or significant lung involvement. X-ray findings in Paget&rsquo;s disease show bone enlargement and thickening, not the typical features of AS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. Healed Tuberculosis<br />\r\nHealed tuberculosis can cause residual effects, such as fibrosis or lung restriction, but it would not typically present with early morning back stiffness that improves with exercise or red eyes. Moreover, healed TB would not lead to the characteristic sacroiliac joint involvement or bamboo spine seen in AS. The X-ray may show old pulmonary scars, but the patient&#39;s clinical symptoms and presentation do not align with healed TB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Osteopetrosis<br />\r\nOsteopetrosis, or marble bone disease, is a genetic condition characterized by abnormal bone hardening due to defective osteoclast function. It leads to increased bone density, which may be evident on X-ray, but it typically presents with bone fractures, cranial nerve palsies, and hearing loss rather than back stiffness or red eyes. This condition does not involve the spine in a manner consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, nor does it cause lung restriction or extra-articular manifestations like uveitis.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IV Mannitol</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most likely diagnosis here is dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, a rare but serious complication that can occur during or shortly after dialysis. It is characterized by neurological symptoms such as drowsiness, seizures, and hypotension. The condition arises due to an osmotic gradient between the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the rapid reduction of urea and other solutes during dialysis. This leads to water shifting into the brain, causing cerebral edema and the associated neurological symptoms. IV Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can help reduce cerebral edema by drawing water out of the brain and into the bloodstream, which helps alleviate the symptoms of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bumetanide<br />\r\nBumetanide is a loop diuretic used to treat conditions like edema and fluid retention. It acts on the kidneys to increase urine output. While it can help manage fluid balance, it is not effective for treating cerebral edema or the neurological complications of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. The issue in this case is not fluid overload but rather the osmotic imbalance caused by dialysis, which makes bumetanide inappropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ethacrynic Acid<br />\r\nEthacrynic acid, like bumetanide, is a loop diuretic used for conditions involving fluid retention.

Additionally, the swollen neck indicates a possible goiter, a classic sign of thyroid dysfunction. The immediate management of thyroid storm involves controlling the heart rate and managing the underlying hyperthyroidism. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is used in this situation to control the tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. It is preferred in patients with thyroid storm who have a history of bronchial asthma because, unlike beta- blockers, it does not cause bronchoconstriction and is safe for asthmatic patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Propranolol<br />\r\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used in the management of thyroid storm to control tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. However, it should be avoided in this patient because she has bronchial asthma, and beta-blockers can worsen bronchoconstriction, leading to an asthma attack. Although propranolol can be beneficial in controlling heart rate, it poses a risk in patients with respiratory conditions, making it less suitable for this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. Esmolol<br />\r\nEsmolol is a short-acting beta-blocker that is typically used in cases where rapid heart rate control is needed. While it could theoretically help control the tachycardia in thyroid storm, it is not ideal for this patient because, like propranolol, it can cause bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. Therefore, its use is contraindicated in this case due to the risk of exacerbating asthma symptoms.<br />\r\nD. Propylthiouracil<br />\r\nPropylthiouracil (PTU) is an antithyroid medication that can be used to block the synthesis of thyroid hormones and treat hyperthyroidism. While it is an important part of the management of thyroid storm, PTU does not provide immediate control of tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, which are the acute concerns in this patient. Immediate management focuses on controlling the heart rate and symptoms, which is why a drug like diltiazem is preferred in this case.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tenofovir for &gt; 40 weeks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B, indicated by the presence of HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) and HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen), which suggests active viral replication. The patient has an elevated viral load (2 x 10^5 copies/mL), which confirms active replication of the virus, along with a doubling of SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), indicating liver inflammation. Given these findings, Tenofovir, a nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), is an appropriate treatment for chronic hepatitis B due to its high potency and low resistance profile. Tenofovir is typically used for long-term management, often for &gt;40 weeks (and potentially indefinitely, depending on response). It effectively reduces viral replication and liver inflammation, reducing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Lamivudine for 30+ weeks<br />\r\nLamivudine is another NRTI used to treat chronic hepatitis B, but it is less ideal in this patient. Lamivudine has a higher rate of resistance over time, especially in patients with high viral loads, such as this one. While it can be used initially, it is generally not recommended for long-term therapy in patients with significant viral replication due to the risk of resistance. Therefore, Tenofovir is preferred over lamivudine for longer-term therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. Pegylated interferon for 52 weeks<br />\r\nPegylated interferon is an immune-modulating agent that can be used to treat chronic hepatitis B. However, it is usually reserved for patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B or those who do not have high viral loads. It is not the first-line therapy for patients with high viral loads and active hepatitis, as in this case, due to its adverse side effects, including flu-like symptoms, bone marrow suppression, and potential thyroid dysfunction. The treatment duration (52 weeks) can also be challenging for some patients. Therefore, Tenofovir is the more appropriate choice in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Combined pegylated interferon with lamivudine<br />\r\nCombining pegylated interferon with lamivudine is not standard practice in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. While the combination therapy might have some theoretical benefits, it is not preferred due to the increased risk of resistance with lamivudine and the significant side effects associated with interferon therapy. This combination does not offer any clear advantage over Tenofovir monotherapy, which is both safer and more effective in reducing viral load and liver inflammation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thyroid receptor antibody</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient presents with symptoms like palpitations, sweating, restlessness, and sweaty palms, which are suggestive of hyperthyroidism or an overactive thyroid. The clinical findings, likely involving signs like exophthalmos (protruding eyes) or a goiter, suggest the possibility of Graves&#39; disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The key diagnostic finding in this condition is the presence of thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb), which are autoantibodies that stimulate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, leading to increased thyroid hormone production. These antibodies are characteristic of Graves&#39; disease, confirming the diagnosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Anti-thyroglobulin antibody<br />\r\nAnti-thyroglobulin antibodies are often associated with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition that causes hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. These antibodies can be elevated in autoimmune thyroid diseases, but they are not specific to Graves&#39; disease or hyperthyroidism. Therefore, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies would not be the diagnostic finding in this patient with symptoms of hyperthyroidism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody<br />\r\nAnti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies are also primarily associated with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis and some cases of autoimmune thyroid disease. They are markers of thyroid inflammation and can be found in patients with hypothyroidism. Like anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, they are not specific to Graves&#39; disease or hyperthyroidism. Thus, this would not be the correct diagnostic finding for a patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Elevated ultrasensitive thyrotropin levels<br />\r\nIn hyperthyroidism, thyrotropin (TSH) levels are typically low, not elevated. This is because the body decreases TSH production in response to high levels of circulating thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). An elevated ultrasensitive TSH level would be seen in hypothyroidism, where the feedback mechanism causes TSH levels to rise. Therefore, elevated TSH levels would not support a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or Graves&#39; disease.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor associated with Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and occurs most commonly in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with AIDS. It presents as painful, purple or dark red plaques or nodules that can appear on the skin, oral mucosa, and internal organs. The lesions are often multiple and may be non-blanching due to their vascular nature. Kaposi sarcoma is a common AIDS-defining illness and is strongly linked to low CD4 counts. The appearance of the lesion in an HIV-positive patient is characteristic and highly suggestive of this diagnosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Basal Cell Carcinoma<br />\r\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, but it typically presents as a pearly papule with rolled borders and central ulceration, usually in sun-exposed areas like the face. BCC grows slowly and is rarely painful. It is not associated with HIV or immunosuppression and does not appear as violaceous or vascular lesions, making it unlikely in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Malignant Melanoma<br />\r\nMalignant melanoma often presents as a pigmented lesion with features described by the ABCDE rule (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter &gt;6 mm, Evolving). While melanoma can occur in immunocompromised patients, it is generally not painful in early stages and is not associated with the typical vascular, purplish lesions seen in Kaposi sarcoma. The clinical context and lesion appearance are more consistent with Kaposi sarcoma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)<br />\r\nSCC can present as a scaly, crusted, or ulcerated lesion, often in sun-exposed areas, and can become painful. However, SCC usually lacks the violaceous or reddish-purple vascular appearance of Kaposi sarcoma and is more common in older individuals with a history of chronic sun exposure or immunosuppression (e.g., transplant recipients). Although HIV patients are at increased risk for SCC, the lesion described is more typical of Kaposi sarcoma.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the basal ganglia, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to a deficiency in dopamine. The basal ganglia are deeply involved in the regulation of voluntary motor control, muscle tone, and movement initiation, as well as certain non-motor functions like motivation and emotional expression. The hallmark motor features (resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor features (affective flattening, apathy) seen in this patient directly result from basal ganglia dysfunction, confirming it as the affected region.<br />\r\nIncorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hippocampus<br />\r\nThe hippocampus is primarily involved in learning and memory formation, particularly in short-term to long-term memory consolidation.

Lesions here may cause difficulty initiating voluntary movement (apraxia), but they do not typically cause the tremor, rigidity, or emotional blunting observed in Parkinson&#39;s disease. Thus, while this area plays a role in motor planning, it is not the primary site affected in this scenario.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HIV with disseminated histoplasmosis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clinical presentation of a 45-year-old HIV-positive male with persistent cough, weight loss, umbilicated papular skin lesions, and bilateral nodular infiltrates on chest X-ray, combined with a negative CBNAAT for tuberculosis and low CD4 count, strongly suggests disseminated histoplasmosis. Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that commonly affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with AIDS and CD4 counts &lt;150 cells/mm&sup3;. The disease often begins as a pulmonary infection and can progress to disseminated disease, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Skin lesions in disseminated histoplasmosis may mimic molluscum contagiosum (umbilicated papules), and the lung involvement with systemic symptoms like weight loss is consistent with fungal dissemination. This constellation of findings points toward disseminated histoplasmosis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients in endemic areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:<br />\r\nB. HIV with disseminated cryptococcosis<br />\r\nCryptococcosis, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, typically presents in HIV patients with central nervous system symptoms, such as meningitis, and less commonly with pulmonary or cutaneous manifestations. Although disseminated cryptococcosis can involve the lungs and skin, umbilicated papular skin lesions are less classic, and cough and bilateral pulmonary nodules are more characteristic of histoplasmosis. Moreover, cryptococcal skin lesions are often less numerous and not primarily distributed on the face and trunk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. HIV with molluscum contagiosum<br />\r\nMolluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection caused by a poxvirus, which presents with umbilicated papules and is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV. However, molluscum contagiosum is limited to the skin and does not cause systemic symptoms like cough, weight loss, or pulmonary infiltrates. The presence of systemic signs and pulmonary nodular infiltrates rules out molluscum contagiosum as the primary diagnosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. HIV with tuberculosis<br />\r\nWhile tuberculosis (TB) is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients and can present with cough and weight loss, the diagnosis is unlikely here because the CBNAAT for TB was negative. Moreover, TB does not typically present with umbilicated skin lesions, which are much more characteristic of fungal infections like histoplasmosis. Also, bilateral nodular infiltrates are more typical of fungal dissemination than TB in this context.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subacute combined degeneration of the cord</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most probable diagnosis is Subacute Combined Degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord, which is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition leads to demyelination of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, resulting in the characteristic combination of sensory loss (especially proprioception and vibration sense), upper motor neuron (UMN) signs in the lower limbs (e.g., spasticity, weakness), and absent deep tendon reflexes due to peripheral nerve involvement. The presence of angular stomatitis supports a nutritional deficiency, particularly of B vitamins. The chronic progression over 3 months also aligns with SCD. Patients may also have ataxia, a positive Romberg sign, and in advanced cases, neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Extradural cord compression<br />\r\nExtradural compression (e.g., from tumor or abscess) typically causes localized back pain, progressive motor weakness, and sensory level deficits, often with a more acute or subacute onset. It doesn&#39;t explain the nutritional signs like angular stomatitis, and loss of vibration and proprioception with UMN signs in the absence of a discrete sensory level is more suggestive of SCD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)<br />\r\nALS affects both upper and lower motor neurons, causing progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and fasciculations. However, sensory pathways are typically spared, so loss of proprioception and vibration sense would not be explained. The presence of angular stomatitis also makes ALS less likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple sclerosis (MS)<br />\r\nMS may cause multifocal neurological deficits, including UMN signs and sensory loss, but it typically presents in younger patients (20&ndash;40 years old), often with relapsing-remitting episodes. It also rarely causes nutritional deficiency signs like angular stomatitis. Moreover, MS would not classically present with such symmetrical and chronic sensory-motor findings.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Tricuspid stenosis impedes the flow of blood from the right atrium to the right ventricle during diastole, causing right atrial enlargement, which in turn leads to a prominent &#39;a&#39; wave on JVP due to increased resistance during atrial contraction. The diastolic murmur is due to turbulent flow across the narrowed tricuspid valve during diastole.

Lewy bodies are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions composed primarily of alpha-synuclein, and are a hallmark of Parkinson&#39;s disease and related disorders. While the classic presentation of Parkinson&rsquo;s includes motor symptoms like resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability, cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations often develop in later stages.

Additionally, visual hallucinations are less characteristic, and the course is typically more rapid than described here.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Huntington&rsquo;s chorea<br />\r\nHuntington&rsquo;s disease is a genetic disorder that presents earlier (typically in the 30s&ndash;50s) with a triad of chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline.

The definitive treatment is lifelong desmopressin (DDAVP) supplementation, a synthetic analog of ADH, which helps concentrate the urine and correct the water imbalance. Without ADH, patients are unable to retain free water, leading to high serum sodium levels and dilute urine, which can result in dehydration and neurologic symptoms if left untreated.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pancoast tumor The most likely diagnosis is Pancoast tumor, a type of lung cancer that typically occurs at the apex of the lung, often involving the superior pulmonary sulcus. This type of tumor can cause upper chest discomfort and radiating pain due to its proximity to the brachial plexus and sympathetic nerve chain. The symptoms described, including drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), pain radiating to the upper arm, and tingling in the 4th and 5th digits of the left hand, are classic signs of Horner&rsquo;s syndrome, which occurs when the sympathetic nerves are involved. Horner&rsquo;s syndrome can result from the tumor compressing the sympathetic pathway, leading to ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. Chest x-ray findings of a mass at the apex of the lung would support this diagnosis. Incorrect Answers: B. Upper lobe pneumonia While upper lobe pneumonia can cause chest discomfort and pain, it is less likely to cause Horner&rsquo;s syndrome or the neurological symptoms described (e.g., tingling in the 4th and 5th digits). Pneumonia would typically present with symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea, and would show consolidation or infiltrates in the upper lobe on chest x-ray, not a mass like a Pancoast tumor. C. Superior vena cava obstruction Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction presents with symptoms such as facial and upper extremity edema, jugular venous distension, and cyanosis, due to the impaired venous return to the heart. While this could cause chest discomfort, it would not explain the ptosis or the tingling in the hand. The x-ray would show features of SVC obstruction, such as a mediastinal mass or enlarged veins. The absence of these signs and the specific neurological findings make SVC obstruction less likely in this case. D. Aspergilloma Aspergilloma, or a fungal ball, typically forms in pre-existing lung cavities, often in individuals with previous lung disease, such as tuberculosis or emphysema. It usually causes hemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea rather than the neurological symptoms seen in this patient. The x- ray findings would typically show a fungal ball within a lung cavity, which is not consistent with the findings of a Pancoast tumor.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This condition, also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), is characterized by acute pain and swelling in a joint, most commonly the knee or wrist, but it can affect the great toe as well. The key differentiating factor in this case is the absence of elevated serum uric acid levels, which rules out gout. Instead, calcium pyrophosphate crystals are deposited in the joint, leading to an inflammatory response. On synovial fluid analysis, CPPD is diagnosed when rhomboid-shaped crystals with positive birefringence are found under polarized light microscopy. Chronic alcohol use is a risk factor for pseudogout, as it is associated with calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acute gout<br />\r\nAcute gout is characterized by sudden onset of pain, swelling, and redness, typically involving the big toe (podagra), but serum uric acid levels are often elevated, especially during an acute flare.

Additionally, monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid would be seen in gout, but there is no mention of the characteristic needle-shaped crystals with negative birefringence that are typically seen in gout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reactive arthritis<br />\r\nReactive arthritis often follows an infection, typically urinary or gastrointestinal. It presents with the classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis (the &quot;cant see, can&#39;t pee, can&#39;t climb a tree&quot; syndrome). This patient does not report a history of infection or the typical symptoms of urethritis or conjunctivitis, so reactive arthritis is not a likely diagnosis.<br />\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Septic arthritis<br />\r\nSeptic arthritis can present with acute joint pain and swelling and is typically caused by bacterial infection. However, it usually presents with severe pain, fever, and systemic signs of infection, and synovial fluid analysis would show a high white blood cell count, often greater than 50,000/&micro;L with predominantly neutrophils. The absence of these signs, particularly the absence of fever and the presence of normal white blood cell count, makes septic arthritis unlikely in this case.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anterior Spinal Artery</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation for Correct Answer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clinical features described&mdash;acute onset left-sided weakness, loss of proprioception and vibration sense on the left side of the body, and facial sparing&mdash;are highly indicative of a medial medullary syndrome (also known as Dejerine syndrome), which is caused by an infarction in the region supplied by the anterior spinal artery. The anterior spinal artery supplies the medial portion of the medulla, where the pyramidal tract (for motor function) and medial lemniscus (for proprioception and vibration sense) are located. The deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion indicates right-sided hypoglossal nerve involvement, as the hypoglossal nerve nuclei are also located in the medulla. Thus, the anterior spinal artery is the artery most commonly involved in this type of presentation, causing both motor and sensory deficits with facial sparing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Middle Cerebral Artery &ndash; Incorrect:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies most of the lateral convexity of the cerebral hemisphere, including areas responsible for motor and sensory functions of the face, arm, and hand. However, the MCA does not supply the medulla or the structures described in this case (proprioception, vibration sense, and hypoglossal nerve function). MCA involvement would typically result in contralateral hemiparesis, sensory loss, and facial involvement, unlike the facial sparing seen in this case. Therefore, the MCA is not the correct answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anterior Cerebral Artery &ndash; Incorrect:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) supplies the medial aspect of the frontal lobes and the paracentral lobule, which is involved in motor and sensory functions of the contralateral leg and foot. ACA occlusion can cause contralateral leg weakness or sensory loss, but it does not affect the medulla or structures such as the hypoglossal nerve or medial lemniscus. Additionally, there would likely be involvement of the leg, not sparing of the face, which further rules out the ACA as the cause of this patient&rsquo;s symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Posterior Cerebral Artery &ndash; Incorrect:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) supplies the occipital lobe and the inferior temporal lobe, as well as portions of the thalamus and midbrain. While PCA occlusion can result in visual deficits (e.g., homonymous hemianopia) or thalamic sensory disturbances, it does not supply the medulla where the structures involved in the patient&#39;s symptoms are located. Therefore, PCA involvement is not associated with the symptoms of weakness, proprioceptive loss, and hypoglossal nerve deviation seen here.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It does not cause bilateral papilledema or result from trauma or SDH. Moreover, optic disc swelling in optic neuritis is usually unilateral and not due to raised ICP.<br />\r\nD.

It typically presents with visual field defects and optic disc cupping, not papilledema. It is unrelated to trauma or SDH.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immature senile cataract is a common condition in elderly individuals, especially those with diabetes. The patient presents with painless vision loss, which is characteristic of cataracts, particularly when the lens opacity becomes significant. The management for immature senile cataract includes phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, which is the standard surgical procedure for cataract removal Other Options: A) Zonular cataract and lensectomy: Zonular cataracts are different from senile cataracts and typically involve the zonules of the lens. Lensectomy is not the first-line treatment, and zonular cataracts may not match this presentation B) Rosette cataract and sugar control: Rosette cataracts are characterized by a particular pattern of opacity that is not typical for diabetic patients with senile cataracts. Sugar control is important for overall health but would not be sufficient as a primary treatment for cataracts C) Sunflower cataract and lesion extraction: Sunflower cataracts are a specific type of cataract associated with Wilson&#39;s disease, not typical for diabetic patients. The treatment for these is different and focuses on addressing the underlying condition<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sturm&#39;s Conoid refers to the visual pattern created when light rays from a point source focus at different points along two perpendicular meridians due to astigmatism. This occurs because the cornea or lens has an uneven curvature, causing the light entering the eye to focus on multiple points instead of a single point on the retina Astigmatism is the refractive error associated with Sturm&#39;s Conoid, where the eye&#39;s inability to focus light evenly causes distorted or blurred vision, especially at certain angles Other Options: A) Presbyopia ? Presbyopia is a condition related to age-related changes in the lens, resulting in difficulty focusing on near objects. It does not involve the creation of a conoid pattern and is unrelated to astigmatism C) Hypermetropia (Hyperopia) ? Hypermetropia or farsightedness is when distant objects are focused behind the retina due to the eye being too short or the cornea being too flat. It does not cause the Sturm&#39;s Conoid D) Myopia ? Myopia or nearsightedness is when close objects are focused in front of the retina. It is also not associated with the creation of Sturm&#39;s Conoid.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In heat stroke, the body&rsquo;s mechanisms for cooling itself are overwhelmed, and sweating is usually absent due to the failure of the hypothalamus to regulate the temperature effectively. Sweating, which is a natural cooling mechanism, tends to stop when a person is in heat stroke, despite the high temperature Other options: A) Tachypnoea: The body tries to compensate for the elevated temperature by increasing the respiratory rate in an attempt to cool down B) Hypotension: Heat stroke can lead to dehydration and a decrease in circulating blood volume, causing hypotension D) Red hot skin: As the body tries to dissipate heat, the skin often becomes flushed, red, and hot due to vasodilation, which can also be seen in heat stroke<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In addition to its primary effect of blocking the angiotensin II receptor (AT1), it has also been shown to have a secondary effect as a thromboxane A2 antagonist.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>80 hours Explanation:<br />\r\nWhen a patient develops symptoms of digoxin toxicity (such as nausea and vomiting), the first step is to stop the medication. Digoxin has a long half-life (40 hours in this case), meaning it takes a long time for the drug to be eliminated from the body. The goal is to wait until the serum concentration of digoxin falls within the therapeutic range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key Points:<br />\r\nTherapeutic range of digoxin: 1 mg/dl. Current serum concentration: 4 mg/dl. Half-life of digoxin: 40 hours.<br />\r\nThe general formula to estimate the time it will take for a drug to decrease to a safe concentration is:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time to reach therapeutic level<br />\r\n= Half-life &times; log 2<br />\r\n( Current concentration Therapeutic concentration) Time to reach therapeutic level=Half-life&times;log<br />\r\n2 ( Therapeutic concentration Current concentration )<br />\r\nHowever, a simplified approach is to wait around 5 half-lives for a drug to drop close to a therapeutic range (for many drugs). This is because after 5 half-lives, the concentration typically falls by over 95%.<br />\r\nCalculation:<br />\r\nGiven:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half-life of digoxin = 40 hours<br />\r\nYou would wait approximately 5 half-lives. 5 &times; 40 = 200 hours<br />\r\n5&times;40=200 hours<br />\r\nHowever, this calculation suggests an extended period. For clinical practicality and rapid therapeutic adjustment, a closer approximation is usually 2 half-lives for initial symptom resolution and then reassessment. Hence, 80 hours (which is 2 half-lives) is a reasonable estimate for when to reconsider therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not the others?<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;40 hours: This would only cover one half-life, not enough time for digoxin to reach therapeutic<br />\r\nlevels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;120 hours: While longer than necessary, this is an overestimate and unnecessary for most patients.<br />\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;140-180 hours: This is far too long and does not fit typical clinical guidelines for drug elimination.</p>\r\n",

However, atropine can have side effects, especially when given in large doses or as an infusion.<br />\r\nOne of the known side effects of atropine is hyperthermia (fever). This can occur because:<br />\r\nAtropine reduces sweating (by inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system), which leads to impaired heat dissipation.<br />\r\nIt can also cause central nervous system effects, including altered thermoregulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In cases of organophosphate poisoning, atropine is given to counteract the muscarinic effects of the poisoning, but if too much atropine is used, toxic effects can result, including fever, dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.<br />\r\nWhy not the others?<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Side effect of pralidoxime: Pralidoxime is used to reactivate acetylcholinesterase and reverse the effects of organophosphate poisoning. It generally does not cause a significant rise in temperature.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to organophosphate poisoning: While organophosphates can cause muscarinic effects like excessive salivation, bronchorrhea, and bradycardia, fever is more commonly due to atropine toxicity rather than the poisoning itself. Organophosphate poisoning leads to hypothermia in some cases due to excessive cholinergic stimulation, rather than fever.<br />\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Idiopathic: While fever can sometimes occur without a clear cause, in this case, the administration of atropine strongly suggests that the fever is likely due to atropine toxicity.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) occurs in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype who are resistant to androgens due to a defective androgen receptor. As a result, although they produce normal levels of testosterone and anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH), their tissues cannot respond to androgens. AMH causes regression of M&uuml;llerian structures, so the uterus and fallopian tubes are absent. Externally, they appear female but lack pubic and axillary hair due to androgen insensitivity. Testes are present and often found as inguinal masses. Breast development can vary but is often present due to peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen. The presence of inguinal masses, absent uterus and ovaries, and lack of pubic hair makes CAIS the most likely diagnosis. Option B: Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism (Incorrect) In hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, such as in gonadal dysgenesis, there is failure of the gonads to respond to gonadotropins, resulting in elevated FSH and LH levels. These patients typically have a uterus and fallopian tubes because there is no AMH production. While they may have primary amenorrhea and absent breast development, the presence of a uterus and lack of inguinal masses differentiates this from CAIS. The complete absence of M&uuml;llerian structures and presence of testes in the inguinal region rule out this diagnosis. Option C: Turner Syndrome (Incorrect) Turner syndrome is characterized by a 45,X karyotype and is typically associated with short stature, primary amenorrhea, and streak ovaries. Patients with Turner syndrome always have a uterus because they lack AMH production. They also usually develop normal pubic and axillary hair, as adrenal androgens are unaffected. The patient in this case is of normal height and has no uterus or ovaries, which is not consistent with Turner syndrome. Option D: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (Incorrect) PCOS is a condition seen in individuals with normal female internal anatomy and is associated with hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity, and polycystic ovaries. These patients typically have a uterus and ovaries, develop secondary sexual characteristics, and may have excess pubic an axillary hair rather than a complete absence. Since the patient lacks internal female organs and secondary sexual features, PCOS is not a plausible diagnosis.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This position is incompatible with vaginal delivery, and management depends on gestational age, labor status, and maternal-fetal condition. Management Steps: 1. Confirm Diagnosis: &bull; Clinical examination: Palpation of fetal position and Leopold maneuvers. &bull; Ultrasound: Confirm transverse lie and assess placental location, amniotic fluid, and fetal anomalies. 2. Assess Factors: &bull; Parity: Transverse lie is more common in multiparous women due to lax uterine tone. &bull; Placental location: Associated with placenta previa. &bull; Amniotic fluid volume: Polyhydramnios increases mobility, while oligohydramnios may fix the fetus in this position.<br />\r\n3. Management Options: &bull; Before Labor: &bull; External Cephalic Version (ECV): &bull; Performed after 37 weeks if no contraindications. &bull; Success depends on uterine tone and amniotic fluid volume. &bull; If ECV is unsuccessful, plan for cesarean delivery. &bull; In Labor: &bull; Cesarean Section: &bull; The definitive mode of delivery for persistent transverse lie. &bull; Immediate cesarean is required if labor starts or membranes rupture to prevent complications (e.g., cord prolapse, uterine rupture). &bull; Attempt ECV: Sometimes attempted early in labor if membranes are intact and no contraindications exist. 4.

When the patient is supine during late pregnancy, the gravid uterus has a compressive effect on the IVC. This results in opening up collateral circulation through the means of paravertebral and azygos veins. However, is some cases, the collateral circulation is unable to open up, and the heart&rsquo;s venous return may get severely impaired. Syncope, tachycardia, and hypotension are produced as a result. This phenomenon is called supine hypotension syndrome (postural hypotension).<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The initial management focuses on stabilizing the child by addressing dehydration and restoring perfusion. The correct initial approach is managing ABC, giving NS 20 ml/kg bolus, and delaying insulin administration by 1 hour (Option A). This ensures safe and effective management of severe dehydration and DKA Other options: Option B: Starting insulin along with NS bolus may increase the risk of cerebral edema due to rapid shifts in osmolality Option C &amp; D: A 10 ml/kg bolus is insufficient in severe dehydration and may not adequately restore perfusion<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partial penectomy<br />\r\nPartial penectomy is the most appropriate management for a patient with verrucous carcinoma (a type of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma) around the glans of the penis, especially when there is no involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes. Verrucous carcinoma has a slow-growing, locally invasive nature and rarely metastasizes to regional lymph nodes. The goal of treatment is to remove the tumor while preserving as much of the penis as possible to maintain function and appearance. Partial penectomy allows for complete excision of the tumor while sparing the healthy portion of the penis, making it the most appropriate surgical option in this scenario.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Total penectomy &ndash; Total penectomy involves the complete removal of the penis and is typically reserved for cases where the tumor is extensive or involves critical structures that cannot be preserved. Since this patient has localized verrucous carcinoma and no involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes, total penectomy is too radical for this case.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CO2 laser excision &ndash; CO2 laser excision is used for early-stage penile cancers and for lesions that are superficial and localized. However, in the case of verrucous carcinoma, the tumor may have a deep involvement of the penile tissue, which makes complete excision with a laser challenging. Laser therapy is not the first-line treatment for this condition if more extensive excision is required.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Topical 5-fluorouracil &ndash; Topical 5-fluorouracil is used for superficial lesions, often in cases of pre- cancerous conditions like Bowen&rsquo;s disease or actinic keratosis. However, verrucous carcinoma is usually a more invasive tumor, and the topical treatment would not provide sufficient tumor control in this case. Systemic treatment or more invasive surgery like partial penectomy is usually required for such lesions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intraosseous route access for giving IV fluids<br />\r\nThe procedure shown in the image is intraosseous (IO) access, which is commonly used for the rapid administration of IV fluids, blood products, and medications when traditional intravenous (IV) access is difficult or impossible, particularly in emergency or resuscitation settings. The IO route involves inserting a specialized needle into the medullary cavity of a long bone (commonly the proximal tibia or humerus), which provides a non-collapsible venous access. This method is lifesaving in critically ill patients, especially children, where vascular collapse may make peripheral IV access challenging.<br />\r\nA. Intraosseous cannula for pain relief &ndash; This option is incorrect. While intraosseous access can be used to administer analgesics, it is not typically placed specifically for pain relief. The primary indication is emergency vascular access for fluid and drug delivery.<br />\r\nB. Bone marrow aspiration &ndash; This involves using a different technique and equipment to obtain bone marrow samples for diagnostic purposes, usually from the iliac crest. It is a more deliberate, sterile, and diagnostic procedure, not an emergency vascular access technique.<br />\r\nD.

Fournier&#39;s gangrene is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening soft tissue infection that is polymicrobial, involving a mixed infection of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium species. These organisms synergistically lead to tissue destruction, gas formation, and systemic toxicity. Early diagnosis, broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and urgent surgical debridement are critical for survival.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anti-gas gangrene serum indicated for all cases &ndash; This is incorrect. Anti-gas gangrene serum (antitoxin against Clostridium perfringens) is specific to clostridial myonecrosis, not routinely used in Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene, which is usually polymicrobial and not always caused by clostridia.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urinary diversion is the next step &ndash; This is not universally true. Urinary diversion, such as suprapubic catheterization, may be required only if the urethra is involved or access is compromised, but it is not the next immediate step. Emergency surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics take priority.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bilateral orchidectomy must be done &ndash; This is incorrect as well. Testes usually have a separate arterial supply from the testicular arteries (from the abdominal aorta), and may remain viable even when the scrotal wall is necrotic. Orchidectomy is only done if the testes are necrotic, not routinely.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sympathetic &ndash; retrograde ejaculation and bladder dysfunction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common complication following ligation of the first vessel (usually the inferior mesenteric artery) during abdominoperineal resection (APR) for rectal carcinoma is damage to the sympathetic nerves, particularly the hypogastric plexus, which lie in close proximity to the vessel. These nerves are responsible for bladder neck closure and ejaculation mechanisms. Damage to these sympathetic fibers can result in retrograde ejaculation (where semen enters the bladder instead of being expelled) and bladder dysfunction, particularly issues with bladder emptying. This complication arises due to the disruption of sympathetic innervation, which plays a crucial role in involuntary control of urinary and reproductive functions.<br />\r\nA. Parasympathetic &ndash; bladder dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation &ndash; This is incorrect because parasympathetic nerves (from the pelvic splanchnic nerves) are more involved in bladder contraction and erection, not bladder neck closure or ejaculation. Parasympathetic injury more commonly leads to issues with bladder emptying and erectile dysfunction, not retrograde ejaculation.<br />\r\nB. Sympathetic &ndash; bladder dysfunction and impotence &ndash; While bladder dysfunction can be due to sympathetic damage, impotence (erectile dysfunction) is primarily mediated by parasympathetic nerves. Therefore, this combination doesn&#39;t correctly match the nerve supply affected.<br />\r\nD. Sympathetic &ndash; impotence and loss of cutaneous sensation in perineal region &ndash; This is incorrect because cutaneous sensation in the perineum is primarily supplied by somatic nerves (pudendal nerve), and impotence is more linked to parasympathetic damage, not sympathetic injury alone.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In this case, the patient has a history of trauma to the chest, and the lesion appears as a raised, firm, nodular mass that has persisted and possibly enlarged over time &mdash; classic features of a keloid. Keloids are more common on areas such as the chest, shoulders, upper back, and earlobes, and tend to occur after skin trauma such as surgery, injury, burns, or acne. They often appear shiny and smooth and do not regress spontaneously. The delayed presentation and progressive growth of the lesion support the diagnosis.<br />\r\nA. Hemangioma &ndash; Incorrect. Hemangiomas are vascular tumors seen more commonly in infants and young children. They usually appear as soft, compressible, red or bluish lesions and are not associated with prior trauma. Additionally, they tend to involute over time, unlike keloids.<br />\r\nB. Hypertrophic scar &ndash; Incorrect. While hypertrophic scars also form after trauma, they are confined to the borders of the original wound and often regress over time. In contrast, keloids grow beyond the wound margins and persist or enlarge, as seen in this case.<br />\r\nD. Neurofibroma &ndash; Incorrect. Neurofibromas are nerve sheath tumors associated with neurofibromatosis, usually presenting as soft, skin-colored nodules that may be pedunculated.

Entrapment of this nerve leads to a condition called meralgia paresthetica, characterized by pain, burning, or numbness over the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Since this nerve is purely sensory, there is no motor weakness. The symptoms described in the patient are classic for LCNT entrapment post-hernia repair.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ilioinguinal nerve &ndash; Incorrect. The ilioinguinal nerve supplies the skin of the superomedial thigh, root of the penis/scrotum (in males), or mons pubis/labia majora (in females). Entrapment of this nerve would typically cause groin or scrotal pain, not lateral thigh pain.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Iliohypogastric nerve &ndash; Incorrect.

This parasitic infection leads to the formation of fluid-filled cysts within the liver, which can become secondarily infected or rupture into the biliary tree, causing jaundice, cholangitis, or even anaphylaxis. The presence of daughter cysts and calcified walls on imaging is typical for hydatid disease. Diagnosis is supported by serology and imaging, and treatment often includes albendazole with or without surgery depending on the stage and complications.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Surgery is mandatory &ndash; Incorrect. While surgery may be indicated in complicated or large cysts, it is not always mandatory. Medical management with albendazole and minimally invasive procedures (e.g., PAIR &ndash; puncture, aspiration, injection, re-aspiration) are also effective for certain types of hydatid cysts. Surgical intervention is reserved for ruptured, infected, or compressive cysts.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fine-needle aspiration cytology is diagnostic &ndash; Incorrect. FNAC is contraindicated in suspected hydatid disease due to the risk of cyst rupture and anaphylaxis. Diagnosis is usually made through imaging and serological tests. If aspiration is needed (e.g., PAIR), it is done under controlled conditions with pre-treatment using albendazole.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Angioembolization is the treatment of choice &ndash; Incorrect. Angioembolization is used in vascular lesions, such as hepatic hemangiomas or bleeding tumors, not in hydatid cysts. It has no role in the treatment of Echinococcal disease.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

These features are characteristic of benign salivary gland tumors, most commonly pleomorphic adenoma, which accounts for the majority of parotid tumors. Pleomorphic adenomas are known for being painless, slow-growing, and mobile, and may feel firm or rubbery with a lobulated surface. The variability in consistency suggests a mixed tissue composition, which is also typical of pleomorphic adenomas. Their location near the angle of the mandible and mobility over underlying structures further support the diagnosis.<br />\r\nA. Dermoid cyst &ndash; Incorrect.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most appropriate surgery for a patient with chronic pancreatitis, recurrent attacks, dilatation of the pancreatic duct, and intraductal calculi is longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (also known as the Puestow procedure). This surgery is indicated when there is pancreatic ductal dilation with obstructive symptoms due to calculi. The procedure involves creating an anastomosis between the pancreatic duct and the jejunum, allowing for the drainage of pancreatic secretions and relieving the ductal obstruction. This helps to manage symptoms, prevent further episodes of pancreatitis, and potentially prevent further complications like pancreatic pseudocysts or chronic pain.<br />\r\nA. Pancreaticoduodenectomy &ndash; Incorrect. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) is typically performed in cases of pancreatic cancer or severe chronic pancreatitis involving the head of the pancreas, often with gallbladder disease or biliary obstruction. It is not indicated solely for patients with pancreatic duct dilatation and intraductal calculi without other indications like malignancy or massive organ involvement.<br />\r\nC. ERCP and sphincterotomy &ndash; Incorrect. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) with sphincterotomy can be used to relieve symptoms in patients with pancreatic ductal stones or strictures, but it is typically more effective in acute attacks or mild cases. This approach is not the surgery of choice when there is significant pancreatic duct dilatation and recurrent attacks, as the relief might be short-lived or incomplete for patients with chronic pancreatitis and significant ductal pathology.<br />\r\nD. Coring of pancreas head &ndash; Incorrect. Coring of the pancreas head (removal of diseased tissue or pancreatic head resection) is not the standard approach for chronic pancreatitis with dilated ducts and intraductal calculi. While this procedure may be used in some cases of focal pancreatitis, it is less effective for diffuse disease or significant ductal dilation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ER positive<br />\r\nA BIRADS-5 breast lesion indicates a high suspicion for malignancy, with a likelihood of cancer greater than 95%. The prognostic factors for breast cancer include several molecular and tumor<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nmarkers, and among these, ER (Estrogen Receptor) positivity is considered a good prognostic factor. When a breast cancer is ER-positive, it means that the cancer cells are responsive to estrogen, which generally results in a better prognosis. ER-positive tumors tend to grow more slowly, are less likely to spread, and respond well to hormonal therapy like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, which reduce the risk of recurrence.<br />\r\nA. BRCA-1 positive &ndash; Incorrect. BRCA-1 mutations are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer, particularly aggressive forms like triple-negative breast cancer. These tumors are often ER-negative and PR-negative, with poor prognosis. While BRCA-1 mutations increase the risk, they do not correlate with a better prognosis in the presence of a BIRADS-5 lesion.<br />\r\nB. p53 positive &ndash; Incorrect. p53 mutations are typically found in aggressive and poorly differentiated tumors, and their presence is associated with a worse prognosis. p53-positive tumors are often more resistant to therapy and may be associated with a higher rate of recurrence. This makes p53 positivity a poor prognostic factor, not a good one.<br />\r\nD. High Ki-67 &ndash; Incorrect. Ki-67 is a marker of cell proliferation, and a high Ki-67 index indicates rapid cell growth. High Ki-67 levels correlate with more aggressive tumors and a worse prognosis. Tumors with high Ki-67 often have higher chances of recurrence and metastasis, so a high Ki-67 index is considered a poor prognostic factor.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The patient&#39;s sudden onset of chest pain, which radiates to the neck and interscapular region, coupled with a widened mediastinum on the X-ray, is highly suggestive of this condition. Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, allowing blood to flow between the layers and causing the aorta to split or &quot;dissect.&quot; This often leads to severe chest pain and can be associated with asymmetrical blood pressure readings in both arms, which is another significant sign here (right BP: 110/90 mmHg, left BP: 160/100 mmHg). Aortic dissection is a medical emergency and requires urgent intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Acute coronary syndrome &ndash; Incorrect. While acute coronary syndrome (ACS) also presents with chest pain, the character and radiation of the pain are different from those seen in aortic dissection. ACS typically presents with central, crushing chest pain that may radiate to the left arm, neck, or jaw. In this case, the pain described is shooting and radiates to the neck and interscapular region, which is more characteristic of an aortic dissection. Additionally, ACS would not cause the widened mediastinum or the significant BP asymmetry noted in this patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Acute pulmonary embolism &ndash; Incorrect. Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) typically presents with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and possibly hemoptysis. It is less likely to cause pain radiating to the neck or interscapular region. Moreover, PE is unlikely to cause a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray or significant asymmetry in blood pressure between the arms, which are key features pointing towards aortic dissection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Esophageal rupture &ndash; Incorrect. Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) can present with severe chest pain, but the pain is typically associated with vomiting or retching prior to the onset of symptoms. This condition may lead to mediastinal emphysema or air in the mediastinum, but it would not typically present with the radiating pain seen in aortic dissection or the widened mediastinum without signs of air in the tissues. The BP discrepancy seen in this patient is also not characteristic of esophageal rupture.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medical therapy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most appropriate next step in management is medical therapy. In this case, the patient has a liver abscess, which is commonly caused by an infectious process, possibly following a prior episode of diarrhea. The initial treatment of a liver abscess often involves antibiotic therapy to address the infection, particularly if the abscess is small (like the 25cc abscess described here) and there are no signs of complications such as rupture, sepsis, or failure to respond to antibiotics. In many cases, medical therapy with appropriate antibiotics is sufficient for treating small abscesses.<br />\r\nA. PAIR (Percutaneous Aspiration, Injection, and Reaspiration) &ndash; Incorrect. PAIR is a procedure where the abscess is aspirated and the cavity is irrigated and possibly injected with sclerosing agents. This approach is typically used for larger or more complicated abscesses, or in cases where medical therapy has failed. Since this patient has a relatively small abscess and no evidence of complications, PAIR is not the first-line treatment.<br />\r\nB. Surgery &ndash; Incorrect. Surgery is typically reserved for patients with larger abscesses, complications like rupture or peritonitis, or those who fail to respond to medical therapy and less invasive procedures. In this case, there is no indication of surgical intervention because the abscess is small, and there is no mention of complications that would necessitate surgery.<br />\r\nD. Percutaneous drainage &ndash; Incorrect. Percutaneous drainage is an option for abscesses that are larger or if there is failure to improve with medical therapy. While this might be considered if the abscess becomes larger or complicated, it is not the first step in management for a small, uncomplicated liver abscess.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subdural hemorrhage</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most likely diagnosis in this case is subdural hemorrhage. The patient&rsquo;s history of trauma and alcohol dependence is significant, as alcohol can increase the risk of falls and trauma due to impaired coordination and judgment. Additionally, alcohol dependence can predispose to coagulation abnormalities, increasing the likelihood of bleeding. The symptoms of confusion and ataxia following a traumatic event, along with the CT finding, are consistent with a subdural hemorrhage. A subdural hemorrhage typically results from shearing forces that cause veins in the subdural space to rupture, leading to bleeding between the dura and the arachnoid layers. This type of hemorrhage often has a crescent-shaped appearance on CT scans and can cause symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and other neurological deficits, which align with the patient&#39;s presentation.<br />\r\nA. Extradural hemorrhage &ndash; Incorrect. Extradural hemorrhage (or epidural hemorrhage) typically results from arterial bleeding (often the middle meningeal artery) following trauma, and it typically presents as a lens-shaped (biconvex) mass on CT scan. The patient&rsquo;s symptoms and the location of the hemorrhage do not align with extradural hemorrhage, and the CT findings would likely show a more convex mass with a sharp border, unlike the crescent shape of a subdural hemorrhage.<br />\r\nC. Intra-parenchymal hemorrhage &ndash; Incorrect. Intra-parenchymal hemorrhage (or intracerebral hemorrhage) occurs within the brain parenchyma itself, rather than between the meninges. While this type of hemorrhage can be seen in patients with trauma, the patient&#39;s clinical symptoms and the location of the bleeding are more consistent with a subdural hemorrhage. Intra-parenchymal hemorrhages would also present with different imaging findings, typically showing a more irregular shape or mass directly within the brain tissue.<br />\r\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage &ndash; Incorrect. Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically results from the rupture of cerebral aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations, and it presents with sudden-onset, severe headache (often described as the worst headache of the patient&rsquo;s life). While trauma can cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, it would typically present with blood in the subarachnoid space on CT, which is usually seen as hyperdense areas around the sulci. The patient&rsquo;s confusion and ataxia do not align with the typical presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the CT findings in this case suggest a subdural hemorrhage rather than subarachnoid bleeding.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperbaric oxygen has no role in the treatment of this condition. Explanation:<br />\r\nThe condition described in the question is Meleney&rsquo;s gangrene, a rare and severe type of postoperative synergistic bacterial gangrene that involves rapidly progressive necrotizing infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It typically occurs after abdominal surgery or trauma and is associated with extreme pain, erythema, and tissue necrosis. Management is urgent and aggressive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has shown benefit in the treatment of necrotizing soft tissue infections, including Meleney&rsquo;s gangrene. HBOT enhances oxygen delivery to hypoxic tissues, inhibits anaerobic bacterial growth, boosts neutrophil function, and supports wound healing. Therefore, statement D is false &mdash; hyperbaric oxygen does have a role in the treatment of this condition, especially as an adjunct to surgery and antibiotics.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Repeated radical surgery every 24 hours may be required to adequately manage this condition &ndash; Correct.<br />\r\nMeleney&rsquo;s gangrene and other necrotizing soft tissue infections require aggressive and repeated surgical debridement, often daily or every 24 hours, to remove all necrotic tissue and prevent further spread. Surgical intervention is the cornerstone of management, along with antibiotics.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a case of Meleney&rsquo;s gangrene &ndash; Correct.<br />\r\nBased on the description of a severe, spreading soft tissue infection requiring repeated debridement and involving mixed organisms, the clinical picture aligns with Meleney&rsquo;s gangrene. This condition typically follows surgery or trauma and is characterized by rapid spread of infection with high morbidity.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This condition is caused by beta hemolytic streptococcus and may sometimes be polymicrobial &ndash; Correct.<br />\r\nMeleney&rsquo;s gangrene often involves beta-hemolytic streptococci, particularly Group A Streptococcus, and is frequently polymicrobial, involving anaerobes like Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus, which act synergistically. This mixed infection contributes to the rapid tissue destruction seen in the disease.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conjoint tendon&nbsp;<br />\r\nExplanation:<br />\r\nA direct inguinal hernia occurs when abdominal contents herniate through a weakened posterior wall of the inguinal canal, specifically through Hesselbach&#39;s triangle, which is bounded by the rectus abdominis muscle (medially), the inferior epigastric vessels (laterally), and the inguinal ligament (inferiorly). The conjoint tendon (also known as the inguinal falx), formed by the fusion of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis aponeuroses, helps reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. Weakness or attenuation of the conjoint tendon allows abdominal contents to protrude directly through this wall, leading to a direct inguinal hernia. Hence, option B is correct because it identifies the structure most closely associated with the structural integrity of the area involved in direct inguinal hernias.<br />\r\nA. Pectineal ligament &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nThe pectineal ligament (Cooper&rsquo;s ligament) is located on the superior ramus of the pubis and is involved in femoral hernia repair. It does not contribute to the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, so its weakness is unrelated to direct inguinal hernias.<br />\r\nC. Reflected part of inguinal ligament &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nThis is a small fibrous extension of the inguinal ligament that reflects upwards and medially toward the linea alba. It plays a minor role in the structure of the inguinal canal and does not significantly affect the strength of the posterior wall, so its weakness is not a primary factor in direct hernia formation.<br />\r\nD. Lacunar ligament &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nThe lacunar ligament forms the medial border of the femoral ring and is primarily relevant in femoral hernias. It is not part of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and thus not involved in the pathogenesis of direct inguinal hernias.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peptic ulcer Explanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most likely diagnosis is peptic ulcer disease (PUD). This condition often presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding manifested as hematemesis, especially in individuals with known risk factors. The patient has a history of aspirin use, which is a common cause of mucosal injury leading to ulcer formation due to its inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, reducing gastric mucosal protection. Additionally, occasional alcohol consumption can irritate the gastric mucosa and exacerbate ulceration. The history of abdominal pain supports the diagnosis, as ulcers often cause epigastric discomfort. The absence of abdominal tenderness or mass does not exclude ulcer-related bleeding, as many ulcers can bleed silently until significant hemorrhage occurs. Therefore, the clinical picture is most consistent with a bleeding peptic ulcer.<br />\r\nA. Mallory-Weiss tear &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nThis condition involves a longitudinal mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, typically following forceful vomiting or retching, leading to hematemesis. The absence of preceding vomiting or retching in this case makes this diagnosis less likely.<br />\r\nB. Esophagitis &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nEsophagitis may present with mild bleeding, dysphagia, or odynophagia, but it rarely causes significant hematemesis. It is more commonly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or immunosuppressed states (e.g., candida or viral esophagitis), which are not present in this case.<br />\r\nD. Esophageal varices &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nWhile esophageal varices are a serious cause of upper GI bleeding, they are typically seen in patients with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. There is no evidence of liver dysfunction in this patient, and occasional alcohol use without signs of cirrhosis or chronic liver disease makes this diagnosis unlikely.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuous exposure to drills and machines Explanation:<br />\r\nThe most likely etiology of the white fingers in this construction worker is Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), which results from prolonged and repeated use of vibrating tools and machinery such as drills, grinders, and polishers. This syndrome includes symptoms like intermittent blanching (white fingers), numbness, tingling, pain, and reduced grip strength, and it primarily affects the vascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems of the upper limb. The blanching, or &quot;white fingers,&quot; especially in response to cold, is due to vasospasm similar to Raynaud&rsquo;s phenomenon, and occurs because of long-term damage to the digital arteries and nerves. Given the patient&rsquo;s occupational history involving 20 years of working with vibrating machinery, option D is the most accurate explanation for his symptoms.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Candidal infection of the fingers due to continuous exposure to water &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nCandidal infections typically present as paronychia or whitish patches with inflammation, not as blanching or vascular changes like white fingers. There is no mention of moist environments or signs of infection such as swelling or redness.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exposure to thinners and paints &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nExposure to solvents like thinners and paints can cause contact dermatitis or chemical burns, but these do not usually present with white fingers due to vascular changes. There is no indication of skin irritation or rash in this scenario.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Continuous exposure to cement and concrete &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nProlonged contact with cement and concrete can lead to skin problems such as irritant contact dermatitis or allergic dermatitis due to the alkaline nature of cement.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamartoma Explanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most likely diagnosis is a hamartoma, specifically a juvenile (retention) polyp, which is the most common type of rectal polyp in children and young adults. These lesions are benign, disorganized overgrowths of tissue normally found in the affected area. Clinically, they present with painless rectal bleeding and prolapse, as described in the case. On histopathology, juvenile polyps typically show dilated, cystically enlarged glands filled with mucin, often with inflammatory cells in the stroma, which aligns with the findings of enlarged and inflamed glands filled with mucin. These features are classic for a hamartomatous polyp, confirming option C as the correct answer.<br />\r\nA. Adenoma &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nAn adenoma is a neoplastic lesion with potential for malignant transformation, usually seen in older adults. Histologically, adenomas show dysplastic epithelium, not simply mucin-filled glands with inflammation. Adenomas are less common in young patients and typically not associated with prolapse.<br />\r\nB. Choristoma &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nA choristoma is a mass of normal tissue in an abnormal location (ectopic tissue). This does not fit the clinical or histological picture, as the rectal mass in this case is made of tissue normally found in the rectum, just disorganized &mdash; which is consistent with a hamartoma, not a choristoma.<br />\r\nD. Carcinoma &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nCarcinoma implies malignant epithelial transformation, with features such as invasion, cellular atypia, and mitotic figures. The histology here does not show dysplasia or invasion, and the clinical presentation in a 25-year-old with painless bleeding and prolapse also does not support carcinoma, which is rare at this age.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trophic ulcer Explanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A trophic ulcer, also known as a neuropathic ulcer, is caused by loss of sensation due to nerve damage, commonly from conditions like diabetes mellitus, leprosy, or spinal cord injuries. The key characteristics include painless ulceration, typically over pressure points (such as the heel, sole, or metatarsal heads), and deep, punched-out appearance with a surrounding area of callus or dry skin. These ulcers develop due to repetitive unnoticed trauma and poor wound healing secondary to lack of protective sensation. The chronic nature, absence of pain, and location over pressure points strongly point toward a trophic ulcer, making option D the correct diagnosis.<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Venous ulcer &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nVenous ulcers usually occur around the medial malleolus (ankle) and are associated with varicose veins, leg swelling, and hyperpigmentation. They are typically shallow, irregular in shape, and surrounded by edema and skin changes like lipodermatosclerosis. These features are not mentioned or implied in this case.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Malignant ulcer &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nMalignant ulcers (e.g., Marjolin&rsquo;s ulcer or ulcerating cancers) often have raised, everted edges, are non-healing, and may be associated with bleeding, foul discharge, or regional lymphadenopathy. The description lacks such suggestive malignant features or systemic signs.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arterial ulcer &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nArterial ulcers typically appear on toes, feet, or other pressure areas, and are painful, with punched- out edges, and the surrounding skin is often cold, pale, and hairless due to poor arterial blood supply. The presence of pain is a distinguishing factor, which is usually absent in trophic ulcers due to neuropathy.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C4a<br />\r\nExplanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders, the &quot;C&quot; in CEAP stands for clinical classification. C4a specifically refers to skin changes due to venous disease, including eczema (also called stasis dermatitis) and pigmentation. In this case, the patient with varicose veins presents with eczema over the same area, which is a classic skin change associated with chronic venous insufficiency. These skin manifestations are due to venous hypertension, leading to capillary leakage, hemosiderin deposition, and inflammatory responses in the skin. Therefore, C4a is the correct classification, as it directly refers to venous eczema and pigmentation without ulceration.<br />\r\nA. C2 &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nC2 refers only to the presence of varicose veins without any associated edema, skin changes, or ulcers. Since this patient has developed eczema, the condition has progressed beyond C2.<br />\r\nB. C3 &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nC3 denotes the presence of edema in association with venous disease, but without skin changes such as eczema or pigmentation. The presence of eczema elevates the classification beyond this stage.<br />\r\nD. C4b &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nC4b refers to more severe skin changes, such as lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche, which are not mentioned in this scenario.

Nimodipine has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality following SAH. It is typically started as early as possible after diagnosis and continued for 21 days. While it does not treat the hemorrhage itself, it plays a crucial role in preventing secondary complications and improving neurologic outcomes. Thus, initiating Nimodipine is the most appropriate and immediate pharmacological intervention after confirming SAH.<br />\r\nB. Angiography &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nWhile cerebral angiography is important for identifying the source of bleeding (e.g., ruptured aneurysm), it is not the immediate next step. Stabilization and prevention of complications like vasospasm with Nimodipine take precedence before invasive investigations.<br />\r\nC. Surgery &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nSurgical intervention (e.g., clipping or endovascular coiling of the aneurysm) is a definitive treatment but is typically done after initial stabilization and imaging to localize the source. It is not the immediate next step after the CT diagnosis, especially before administering measures to prevent vasospasm.<br />\r\nD.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeding jejunostomy Explanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingestion of strong caustic agents like sodium hydroxide can cause severe damage to the esophagus, leading to complete dysphagia (inability to swallow). The best immediate management in this case, after stabilizing the patient and addressing any acute injuries (such as airway protection, fluid resuscitation, and pain management), is to establish nutritional support. A feeding jejunostomy (J-tube) is typically recommended in patients who have severe esophageal injury or strictures, and are unable to maintain oral intake due to dysphagia. It allows for enteral feeding bypassing the damaged esophagus and providing nutritional support until the patient can recover or the esophagus can be treated or repaired. This is the most appropriate step in managing long-term nutritional needs.<br />\r\nA. Esophagojejunostomy &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nEsophagojejunostomy involves creating a direct anastomosis between the esophagus and the jejunum, which is generally used in cases where esophageal resection is performed due to severe malignancy or extensive damage. In this case, complete dysphagia due to caustic ingestion is better managed with feeding via a jejunostomy tube before considering such extensive procedures.<br />\r\nB. Stent placement &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nStent placement may be used for palliative management of esophageal strictures in certain situations (such as cancer or benign stenosis), but it is not the first-line treatment in the acute setting of caustic ingestion. The priority here is nutritional support and treating the esophageal injury, which stents would not address effectively in this scenario.<br />\r\nD. Gastrojejunostomy &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nGastrojejunostomy is typically performed in cases of gastric outlet obstruction or intractable gastric issues, and is not appropriate for managing caustic esophageal injury. The goal in this case is to bypass the damaged esophagus, and a feeding jejunostomy is a more direct and suitable approach.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thyroglossal cyst Explanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most likely diagnosis is a thyroglossal cyst. These cysts are the most common congenital neck masses and are typically located along the midline of the neck, specifically at the level of the hyoid bone or along the path of the embryological descent of the thyroid gland. The key features that point to this diagnosis are:<br />\r\nMidline location of the swelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The swelling moves with swallowing (deglutition) and protrusion of the tongue, as it is connected to the tongue via the thyroglossal duct. This duct is a remnant of the thyroid gland&rsquo;s descent during embryogenesis. The movement of the swelling with tongue protrusion is a hallmark feature of thyroglossal cysts.<br />\r\nA. Brachial cyst &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nA brachial cyst typically presents as a lateral neck mass, usually anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It does not move with swallowing or tongue protrusion, as it is not connected to the tongue or swallowing muscles. It is generally not found in the midline, ruling out this diagnosis in this case.<br />\r\nC. Plunging ranula &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nA plunging ranula is a type of mucocele that arises from the sublingual gland and typically presents as a swelling in the submandibular region or along the floor of the mouth. Though it can be mobile, it does not typically move with tongue protrusion in the same way as a thyroglossal cyst and is more commonly lateral in location.<br />\r\nD. Dermoid cyst &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nA dermoid cyst is a benign cystic mass that can occur in various locations, including the head and neck. It is generally midline but is non-mobile and does not move with swallowing or tongue protrusion. Dermoid cysts typically contain skin structures like hair follicles and sebaceous glands, which is not consistent with the typical presentation of a thyroglossal cyst.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chemotherapy given before radical surgery to reduce bulk of tumor Explanation:<br />\r\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to chemotherapy that is administered before the primary treatment (in this case, radical surgery) with the aim of reducing the size or bulk of the tumor, making the surgery more effective or easier to perform. This approach is typically used in cancers where the tumor is large or locally advanced, as it can help shrink the tumor, improve surgical outcomes, and increase the chance of complete resection. For the patient with stage 2A cervical cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is intended to reduce tumor size prior to radical surgery to remove the tumor, improving surgical accessibility and the overall prognosis.<br />\r\nA. Chemotherapy given along with radiation &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nChemotherapy given along with radiation refers to concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (often used in locally advanced cancers). This is not neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as the chemotherapy is administered simultaneously with radiation, not prior to it.<br />\r\nB. Chemotherapy given during surgery &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nChemotherapy administered during surgery is not referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This scenario would likely refer to intraoperative chemotherapy, which may be used in certain cancer surgeries to treat residual cancer cells during the procedure, but it is not the same as neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<br />\r\nD. Chemotherapy given after radical surgery for micrometastases &ndash; Incorrect.<br />\r\nChemotherapy given after surgery is known as adjuvant chemotherapy. It is used to target any remaining micrometastases or prevent recurrence after the tumor has been surgically removed. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given before surgery, not after.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The next most appropriate step for this patient is detection of microfilariae in the blood smear. The microfilariae circulate in the blood at night showing a nocturnal periodicity, so blood smears of samples obtained at night between 10PM to 2AM can detect microfilariae. DEC provocation test refers to administration of DEC and subsequently collecting blood samples. Although DEC provocation has the advantage of blood sample collection even in the day time, guidelines suggest blood sample collection at night followed by identification of microfilariae in a blood smear.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The condition described, with bone pain and hepatosplenomegaly, and a &quot;crumpled tissue paper&quot; appearance on a trephine biopsy and aspirate, is Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as acid beta-glucosidase). This leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the macrophages, which are referred to as Gaucher cells. The &quot;crumpled tissue paper&quot; appearance is a hallmark of Gaucher cells, and they are seen in bone marrow biopsies. Symptoms of Gaucher disease include hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain, and fractures, among others, due to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Why the other options are less likely: A. Hexosaminidase: A deficiency in hexosaminidase A is characteristic of Tay- Sachs disease, which primarily affects the nervous system and presents with progressive neurodegeneration. It does not cause the &quot;crumpled tissue paper&quot; appearance or hepatosplenomegaly. C. Sphingomyelinase: A deficiency in sphingomyelinase is seen in Niemann-Pick disease, which also causes hepatosplenomegaly but presents with neurodegeneration and the accumulation of sphingomyelin, not glucocerebroside. The &quot;foam cells&quot; in Niemann-Pick disease look different from the crumpled tissue paper appearance in Gaucher cells. D. Alpha 1,4 glucosidase: A deficiency in alpha-1,4-glucosidase causes Pompe disease, which leads to muscle weakness and cardiomegaly. It does not typically cause hepatosplenomegaly or the &quot;crumpled tissue paper&quot; appearance in the bone marrow.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It can also cause hypercalcemia due to paraneoplastic syndromes, particularly the release of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which raises serum calcium levels. The presence of large atypical cells with hyperchromasia on lung biopsy fits with squamous cell carcinoma Other options: Small cell carcinoma (B) typically presents with more rapid progression, often associated with symptoms like cough, hemoptysis, and paraneoplastic syndromes such as SIADH (not hypercalcemia). The cells are usually smaller and have less hyperchromasia compared to what is described in this case Adenocarcinoma (C) is also linked to smoking but is generally more common in non-smokers as well. It can present with similar symptoms but typically shows glandular differentiation on histology Large cell neuroendocrine tumor (D) is a rare form of neuroendocrine tumor of the lung, which can also present with similar symptoms, but the histology often shows large, polygonal cells and neuroendocrine features, which does not match the description of large atypical cells with hyperchromasia seen here<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that affects the mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum, or pericardium. It is most associated with exposure to asbestos. Asbestos exposure is strongly linked to the development of mesothelioma, especially in individuals who work in environments where they are exposed to asbestos fibres, such as cement factories, and shipyards. Chronic smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, but smoking alone does not directly cause mesothelioma. However, the combined risk of smoking and asbestos exposure may increase the risk of other respiratory diseases and cancers Other options: A) Silicosis: This is caused by inhalation of silica dust, commonly seen in miners, quarry workers, and stonecutters. Silicosis is associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis and certain types of lung cancer, but it is not directly linked to mesothelioma C) Coal worker pneumoconiosis: This is caused by inhalation of coal dust, seen in coal miners. It primarily causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumoconiosis, but it is not associated with mesothelioma D) Bagassosis: This is caused by inhalation of dust from sugarcane. It leads to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but it is not linked to mesothelioma<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osmotic fragility test- Hereditary spherocytosis The most appropriate investigation for a child with intermittent jaundice, splenomegaly, and spherocytes on peripheral blood smear is the osmotic fragility test, which would support a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis Other options: B) Coombs test - AIHA: The Coombs test is used to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). While AIHA can also cause jaundice and splenomegaly, it typically presents with normocytic or macrocytic cells, not spherocytes. The peripheral smear in AIHA often shows polychromasia, reticulocytosis, and spherocytes, but the clinical presentation with a family history is more suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis C) G6PD deficiency - genetic testing: G6PD deficiency leads to hemolysis under oxidative stress (e.g., after taking certain drugs, infections, or eating fava beans), but it does not typically present with spherocytes. G6PD deficiency usually causes bite cells and blister cells on the peripheral blood smear, not spherocytes D) PNH - Flow cytometry: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disorder of red blood cells characterized by hemolysis and thrombosis, but it typically presents with hemoglobinuria (dark urine, especially after waking up) and does not feature spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Flow cytometry is used to detect deficiencies of GPI-anchored proteins in PNH, but this is not the case here<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

On electron microscopy, subepithelial deposits are seen in PSGN.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluid overload Chest discomfort after a blood transfusion, along with bilateral fissural thickening on X-ray, is highly suggestive of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). This condition occurs when the volume of transfused blood exceeds the circulatory capacity of the patient, leading to pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. TACO is more likely when multiple units of blood are transfused within a short period, as in this case (4 units of blood in 2 hours). Other options: A) ABO Incompatibility: This can cause an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, leading to symptoms such as fever, chills, back pain, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria, but chest discomfort and bilateral fissural thickening on X-ray are not typical of ABO incompatibility B) GVHD (Graft-versus-host disease): GVHD occurs when the donor&#39;s T lymphocytes attack the recipient&#39;s tissues. It can manifest with fever, rash, liver dysfunction, and diarrhea, but pulmonary findings like bilateral fissural thickening are uncommon early in GVHD. It typically presents later, often after a few days C) Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia due to citrate toxicity (from blood transfusions) can cause symptoms such as muscle cramps, tetany, and arrhythmias, but chest discomfort and bilateral fissural thickening on X-ray are not typical features of hypocalcemia<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
