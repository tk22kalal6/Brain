      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nExpiration\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring expiration, the lungs and alveoli recoil and become smaller, reducing alveolar surface area. As a result, surfactant molecules become more concentrated. Although surfactant works to reduce surface tension, when alveoli shrink, the relative effectiveness of surfactant is reduced, leading to a slight increase in surface tension.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Laplace's law states that smaller alveoli (like during expiration) would experience greater inward pressure due to surface tension. This is why surfactant is especially important in preventing alveolar collapse during expiration, but surface tension does increase compared to inspiration.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nB. Inspiration \r\nIncorrect. During inspiration, alveoli expand, and surfactant molecules are more evenly distributed across a larger surface area. This results in a reduction in surface tension.\r\n\r\nC. Standing \r\nIncorrect. Body posture may affect lung volumes and ventilation-perfusion ratios, but it does not directly influence alveolar surface tension like the phases of respiration do.\r\n\r\nD. Supine \r\nIncorrect. Like standing, supine position affects mechanics of ventilation but does not directly increase surface tension in alveoli.\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nRespiratory alkalosis\r\n\r\nAt high altitude, the atmospheric pressure is lower, leading to a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO?). To compensate, the body responds with hyperventilation—an increased breathing rate—to try to bring in more oxygen.\r\n\r\nHowever, hyperventilation also causes excessive exhalation of CO?, which reduces the arterial partial pressure of CO? (PaCO?). Since CO? is acidic, its loss results in a rise in blood pH, leading to respiratory alkalosis.\r\n\r\nThis is an early and classic physiological response to high altitude exposure.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Metabolic acidosis \r\nIncorrect. This occurs due to excess acid or loss of bicarbonate (e.g., in renal failure or diarrhea), not due to hyperventilation. High altitude does not directly cause metabolic acidosis.\r\n\r\nB. Metabolic alkalosis \r\nIncorrect. This is typically caused by loss of H? ions (e.g., vomiting, diuretics), not due to changes in ventilation or altitude.\r\n\r\nC. Respiratory acidosis \r\nIncorrect. This results from hypoventilation, which causes CO? retention and a drop in pH. At high altitude, the opposite—hyperventilation—occurs.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\n25 Hz\r\nThe tetanizing frequency is the minimum frequency at which repeated stimuli result in fused, sustained muscle contraction (complete tetanus) rather than discrete twitches. To calculate it, we first determine the total time of a single muscle twitch:\r\n\r\nLatent period: 10 ms\r\n\r\nContraction period: 40 ms\r\n\r\nRelaxation period: 40 ms\r\nTotal twitch time = 90 ms\r\n\r\nTo produce complete tetanus, stimuli must occur faster than this 90 ms cycle, typically 2–3 times per twitch. Thus, the tetanizing frequency is:\r\n\r\n&lt;math&gt;Tetanizing frequency?100090×2.5?25–30 Hz\\text{Tetanizing frequency} ? \\frac{1000}{90} \\times 2.5 ? 25–30 \\text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;Tetanizing frequency?901000×2.5?25–30 Hz\r\n\r\nAmong the choices, 25 Hz is the best approximation and the correct answer.\r\n\r\nIncorrect options:\r\n\r\nOption A: 20 Hz\r\n\r\nThis frequency corresponds to one stimulus every 50 ms, which is longer than the contraction-relaxation cycle, leading only to incomplete (unfused) tetanus, not full tetanus. Hence, it is too low.\r\n\r\nOption B: 30 Hz\r\n\r\nThis is a possible tetanizing frequency, but it is higher than the minimum required. While still physiologically acceptable, 25 Hz is the more accurate minimum frequency, making 30 Hz an incorrect choice based on this question’s context.\r\n\r\nOption C: 40 Hz\r\n\r\nSimilar to 30 Hz, this frequency is well above the required level to achieve tetanus. Although effective, it's not the best answer since the question asks for the calculated tetanizing frequency, and 25 Hz is a better match based on the twitch duration.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nTemperature regulation\r\n\r\nFeedforward mechanisms are anticipatory responses that prepare the body for a predicted change, rather than reacting to a change that has already occurred. These mechanisms are proactive, unlike feedback systems which are reactive.\r\n\r\nAn example is temperature regulation, especially when the body prepares for heat loss or gain in advance—like\r\n\r\nShivering before the core temperature has dropped significantly\r\n\r\nVasodilation/sweating initiated before the core gets overheated (based on skin temperature)\r\n\r\nSuch anticipatory adjustments are made based on external cues or early signs to prevent a larger disturbance, which is the essence of feedforward control.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA. HR increases from supine to standing\r\nThis is a feedback response. Baroreceptors detect a drop in blood pressure due to gravity and then adjust the heart rate to maintain perfusion. It's a reactive correction.\r\n\r\nB. Vasoconstriction in response to cooling\r\nAlso a feedback mechanism. The body detects a drop in temperature and reacts by conserving heat through vasoconstriction. This happens after the stimulus is sensed.\r\n\r\nC. Increase in cardiac output in response to anemia\r\nThis is also feedback. The reduced oxygen-carrying capacity is detected, and in response, the heart pumps faster/harder to compensate. It is a compensatory adjustment, not anticipatory.",

Therefore, Option C is NOT a mechanism of ADH, making it the correct answer.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA.

This reflex causes a triad of effects:\r\n\r\nHypopnea (? respiratory rate) \r\nThe reflex inhibits respiratory centers, leading to shallow or reduced breathing.\r\n\r\nBradycardia (? heart rate) \r\nDue to vagal stimulation, the heart rate decreases.\r\n\r\nHypotension (? blood pressure) \r\nCaused by vasodilation and decreased cardiac output due to reduced sympathetic tone and bradycardia.\r\n\r\nThese features help protect the heart during ischemic or volume-depleted states by lowering its workload.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Option:\r\n2. Tachycardia \r\nThis is not a feature of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. In fact, bradycardia is the hallmark. Tachycardia would be expected in reflexes like Bainbridge reflex (atrial stretch-induced).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nAlpha waves\r\n\r\nAlpha waves are brain waves seen on an EEG in a normal awake person who is relaxed with eyes closed. They typically have a frequency of 8–13 Hz and are most prominent in the occipital cortex.\r\n\r\nWhen a person opens their eyes, becomes alert, or starts engaging with the environment, alpha wave activity diminishes. This phenomenon is known as “alpha block” or desynchronization.\r\n\r\nThe EEG shifts toward beta wave activity (higher frequency, lower amplitude) associated with alertness and active thought.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA. Beta waves \r\nBeta waves (13–30 Hz) are associated with active mental concentration and alertness. These waves increase, not decrease, when eyes are opened or during mental activity.\r\n\r\nB. Theta waves \r\nTheta waves (4–7 Hz) are seen during drowsiness, light sleep (NREM 1 stage), or in children. Not typically prominent in a normal relaxed adult at rest with eyes closed.\r\n\r\nD. Delta waves \r\nDelta waves (0.5–4 Hz) are associated with deep sleep (NREM 3/4). These are not affected by eye opening in the awake state because they are not normally present.",

The best candidates include:\r\n\r\n1. Ototoxicity – Certain drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) can damage cochlear hair cells, causing bilateral SNHL. These patients often benefit from cochlear implants.\r\n\r\n2. Congenital hearing loss – Children born with bilateral profound SNHL are excellent candidates, especially when implanted early (before age 2) for optimal speech and language development.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n3. Ossicular fixation – This is a conductive hearing loss, often due to otosclerosis or chronic otitis media, and is best treated with surgical correction (e.g., stapedectomy) or hearing aids, not cochlear implants.\r\n\r\n4. Otosclerosis – Early stages affect the stapes (conductive loss); later stages (cochlear otosclerosis) may involve SNHL, but cochlear implantation is rarely the first line and reserved for severe cochlear involvement, which is uncommon.\r\n",

Meniere disease – Causes episodic vertigo, but usually with hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sense of ear fullness, which are absent here.\r\n\r\nc. Vestibular neuritis – Presents with acute, prolonged vertigo lasting days, often following a viral illness, and not typically triggered by position changes.\r\n\r\nd.

NPC can occur in both sexes and is more common in adults, though juvenile cases do occur, particularly in endemic regions (e.g., Southeast Asia). Hence, saying it is \"only seen in young boys\" is factually incorrect.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options \r\na. Unilateral cervical lymph nodes – This is a common presentation. NPC often presents with painless cervical lymphadenopathy, frequently unilateral, especially in early stages.\r\n\r\nb. Epistaxis – Nasal bleeding is a typical symptom of nasopharyngeal carcinoma due to tumor erosion of mucosal vessels.\r\n\r\nd. Biopsy – Definitive diagnosis of NPC is made via nasopharyngeal biopsy, making this a necessary and standard diagnostic step.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) \r\n\r\nBezold abscess\r\n\r\nBezold abscess is a deep neck abscess that arises as a complication of mastoiditis (which itself follows an ear infection). It occurs when pus from mastoid air cells erodes through the medial aspect of the mastoid tip into the sternocleidomastoid muscle, leading to:\r\n• Neck rigidity\r\n• Trismus (lockjaw) due to irritation/inflammation of adjacent muscles\r\n• Fever and systemic toxicity\r\n• Neck swelling and tenderness\r\n\r\nIt typically affects children and adolescents, especially with a delayed or poorly treated otitis media.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\na. Meningitis – Can cause fever and neck rigidity, but trismus and limb spasms are not typical. Also, the link to ear infection more strongly suggests a local complication rather than a generalized CNS infection.\r\nb. Tetany – Caused by hypocalcemia, leading to muscle spasms, but does not present with fever or ear infection history. Also, lockjaw is not a defining feature of tetany.\r\nd. Sinus thrombosis – May occur post-otitis media or mastoiditis (esp. lateral sinus thrombosis), but more often presents with headache, papilledema, and neurological symptoms, not primarily trismus and neck rigidity.",

The following are common causes of stridor in infants:\r\n1. Laryngomalacia – The most common cause of stridor in infants, due to floppy supraglottic structures collapsing during inspiration. It presents as inspiratory stridor soon after birth.\r\n3. Subglottic stenosis – A narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords, which may be congenital or acquired (post-intubation). It causes biphasic stridor and respiratory distress.\r\n4. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) – Caused by HPV types 6 and 11, it results in wart-like growths in the airway, especially the larynx, and leads to progressive stridor and hoarseness.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Option:\r\n2. Congenital hemangioma/polyp – While congenital hemangioma (especially subglottic) can rarely cause stridor, polyps are extremely rare in infants and not a common cause of stridor. Hence, this option is not as consistent or reliable compared to the other three.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). In a week-old child, the lower esophageal sphincter is often immature, leading to a common phenomenon where stomach contents easily flow back into the esophagus. This results in non-bilious (not green, as bile isn't involved at this level) and non-projectile (not forceful) vomiting, often appearing as \"spitting up\" or \"wet burps.\" A normal abdominal examination is typical in these cases. While milk allergy can cause vomiting, it often presents with other symptoms like rash, diarrhea, or irritability, which are not mentioned here. Small bowel obstruction usually involves bilious vomiting and abdominal distension, making it unlikely. Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (CHPS) characteristically presents with projectile non-bilious vomiting, usually later than one week of age (typically 3-6 weeks), which contradicts the \"non-projectile\" description.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nSkin Biopsy (Correct Answer): A skin biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing a wide variety of skin conditions, especially when dealing with a plaque whose etiology is not immediately apparent. An asymptomatic plaque, by its very nature, lacks the overt symptoms (like pain, itching, or inflammation) that might point to a specific infectious or inflammatory cause. Without systemic involvement, the issue is localized to the skin. A skin biopsy allows for the microscopic examination of tissue, revealing the specific cellular and architectural changes that define different dermatological diseases. This can include conditions such as elastosis perforans serpiginosa, pseudoxanthoma elasticum (which can have skin-limited presentations despite being a systemic disorder), various forms of lichen planus, benign tumors, or other less common dermatoses. By obtaining a tissue sample, the pathologist can definitively identify the underlying pathology, leading to an accurate diagnosis and guiding appropriate treatment or reassurance.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Option:\r\n\r\nA. Chest X-ray (Incorrect Answer): A chest X-ray is a diagnostic imaging test used to visualize the structures within the chest, primarily the lungs, heart, and bones. It is indicated when there are concerns about pulmonary diseases, cardiac issues, or systemic conditions that manifest in the chest (e.g., sarcoidosis, metastatic cancer affecting the lungs). Since the patient presents with an isolated skin plaque and explicitly \"no systemic involvement,\" a chest X-ray would be an unnecessary and irrelevant investigation for the immediate diagnosis and management of the skin condition.\r\n\r\nB. HIV test (Incorrect Answer): An HIV test screens for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which can lead to various dermatological manifestations in immunocompromised individuals. While some skin conditions are more prevalent or present atypically in HIV-positive patients, an asymptomatic, isolated plaque on the neck, in the absence of any other signs of immunodeficiency, risk factors for HIV, or widespread/atypical skin lesions commonly associated with HIV, does not warrant an HIV test as the primary diagnostic step. The skin finding itself does not strongly suggest HIV as the underlying cause in this specific presentation.\r\n\r\nC. KOH mount/Tzanck (Incorrect Answer): This option combines two distinct rapid diagnostic tests:\r\nKOH mount (Potassium Hydroxide mount): This test is used to identify fungal elements (hyphae, spores) in skin, hair, or nail samples. It's typically performed when a fungal infection (like tinea corporis) is suspected, which usually presents as a scaly, itchy, erythematous, or annular plaque. An asymptomatic, non-scaly plaque is less likely to be a primary fungal infection.\r\nTzanck smear: This cytological test is used to detect viral infections, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), by identifying multinucleated giant cells and acantholytic cells. These viral infections typically cause vesicular (blister-like) or ulcerative lesions, often accompanied by pain or itching, not stable, asymptomatic plaques. Therefore, neither a KOH mount nor a Tzanck smear is appropriate for evaluating an asymptomatic, non-vesicular, non-scaly plaque.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n The correct diagnosis for this 6-week-old child's symptoms is Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The key differentiating factor is the description of \"non-projectile but forceful vomiting.\" While infantile GERD often manifests as effortless spitting up, more significant reflux can present with forceful, non-projectile emesis. The vomiting is non-bilious, which is consistent with reflux as it originates from the stomach. The child's normal abdominal examination and normal bowel movements further support GERD, as these findings rule out more severe issues like significant intestinal obstruction. GERD is a very common condition in infants due to the immaturity of the lower esophageal sphincter, and the symptoms often peak around 4-6 months of age, fitting the timeline. Incorrect Options: d) Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (CHPS): This diagnosis is unlikely because the vomiting is explicitly stated as \"non-projectile.\" The hallmark symptom of CHPS is projectile vomiting, where the stomach contents are expelled with significant force, often across the room. While CHPS typically presents at this age (3-6 weeks), and features non-bilious, forceful vomiting, the absence of projectile nature makes it an improbable primary diagnosis in this specific scenario. a) Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA): While CMPA can cause vomiting, it typically presents with other systemic symptoms beyond just vomiting. These often include irritability, skin rashes (e.g., eczema), respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheezing), and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea (which can be bloody or mucoid), constipation, or poor weight gain. The isolated finding of \"non-projectile but forceful vomiting\" without any of these additional signs makes CMPA less likely to be the primary diagnosis here. b) Intestinal obstruction: A non-bilious intestinal obstruction would indicate an issue high in the gastrointestinal tract, such as a gastric outlet obstruction or a duodenal obstruction proximal to the bile duct entry. However, a significant intestinal obstruction would typically lead to additional findings on examination, such as abdominal distension, abnormal bowel sounds, and most importantly, changes in bowel movements (e.g., obstipation or lack of stool passage if complete, or abnormal stools if partial). The \"normal abdomen examination and normal bowel movement\" in this case make a significant intestinal obstruction highly unlikely.",
