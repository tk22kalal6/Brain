When Fibrillin-1 is defective or absent, TGF-β levels rise, causing abnormal deposition of normal collagen and affecting all tissues rich in Fibrillin-1. Clinically, this can manifest as arachnodactyly (increased finger and toe length due to periosteal changes), lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) from the zonules, and vascular issues such as aortic root dilation and potential coarctation of the aorta.\r\n",

Hydrochlorothiazide is a valid option but may worsen glucose tolerance; ARBs are preferred in prediabetics. Glucocorticoids would worsen hypertension and are contraindicated. Telmisartan is an ARB, effective and metabolically neutral, making it the best choice here.\r\n\r\n",

Among NSAIDs:\r\n\r\n• Diclofenac and Ibuprofen both increase CV risk and have GI toxicity\r\n• Celecoxib, although a COX-2 inhibitor, at low to moderate doses, has comparable CV risk to traditional NSAIDs (per PRECISION trial, 2016)\r\n• It spares gastric mucosa better → hence safer in PUD\r\n\r\nDiclofenac is a non-selective NSAID with a high cardiovascular risk, especially post-MI. Tramadol is an opioid analgesic with no anti-inflammatory properties and is unsuitable for arthritis/carditis. Celecoxib is COX-2 selective, has lower GI toxicity, and is a better option in those with both PUD and CV history when NSAID is needed. Ibuprofen increases both GI and CV risk, making it less suitable than celecoxib in this scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Prevents Aspiration: The cuff seals the airway, reducing the risk of saliva, gastric contents, or secretions entering the lungs. \r\n2. Ensures Effective Positive Pressure Ventilation: In mechanically ventilated patients, the cuff prevents air from leaking around the tube, allowing full delivery of ventilatory support. \r\n3.

Unlike simple myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness), where light focuses at one point, astigmatism results in distorted or blurred vision at all distances because light rays are not focused correctly onto the retina. \r\n",

Its features include lattice degeneration, which is an area of retinal thinning, and lacquer cracks, which are breaks in Bruch's membrane. Choroidal neovascularization can develop from these changes. Foster–Fuchs spots represent remnants of prior bleeding. Chorioretinal atrophy contributes to a tigroid fundus appearance due to prominent choroidal vessels. Posterior staphyloma is a degenerative change associated with high axial myopia and is a major contributing factor. Peripapillary atrophy and tilted disc are also common, the latter resulting from oblique insertion of the optic nerve into the disc.\r\n",

Anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 promote survival by inhibiting Bax/Bak—sequestering them or binding BH3-only proteins—to prevent MOMP.<br><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/290207131.png\"></p>",

Cronkhite-Canada syndrome is a nonhereditary hamartomatous polyposis with alopecia, skin and nail changes, and occurs mainly in older adults.

Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst). \r\nMature teratomas are benign germ cell tumors formed from pluripotent cells that differentiate into mature tissues from ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. They are the most common ovarian germ cell tumor, usually slow-growing, and can arise outside the gonads (e.g., sacrococcygeal region, mediastinum). They contain fully differentiated tissues such as skin and hair (ectoderm), thyroid or respiratory/gastrointestinal epithelium (endoderm), and muscle, fat, bone, or cartilage (mesoderm). The cyst often contains greasy sebaceous material and hair, and a Rokitansky (dermoid) nodule may appear as a raised area with hair, teeth, or bone.\r\n",
