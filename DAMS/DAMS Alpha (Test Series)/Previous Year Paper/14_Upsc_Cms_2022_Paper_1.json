      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Massage Explanation: Freezing cold injury or frostbite/ trench foot or immersion injury ? Vasoconstriction, ice formation and freezing within the tissue, most commonlv afecting the hands and feet (around 90% of cases). Risk factors incude alcohol, previous frostbite, drug use, inappropriate clothing, fatigue and dehydration. Tissue injury results trom both treezing and vasoconstriction. ? Superficial frostbite involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Pain or paresthesia, and the skin appear white and waxy. After rewarming there Is cyanosis and erythema, wheal-and-flare formation, edema, and superficial blisters. Deep frostbite involves muscle, nerves, and deeper blood vessels. It may result in edema of the hand or foot, vesicles and bullac, tissue necrosis, and gangrene. ? Treatment:- Consume warm drinks, remove shoes, wet clothing and jewellery and re-dress in warm, dry cothing. Re-freezing tollowing warming is particularly destructive; therefore re-warming should only be initiated if there is no risk of further re-freezing. Rewarming by immersion of the affected part in a water bath at temperatures of 40°-44°c (004°-1u°F), IV warm fluid fluids (due to cold diuresis), strong analgesia and blister care. Massage, application of ice water, and extremne heat are contraindicated. Area should be cleansed with soap or antiseptic and sterile dressings should be applied. Analgesics (Aspirin 75-300 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg) are often required during rewarming Antibiotics are used if there is evidence of infection. Combination of thrombolvsis and vasodilators (such as nitroglycerin), given within 24 hours in hospital. iloprost, a Prostacyclin analogue reduce chance of amputation Pernio (Chilblains) ? Vasculitic disorder associated with exposure to cold; acute forms have been described. Raised erythematous lesions develop most commonly on the toes or fingers in cold weather and are associated with pruritus and a burning sensation; may blister and ulcerate. ? Pathologic examination demonstrates angitis characterized by intimal proliferation and perivascular infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. ? Treatment: - Sympatholytic drugs and dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. Avoid exposure\r\nto cold, and ulcers should be kept clean and protected with sterile dressings.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1, 3 and 4 Explanation: Cardiomegaly can be caused by chamber\r\ndilatation, especially left ventricular dilatation, or by a pericardial effusion, but may also be due to a\r\nmediastinal mass or pectus excavatum. Cardiomegaly is not a sensitive indicator of left ventricular\r\nsystolic dysfunction and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray has normal echocardiograms. Dilatation of\r\nindividual cardiac chambers can be recognised by the characteristic alterations to the cardiac\r\nsilhouette in X-ray ? Left atrial dilatation results in prominence of the left atrial appendage, appears\r\nas straight left heart border, a double cardiac shadow to the right of the sternum, and widening of the\r\nangle of the carina (bifurcation of the trachea) as the left main bronchus is pushed upwards. ? Right\r\natrial enlargement projects from the right heart border towards the right lower lung field. ? Left\r\nventricular dilatation causes prominence of the left heart border and cardiomegaly. Left ventricular\r\nhypertrophy produces rounding of the left heart border. ? Right ventricular dilatation increases heart\r\nsize, displaces the apex upwards and straightens the left heart border. ? Lateral or oblique film may\r\ndetect pericardial calcification in patients with constrictive pericarditis or a calcified thoracic aortic\r\naneurysm. which may be obscured by the spine on the PA view. ? The lung fields shows congestion\r\nand oedema in patients with heart failure, and an increase in pulmonary blood flow (pulmonary\r\nplethora') in those with left-to-right shunt. Pleural effusions may also occur in heart failure.",

Bisphosphonates –\r\nCorrect • Drugs like alendronate or risedronate are known to cause upper GI irritation. • They can\r\nlead to esophagitis, gastritis, and in some cases, peptic ulcers due to direct mucosal damage,\r\nespecially when not taken properly (e.g., without water or lying down). 4. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate\r\n– Incorrect • This is actually used in the treatment of PUD, particularly in H. pylori eradication\r\nregimens. • It has protective and antimicrobial properties and helps coat the gastric mucosa. • Not\r\nulcerogenic — in fact, it helps in ulcer healing.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 1, 2 and 3 Explanation: Prevention of transmission of Hepatitis virus\r\nHepatitis B:- For unvaccinated persons post-exposure prophylaxis with a combination of HBIG, and\r\nhepatitis B vaccine is recommended. Both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine can be given at same time\r\nbut separate site. For perinatal exposure of infants born to HbsAg-positive mothers- passive\r\nimmunisation by a single dose of HBIG, 0.5 mL, IM in the thigh immediately after birth, followed by\r\nactive immunisation with three doses of hepatitis B vaccines started within the first 12 h of life. For\r\npregnant mothers with high-level HBV DNA (>2 x 10' 1U/mL), nucleoside analogues (tenofovir) during\r\nthe third trimester of pregnancy reduces further perinatal transmission. For accidental exposure (e.g.,\r\naccidental needle stick, other mucosal penetration, or ingestion), a single IM dose of HBIG, 0.06\r\nmL/kg, as soon as possible, followed by a complete course of vaccine to given within the first week\r\nCurrently, booster does not recommended routinely, except in immunosuppressed persons who have\r\nlost detectable anti-HBs or immunocompetent persons who sustain percutaneous HbsAg-positive\r\ninoculations after losing detectable antibody. Hepatitis C:- IG is ineffective in preventing hepatitis C\r\n12\r\nand is no longer recommended for post exposure prophylaxis in cases of perinatal, needle stick, or\r\nsexual exposure. For stable, monogamous sexual partners, sexual transmission of hepatitis C is\r\nunlikely, and sexual barrier precautions are not recommended. For persons with multiple sexual\r\npartners or with STD, the risk is increased, and barrier precautions are recommended. No special\r\nprecautions are recommended for babies born to mothers with hepatitis C, and breast-feeding does\r\nnot have to be restricted. Hepatitis E: - For prevention of hepatitis E, IG derived from HEV endemic\r\npopulations does not appear to be effective. Hepatitis A: - Both passive immunization with\r\nimmunoglobulin (IG) and active immunization with killed vaccines are available. For postexposure\r\nprophylaxis of intimate contacts (household, sexual, institutional) administration of 0.02 ml/kg is\r\nrecommended as early after exposure as possible but may effective even after 2 weeks. Prophylaxis\r\nnot necessary for those who already received vaccine, for casual contacts (office, factory, school, or\r\nhospital), for most elderly persons (likely to be immune), for those known to have anti-HAV in their\r\nserum. Currently, hepatitis A vaccine (not IG) is recommended for all persons aged ?12 months for\r\npostexposure prophylaxis and for preexposure prophylaxis prior to international travel to HAVendemic\r\nareas.",

ET is the most common movement disorder; can present in childhood but dramatically\r\nincreases in after>70 years. High-frequency tremor (6-10 Hz) mainly affects the upper extremities.\r\nMost often manifest as a postural or action tremor and, in severe cases, can interfere eating and\r\ndrinking. Bilateral and symmetric but may begin on one side and remain asymmetric. Severe cases\r\nhave an intention tremor with overshoot and slowness of movement suggesting the possibility of a\r\ncerebellar origin. ? Etiology unknown. 50% have positive family history with an AD pattern of\r\ninheritance. It involves head (30%), voice (20%), tongue (20%), face/ jaw (10%), lower limbs (10%)\r\nand multiple body part (50%). ? It characteristically improved by alcohol and worsened by stress.\r\nUsually other neurologic examination is normal but subtle impairment of coordination or tandem\r\nwalking, disturbances of hearing, cognition, personality, mood, and olfaction. ? Parkinsonism can be\r\ndifferentiated from ET because the former stops at the onset of a voluntary action and is typically\r\nassociated with bradykinesia with progressive slowing of sequential movements, rigidity, gait and\r\npostural instability, and other parkinsonian features. ? T/t-Mild case- no treatment only reassurance.\r\nBeta blockers and primidone are the standard treatment. Hand tremor usually improves, while head\r\ntremor is often refractory.",

Clinical\r\nfeature:-It occurs in 30%-40% of patients with cirrhosis. Symptoms are inability to concentrate,\r\ndelirium, disorientation, drowsiness, slurring of speech and eventually coma develop. Seizures are\r\nrare. Other features are hyper-reflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Rarely causes focal\r\nneurological signs; if present, other causes must be sought. Fetor hepaticus, a sweet musty odour to\r\nthe breath, is usually present but is more a sign of liver failure and portosystemic shunting.\r\nCerebellar dysfunction, Parkinsonian syndromes, spastic paraplegia and dementia are rare.\r\nManagement-Remove precipitating causes and to suppress the production of neurotoxins by bacteria\r\nin the bowel.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nTransfusion associated GVHD can be prevented by prior irradiation of transfused blood\r\nExplanation: Some important point regarding blood components (BC), its transfusion, complications\r\nand management.\r\nABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharide chains that project from the red cell surface which\r\nattached to proteins and lipids of red cell membrane.\r\nIf RhD-positive red cells enter the circulation of an RhD-negative mother, IgG antibodies are\r\nproduced. It crosses placenta and cause hemolysis and severe neurological damage or death due to\r\nhaemolytic disease of the newborn. For prevention RhD-negative women should be given anti-D\r\nperinatally.\r\nMost frequent causes of death were transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) (32%),\r\nfollowed by TRALI (26%), hemolysis (18%), and sepsis (14%).\r\nMalaria is less severe in type O than non-O patients. Blood group O is susceptible to Helicobacter\r\npylori.\r\nRBC Ag may be the target of autoantibodies generating autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of\r\nthem, mostly IgG, are active at 37°C, called \"warm autoantibodies,\" and are most often directed\r\nagainst Rh Ag, while others, most often IgM, are active at 4°C, called \"cold autoantibodies,\" and may\r\nbe directed against ABO, I. I. P, and other Ag\r\n43 RBC group systems described, five (Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, and MNS) are routinely investigated\r\nwith transfusion compatibility of 95% Platelets stored At 20-24°C and under permanent motion for\r\n3-7 days (5 day Davidson) or At 4°C without motion: up to 14-21 days, If irradiated: <24>90% of cases. Prevention - Gamma or X-ray irradiation of cellular BC\r\nor treating BC with pathogen reduction. At-risk patients are: inherited immune deficiency, Hodgkin\r\nlymphoma, patients with aplastic anaemia receiving immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte\r\nglobulin, patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation, those taking\r\nT-lymphocyte-suppressing drugs, such as fludarabine and other purine or pyrimidine analogues, anti-\r\nCD52 Ab or antithymocyte globulin, fetuses receiving intrauterine transfusions, and recipients of BC\r\ngiven by blood relative. Granulocyte concentrates contain a large number of lymphocytes, so always\r\nbe irradiated.\r\nTACO:-Risk factors are older age, renal failure, preexisting fluid overload, cardiac dysfunction,\r\nadministration of a large volume of BCs, and an excessive rate of transfusion comparative to\r\nhemodynamic tolerance. C/F- Dyspnea, hypoxia, bilateral and predominantly alveolar infiltrates on\r\nchest x-ray, frequent systolic hypertension, and elevated brain natriuretic peptide, Fever may also\r\nexist. Prevention - identifying at-risk patients, close monitoring, a slow transfusion rate and use of\r\ndiuretics in hemodynamically stable patients. Treatment requires stopping the transfusion and\r\nadministrating oxygen and diuretics.\r\n18\r\nElectrolyte imbalance- Transfusion total blood volume over 3 h or >5-10 units of RBCCs cause citrate\r\ntoxicity, hypothermia and cardiac dysrhythmias, (due to BC at 4°C), hyperkalemia, and dilutional\r\ncoagulopathy, Citrate chelates calcium causing hypocalcemia, manifested by circumoral paresthesia,\r\nand changes in cardiac function\r\nIron overload. Each unit of RBCs contains 200-250 mg of iron, its accumulation affect endocrine,\r\nhepatic, and cardiac function. Acute hypotensive transfusion reactions defined as an abrupt drop in\r\nblood pressure of >30 mmHg carly after the start of transfusion and resolving quickly once the\r\ntransfusion is stopped, without further intervention.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 1, 3 and 4 Explanation: Some important points regarding skeletal\r\nmaturation and somatic growth The growth plate is dependent on a variety of hormonal stimuli,\r\nincluding GH, insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, paracrine and\r\ncirculating growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factor family), and cytokines. Linear bone growth\r\nrates are very high in infancy and are pituitary dependent. Mean growth velocity is around 6 cm/year\r\nin later childhood. Peak growth rates occur during midpuberty when bone age is 12 (girls) or 13\r\n(boys). In general, delayed bone age in a child with short stature is suggestive of a hormonal or\r\nsystemic disorder, whereas normal bone age in a short child is more likely to be caused by a genetic\r\ncartilage dysplasia or growth plate disorder. Caloric deprivation, malnutrition, uncontrolled diabetes,\r\nand chronic renal failure are secondary causes of abrogated GH receptor function and short stature\r\nwith normal or elevated GH and low IGF-1 levels. Psychological and social deprivation causes growth\r\nretardation, delayed speech, discordant hyperphagia, and an attenuated response to GH\r\nadministration. A nurturing environment restores growth rates. Diagnosis- Short stature should be\r\nevaluated if a patient's height is below >3 SD or decelerated growth rate. Skeletal maturation is best\r\nevaluated by radiologic bone age, based on the degree of wrist bone growth plate fusion. Final height\r\npredicted by using standardized scales (Bayley-Pinneau or Tanner-Whitehouse) or estimated by\r\nadding 6.5 cm (boys) or subtracting 6.5 cm (girls) from the midparental height. Lab Investigation:-\r\nSince GH secretion is pulsatile, GH deficiency is assessed by the response to provocative stimuli, i.e.\r\nexercise, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and other pharmacologic tests that normally increase GH to\r\n>7 μg/L in children. Random GH measurements do not distinguish normal children from GH\r\ndeficiency. Treatment:- Replacement therapy with recombinant GH (0.02-0.05 mg/kg per day SC)\r\nrestores growth velocity around 10 cm/year. GH treatment is moderately effective in Turner\r\nsyndrome and chronic renal failure. GH treatment for psychosocial or constitutional (idiopathic) short\r\nstature is not recommended. In GH insensitivity and growth retardation due to mutations of the GH\r\n21\r\nreceptor, treatment with IGF-1 bypasses the dysfunctional GH receptor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) 20-25% Explanation: Some important point regarding sleep pattern:- ?\r\nThe stages of human sleep are defined on the basis of characteristic patterns in the EEG,\r\nelectrooculogram (EOG) and EMG measured on the chin, neck, and legs. Continuous recording all\r\nthree called polysomnography. ? NREM sleep is subdivided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3,\r\ncharacterized by an increasing threshold for arousal and slowing of the cortical EEG. NREM stages N1\r\nand N2 constitute 50-60% while N3 sleep (slow-wave sleep) predominates in the first third of the\r\nnight and comprise 15-25% total sleep time in young adults. Age has a profound impact on sleep. N3\r\nsleep is most prominent in childhood, decreasing in puberty and 2nd and 3 decades and may be\r\nabsent in older. ? REM sleep is characterized by low-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG, similar to\r\nNREM stage N1, and an EOG pattern of REMS. EMG activity is absent in nearly all skeletal muscles\r\nexcept those involved in respiration, characteristic of REM sleep. REM sleep constitutes 20-25% of\r\ntotal sleep in adult, while 50% in infancy. ? The first REM sleep episode usually occurs in the 24 hour\r\nof sleep. NREM and REM sleep alternate with an average period of 90-110 min (ultradian sleep cycle).\r\nAfter sleep deprivation, NREM sleep recovers first, followed by REM sleep. Prolactin secretion is\r\npulsatile, with the highest secretory peaks occurring during NREM sleep. Nocturnal erections occur\r\nduring REM ? Inadequate sleep is associated with glucose intolerance that may lead to diabetes,\r\nobesity, and metabolic syndrome, impaired immune responses, accelerated atherosclerosis,\r\nincreased risk of cardiac disease, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.",

And option \"c\" and \"d\" both are correct but I will like to go with option \"d\" which\r\nseems to be more correct. Now it's upon you to select correct answer. Aldosterone secreted by the\r\nzona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex enhances sodium reabsorption (and potassium excretion) by\r\nthe collecting tubule and favor edema formation. ? Angiotensin II has generalized vasoconstrictor\r\nproperties, particularly on the renal efferent arterioles. It enhances salt and water reabsorption in the\r\nproximal tubule as well as in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. All that enters the systemic\r\ncirculation stimulates the production of aldosterone. Blockade of the action of aldosterone by\r\nspironolactone or eplerenone (aldosterone antagonists) or by amiloride (a blocker of epithelial\r\nsodium channels) often induces a moderate diuresis in edematous states. ? Secretion of arginine\r\nvasopressin (AVP) by the posterior pituitary gland occurs in response to increased intracellular\r\nosmolar concentration; and increases the reabsorption of free water in the distal tubules and\r\ncollecting ducts.",

Filtration pressure in glomerulus is normally maintained at a constant level even in\r\nvariations in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, by alterations in muscle tone within the\r\nafferent and efferent arterioles and mesangial cells; known as autoregulation. Due to decrease\r\nperfusion pressure, local production of prostaglandins increases that cause vasodilatation of the\r\nafferent arteriole increasing the intraglomerular pressure. Apart of it renin (cleaves angiotensinogen\r\nangiotensin I, which is cleaved by ACE to angiotensin II) is released by smooth muscle cells in the\r\njuxtaglomerular apparatus in response to reduced perfusion pressure, stimulation of sympathetic\r\nnerves or low sodium of fluid in the distal convoluted tubule at the macula densa. Angiotensin II\r\nrestores glomerular perfusion pressure causing vasoconstriction of the efferent arterioles to raise\r\nintraglomerular pressure selectively, and inducing systemic vasoconstriction to increase blood\r\npressure and thus renal perfusion pressure.",

Sickle-cell disease results from a single substitution\r\nof glutamic acid to valine at position 6 of the beta globin polypeptide chain; AR inheritance.\r\nHomozygotes only produce abnormal beta chains (HbS, termed SS), and this results in the clinical\r\nsyndrome of sickle-cell disease. Heterozygotes (HbA and HbS) results in sickle-cell trait and it may be\r\nassociated with an increased risk of sudden and cardiovascular death in young adults. ? Common in\r\nAfrican American populations; Sickle-cell trait are relatively resistant to the effects of falciparum\r\nmalaria in early childhood ? Clinical features: Background retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy,\r\nvitreous bleeds, sickle chest syndrome, infection, pulmonary hypertension, osteomyelitis, hepatic\r\nsequestration, cholelithiasis, enuresis, haematuria, papillary necrosis, chronic renal failure, dactylitis,\r\narthropathy, subarachnoid bleed, fits, cerebrovascular event, sickle myocardium, cardiomegaly,\r\ntransfusional iron overload, splenic infarction, vertebral collapse, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis,\r\npriapism, leg ulceration, ?

Vitamin D deficiency ? impaired intestinal absorption of calcium\r\ndecreased serum total and ionized calcium values ? hypocalcemia ? secondary hyperparathyroidism,\r\n? PTH-induced increase in bone turnover (phosphaturia, hypophosphatemia) ? ?alkaline phosphatase.\r\n1, 25(OH)2D level are not accurate reflections of vitamin D stores and not used to diagnose vitamin D\r\ndeficiency in patients with normal renal function. Recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 IU\r\nfrom 1 to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for those >70. Safety margin for vitamin D is large, and vitamin\r\nD toxicity observed only when taken 40,000 IU daily. Vitamin D should always be repleted in\r\nconjunction with calcium supplementation. The hepatic enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a\r\nstrong inducer of the catabolism of vitamin D metabolites. Phenytoin and rifampicin, lead to strong\r\ninduction and need higher dose. Level of calcium becomes normal within 1 week of therapy, while\r\nincreases in PTH and ALP may persist for 3-6 months. Most efficacious methods to monitor treatment\r\nand resolution of vitamin D deficiency are measurement of serum and urinary calcium. Those taking\r\nvitamin D and calcium the 24-h urinary calcium excretion should be 100-250 mg/24 h. Levels >250\r\nmg/24 h may lead to nephrolithiasis",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) 1, 2 and 3 Explanation: Acne vulgaris:- ? Chronic inflammation of the\r\npilosebaceous units, extremely common, generally starts during puberty and has been estimated to\r\naffect over 90% of adolescents (12-20 year); severe in later adolescence, can persist into the thirties\r\nand forties, especially in females. Increased sebum production; colonisation of pilosebaceous ducts\r\nby Propionibacterium acnes and occlusion of gland ? Both androgens and progestogens increase\r\nsebum excretion and oestrogens reduce; may have positive family history ? Usually affects the face\r\n(earliest in forhead) and often the trunk; hallmark is open comedones (blackheads) are dilated\r\nkeratin filled follicles, which appear as black papules due to the keratin debris and closed comedones\r\n(whiteheads) usually have no visible follicular opening and are caused by accumulation of sebum and\r\nkeratin deeper in the pilosebaceous ducts. Scarring may follow Acne conglobata: characterised by\r\ncomedones, nodules, abscesses, sinuses and cysts, usually with marked scarring. Rare, usually\r\naffecting adult males and MC on trunk and upper limbs; may associated with hidradenitis\r\nsuppurativa. Acne fulminans: Rare but severe; associated with fever, arthralgias and systemic\r\ninflammation, with raised neutrophil count and plasma viscosity. usually found on the trunk in\r\nadolescent males. Costochondritis can occur. Acne excoriée: self-inflicted excoriations due to\r\ncompulsive picking of pre-existing or imagined acne lesions. It usually affects adolescent girls, and\r\nunderlying psychological problems are common. Treatment: ? Mild to moderate disease:- Topical\r\ntherapy- Benzoyl peroxide or retinoids, azelaic acid. For inflammatory acne- antibiotics (erythromycin\r\nor clindamycin), in moderated disease- systemic tetracycline, lymecycline if fails than erythromycin\r\nor trimethoprim. In women oestrogen- containing OCP can be a useful adjunct, estrogen + antiandrogen\r\n(Cyproterone acetate) is also option. ? Isotretinoin has revolutionised the treatment of\r\nmoderate to severe acne. Combination with systemic glucocorticoid may be required in the short\r\nterm to reduce flare early in the treatment. Depression and suicide have been reported in association\r\nwith isotretinoin. Intralesional triamcinolone may be sued. CO, laser, microdermabrasion, chemical\r\npeeling or localised excision done for scarring. UV B phototherapy or PDT can occasionally be used\r\nAcne Rosacea ? Chronic inflammatory condition affects the central face and consists of flushing,\r\nerythema, papules, pustules and telangiectasiae. Cause unknown; normal sebum excretion, no\r\ncomedones. Most commonly affects fair-skinned female but severe in male. Seen almost exclusively\r\nin adults, only rarely affecting patients &lt;30 years. It can be exacerbated by heat, sunlight and\r\nalcohol emotional stimuli, hot drinks, or spicy foods. Very long standing may lead to connective tissue\r\novergrowth, particularly of the nose (rhinophyma) ? Mild disease may respond to topical\r\nantimicrobials, such as metronidazole or azelaic acid. Topical ivermectin may be beneficial in some\r\ncases. Tetracycline or erythromycin.",

Vascular access for haemodialysis done by\r\nformation of an AV fistula, usually in the forearm (75%) [Side-to-side-anastomoses of radial artery\r\nwith cephalic vein at the wrist Le. Cimino fistula], up to a year before dialysis is contemplated. After\r\n4-6 weeks, pressure transmitted from the artery to the vein leading from the fistula causes distension\r\nand thickening of the vessel wall (arterialisation). If creation of an AVF is not possible, synthetic\r\npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts may be done between an artery and a vein. ? Patients must be\r\nscreened for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, and vaccinated against hepatitis B if they are not\r\nimmune. Patients with hepatitis C and HIV are less infectious and can be treated satisfactorily using\r\nmachine segregation and standard infection control measures. Haemodialysis is usually done for 3-5\r\nhours three times weekly. ?

Preterm neonates\r\nlose 2-3% birth wt/d with cumulative loss 10-15% in first week. Failure of wt loss in first week is\r\nindicative of excessive fluid administration. Excessive (>3%) loss/day in 5-7 days is non physiological.\r\nRobust sucking pattern is not present until 32- 34 weeks gestation. Coordination between sucking,\r\nswallowing and breathing does not mature till 34 weeks and fully matures by 37 to 38 weeks of\r\ngestation. Expressed breast milk should start within hour so that infant gets colostrum. Expressed\r\n43\r\nmilk can be stored for about 6 hours at room temperature and for 24 hours in domestic refrigerator\r\n(2° to 8°C). Enteral feeding is important for sick neonates.

Applied to children up to 30 months. Ages and stages questionnaire (ASQ-3): It\r\nconsists of age- based, parent-completed questionnaires. Used from one month to 5 years of age. It\r\nassesses communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social. Denver II or\r\nrevised DDST assesses gross motor, fine motor adaptive, language and personal-social behaviour.\r\nTrivandrum development screening chart: consists of 51 items for children of 0-6 years. Clinical\r\nadaptive test and clinical linguistic and auditory milestone scale (CAT/CLAMS): used to assess the\r\nchild's cognitive and language skills and uses parental report and direct testing of the child's skills.\r\nUsed at ages of 0-36 months. Goodenough-Harris drawing test: Simple nonverbal intelligence test\r\nrequires only a pencil or pen and white unlined paper. Bayley scale for infant development II is\r\ndefinitive test not screening used for 1 months to 3.5 years. Other definitive test are Wechsler\r\nintelligence scale for children IV (age 6 to 17 years), Stanford-Binet intelligence scales, 5th edition\r\n(age 2 to 85 years), Vineland adaptive behavior scale II (age 0 to 89 years)",

Some important point regarding chloroquine toxicity:\r\nChloroquine is well absorbed orally has a large volume of distribution; accumulates especially\r\nin heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, lung and spleen, and is strongly bound in melanin-containing\r\ncells (eye and skin). Renal excretion enhanced by acidification of the urine.\r\nC/F :- Malaise, anorexia, pruritus, urticaria, haemolytic anaemia, methaemoglobinaemia,\r\nretinopathy, psychosis, seizures, convulsions, vertigo, headache. Sudden apnoea can occur.\r\nCVS manifestations comprise hypotension, atrioventricular conduction defects, and cardiac\r\narrhythmias. Hypokalemia is often present. Effects of chloroquine retinopathy rare pigmentary\r\nstippling, mottling, a \"bull's eye\" pattern of macular hyperpigmentation, attenuation of the\r\nretinal arteries, pale optic discs, disturbance of colour vision, loss of central vision scotoma and\r\nvisual field defects.\r\nFeatures of methemoglobinemia may be asymptomatic or lethargy, stupor, seizure. Acute\r\nmethemoglobinemia is life threatening when MetHb >50% of total circulatory haemoglobin.\r\nABG reveals normal PaO, and low SpO, Filter paper test shows blood is chocolate coloured not\r\nchanging after exposure to oxygen. Treatment is methylene blue. Patients with G6PD\r\ndeficiency should not receive methylene blue. Other t/t are ascorbic acid, hyperbaric oxygen\r\nand exchange transfusion.\r\nIndications of severe toxicity: (i) systolic BP < 90>110 ms, (ii)\r\nhypokalaemia (K+&lt;3.0 mEq).\r\nCardiovascular effects include hypotension, vasodilation, ECG abnormalities (prolonged PR,\r\nQRS, and QT interval), ventricular arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse.\r\nFatal dose: As little as 2.25 to 3 grams in an adult. About 2 to 3 times the therapeutic dose\r\nmay be fatal in children.",
