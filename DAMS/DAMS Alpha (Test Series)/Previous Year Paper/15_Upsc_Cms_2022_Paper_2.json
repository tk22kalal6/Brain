      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) May be caused by fungi or bacteria Explanation: Some important point\r\nregarding mycetoma- ? Chronic, specific, granulomatous, progressive, destructive inflammatory\r\ndisease, which involves the skin, subcutaneous tissues and underlying deeper structures. ? Causative\r\norganism may be true fungi (eumycetoma) or bacteria (actinomycetoma). Mycetoma belt lies\r\nbetween the latitudes 15° south and 30° north, comprising the countries of Sudan, Somalia, Senegal,\r\nIndia, Yemen, Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, Argentina and a few others. ? Route of infectioninoculation\r\nof the organism that is resident in the soil through a traumatised area. ? Pathognomonic\r\nfeature - Triad of painless subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and seropurulent discharge. During\r\nthe active phase of the disease the sinuses discharge grains, the colour of which can be black,\r\nyellow, white or red depending upon the organism. Pain supervenes when there is secondary\r\nbacterial infection. It may cause tissue destruction, deformity, disability, and death in extreme cases.\r\n? Common sites are those that come in contact with soil (foot 70%, hand 12%, others are knee, arm,\r\nleg, head and neck, thigh and perineum while rare sites are the chest, abdominal wall, facial bones,\r\nmandible, testes, paranasal sinuses and eye). There may be areas of local hyperhidrosis due to\r\nsympathetic overactivity or increased local temperature due to raised arterial blood flow caused by\r\nthe chronic inflammation. Regional lymph nodes are small and shotty. Lymphadenopathy is common\r\ndue to secondary bacterial infection, lymphatic spread of mycetoma or a local immune response to\r\nthe disease. Spread via the blood stream can occur. Therefore surgery in mycetoma under local\r\nanaesthesia is contraindicated. ? Local spread occurs predominantly along tissue planes. Lymphatic\r\nspread, more common in actinomycetoma. ? It is not contagious. Granuloma increases in size, and\r\nthe overlying skin becomes stretched, smooth, shiny and attached to the lesion. In eumycetoma, it is\r\nusually gradual and delayed while in actinomycetoma, invasion to deeper tissues occurs earlier and is\r\nmore extensive. The tendons and nerves are spared until very late in the disease and trophic\r\nchanges are rare because the blood supply is adequate. ? Plain radiograph-Periosteal reaction with\r\nnew bone spicules may create a sun-ray appearance and Codman's triangle, not unlike an osteogenic\r\nsarcoma. USG can differentiate between eumycetoma and actinomycetoma as well as between\r\n2\r\nmycetoma and other conditions which is useful for surgery, MRI-The 'dot-in-circle sign, which\r\nindicates the presence of grains, is highly characteristic. Biopsy and FNAC are confirmatory and helps\r\nin distinguishing between eumycetoma and actinomycetoma. Deep surgical biopsy is always needed\r\nfor culture. ? Management:- Actinomycetoma - combined drug therapy with amikacin sulphate and\r\nco-trimoxazole in the form of cycles is the treatment of choice. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,\r\nrifampacin, sulphonamides, gentamicin and kanamycin are used as a second line of treatment.\r\nEumycetoma- ketoconazole, intraconazole and voriconazole are the drugs of choice. They may need\r\nto be used for up to a year. Surgery is indicated for small localised lesions, resistance to medical\r\ntreatment. The surgical options are wide local and debulking excisions and amputations. The\r\namputation rate is 10-25%. The recurrence rate 25 to 50%.",

Investigation -USG. The same\r\ntreatment applies to parotid stones as to submandibular duct stones. Small stones (-4 mm) retrieved\r\nby baskets, up to 8 mm can be broken with lithotripsy and > 8 mm diameter removed by endoscopic\r\nassisted surgery and preserving the gland. Parotid duct strictures - Strictures are common in the\r\nparotid gland and are responsible for 20% of obstruction. Strictures respond to dilatation and\r\nendoscopic washouts with steroid solutions. Papillary obstruction- Obstructive parotitis, can be\r\ncaused by trauma to the parotid papilla. The partial obstruction over a protracted period leads to\r\ndilation of the duct and an entity called 'mega-duct.

Previously known as leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. Mesenchymal origin. M: F=1:1.\r\nAssociated with a mutation in the tyrosine kinase c-kit oncogene and sensitive to the tyrosine kinase\r\nantagonist imatinib. Tumours with mutations in exon 11 of c-kit are particularly sensitive to this drug.\r\nTumor size and mitotic index are the best predictors of metastasis. Peritoneal and liver metastases\r\nare most common but lymph nodes are extremely rare. Because the mucosa overlying the tumour is\r\nnormal, endoscopic biopsy can be uninformative unless the tumour has ulcerated. Targeted biopsy by\r\nendoscopic ultrasound is more helpful. Tumours > 5 cm in diameter have metastatic potential. If\r\neasily resectable, surgery is the primary mode of treatment. Small tumours-wedge excision, larger\r\ntumours-a gastrectomy or duodenectomy but lymphadenectomy is not required. The prognosis of\r\nadvanced metastatic GISTs has been dramatically improved with imatinib chemotherapy but\r\nresection of metastases, especially from the liver, still has an important role.",

The main forms of peritoneal metastases are: (1)\r\ndiscrete nodules (most common) variety; (ii) plaques varying in size and colour; and diffuse\r\nadhesions (late stage ), late stage gives rise to a 'frozen pelvis. Gravity determines the distribution of\r\nmalignant cells within the peritoneal cavity. Pseudomyxoma peritonei:- Rare condition, common in\r\nwomen. The abdomen is filled with a yellow jelly, large quantities of which are often encysted. Most\r\ncases arise from a primary appendiceal tumour with secondary implantation on to one or both\r\novaries. C/F- Painless abdominal distension and usually no impairment of general health. Does not\r\ngive rise to extraperitoneal metastases but causes symptoms and complications are due to tumour\r\nbulk. Diagnosis- USG, CT scanning and laparotomy. T/t-Masses of jelly are scooped out.

Stoppa, repair is open totally extraperitoneal\r\nmesh repair. Desarda operation where a 1- to 2-cm strip of external oblique aponeurosis lying over\r\nthe inguinal canal is isolated from the main muscle then sutured to the conjoint tendon and inguinal\r\nligament, reinforcing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. As the abdominal muscles contract, this\r\nstrip of aponeurosis tightens to add further physiological support to the posterior wall. Open suture\r\nrepair technique is not a tension free repair. Hernia system is a two-layered mesh in which inner layer\r\nis placed deep to transversalis fascia and the outer layer superficial to it.",

Small purple nodule measuring a few mm in size, which is painful in response to\r\ninsignificant stimuli, including cold exposure; patients sometimes labeled as malingering. Subungual\r\nvarieties may be invisible causes of paroxysmal digital pain. Treatment is excision. Repair nail bed if\r\nsubungual. MRI may occasionally detect tumour Glomus jugulare (Glomus tumour):- Middle ear\r\ntumours are rare with the most common being a glomus tumour. It arise from nonchromaffin\r\nparaganglionic tissue. Carotid body tumour arising in the neck is an example of this type of tumour.\r\nIn the temporal bone, three types of glomus tumour are recognised and classification depends on the\r\nlocation: glomus tympanicum (arising in the middle ear), glomus jugularae (arising next to the jugular\r\nbulb) and glomus vagale (skull base). Symptoms are pulsatile synchronous tinnitus, conductive and\r\nsensorineural hearing loss, and lower cranial nerve palsies. Palsies of CNS VII, IX, X. XI and/or XII may\r\noccur. The classical sign is a cherry-red mass lying behind the tympanic membrane. TOC is\r\npreoperative embolisation followed by surgical excision. Radiotherapy is also effective.",

Collection of blood\r\nanywhere in the area between the pelvic peritoneum and the perineal skin is called pelvic hematoma.\r\nCommonest type is the vulval hematoma. ? Etiology: Improper hemostasis during repair of vaginal or\r\nperineal tears or episiotomy wound, failure to take precaution during suturing the apex, failure to\r\nobliterate the dead space, rupture of paravaginal venous plexus ? C/f-Persistent, severe pain on the\r\nperineal region. rectal tenesmus or bearing down efforts, retention of urine, shock, tense, tender\r\nswelling at the vulva which becomes dusky and purple ? T/t-small hematoma (&lt;5 cm) treated\r\nconservatively. Larger hematomas should be explored under general anesthesia. Simultaneous clots\r\nare removed and bleeding secured, antibiotic, Foley catheterisation Rupture of uterus:- features\r\nDuring Pregnancy: ? Scar rupture: dull abdominal pain over the scar area with slight vaginal bleeding,\r\ntenderness on uterine palpation; FHS irregular or absent. Sense of something giving way\r\naccompanied by acute abdominal pain and collapse. ? Spontaneous rupture: high parous women.\r\nOnset is usually acute but sometimes insidious. Acute types- acute pain abdomen with fainting\r\nattacks, shock, acute tenderness on abdominal examination, palpation of superficial fetal parts, if the\r\nrupture is complete and absence of fetal heart rate change of uterine contour. In insidious onsetdiagnosis\r\nis often confused with concealed accidental hemorrhage or rectus sheath hematoma. ?\r\nLower segment scar rupture during labour- insidious onset. Confirmation is by laparotomy. ? Rupture\r\nfollowing manipulative or instrumental delivery: Sudden deterioration, vaginal bleeding following\r\nmanipulative or instrumental delivery. Exploration of uterus to feel the rent confirms the diagnosis.\r\nShortening of the cord immediately following a difficult vaginal delivery is pathognomonic. Cervical\r\ntear ? Commonest cause of traumatic postpartum hemorrhage. Left lateral tear is commonest. ?\r\nAttempted forceps delivery or breech extraction in incompletely dilated cervix, rigid cervix,\r\npreviously operated, precipitate labor or extremely vascular cervix as in placenta ? Diagnosis -\r\nexcessive vaginal bleeding immediately following delivery in hard and contracted uterus. Exploration\r\nconfirms the diagnosis but also helps to know the extent of the tear. ? Complication - Early-severe\r\nPPH, broad ligament hematoma. pelvic cellulitis, thrombophlebitis. Late - ectropion, cervical\r\nincompetence with midtrimester abortion. ?

The WHO \"End TB strategy\". adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2014.\r\nThe DOTS strategy (1994) helped revitalize national tuberculosis programmes and equivalent entities\r\nby putting in place the essential basics to address the TB epidemic. The \"Stop TB strategy\" (2006)\r\nbroadened the response by addressing the emerging challenges of HIV associated TB and MDR-TB\r\netc. It improves access to quality TB care by engaging all public and private care providers, civil\r\nsociety organizations and communities. The End TB Strategy (2015) encompasses a package of\r\ninterventions that can be fully adopted at country level. The strategy envisions universal access to\r\nhigh-quality TB care and goes beyond it to promote TB prevention. The End TB Strategy identifies\r\nfour barriers in the fight against TB. These are (a) weak health system. (b) underlying determinants\r\nof TB such as poverty, undernutrition, migration and ageing population and risk factors such as\r\ndiabetes, silicosis and smoking etc, (3) lack of effective tools, and (4) continuous unmet- funding\r\nneeds.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Euthenics Explanation: Euthenics: - Mere improvement of the genotype\r\nis of no use unless the improved genotype is given access to a suitable environment, an environment\r\nwhich will enable the genes to express themselves readily. Man has been adapting environment to\r\nhis genes more than adapting his genes to the environment. Exposure to environmental stimulation\r\nimproved their IQ in mild retarded children. The solution of improving the human race does not lie in\r\ncontrasting heredity and environment, but rather in the mutual interaction of heredity and\r\nenvironmental factors. This environmental manipulation is called euthenics. Eugenics: - Science\r\nwhich aims to improve the genetic endowment of human population (Galton). Negative eugenics:\r\nHitler sought to improve the German race by killing the weak and defective which is not acceptable in\r\ncivil society; this was negative eugenics. If people who are suffering from serious hereditary diseases\r\nmay sterilized or debarred from producing children to reduce disease. The aim of negative eugenics\r\nis to reduce the frequency of hereditary disease. In spite of eugenic sterilization, new cases of\r\nhereditary diseases will continue to arise in the population because of fresh mutations, and hidden\r\ncarriers (heterozygotes) of recessive defects Positive eugenics: More ambitious programme than\r\n47\r\nnegative eugenics. It seeks to improve the genetic composition of the population by encouraging the\r\ncarriers of desirable genotypes to assume the burden of parenthood. At present, it has very little\r\napplication. Acculturation: Acculturation means \"culture contact\" When there is contact between two\r\npeople with different types of culture, there is diffusion of culture both ways. These are: Trade and\r\ncommerce, industrialization, propagation of religion, education (introduction of scientific medicine);\r\nand conquest. It has both good and bad aspects The British brought their culture in India through\r\nconquest.",

When the material used for filling is\r\ncompletely consolidated a platform and drainage may be constructed. Masonry well improvement\r\nconsists of making the upper 10 feet or more of the lining water-tight, raising the lining one foot\r\nabove the ground, and providing a reinforced concrete slab cover at the top. Sanitary well: one which\r\nis properly located, well constructed and protected against contamination with a view to yield a\r\nsupply of safe water. Point to be taken into consideration during making well:- Location: well should\r\nbe located not less than 15 m (50 feet) from likely sources of contamination. Should located at a\r\nhigher elevation with respect to a possible source of contamination. Distance should be less than 100\r\nm (100 yards) Lining should be built of bricks or stones set in cement up to a depth of at least 6 m\r\n(20 feet) so that water enters from the bottom. Lining should be carried 60-90 cm (2-3 feet) above\r\nthe ground level and a parapet wall up to a height of at least 70-75 cm (28 inches) above the ground.\r\nCement- concrete platform round the well extending at least 1 m (3 feet) in all directions and pucca\r\ndrain. Top of the well should be closed by a cement concrete cover and equipped with a hand-pump\r\nfor lifting the water in a sanitary manner. Tube well: Yield water which is bacteriologically safe. A\r\nwater-tight concrete platform with a drain all round should be provided. Area within 15 m of the tube\r\nwell should be kept free from pollution with liquid and solid wastes. The life of the tube well varies\r\nfrom place to place depending upon the type of strainer, quality of underground water and the nature\r\nof soil. Average well may last for a period of 5 to 10 years; even upto 30 years. Chandigarh, the\r\ncapital of Punjab, derives its entire water supply from tube wells.",

Explanation: Presumptive\r\ncoliform test (i) Multiple tube method: Test is based on estimating the most probable number of\r\ncoliform organisms in 100 ml of water. Inoculation of measured quantities of the sample water done\r\nfor 48 hours into tubes of McConkey's Lactose Bile Salt Broth with bromcresol purple as an indicator\r\nand \"presumptive coliform count\", obtained. Confirmatory tests required in chlorinated water.\r\nConfirmation is done by subculturing each positive tube in 2 tubes of brilliant green bile broth, one of\r\nwhich is incubated at 37 deg C for up to 48 hours and the other incubated at 44°C and inspected\r\nafter 6 and 24 hours to decide E. coli is present or not. E. coli is only coliform organism which is\r\ncapable of producing gas from lactose at 44 deg C. if needed further confirmation done by testing for\r\nindol production at 44 °C. (ii) Membrane filtration technique: In some countries membrane filter\r\ntechnique is used as a standard procedure to test for the presence of coliform organisms through a\r\nmembrane made of cellulose ester. Bacteria present in water are retained on the surface of the\r\nmembrane and by inoculating it on suitable media at appropriate temperature, it is possible to count\r\nthe colonies and obtain results within 20 hours as compared to 72-96 hours required for the usual\r\nmultiple tube technique.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) 4 only Explanation: National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and wealth\r\nindex ? Wealth was divided into quintiles and not quartiles. Wealth was divided into five parts/ groups\r\nwith equal number of individual in each. As seen in the table also and present in the report. Five parts\r\nis quintiles (Wealth index quintiles - poorest, second, middle, fourth, richest). Four is quartiles. ? It\r\ncannot be presented in pie chart because TFR is not a proportion which would add up to 100%. ?\r\nWealth index is index of the economic status of households and is based on consumption of\r\nconsumer goods. It is an indicator of the level of wealth that is consistent with expenditure and\r\nincome measures. Wealth index Households are given scores based on the number and kinds of\r\nconsumer goods they own, ranging from a television to a bicycle or car, and housing characteristics\r\nsuch as source of drinking water, toilet facilities, and flooring materials etc. These scores are derived\r\nusing principal component analysis. Infant mortality rates are high in lowest wealth index households and lowest among the highest wealth index households ? As wealth quintile rises TFR decreases. So\r\noption \"d\" is only correct",
