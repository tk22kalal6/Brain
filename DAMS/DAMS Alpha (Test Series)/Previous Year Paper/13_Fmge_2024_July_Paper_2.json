It is characterized by weakness and muscle fatigue. Weakness increases with usage and muscle movement is difficult at the end of the day. It affects proximal muscles leading to weakness of the limbs. Ocular features like ptosis and diplopia can also be seen. Myasthenia gravis is often related to thymomas. Symptoms of myasthenia gravis improve after excision of the thymus gland even in the absence of a thymoma. \r\n",

This pattern is produced due to the intrinsic properties of the low threshold T-type calcium channels of the thalamus. These channels are activated at a much lower threshold and produce larger currents as compared to most other calcium channels in the brain. Hence, inhibition of these T-type calcium currents in the neurons of the thalamus by ethosuximide is effective for the management of absence seizures.\r\n",
