ACE inhibitors block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. During anaesthesia, there is already vasodilation and decreased sympathetic tone combining this with ACE inhibitors can cause severe hypotension that is resistant to fluids.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The humeral head is seen below and medial to the glenoid socket. This suggests anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint. In young adults, the common cause for anterior dislocation is athletic injuries, while in older adults, falls are a more common cause.\r\n",
