      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nAcetylcholine\r\n\r\nWhen blood pressure increases, it activates baroreceptors (primarily in the carotid sinus and aortic arch). These receptors send signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brainstem, which then activates the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibits the sympathetic system.\r\n\r\nThe parasympathetic response is mediated through the vagus nerve, which releases acetylcholine (ACh) at the sinoatrial (SA) node. Acetylcholine acts on muscarinic receptors in the SA node to slow down heart rate (negative chronotropy) by increasing potassium permeability and reducing the rate of depolarization. This is a homeostatic response to lower cardiac output and reduce blood pressure.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options :\r\nA) Nor-epinephrine\r\nThis is a sympathetic neurotransmitter that increases heart rate and contractility. It would be active in response to low blood pressure, not high. So, it’s not involved in the SA node response to increased BP.\r\n\r\nB) Epinephrine\r\nAlso a sympathomimetic hormone, it stimulates the SA node to increase heart rate. Like norepinephrine, it is part of the sympathetic response, not the baroreceptor-mediated response to high BP.\r\n\r\nC) Dopamine\r\nDopamine can affect heart rate and vascular tone but is not the primary neurotransmitter involved in baroreceptor-mediated modulation of the SA node. It is not directly involved in this reflex pathway.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nIn upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions, the corticospinal tract or motor neurons above the anterior horn are affected, leading to a loss of inhibitory control over lower motor neurons. This results in characteristic features such as spasticity, which is increased muscle tone that is velocity-dependent, and exaggerated or hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. These two signs—spasticity and hyperreflexia—are considered the classic hallmarks of UMN lesions. In contrast, muscle atrophy is usually minimal and occurs only from disuse, and fasciculations are absent, as they are features of lower motor neuron (LMN) lesions, where the neurons themselves or their axons are damaged. Therefore, spasticity and exaggerated reflexes are the primary clinical findings in UMN lesions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nThe effect is due to rapid correction of Na\r\n\r\nThe scenario describes a classic case of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), previously known as central pontine myelinolysis.The patient had vomiting and poor dietary intake for 4 weeks, which likely led to chronic hyponatremia.He was then treated aggressively with IV normal saline, which can rapidly raise serum sodium levels.Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia is a well-known cause of ODS, which presents with quadriplegia, mutism, rigidity, pseudobulbar palsy, or locked-in syndrome.Chronic hyponatremia leads to brain adaptation by reducing intracellular osmolytes. Rapid Na+ correction reverses this osmotic gradient too quickly, causing neuronal dehydration and demyelination, especially in the pons.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nB) The effect is due to slow correction of Na\r\nSlow correction of sodium is the recommended approach in chronic hyponatremia. It prevents ODS, not causes it.\r\n\r\nC) Dehydration\r\nWhile dehydration may have contributed to the initial hyponatremia or clinical presentation, it does not directly cause quadriplegia and mutism after saline therapy.\r\n\r\nD) Metabolic acidosis\r\nThere is no mention of acid-base disturbance here, and metabolic acidosis does not typically lead to this specific neurological presentation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nIncreased Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure\r\n\r\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is primarily determined by the net filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, which depends on:\r\n\r\nGlomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC) – pushes fluid out of capillaries\r\n\r\nBowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure (PBC) – opposes filtration\r\n\r\nGlomerular oncotic pressure (πGC) – also opposes filtration\r\n\r\nAn increase in Bowman’s capsule hydrostatic pressure (e.g., due to obstruction of the urinary tract or presence of kidney stones) opposes filtration and leads to a reduction in GFR. This is because the pressure in the capsule resists the flow of fluid from the glomerulus, reducing the net driving force for filtration.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA) Increased RBF (Renal Blood Flow):\r\nAn increase in RBF usually increases GFR (by raising hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus), not decreases it. Therefore, this would not lead to reduced GFR.\r\n\r\nB) Increased Glomerular hydrostatic pressure:\r\nThis is the main driving force for filtration. An increase in this pressure would enhance GFR, not decrease it.\r\n\r\nD) Decreased Glomerular oncotic pressure:\r\nA lower oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries would reduce the opposing force to filtration and thus increase GFR. So, it does not explain a decrease in GFR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nLoud S1\r\nLoud S1 is not a typical feature of a large pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade, which is suggested in this case by the “water bottle” heart on chest X-ray. Instead, heart sounds—including S1—are usually muffled due to the insulating effect of fluid around the heart. The presence of breathlessness, history of recent viral illness, and chest pain, along with radiologic evidence, strongly points toward pericardial effusion, potentially progressing to cardiac tamponade. Thus, option B is the incorrect (false) statement, making it the right answer to the question.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA: Pulsus paradoxus is observed\r\nThis is true. Pulsus paradoxus—an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (>10 mmHg) during inspiration—is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade. It reflects impaired ventricular filling due to increased pericardial pressure.\r\n\r\nC: Emergency pericardiocentesis may be required\r\nThis is also true. If tamponade is present (e.g., causing hypotension or signs of shock), emergency pericardiocentesis is the definitive and often life-saving intervention to relieve pressure on the heart.\r\n\r\nD: ECG showing RA and RV collapse requires immediate intervention\r\nTrue. Echocardiographic evidence (not ECG) of right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse is a hallmark of tamponade physiology, which mandates urgent pericardiocentesis. While the question says \"ECG\", this likely refers to echo findings (a common confusion), and the interpretation focuses on the required immediate intervention, which is correct.",

They are slowly adapting type I (SA1) receptors, meaning they respond to sustained pressure and edges. This property allows them to provide high spatial resolution, which is essential for static two-point discrimination—the ability to perceive two closely spaced points on the skin as separate when the stimulus is stationary. Unlike Meissner corpuscles, which respond to dynamic or moving stimuli, or Pacinian corpuscles, which detect vibration, Merkel cells are uniquely suited for detecting fine, stationary tactile details, making them the primary receptors responsible for static two-point discrimination.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nCerebral edema (Incorrect Statement)\r\nCerebral edema is not typically associated with hypokalemia, and hence it is the correct answer to the question asking for an exception. Hypokalemia primarily affects muscle, cardiac, and renal systems, but it does not cause cerebral edema. Cerebral edema is more commonly linked with hyponatremia, where a low serum sodium concentration causes water to shift into brain cells, leading to swelling. In contrast, potassium disturbances do not cause significant osmotic shifts in the brain that would result in cerebral edema.\r\n\r\nCorrect Statement\r\n\r\nA: Ventricular tachycardia \r\nHypokalemia increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, due to increased myocardial excitability. ECG changes such as U waves, flattened T waves, and prolonged QT interval may be seen, all of which predispose to arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nB: Quadriplegia \r\nSevere hypokalemia can cause profound muscle weakness, which may progress to flaccid paralysis or quadriplegia in extreme cases. This occurs because potassium is critical for maintaining the resting membrane potential of muscle cells; a deficit impairs neuromuscular transmission.\r\n\r\nC: Diabetes insipidus \r\nHypokalemia can cause a form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Low potassium impairs the renal tubule’s responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to polyuria and polydipsia, resembling diabetes insipidus. It is a recognized reversible cause of acquired nephrogenic DI.",

It is secreted by peritubular interstitial cells in the renal cortex.\r\n\r\nThe liver is a secondary site of erythropoietin production, particularly during the fetal stage of development. In fetuses, the liver is the major source of EPO, and while its role declines after birth, it continues to produce small amounts in adults.\r\n\r\nThus, both liver and kidney contribute to erythropoietin production, especially during different life stages, \r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nB) Kidney and Muscle (BC)\r\nMuscle does not produce erythropoietin, so this combination is incorrect.\r\n\r\nC) Liver, Kidney, and Muscle (ABC)\r\nMuscle is not involved in erythropoietin secretion, so including it makes this option incorrect.\r\n\r\nD) Only B (Kidney)\r\nWhile the kidney is the major source in adults, the liver also contributes, especially in fetal life.

It works by detecting urease activity, an enzyme produced by H. pylori that breaks down urea to release CO?, which is then measured in the patient’s breath.\r\n\r\nIt is highly sensitive and specific and recommended 4 or more weeks after completion of therapy to avoid false negatives due to suppression of the bacteria by PPIs or antibiotics.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA) Biopsy urease test\r\nThis is an invasive test requiring endoscopy. It is less commonly used post-treatment unless endoscopy is already indicated for other reasons. Additionally, false negatives can occur due to patchy infection or recent antibiotics/PPI use.\r\n\r\nB) Upper GI endoscopy\r\nWhile it provides direct visualization, it is not necessary for routine assessment of H. pylori eradication unless there are alarm symptoms or non-healing ulcers. It's invasive and not cost-effective for routine follow-up.\r\n\r\nD) Serology\r\nSerological tests detect antibodies, which can remain positive for months to years after successful treatment. Hence, they do not differentiate between active and past infection and are not useful for assessing treatment success.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPain abdomen\r\n\r\nIgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is an autoimmune condition that primarily affects the small blood vessels. It often presents with palpable purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and kidney involvement. Abdominal pain is a common and sometimes severe manifestation of IgA vasculitis, and it is often associated with complications like intestinal intussusception or bleeding. Steroids are indicated in cases of severe abdominal pain, especially if there are signs of complications such as intestinal ischemia or bleeding, as steroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA) Arthritis:\r\nArthritis is one of the common features of IgA vasculitis, affecting large joints (like knees and ankles). However, arthritis in this condition is usually self-limiting and can often be managed symptomatically with NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for pain relief. Steroids are generally not required for mild arthritis unless it becomes severe or refractory to other treatments.\r\n\r\nB) GI bleeds:\r\nGastrointestinal bleeding can occur in IgA vasculitis, but it is usually treated based on the severity of the bleeding. In the case of minor bleeding, supportive management and close observation may be sufficient. Steroids are generally not indicated unless there is significant, life-threatening GI bleeding, in which case other treatments like endoscopy or surgical intervention might be necessary.\r\n\r\nC) Severe rash:\r\nThe characteristic purpuric rash in IgA vasculitis is typically self-limited and resolves over time. It does not usually require steroid treatment unless it is associated with severe complications, like skin necrosis or ulcerations, which is rare. For most cases, the rash is treated symptomatically, and steroids are not routinely required unless the rash is associated with more severe systemic involvement.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nUrine calcium creatinine ratio >15\r\n\r\nNutritional rickets is primarily caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, leading to impaired calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The typical findings and pathophysiology associated with nutritional rickets include:\r\n\r\nNormal calcium (A): In early stages of nutritional rickets, calcium levels may remain within normal range due to compensatory mechanisms, such as increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. However, in advanced cases, calcium levels may drop, but it is not a constant feature of early nutritional rickets.\r\n\r\nLow phosphorus (B): A decrease in phosphorus is commonly observed in rickets due to impaired intestinal absorption of phosphorus. This results from inadequate vitamin D, which is essential for efficient phosphorus absorption in the gut.\r\n\r\nHigh PTH (D): Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase in response to low calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, a compensatory mechanism to try to increase calcium reabsorption from the bones and kidneys.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nUrine calcium creatinine ratio >15 (C): This ratio is typically seen in hypercalciuria, which is associated with other conditions like hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia, not nutritional rickets. In nutritional rickets, calcium excretion in urine can be normal or low, and there is no consistent increase in the urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio. Nutritional rickets is more likely to show a low urinary calcium due to the body’s compensatory retention of calcium.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n11 beta hydroxylase deficiency\r\n\r\nThe clinical presentation described in the question suggests a disorder related to adrenal steroidogenesis, which affects the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. Here are the key features:\r\n\r\nSMR-5: This suggests sexual maturity rating 5, indicating that the child has already reached adult stage of sexual development (likely due to premature puberty).\r\n\r\nHeight age = chronological age: This indicates normal growth in terms of age but may suggest early pubertal development, which is commonly seen in adrenal disorders.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation: This is a key feature of adrenal insufficiency. It occurs due to increased ACTH secretion, which stimulates melanocytes, causing hyperpigmentation of the skin, particularly in the creases, elbows, and knuckles.\r\n\r\nShort stature: Often seen in adrenal disorders like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to premature closure of the growth plates secondary to early puberty.\r\n\r\nHypertension (BP 150/90 mmHg): This suggests sodium retention and volume overload, both of which can occur due to mineralocorticoid excess (increased aldosterone-like effects).\r\n\r\n11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In this condition:\r\n\r\nThere is deficiency in the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, leading to the accumulation of 11-deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone (DOC).\r\n\r\nThe DOC has mineralocorticoid effects, causing hypertension due to sodium retention and fluid retention.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, androgen excess leads to premature puberty (SMR-5) and hyperpigmentation due to increased ACTH secretion in an attempt to stimulate the adrenal glands.\r\n\r\nIt can also lead to short stature due to early puberty and subsequent premature closure of growth plates.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nB) 21 alpha hydroxylase deficiency:\r\n\r\nThis is the most common form of CAH. It primarily presents with salt-wasting, virilization (masculinization in females), and hypotension (due to aldosterone deficiency), rather than the hypertension observed here.\r\n\r\nThis condition does not typically cause hyperpigmentation as seen in this case, and it is more commonly associated with hypoglycemia rather than high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nC) 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency:\r\n\r\nThis enzyme deficiency results in low cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroid production. The deficiency often leads to salt-wasting (not hypertension) and ambiguous genitalia in newborns.\r\n\r\nIt is associated with poor sexual development and lack of pubertal progression, making it inconsistent with the clinical picture of premature sexual maturity (SMR-5) seen here.\r\n\r\nD) Cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme deficiency:\r\n\r\nThis enzyme deficiency also leads to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, resulting in salt-wasting and hypotension rather than hypertension.\r\n\r\nSimilar to 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, this condition does not cause hypertension, and would present with delayed sexual development, not premature puberty.",

It presents with redness and inflammation in both eyes but without the thick, yellowish pus seen in bacterial conjunctivitis. This feature, along with the other classic signs like fever, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy, helps distinguish Kawasaki disease from bacterial eye infections. Therefore, purulent conjunctivitis is not seen in Kawasaki disease.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nB) Strawberry tongue:\r\nStrawberry tongue is a hallmark feature of Kawasaki disease. It refers to the red, swollen appearance of the tongue, which is covered with a white coating and resembles the appearance of a strawberry. This feature is very commonly seen and is one of the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease.\r\n\r\nC) Polymorphic rash:\r\nA polymorphic rash is also commonly observed in Kawasaki disease. It is multiform in appearance, meaning it can present as maculopapular, erythematous, or vesicular lesions, and typically affects the trunk and extremities. It is one of the key features that helps differentiate Kawasaki disease from other febrile illnesses in children.\r\n\r\nD) Cervical lymphadenopathy:\r\nCervical lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck) is a prominent feature of Kawasaki disease. It is commonly seen in about 50% of cases and is one of the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease. This condition is part of the inflammatory response seen in Kawasaki disease and usually presents with enlarged lymph nodes, often on one side of the neck.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nPhacolytic glaucoma (Correct Answer): Phacolytic glaucoma is a secondary open-angle glaucoma caused by the leakage of high molecular weight lens proteins from a mature or hypermature cataract through an intact (but possibly permeable) lens capsule. These proteins are then phagocytosed by macrophages, which, along with the proteins themselves, obstruct the trabecular meshwork, leading to a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The patient's presentation fits perfectly:\r\n\r\n•  80-year-old male with 2 years of diminution of vision: This strongly suggests the presence of a long-standing and likely mature/hypermature cataract, which is the prerequisite for phacolytic glaucoma.\r\n\r\n•  Red and painful right eye with IOP of 50 mmHg: This indicates acute, severe inflammation and significantly elevated pressure.\r\n\r\n•  Deep anterior chamber: This is a hallmark feature of phacolytic glaucoma. Unlike angle-closure glaucomas, the mechanism here is an open angle clogged by material, not physical closure.\r\n\r\n•  Cells and flare: This signifies an inflammatory reaction (uveitis), which is characteristic as the body responds to the leaked lens proteins and the presence of macrophages. All these findings are highly consistent with phacolytic glaucoma, where a mature cataract precipitates an acute inflammatory glaucoma.\r\n\r\nA. Malignant glaucoma (Incorrect Answer): Malignant glaucoma, also known as aqueous misdirection syndrome, is characterized by a misdirection of aqueous humor into the vitreous cavity, pushing the lens-iris diaphragm forward. The hallmark clinical sign of malignant glaucoma is a shallow or flat anterior chamber, often occurring after intraocular surgery (like glaucoma or cataract surgery), or sometimes spontaneously. The patient's presentation explicitly states a \"deep anterior chamber,\" which directly contradicts the defining feature of malignant glaucoma. Therefore, this option is highly unlikely.\r\n\r\nC. Phacomorphic glaucoma (Incorrect Answer): Phacomorphic glaucoma is a type of secondary angle-closure glaucoma caused by an intumescent (swollen) cataractous lens. The swollen lens pushes the iris forward, leading to pupillary block and mechanical closure of the anterior chamber angle. The defining characteristic of phacomorphic glaucoma is a shallow anterior chamber, which is caused by the forward displacement of the iris and lens. Since the patient in this scenario has a \"deep anterior chamber,\" phacomorphic glaucoma is inconsistent with the findings.\r\n\r\nD. Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (Incorrect Answer): Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI) is a chronic, low-grade, non-granulomatous anterior uveitis that is typically asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, characterized by minimal inflammation (\"quiet\" eye). While FHI can be associated with secondary glaucoma (due to trabecular meshwork dysfunction) and cataract formation, the typical presentation is not an acutely \"red and painful eye\" with an IOP of 50 mmHg. The severe acute inflammation and extremely high pressure seen in this patient's right eye are far more consistent with an acute inflammatory event like phacolytic glaucoma rather than the chronic, insidious nature of FHI. Other classic signs of FHI like heterochromia or stellate keratic precipitates are also not mentioned.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nVisual field defects to be associated with glaucoma if associated with optic nerve head changes (Correct Answer)\r\nThis statement is a fundamental principle in the diagnosis of glaucoma. Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive optic neuropathy, meaning damage to the optic nerve. This damage leads to specific and reproducible patterns of visual field loss. While visual field defects can arise from various conditions affecting the visual pathway (e.g., neurological disorders, retinal diseases), for a defect to be definitively attributed to glaucoma, it must correlate with characteristic structural changes observed in the optic nerve head (such as increased optic disc cupping, thinning of the neuroretinal rim, or retinal nerve fiber layer loss). This correlation between functional (visual field) and structural (optic nerve) damage is crucial for an accurate glaucoma diagnosis and distinguishes it from other conditions that might cause similar field loss patterns.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Early and specific feature is isopter contraction and baring of blind spot (Incorrect Answer)\r\nWhile both isopter contraction (generalized constriction of the peripheral visual field) and baring of the blind spot (an extension of the normal blind spot) can be observed in glaucoma, they are not typically considered the earliest or most specific features. The earliest detectable visual field defects in glaucoma are more commonly localized defects within the central 30 degrees of vision, such as paracentral scotomas (areas of decreased sensitivity near the center of vision but not involving the fovea) or nasal steps (a sharp cutoff of vision along the horizontal meridian in the nasal field). Isopter contraction often indicates more advanced damage, and baring of the blind spot can sometimes be a normal variant or related to other conditions.\r\n\r\nC. In static perimetry, intensity of stimulus is kept constant while it is moved (Incorrect Answer)\r\nThis statement incorrectly describes static perimetry. In static perimetry, the stimulus is presented at fixed locations in the visual field. For each of these fixed locations, the intensity of the stimulus is varied (usually starting from sub-threshold and increasing) until the patient perceives it. This process determines the retinal sensitivity threshold at that specific point. The description provided—keeping the intensity constant while moving the stimulus—actually describes kinetic perimetry (like Goldmann perimetry), where a stimulus of fixed intensity is moved from a non-seeing area into a seeing area to map out the boundaries of visual perception (isopters).\r\n\r\nD. Kinetic perimetry is best for monitoring field changes in glaucoma (Incorrect Answer)\r\nKinetic perimetry, while useful for mapping the full extent of the peripheral visual field and for certain types of visual loss, is generally not considered the best method for monitoring subtle or progressive changes in glaucoma. Static automated perimetry (e.g., using a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer) is preferred for glaucoma monitoring. Static perimetry offers several advantages, including greater sensitivity for detecting early, subtle defects (like paracentral scotomas which are common in glaucoma), the ability to provide quantitative threshold values, and the use of sophisticated statistical analysis software (e.g., Guided Progression Analysis) to track progression over time. These features make static perimetry more reliable for detecting the often subtle and gradual visual field changes characteristic of glaucoma progression.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nChronic malnutrition\r\n\r\nThis child’s anthropometric measurements show signs of chronic malnutrition based on the provided z-scores:\r\n\r\nWeight-for-age &lt; -3.2 SD: This indicates that the child's weight is significantly below the expected weight for their age. A z-score of less than -3 SD is considered severe underweight and typically indicates malnutrition.\r\n\r\nHeight-for-age &lt; -2.5 SD: A height-for-age z-score less than -2.5 SD indicates stunting, which is a sign of chronic malnutrition. This means that the child has not reached the expected height for their age, likely due to nutritional deficiencies over a long period or poor growth conditions.\r\n\r\nWeight-for-height &lt; -1.7 SD: This suggests the child has wasting or acute malnutrition (also known as marasmus), but not as severe as the criteria for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A z-score between -1 and -2.5 is considered moderate malnutrition.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis: Chronic malnutrition\r\n\r\nThe combination of stunting (low height-for-age) and moderate wasting (low weight-for-height), with a significantly low weight-for-age, points towards chronic malnutrition. Chronic malnutrition often reflects long-term nutritional deficiencies, typically seen in children with poor feeding practices, inadequate nutrition over an extended period, or recurrent infections.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA) Acute malnutrition:\r\n\r\nAcute malnutrition, also known as wasting, typically refers to a rapid loss of weight due to recent inadequate food intake or illness. In this case, while the child has some degree of wasting (weight-for-height &lt; -1.7 SD), the key indicator of acute malnutrition would be more severe wasting and rapid weight loss, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nB) Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM):\r\n\r\nSAM would be diagnosed if the child had severe wasting (weight-for-height &lt; -3 SD), edema, or very low weight-for-age. Here, while the weight-for-age is low, it is not sufficiently severe to qualify as SAM. The weight-for-height z-score of -1.7 indicates moderate wasting, not severe.\r\n\r\nC) Acute on chronic malnutrition:\r\n\r\nAcute on chronic malnutrition refers to a situation where a child with long-standing malnutrition experiences a recent exacerbation, such as an acute illness or other event that causes further weight loss or worsening nutritional status. While the child has some features of malnutrition, there is no indication of a recent acute event or illness, making this diagnosis less likely.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nHypokalemia with paradoxical aciduria seen in type-4 RTA\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is B, as it is incorrect in the context of type 4 renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Let's first understand why:\r\n\r\nType 4 RTA is associated with aldosterone deficiency or resistance. This leads to:\r\n\r\nHyperkalemia (not hypokalemia)\r\n\r\nMild metabolic acidosis\r\n\r\nImpaired distal acid secretion\r\n\r\nNormal anion gap metabolic acidosis\r\n\r\nSo, stating that hypokalemia and paradoxical aciduria are seen in type 4 RTA is false, making option B the correct \"EXCEPT\" answer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA) Rickets is seen in Fanconi syndrome, phosphaturia \r\n\r\nFanconi syndrome is a proximal tubule disorder where there is impaired reabsorption of various solutes including phosphate, glucose, bicarbonate, and amino acids. Loss of phosphate (phosphaturia) leads to hypophosphatemic rickets in children.\r\n\r\nC) RTA-2 has abnormal bicarbonate excretion\r\n\r\nType 2 RTA is also known as proximal RTA, where the renal tubules fail to reabsorb bicarbonate properly. This leads to excessive bicarbonate loss in the urine and metabolic acidosis. It's associated with Fanconi syndrome and can also lead to rickets in children.\r\n\r\nD) Type 4 is aldosterone deficiency\r\n\r\nType 4 RTA is caused by either hypoaldosteronism or aldosterone resistance. Aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion and sodium reabsorption. Its deficiency leads to hyperkalemia and reduced acid secretion in the distal nephron, causing mild metabolic acidosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nSelf-inflating bag\r\n\r\nA) Self-inflating bag, because free flow oxygen cannot be delivered effectively via a self-inflating bag unless a special reservoir attachment and technique are used. In routine use, a self-inflating bag requires positive pressure to open the patient valve, which only happens when the bag is squeezed. Hence, unless it's actively being squeezed, no oxygen reaches the patient, making it unsuitable for free flow oxygen delivery.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nB) Self-inflating reservoir bag\r\nWhile a self-inflating bag alone is ineffective for free flow oxygen, with a reservoir and modifications, it can deliver free flow oxygen better than a standard self-inflating bag. Still, it's not the preferred method due to inconsistency, but it is possible with adaptations.\r\n\r\nC) Face mask firmly over mouth\r\nFree flow oxygen can be delivered via a face mask placed firmly over the mouth; however, it is more ideal to cover both mouth and nose to ensure effective oxygenation in neonates and infants.\r\n\r\nD) Face mask over mouth & nose\r\nThis is one of the preferred methods for delivering free flow oxygen, especially in neonates.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n1. Fluorescein\r\nFluorescein is the first dye to be applied during a dry eye examination. This hydrophilic dye primarily stains areas of the cornea where the epithelial barrier is compromised, meaning cells are missing or damaged, allowing the dye to penetrate. It is crucial for assessing the tear film's stability through the Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT) test, where the time taken for dry spots to appear in the tear film after a blink is measured. Additionally, fluorescein is excellent for identifying corneal punctate erosions or other epithelial defects. Its placement as the initial dye is strategic because it is relatively non-irritating, thereby minimizing reflex tearing that could interfere with accurate TBUT measurement and other subsequent observations.\r\n\r\n2. Lissamine Green\r\nFollowing fluorescein, Lissamine Green is typically applied. This is a vital dye, meaning it specifically stains devitalized (damaged or dead) cells and mucus strands on the ocular surface, especially on the conjunctiva. Unlike fluorescein, Lissamine Green provides excellent visualization of conjunctival staining patterns, particularly in the interpalpebral zone (the area of the conjunctiva exposed between the eyelids), which is a key indicator of dry eye severity. The significant advantage of Lissamine Green over Rose Bengal is its minimal patient discomfort upon instillation, making it a more patient-friendly option for assessing conjunctival health.\r\n\r\n3. Rose Bengal\r\nRose Bengal is a vital dye that also stains devitalized cells and mucus on both the cornea and conjunctiva, similar in purpose to Lissamine Green. Historically, it was widely used in dry eye diagnostics. However, its use is often reserved as a third step or is sometimes foregone in favor of Lissamine Green due to its primary drawback: it can cause significant stinging and irritation upon application. This discomfort can lead to reflex tearing, which might dilute other dyes or interfere with prior measurements. Therefore, if Rose Bengal is deemed necessary for a comprehensive assessment, it is applied last to avoid confounding earlier test results.",

It involves scoring based on several clinical parameters. The parameters included in the Downe score are:\r\n\r\na) Respiratory rate: The respiratory rate is an important parameter in evaluating the severity of respiratory distress. A high respiratory rate can indicate difficulty in breathing or respiratory distress, which is a key part of the Downe score.\r\n\r\nb) Cyanosis: Cyanosis refers to a bluish color of the skin or mucous membranes due to poor oxygenation, which is another important indicator of respiratory distress. This is scored in the Downe score system.\r\n\r\nd) Grunting: Grunting is a sound made during expiration, commonly associated with respiratory distress. It indicates the infant is trying to increase functional residual capacity and keep alveoli open, which is also part of the Downe score evaluation.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nc) Feeding: While feeding difficulties can be seen in respiratory distress and are important in the clinical evaluation of a neonate, feeding is not a parameter included in the Downe score.",

This highly characteristic combination of features is a strong indicator of active or past tuberculous infection.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nOther options (A. Sarcoidosis)\r\nExplanation: Sarcoidosis is indeed characterized by granulomas, but these are typically non-caseating (meaning they lack the central cheesy necrosis seen in tuberculosis). The presence of caseous necrosis in the image description rules out sarcoidosis as the primary diagnosis.\r\n\r\nOther Options (C. Langerhans cell histiocytosis)\r\nExplanation: Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a proliferative disorder involving Langerhans cells. While it can sometimes present with granuloma-like infiltrates, it is not typically characterized by prominent caseous necrosis. Its histological features are distinct, often involving Langerhans cells with characteristic grooved nuclei and eosinophils.\r\n\r\nOther Options (D. Hodgkin lymphoma)\r\nExplanation: Hodgkin lymphoma is a hematological malignancy characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells within a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.

Prompt and effective management is essential to prevent maternal and fetal complications.\r\n\r\nClinical Features of Impending Eclampsia\r\n • Severe or persistent headache (unresponsive to analgesics).\r\n • Visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, scotomas, diplopia).\r\n • Hyperreflexia or clonus.\r\n • Persistent epigastric or right upper quadrant pain (suggestive of liver involvement).\r\n • Rising blood pressure (?160/110 mmHg).\r\n • Severe proteinuria or oliguria.\r\n • Symptoms of cerebral irritability.\r\n\r\nManagement Steps\r\n\r\n1. Immediate Stabilization\r\n • Environment:\r\n • Admit the patient to a high-dependency or labor ward with continuous monitoring.\r\n • Ensure a quiet, darkened environment to minimize sensory stimulation (which can precipitate seizures).\r\n • Monitoring:\r\n • Regular monitoring of:\r\n • Blood pressure (frequent checks or continuous monitoring).\r\n • Oxygen saturation.\r\n • Urine output (via catheterization to assess oliguria).\r\n • Reflexes and clonus (indicators of cerebral irritability).\r\n • Fetal heart rate (via cardiotocography).\r\n\r\n2. Seizure Prophylaxis\r\n • Magnesium Sulfate is the drug of choice for preventing seizures in impending eclampsia:\r\n • Loading dose:\r\n • 4g of magnesium sulfate intravenously over 10-20 minutes.\r\n • Maintenance dose:\r\n 5 g intramuscularly (IM) in each buttock every 4 hours.\r\n • Monitor for toxicity:\r\n • Check for deep tendon reflexes, respiratory rate (>12 breaths/min), and urine output (>30 mL/hour).\r\n • Antidote: Calcium gluconate (1 g IV over 10 minutes).\r\n\r\n3. Blood Pressure Control\r\n • Aim to maintain systolic BP &lt;160 mmHg and diastolic BP &lt;110 mmHg to reduce the risk of stroke and organ damage.\r\n • Antihypertensives:\r\n • Labetalol (first-line):\r\n • 20 mg IV bolus, repeated every 10–15 minutes as needed (max dose 220 mg).\r\n • Hydralazine:\r\n • 5–10 mg IV bolus over 10 minutes; repeat every 20–30 minutes as needed.\r\n • Nifedipine:\r\n • 10 mg oral immediate-release; can be repeated after 30 minutes.\r\n • Avoid excessive lowering of blood pressure to prevent reduced placental perfusion.\r\n\r\n4. Delivery Planning\r\n • Delivery is the definitive treatment for impending eclampsia but must be balanced with gestational age and maternal/fetal status.\r\n • Mode of delivery:\r\n • Vaginal delivery is preferred if the cervix is favorable and induction is feasible.\r\n • Cesarean section is indicated for maternal or fetal instability or an unfavorable cervix.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Postpartum Care\r\n • Magnesium sulfate:\r\n • Continue for 24 hours postpartum or until symptoms resolve.\r\n • Blood pressure monitoring:\r\n • Antihypertensives should be continued postpartum if hypertension persists.\r\n • Monitor for complications such as pulmonary edema, renal dysfunction, or recurrent seizures.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nWaldeyer’s ring most commonly involved\r\nThis is false. In Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldeyer’s ring (including tonsils and adenoids) is rarely involved, unlike non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where it is a common site. Hodgkin lymphoma typically affects cervical, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes, and tends to spread in a contiguous manner.\r\n\r\nIncorrect options:\r\n\r\nA. Nodular sclerosis manifests as mediastinal lymph node\r\nThis is true. Nodular sclerosis is the most common subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in young adults, and often presents with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, especially in the anterior mediastinum.\r\n\r\nB. RS cells are B cells\r\nThis is true. Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells originate from germinal center B lymphocytes, although they lose many typical B-cell markers, making them phenotypically unusual. However, gene rearrangement studies confirm their B-cell lineage.\r\n\r\nD. RS cells are positive for CD15, CD30, PAX5\r\nThis is true. Classical RS cells typically express CD15 and CD30. They also express PAX5, a B-cell transcription factor, although weakly. This immunophenotype helps differentiate Hodgkin lymphoma from other lymphoid malignancies.",

In serous otitis media (also known as otitis media with effusion), fluid accumulates in the middle ear without signs of acute infection. This fluid dampens the movement of the tympanic membrane and ossicles, resulting in decreased compliance (mobility). On impedance audiometry (tympanometry), this typically produces a Type B (flat) tympanogram, indicating fluid in the middle ear. A Type Ad tympanogram, on the other hand, reflects hypercompliance, which is seen in ossicular discontinuity or flaccid tympanic membrane—not in serous otitis media.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p>A.

Especially in children, serous otitis media is often bilateral due to the anatomical and functional immaturity of the Eustachian tubes.</p>\r\n<p>C. Most commonly seen after common cold<br>\r\nTrue. Serous otitis media frequently follows upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold, due to Eustachian tube dysfunction leading to fluid accumulation in the middle ear.</p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nThe patient's presentation is highly characteristic of Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (AIN). Here's why:\r\n\r\nHistory of Tonsillitis & Antibiotic Use: AIN is very commonly triggered by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to certain medications, with antibiotics (like penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides) being frequent culprits. The tonsillitis explains the reason for antibiotic exposure.\r\nEosinophilia: This finding (increased eosinophils in the blood) is a hallmark of allergic reactions and is a classic laboratory sign in AIN, often present in over 80% of cases.\r\n\r\nWBC Casts in Urine: White blood cell (WBC) casts indicate that inflammation is occurring within the renal tubules and interstitium, which is the primary site of damage in tubulointerstitial nephritis. The WBCs clump together within the renal tubules and are excreted as casts. This finding differentiates it from simple urinary tract infections (where WBCs are present but not necessarily casts).\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nOption (B. PSGN - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis)\r\nExplanation: While PSGN can follow a streptococcal infection like tonsillitis, its key features differ. PSGN is a glomerular disease, characterized primarily by hematuria (often dark or \"cola-colored\" urine), proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. While WBCs can be present in the urine, red blood cell (RBC) casts are the characteristic finding in PSGN, not typically prominent WBC casts. Crucially, eosinophilia is not a feature of PSGN.\r\n\r\nOption (C. Acute Pyelonephritis)\r\nExplanation: Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidney parenchyma. It typically presents with symptoms like fever, flank pain, dysuria, and systemic signs of infection. Urinalysis would indeed show pyuria (WBCs in urine) and often WBC casts. However, eosinophilia is not a characteristic feature of bacterial pyelonephritis, which helps differentiate it from AIN in this scenario.\r\n\r\nOption (D. Chronic glomerulonephritis)\r\nExplanation: Chronic glomerulonephritis refers to a group of long-term, progressive kidney diseases affecting the glomeruli, leading to gradual kidney function decline. It typically presents with persistent proteinuria, hematuria, and slowly worsening kidney function over months to years. It does not typically manifest acutely with eosinophilia and prominent WBC casts immediately following an infection and antibiotic use.",

Patients fill memory gaps with fabricated or distorted stories without the intention to lie. This occurs due to profound memory impairment.\r\n\r\nOption (B): Polyneuropathy\r\nPolyneuropathy is commonly associated with chronic alcoholism and thiamine deficiency, and it may coexist with Korsakoff psychosis. It is therefore not an excluding feature.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Amnesia\r\nSevere anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories) and retrograde amnesia (loss of past memories) are core features of Korsakoff psychosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nIntrojection\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nBeck’s Cognitive Theory of Depression is a widely accepted psychological model explaining depression through distorted thinking and negative cognitive patterns. Key elements include:\r\n\r\nA. Automatic thoughts: Spontaneous, negative thoughts that pop into a person’s mind, often about themselves, the world, or the future.\r\n\r\nC. Cognitive distortions: Systematic errors in thinking (e.g., overgeneralization, catastrophizing).\r\n\r\nD. Dysfunctional beliefs: Deeply held negative beliefs about oneself and the world, formed early in life and activated in stressful situations.\r\n\r\nB. Introjection, on the other hand, is a psychoanalytic concept (originating from Freud), referring to the unconscious adoption of the ideas or attitudes of others (e.g., internalizing the voice of a critical parent). It is not a component of Beck’s cognitive theory.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is: B. Introjection.",
