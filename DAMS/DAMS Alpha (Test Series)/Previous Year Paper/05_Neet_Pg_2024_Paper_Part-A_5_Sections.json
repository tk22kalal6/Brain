Symptoms include intellectual disability, subluxated lenses, long slender limbs, arachnodactyly, and thrombi. Its skeletal features often resemble those of Marfan syndrome. Additionally, folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiencies can also cause homocystinuria with megaloblastic anemia.",

As a muscarinic receptor antagonist, it specifically targets the urinary bladder, helping to reduce side effects compared to other antimuscarinic medications. This selectivity is particularly beneficial for patients with cognitive issues. Since tolterodine is metabolized by CYP2D6, its dosage may need adjustment based on individual CYP2D6 activity, making it a suitable choice for minimizing adverse effects while addressing urinary incontinence.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) Metabolic acidosis with partial compensated respiratory alkolosis with high anion gap The acid-base disorder here is a mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis with partially compensated respiratory alkalosis with high anion gap. It should not be confused with metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis. This can be understood by the following calculation: Step 1: The pH in this patient is 7.3 (pH &lt;7.35) which indicates acidosis Step 2: HCO3 is 6.3 mmol/L (Normal HCO3-22-30 mmol/L). In metabolic acidosis, HCO3 levels decrease. Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis. Step 3: Calculate the anion gap. Anion gap = Na+(CI+HCO3-) 135-(113.7 +6.3) = 15, which is a high anion gap (normal anion gap is between 6-12 mEq/L) Step 4: As per Winter&rsquo;s formula, the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis can be calculated using, PCO₂ =(1.5 x [HCO3]) +8 &plusmn; 2 In this case, Expected pCO2 = (1.5 x [6.3]) +8 &plusmn; 2 = 17.5 &plusmn; 2 = 15.45-19.45 mmHg The pCO2 in this patient is 16 mmHg, which implies there is an overcompensation of pCO2. This overcompensation can happen only if there is an additional component of respiratory alkalosis contributing to reduced pCO2.</p>\r\n",

They are connected to hair follicles and have a larger lumen compared to eccrine glands. Their primary function remains unclear, and they have a lower secretory output.\r\n\r\nSebaceous glands secrete sebum, providing skin lubrication and waterproofing. These glands are associated with hair follicles and are absent in non-hairy skin.\r\n\r\nThe erector pili muscle, a smooth muscle bundle, extends from the dermis to the follicle wall and is involved in hair erection",
