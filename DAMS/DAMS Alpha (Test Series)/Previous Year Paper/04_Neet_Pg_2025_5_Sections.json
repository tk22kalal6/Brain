Therefore, if the patient received both the recessive genes from their parents, they will have an extremely low level of HDL, and If the patient inherited only one gene from their parents, they would have a relatively low level of HDL (about half the normal level in normal individuals) but no overt clinical manifestation of the disease. Heterogeneous parents for the pathology will have a 25% chance of having an affected sibling or homozygous sibling, 50% of having a carrier sibling or heterozygous sibling, and 25% of having a normal sibling, while homozygous parent married to a normal individual will have 100?rrier siblings.\r\n• Mutations have been found in chromosome 9q31, which encodes for the ATP-Binding cassette transporter (ABCA-1) gene. These transporters normally transmit cholesterol and phospholipids from inside the cells into the liver. Thus cholesterol will be accumulated within the cells, which eventually impairs cell functions and lead to their death.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n• Insulin concentrations oscillate at a periodicity of 5–15 min per oscillation. These oscillations are due to coordinate insulin secretory bursts, from millions of islets. The generation of common secretory bursts requires strong within-islet and within-pancreas coordination to synchronize the secretory activity from the ?-cell population. The overall contribution of this pulsatile mechanism dominates and accounts for the majority of insulin release. This review discusses the methods involved in the detection and quantification of periodicities and individual secretory bursts. The mechanism by which overall insulin secretion is regulated through changes in the pulsatile component is discussed for nerves, metabolites, hormones, and drugs. The impaired pulsatile secretion of insulin in type 2 diabetes has resulted in much focus on the impact of the insulin delivery pattern on insulin action, and improved action from oscillatory insulin exposure is demonstrated on liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. Therefore, not only is the dominant regulation of insulin through changes in secretory burst mass and amplitude, but the changes may affect insulin action. Finally, the role of impaired pulsatile release in early type 2 diabetes suggests a predictive value of studies on insulin pulsatility in the development of this disease.",

People with night blindness do not see well in the dark. But they can see normally if enough light is present. As the vitamin A deficiency worsens, the conjunctiva (thin membrane covering the white of the eye) dries out. Then corneal ulcers (open sores) appear. If untreated it eventually leads to vision loss and blindness.\r\n• The different eye signs of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in children, as graded by the WHO, are:\r\n• Night blindness (XN)\r\n• Conjunctival xerosis (X1A)\r\n• Bitot's spots (X1B)\r\n• Corneal xerosis (X2)\r\n• Corneal ulcer covering less than 1/3 of the cornea (X3A)\r\n• Corneal ulcer covering at least 1/3 of the cornea, defined as keratomalacia (X3B)\r\n• Corneal scarring (XS)",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\n• During fasting, free fatty acids are mobilized from adipocytes and transported to the liver where they contribute to the synthesis of ketone bodies \r\n•  This process is dependent on low insulin levels, which enhances lipolysis in white adipose tissue due to the suppressed insulin-induced inhibition on hormone sensitive lipase. In hepatocytes, they subsequently undergo beta-oxidation that may initiate ketogenesis \r\n• Due to the need of transporters for the entry of long chain fatty acids to the mitochondrial matrix, this could be a limiting step for ketosis during a ketogenic diet. Interestingly, MCFA are not dependent on the transporter protein for mitochondrial entry \r\n",

Preoperative management: • The key goal before surgical resection is to control hypertension and volume status. • The first-line preoperative drug is Phenoxybenzamine, a non-selective, irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker. • It helps in controlling the hypertension by blocking alpha-1 receptors, leading to vasodilation and prevention of intraoperative hypertensive crisis caused by catecholamine surge during tumor manipulation. Why not the others? • Clonidine: Central alpha-2 agonist; not appropriate for pheochromocytoma as it does not block peripheral catecholamine effects. • Aspirin: Antiplatelet; no role in catecholamine-related BP control • Esmolol: A beta-blocker used only after adequate alpha blockade is established to control tachycardia; using beta-blockers first can cause unopposed alpha stimulation, worsening hypertension.",

This regimen is preferred due to: • High efficacy • Avoidance of injectable agents (which are more toxic) • Compatibility with ART initiation ________________________________________ IRIS Consideration: Since the patient has a low CD4 count, starting ART can trigger Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) — a paradoxical worsening of TB symptoms due to immune recovery. Hence, close monitoring is required. ________________________________________ Why not the others? • B. HEZ + levofloxacin: Not a WHO-recommended MDR regimen; levofloxacin is a second-line agent, but this combo is incomplete. • C. HEZ + linezolid: Inadequate for RR/MDR-TB. • D.

Thiazide diuretics (including chlorthalidone) reduce urinary calcium excretion, which helps prevent the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones—especially calcium oxalate stones. ________________________________________ Mechanism: • Thiazides promote sodium and water loss in the distal convoluted tubule. • They increase calcium reabsorption from the renal tubule, thereby reducing urinary calcium excretion. • Lower calcium levels in urine reduce supersaturation of calcium salts and decrease stone formation. ________________________________________ Why other options are incorrect: • a. Decreased oxalate excretion: Not the primary mechanism. • b. Increased oxalate excretion: Would increase stone risk, not decrease it. • d. Increased calcium excretion: Increases stone risk, the opposite effect of chlorthalidone.",

This condition is a chronic, inflammatory, and progressive skin disease that primarily affects the glans penis and prepuce. BXO is characterized by the presence of white, sclerotic (hardened), and atrophic (thinned) plaques, which can be clearly seen in the image around the urethral meatus. This sclerotic tissue leads to the progressive narrowing of the preputial opening, causing phimosis. Over time, BXO can also lead to meatal stenosis, where the urethral opening itself narrows, as seen in the image. The progressive nature of the condition and the visible white, sclerotic lesion are classic signs of BXO.",

Delivery of the Buttocks and Legs • Pinard Manoeuvre: • Used to deliver extended legs in a breech presentation. • The practitioner gently flexes and abducts the thigh to bring the leg down, enabling delivery. 2. Delivery of the Trunk • Allow the trunk to deliver spontaneously up to the level of the scapula while supporting the baby. • Avoid traction to prevent overstretching of the spine or brachial plexus injuries. 3. Delivery of the Arms • Lovset Manoeuvre: • Used to deliver the arms when they are extended or above the head. • Rotate the baby gently by holding the hips to bring one shoulder and arm into the anterior-posterior plane. • Sweep the arm down across the chest to deliver it. • Repeat on the other side. 4. Delivery of the Head • Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit Manoeuvre: • The baby is supported on the practitioner’s forearm with two fingers of one hand placed in the baby’s mouth (to flex the head). • The other hand applies gentle pressure on the baby’s occiput to assist in head flexion and delivery. • Burns-Marshall Manoeuvre: • Used when the baby’s head is at the perineum. • Hold the baby by the ankles, allow the body to hang until the nape of the neck is visible, and gently deliver the head. • Forceps Application: • Piper forceps can be used to assist in delivering the after-coming head in certain situations. 5. Other Specific Manoeuvres • Bracht Manoeuvre: • Used when the baby is delivered up to the umbilicus. • The baby’s body is lifted over the mother’s abdomen, using uterine pressure to assist in head delivery. ergency cesarean delivery if complications arise. Proper use of these maneuvers ensures a safe and controlled breech vaginal delivery.",

Hegar’s Sign: • Definition: Softening of the lower uterine segment (isthmus) felt during a pelvic examination. • Significance: • Typically occurs around the 6th week of pregnancy. • Hegar’s sign is an early indicator of pregnancy and is often one of the first physical changes noted. • This sign is helpful in confirming early pregnancy, particularly in primigravid (first-time pregnant) women. 2. Goodell’s Sign: • Definition: Softening of the cervix due to increased blood flow and hormonal changes. • Significance: • This sign is often noticeable by the 6th week of pregnancy. • The cervix becomes softer, more vascular, and bluish in color (due to increased blood flow), which is a result of hormonal changes such as increased estrogen. • Goodell’s sign is used as a positive indicator of pregnancy and is more evident after fertilization and early gestation. 3. Osiander’s Sign: • Definition: Increased vascularity of the vaginal walls and cervix, making them appear more purple or cyanotic. • Significance: • This sign is typically visible around the 8th week of pregnancy. • Caused by increased blood flow due to the effects of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. • It may be detected during a pelvic examination, where the vaginal mucosa and cervix appear congested and purplish, indicating early pregnancy. 4. Palmer’s Sign: • Definition: A pulsation felt in the lateral fornix of the vagina, often during a vaginal examination. • Significance: • The sign is caused by the increased blood flow to the pelvic area during pregnancy, leading to the pulsation of the uterine arteries. • It is an early sign of pregnancy, typically noticeable from around 8-10 weeks of gestation. • This sign is sometimes used as a confirmation of pregnancy, but it is not as commonly assessed today as other signs.",

This sequence ensures anatomical alignment, proper healing, and minimization of complications such as infection, hematoma, or wound dehiscence. The repair begins with continuous suturing of the vaginal mucosa to restore the vaginal wall and prevent dead space. Then, the underlying perineal muscles (including the transverse perineal and bulbocavernosus muscles) are approximated to restore perineal body strength and support. Finally, the skin is closed, usually with interrupted or subcuticular sutures, to restore the external appearance and barrier. Proper layer-by-layer repair is critical to: Reduce bleeding, Restore anatomy, Prevent dyspareunia, Promote faster recovery.",

A reactive NST (normal) in a term pregnancy is defined as at least two accelerations of fetal heart rate (15 bpm above baseline lasting 15 seconds) within 20 minutes. However, sometimes fetuses may be in a sleep cycle, which can last up to 40 minutes. Therefore, if only one acceleration is seen in the initial 20 minutes, the correct next step is to continue monitoring for up to 40 minutes to allow the fetus time to wake up and demonstrate reactivity. This avoids unnecessary interventions and is part of the standard protocol for NST interpretation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) 14 gm The Pritchard regimen is a widely used protocol for administering magnesium sulfate (MgSO?) in the management of eclampsia and severe preeclampsia to prevent or control seizures. As per this regimen, the loading dose totals 14 grams, given in two parts: 4 g IV (intravenous) of 20% MgSO? solution is given slowly over 5–10 minutes 10 g IM (intramuscular) of 50% MgSO? solution is given, 5 g in each buttock, using a deep intramuscular injection with lignocaine to reduce pain. This regimen ensures rapid attainment of therapeutic serum magnesium levels and effective seizure prophylaxis. The Pritchard regimen is especially preferred in resource-limited settings, as it does not rely heavily on serum level monitoring but focuses on clinical monitoring for toxicity (e.g., reflexes, urine output, respiratory rate).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThe question asks about the type of pelvis most commonly associated with persistent occiput posterior (OP) or face to pubes delivery.\r\n\r\nC. Anthropoid pelvis is the correct answer.\r\n\r\nAnthropoid Pelvis Characteristics: An anthropoid pelvis is characterized by an anteroposterior diameter that is greater than its transverse diameter at the inlet. The inlet is oval-shaped, resembling that of an ape (hence \"anthropoid\"). The side walls are often convergent, and the sacrum is long and straight.\r\nImpact on Fetal Rotation: Due to its long anteroposterior diameter and relatively narrow transverse diameter, the anthropoid pelvis tends to favor the fetal head entering the pelvis in an anteroposterior (occiput anterior or occiput posterior) position and persisting in these positions, often with a reduced tendency for internal rotation.\r\nPersistent OP and Face to Pubes: When the fetal head enters the anthropoid pelvis in the occiput posterior (OP) position, the long anteroposterior diameter encourages it to remain in that orientation. Spontaneous rotation to an occiput anterior (OA) position is less common or more difficult. This can lead to a \"persistent OP\" presentation. If the head extends (rather than flexes) in this position, it can result in a \"face to pubes\" delivery, where the face presents under the pubic symphysis, which is a rare but possible outcome of persistent OP, particularly in an anthropoid pelvis.\r\nA. Android pelvis is incorrect. An android pelvis is heart-shaped at the inlet, with a prominent sacrum and convergent side walls. It is associated with a higher incidence of deep transverse arrest, not typically persistent OP or face to pubes.\r\n\r\nB. Gynecoid pelvis is incorrect. A gynecoid pelvis is the most common and ideal female pelvic shape, with a rounded or slightly oval inlet and well-proportioned diameters. It favors a well-flexed occiput anterior presentation and efficient rotation, making persistent OP or face to pubes less likely.\r\n\r\nD. Platypelloid pelvis is incorrect. A platypelloid pelvis is characterized by a very wide transverse diameter and a very short anteroposterior diameter (flattened). It favors a transverse lie at the inlet and can lead to a deep transverse arrest or arrest at the inlet, but not typically persistent OP or face to pubes delivery.",

This helps in the safe delivery of the placenta once signs of placental separation appear. CCT reduces the duration of the third stage of labor and minimizes the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), making it a critical intervention in obstetric practice.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) Decrease release of gnrh from hypothalamus Hyperprolactinemia leads to amenorrhea primarily by suppressing the hypothalamic release of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone). Prolactin acts at the hypothalamic level, inhibiting GnRH secretion, which in turn causes reduced pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. These gonadotropins are essential for follicular development and ovulation. Their suppression results in anovulation and amenorrhea. This mechanism is especially seen in conditions like prolactinomas or during lactation, when prolactin levels are physiologically high.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) Mc Robert, rubin, gaskin, zavanelli Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency where the fetal anterior shoulder gets stuck behind the maternal pubic symphysis after the head is delivered. Management must be systematic and escalating, starting from least invasive to more invasive steps. The recommended sequence is: McRoberts Maneuver – This is the first-line intervention. It involves hyperflexion and abduction of the mother’s hips to straighten the sacrum and rotate the pelvis, which can relieve up to 40% of cases. Gaskin Maneuver – If McRoberts fails, this involves placing the mother in the all-fours (hands and knees) position, which can help rotate the baby and relieve impaction. Rubin Maneuver – An internal maneuver that involves applying pressure to the posterior aspect of the anterior fetal shoulder to rotate it into the oblique diameter. Zavanelli Maneuver – This is a last resort when all other maneuvers fail. It involves replacing the fetal head into the vagina followed by emergency cesarean section. This stepwise approach is critical to reduce fetal hypoxia, brachial plexus injury, and other complications.",

The appropriate first step is a per vaginal examination to assess the source of bleeding, look for cervical lesions, atrophy, or growth, and to collect a Pap smear (PAPS) to evaluate for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma. Even if the discharge is minimal or intermittent, it must never be ignored in postmenopausal women. Early evaluation ensures timely diagnosis and treatment of malignancy, if present.

The presence of cord pulsations indicates that fetal circulation is still intact, and urgent action is needed to preserve it until definitive delivery (usually via cesarean section). The immediate next step is to relieve pressure on the cord to maintain blood flow. This includes: Buttock elevation (Trendelenburg or knee-chest position), Manual elevation of the presenting part (pushing the head off the cord), Filling the bladder retrograde with saline (about 500 mL) to elevate the presenting part, Avoiding manipulation of the cord, to prevent vasospasm.

It blocks the action of progesterone, which is essential for maintaining pregnancy. By blocking progesterone, it causes decidual degeneration, detachment of the gestational sac, and softening of the cervix.\r\nMisoprostol: This is a prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analogue. It causes uterine contractions and cervical ripening, leading to the expulsion of the pregnancy. Misoprostol is typically administered 24-48 hours after mifepristone.\r\nEfficacy: The combination of mifepristone followed by misoprostol has a high success rate (over 95%) for complete medical abortion in the first trimester.\r\n\r\nB. Dinoprostone is incorrect. Dinoprostone is a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) analogue. While it causes cervical ripening and uterine contractions and can be used for induction of labor or termination of pregnancy, it is generally less effective than misoprostol for medical abortion in the first trimester and is more commonly used in the second trimester for induction or cervical ripening before labor induction at term. It is not the preferred or most common single agent for first-trimester medical termination.\r\n\r\nC. Oxytocin is incorrect. Oxytocin is a uterotonic agent primarily used to induce or augment labor in the second and third trimesters or to manage postpartum hemorrhage. It is ineffective as a standalone agent for termination in the first trimester because the uterus at 10 weeks is relatively insensitive to oxytocin. The uterus becomes more responsive to oxytocin as pregnancy advances.\r\n\r\nD. Intrauterine hyperosmolar saline is incorrect. Intrauterine instillation of hyperosmolar saline was an older method of abortion, primarily used for later-trimester abortions (second trimester). It is associated with significant risks, including infection, coagulopathy, and retained placental tissue, and has largely been replaced by prostaglandin analogues or surgical methods. It is not used for first-trimester termination.",

In this case, the woman has 2 months (approximately 8 weeks) of amenorrhea, making her pregnancy fall within the first trimester. Additionally, her last menstrual period (LMP) is unknown, and cycles are irregular, making clinical dating unreliable. CRL directly measures the length of the embryo from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump) using ultrasound. It is considered the gold standard for dating pregnancies in the first trimester, especially in cases of uncertain or unknown LMP. In IVF-conceived pregnancies, accurate dating is generally known, but if LMP is not available, CRL provides a dependable backup.",
