      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nPhospholamban is a 6kDa protein that tonically inhibits the SERCA pump by increasing its Km for calcium. It is present in both cardiac and smooth muscle cells.\r\n\r\nPhosphorylation of phospholamban relieves this inhibition, speeding up SERCA activity, therefore lowering the cytoplasmic calcium. Phosphorylation of phospholamban is controlled by protein kinases that are, in turn, controlled by agonists. Epinephrine binds to beta receptors on the membrane surface, which are coupled to a heterotrimeric G- protein (Gs) tha activates adenyl cyclase. This increases the intracellular c-AMP which in turn activates protein kinase (PKA).   ",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nCNS toxicity, as described originally by Bert, therefore, k/a “Bert effect”, occurred at oxygen pressures of > 3 ATA. However, lower pressures may result in similar effects if exposure is prolonged. \r\n\r\nSymptoms and signs are quite variable but include twitching of perioral and small muscles of the hand, facial pallor, ‘cogwheel’ breathing, thought to be the result of intense peripheral vasoconstriction due to hyperoxia and diaphragmatic twitching respectively \r\n\r\nIf exposure is continued, vertigo and nausea, followed by altered behaviour, clumsiness, and finally convulsions result. The convulsions begin with a loss of conciousness and develop in three phases; a tonic phase with a generalized hypertonus lasting for about 1 min, a clonic phase with convulsion for about 2–3 mins and a post critical phase of about 10 mins. The patient has no memory of the crisis. CNS toxicity is hastened by factors such as raised PCO2, stress, fatigue and cold.\r\n\r\nPulmonary symptoms of oxygen toxicity is also k/a Lorain Smith effect. Oxygen at 2 ATA produces characteristic pulmonary signs and symptoms beginning with mild carinal irritation on deep inspiration 3–6 hours into the exposure, intense carinal irritation an uncontrolled cough after about 10 hours and finally chest pain and dyspnoea. Clinical features can be divided into three phases (a) Tracheobronchitis (b) ARDS (c) Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Absorption atelectasis due to washout of N2 can lead to collapse of parts of the lung in the event of air trapping.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nBoth A and B. Urinary bladder is an elastic structure. Filling causes the bladder to distend. In addition, like other types of smooth muscle, the bladder muscle has the property of \r\nplasticity; when it is stretched, the tension initially produced is not maintained. The flatness of segment Ib (filling phase) is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius (T = P X r/ 2w or P = T X 2w/ r). In case of the bladder, the wall tension increases as the bladder fills up but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The normal function of the bladder is to store urine until it has reached capacity and until it is socially acceptable to evacuate urine. The bladder wall contains elastin, which allows it to stretch without a subsequent increase in pressure. Typical adult bladder capacity is approximately 350–450 ml. ",

These include:-Increased urinary excretion of bicarbonates. High altitude results in hypoxic hypoxia stimulating the peripheral chemoreceptors. The resulting hyperventilation results in respiratory alkalosis. Alkalosis suppresses the chemoreceptor response. Kidneys increase the urinary excretion of bicarbonates reducing the pH that increases the response to hypoxia. \r\nShift of OHDC to the right- respiratory alkalosis at hugh altitude causes a shift of the OHDC to the left, but a concomitant increase in red blood cell 2,3- DPG shifts the OHDC to the right. The net effect is shift to right and a small increase in P50. Increased secretion of erythropoietin- hypoxia is potent stimulus for secretion of EPO from the kidneys. Hypoxia causes increase in the number of mitochondria, which are the site of oxidative reactions. Myoglobin also increases which facilitates the movement of O2 to the tissues, the tissue content of cytochrome enzymes also increases. ",
