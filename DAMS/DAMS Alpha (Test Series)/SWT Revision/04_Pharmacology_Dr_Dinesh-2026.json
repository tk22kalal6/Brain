Clindamycin has good activity against Bacteroides fragilis and is often used for intra-abdominal infections, though resistance can occur. Metronidazole is also highly effective. Aztreonam and gentamicin are primarily for Gram-negative aerobes, and azithromycin has limited anaerobic activity. \r\n",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) works by replenishing glutathione stores, which provides sulfhydryl groups to detoxify NAPQI, and also by directly binding to NAPQI. This prevents NAPQI from causing hepatocellular damage. \r\n",

However, central nervous system side effects such as psychosis (hallucinations, delusions) are due to increased dopamine activity in the brain and are often not reduced, and can even be exacerbated, by levodopa. Hypertension is not a common side effect of this combination. \r\n",
