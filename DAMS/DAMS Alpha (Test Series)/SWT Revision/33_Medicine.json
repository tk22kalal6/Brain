It most commonly affects middle aged females and is poorly related to exertion. It typically occurs in sleep between 12-5am.  30% cases maybe associated with other vasospastic disorders like migraine and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Attacks are usually precipitated by emotional stress/smoking/cocaine and amphetamine. ECG can show transient ST-T changes (elevation) suggesting Myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography may reveal normal arteries. However, 50-60% may harbour significant coronary stenosis. Hence, provocative testing with ergonovine/intra-coronary acetylcholine is mandatory during angiography to demonstrate vasospasm. The treatment consists of Nitrates and CCB. Beta-blockers are best avoided because they may precipitate vasospasm by facilitating un-opposed alpha-action. Prognosis is excellent with <1% mortality",

PAH can also occur along with HIV, Autoimmune disease and Drug use.\r\nThough HIV associated PAH mimics Idiopathic PAH, there is no correlation with stage of disease. In Scleroderma, PAH is a dreaded complication. PAH can be treated with oral endothelin receptor antagonists (Bosentan, Ambrisentan – convenient oral route but modest efficacy only) as first line when disease is uncomplicated and mild.

He never sought medical treatment because he was uncertain, and his eyes would return fully to normal within 2 days. He denies nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, pruritus, or weight loss. On examination, he has a BMI of 20.1 kg/m2. Scleral icterus is present.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nGilbert’s syndrome\r\nThe given patient is presenting with an asymptomatic and mild elevation in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that has occurred during a time of increased stress, fatigue, and likely decreased caloric intake. This presentation is characteristic of Gilbert syndrome, an inherited disorder of bilirubin conjugation. In Gilbert syndrome, there is a mutation of the UGT1A1 gene that encodes bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which leads to a reduction in activity on the enzyme to 10%–35% of normal. This enzyme is of critical importance in the conjugation of bilirubin. Most of the time, there is no apparent jaundice because the reduced ability to conjugate bilirubin is not reduced to a degree that leads to an elevation of bilirubin. However, during times of stress, fatigue, alcohol use, decreased caloric intake, or intercurrent illness, the enzyme can become overwhelmed, leading to a mild hyperbilirubinemia. Typical bilirubin levels are less than 4.0 mg/dL unless the individual is ill or fasting. Diagnosis usually occurs during young adulthood, and episodes are self-limiting and benign. If a liver biopsy were to be performed, hepatic histology would be normal. No treatment is necessary because there are no long-term consequences of Gilbert syndrome, and patient reassurance is recommended. \r\n",

It is an immune-mediated synovitis, so the synovial fluid shows an elevated leukocyte count despite the absence of infection. Gonococcal arthritis is important to exclude in a young person presenting with acute monoarticular arthritis. Shigella sp. is the most commonly associated enteric organism associated with this syndrome, other causes include Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, and even Clostridium difficile have been implicated.\r\nAmoebic intestinal infections are not associated with reactive arthritis. People who develop this syndrome have a higher prevalence of HLA-B27 antigen, not HLADQ2, which is associated with celiac disease. \r\nThis syndrome is more common in men and classically is associated with the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis.\r\n",
