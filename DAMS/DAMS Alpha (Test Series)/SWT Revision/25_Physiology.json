Arterial blood pressure is sensed by the arterial baroreceptors. A drop in arterial blood pressure unloads the baroreceptors and causes a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic inhibition. Sympathetic activation causes increases in heart rate, ventricular contractility, and total peripheral resistance and a decrease in venous capacitance. Sympathetic nerve activation causes the observed increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and anxiety. In addition, sympathetic nerves to the skin cause vasoconstriction of the blood vessels, accounting for the loss of skin colour. Sympathetic cholinergic nerves activate sweat glands, causing diaphoresis. The common description of a patient in shock is “pale and sweaty.” Arterioles of the cerebral and coronary circulations respond more strongly to local control than to sympathetic activity. Consequently, blood flow to the brain and heart are not diminished by increases in sympathetic nerve activity. ",

The liquid-ventilated lung has increased compliance compared to the gas-ventilated lung, thus producing a steep curve as shown in the figure. In normal respiration, lung volume is always less during inhalation than exhalation at any given pressure. This phenomenon is called hysteresis. During inspiration of air, the collapsing force of surface tension must be overcome. Lungs produce surfactant to minimize surface tension. Thus, pressure increases immediately on inspiration, but volume does not increase until surface tension is overcome. During expiration, volume decreases with pressure increase because no active force is needed to maintain patent airways. With saline, surface tension is further minimized because the air-fluid boundary is removed. Thus, compliance increases and the inspiratory and expiratory curves look similar.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orthostatic hypotension is a decrease in arterial pressure that occurs when a person moves from a supine to a standing position. A person with a normal baroreceptor mechanism responds to a decrease in arterial pressure through the vasomotor center by increasing sympathetic outflow and decreasing parasympathetic outflow. The sympathetic component helps to restore blood pressure by increasing heart rate, contractility, total peripheral resistance (TPR), and mean systemic pressure. In a patient who has undergone a sympathectomy, the sympathetic component of the baroreceptor mechanism is absent.</p>\r\n",

After reaching peak pressure, aortic pressure decreases as blood runs off into the arteries.

These differences in regional ventilation can be explained by regional differences in pleural pressure. The pleural pressure is typically about −10 cm H2O in the upper regions and about −2.5 cm H2O in the lower regions. A less negative pleural pressure in the lower regions of the chest cavity causes less expansion of the lower zones of the lung during resting conditions.

Patients with anemia of chronic disease have low hematocrit leading to a reduced oxygen carrying capacity.  In anemia of chronic disease, the kidney produces less erythropoietin which leads to a normocytic anemia. Anemia results in reduced O2 carrying capacity and can lead to symptoms like headache, easy fatigability and shortness of breath. In anemic states, the dissolved O2 (Pa02) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) typically remain normal. Remember that the total oxygen content of blood is a function of the hemoglobin concentration, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood, though the latter plays an insignificant role in most instances (exception would be CO poisoning).

Ventilation and perfusion are not distributed evenly throughout the lung. Perfusion is greater in the base of the lung than in the apex due to gravity. Ventilation is also greater in the base of the lung than in the apex due to greater relative expansion of the alveoli upon inhalation. The decrease in perfusion at the apex of the lung is much greater than the decrease in ventilation so the ventilation to perfusion (V/Q) ratio at the apex is high. This increase in V/Q ratio makes the apex more oxygen rich and more attractive for aerobic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\r\n",

It consists of the following:-\r\n\r\na.\tRed reaction (k/a red dermographism)- there is reddening at the site which appears in about 10 seconds. This initial redness is due to capillary dilatation, a direct response of the capillaries to pressure. \r\n\r\nb.\tFlare- this is a spreading redness from the site of injury due to arteriolar dilatation. This is due to the “axon reflex”, a response in which impulses initiated in sensory nerves by the injury are relayed antidromically down other branches of the sensory nerve fibers. The transmitter released at the central termination of the sensory C fiber neurons is substance P. Substance P and CGRP are present in all parts of neurons. Both dilate arterioles and, in addition, substance P causes extravasation of fluid. \r\nThe axon reflex persists after total sympathectomy. Flare is absent in locally anesthetized skin and in denervated skin after the sensory nerves have degenerated, but is present after a nerve block or section above the site of injury. This indicates that flare is due to the axon reflex, a neural response. \r\n\r\nc.\tWheal- swelling or local edema is due to increased permeability of the capillaries and post capillary \r\nvenules, with consequent extravasation of fluid. Extravasation is believed to be due to release of substance P. Effective peptide antagonists to substance P have been developed, and they reduce the extravasation. ",

These include:-\r\n\r\n•\tIncreased urinary excretion of bicarbonates. High altitude results in hypoxic hypoxia stimulating the peripheral chemoreceptors. The resulting hyperventilation results in respiratory alkalosis. Alkalosis suppresses the chemoreceptor response. Kidneys increase the urinary excretion of bicarbonates reducing the pH that increases the response to hypoxia. \r\n\r\n•\tShift of OHDC to the right- respiratory alkalosis at hugh altitude causes a shift of the OHDC to the left, but a concomitant increase in red blood cell 2,3- DPG shifts the OHDC to the right. The net effect is shift to right and a small increase in P50.\r\n\r\n•\tIncreased secretion of erythropoietin- hypoxia is potent stimulus for secretion of EPO from the kidneys. \r\n\r\n•\tHypoxia causes increase in the number of mitochondria, which are the site of oxidative reactions. Myoglobin also increases which facilitates the movement of O2 to the tissues, the tissue content of cytochrome enzymes also increases. ",
