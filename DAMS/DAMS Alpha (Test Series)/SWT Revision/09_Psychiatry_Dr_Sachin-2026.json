      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nSomatization Disorder\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nC) Somatization Disorder: Somatization Disorder, now referred to as Somatic Symptom Disorder in DSM-5, involves multiple, recurrent, and changing physical symptoms over a long period of time that cannot be fully explained by medical conditions. Patients often undergo numerous medical evaluations and frequently switch doctors, as they feel their concerns are not being adequately addressed.\r\n\r\nA) Conversion Disorder: Conversion Disorder involves neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness) that cannot be explained by medical \r\nevaluation and are often associated with psychological stress. However, it typically involves a single symptom or a few symptoms rather than multiple, changing physical complaints.\r\n\r\nB) Hypochondriasis: Hypochondriasis, now known as Illness Anxiety Disorder, involves an excessive preoccupation with having a serious illness based on misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. The key feature is the anxiety about having a serious illness rather than multiple somatic complaints.\r\n\r\nD) Factitious Disorder: Factitious Disorder involves intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological symptoms for the purpose of assuming the sick role, not to obtain external rewards like in malingering. This is different from the involuntary symptoms seen in Somatization Disorder.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nAdjustment disorder; provide supportive psychotherapy\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nC) Adjustment disorder; provide supportive psychotherapy: The patient is presenting with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia following a significant life stressor (loss of her job). The symptoms have been present for 3 months, which aligns with the diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder. Adjustment Disorder occurs in response to a stressful event and is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that are disproportionate to the stressor. The first-line treatment for Adjustment Disorder is supportive psychotherapy, which helps the patient cope with the stressor.\r\n\r\nA) Major depressive disorder; start sertraline: While the patient has symptoms of depression, the context and duration suggest Adjustment Disorder rather than Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD requires at least 2 weeks of depressed mood or anhedonia, along with other symptoms, but without a clear external stressor. Sertraline, an SSRI, is a treatment for MDD but not typically the first-line treatment for Adjustment Disorder.\r\n\r\nB) Generalized anxiety disorder; start escitalopram: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple events or activities, lasting at least 6 months. The patient's symptoms are linked to a specific stressor (job loss), making Adjustment Disorder more likely than GAD. Escitalopram is used for GAD but is not indicated for Adjustment Disorder.\r\n\r\nD) Adjustment disorder; start sertraline: While SSRIs like sertraline can sometimes be used in more severe cases of Adjustment Disorder, the initial management typically involves supportive psychotherapy rather than medication. Medication might be considered if the symptoms are particularly severe or persistent, but it is not the first-line approach.",

The risk of agranulocytosis is higher in the first year of clozapine therapy and gradually reduces over the course of treatment. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an idiosyncratic reaction which cannot be predicted in an individual patient. The most important clinical implication to remember is the fact that if a patient has an idiosyncratic side-effect, then this can reoccur at even small doses if rechallenged. Stopping the drug rather than lowering its dose is the appropriate management strategy in such cases. \r\n\r\nNaltrexone produces hepatocellular damage in proportion to the dose administered, especially in patients with pre-existing liver damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\n“Sleepwalking in its classic form, as the name implies, is a condition in which an individual arises from bed and ambulates without fully awakening. It is sometimes called somnambulism, and individuals can engage in a variety of complex behaviors while unconscious. Sleepwalking usually occurs during slow wave sleep. The sleepwalker often can successfully interact with the environment (e.g., avoiding tripping over objects).\r\n\r\nHowever, the sleepwalker may interact with the environment inappropriately, which sometimes results in injury (e.g., stepping out of an upstairs window or walking into the roadway). There are cases in which sleepwalkers have committed acts of violence. \r\n\r\nAn individual who is sleepwalking is difficult to awaken. Once awake, the sleepwalker will usually appear confused. It is best to gently attempt to lead sleepwalkers back to bed rather than to attempt to awaken them by grabbing, shaking, or shouting. In their confused state, sleepwalkers may think they are being attacked and may react violently to defend themselves",

High EE environments significantly increase the risk of relapse in patients with schizophrenia, even if they are receiving appropriate treatment.  \r\n\r\n- A) Increased relapse rate:  \r\nCorrect. High EE (characterized by criticism, hostility, and emotional over-involvement) is a well-established factor contributing to higher relapse rates in schizophrenia. Patients in high EE households are more likely to experience exacerbations of symptoms, despite medication adherence.  \r\n\r\n- B) Decreased treatment adherence:  \r\nWhile a stressful family environment may contribute to nonadherence, high EE is primarily linked to relapse, even among patients who continue treatment. Nonadherence is often influenced by factors like medication side effects, lack of insight, or cognitive deficits.  \r\n\r\n- C) Greater likelihood that this behavior caused the initial psychotic episode:  \r\nHigh EE does not cause schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder influenced by genetic and environmental factors, but high EE primarily impacts relapse risk, not disease onset.  \r\n\r\n- D) Higher probability of the patient developing paranoid-type schizophrenia:  \r\nThere is no strong evidence linking high EE specifically to paranoid-type schizophrenia. Instead, high EE is a general risk factor for worsening symptoms and relapse, regardless of the schizophrenia subtype. ",

As a result, smokers often require higher doses of these drugs to achieve the same therapeutic effect.  \r\n\r\n- A) CYP1A2 induction:  \r\nCorrect. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke (not nicotine) induce CYP1A2 activity, leading to faster clearance of clozapine, olanzapine, and other drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. Stopping smoking can cause drug levels to rise, increasing the risk of toxicity.  \r\n\r\n- B) Dopamine upregulation:  \r\nWhile nicotine affects dopamine release, it does not directly explain the need for higher antipsychotic doses. Dopamine upregulation is more relevant to nicotine addiction and withdrawal rather than drug metabolism.  \r\n\r\n- C) Nicotinic receptor blockade:  \r\nNicotine activates nicotinic receptors rather than blocking them. Nicotinic receptor modulation has been linked to cognitive improvements in schizophrenia but does not directly alter antipsychotic metabolism.  \r\n\r\n- D) Serotonin modulation:  \r\nWhile nicotine affects serotonin pathways, serotonin modulation is not the primary mechanism behind increased antipsychotic clearance.

Lithium augmentation has strong evidence for enhancing antidepressant effects, particularly in treatment-resistant depression.  \r\n\r\n- A) Lithium  \r\nCorrect. Lithium is a first-line augmentation strategy for MDD when an SSRI provides partial improvement. It is particularly beneficial for suicidal patients and those with a suspected bipolar spectrum disorder.  \r\n\r\n- B) Sertraline  \r\nIncorrect. Sertraline is another SSRI, and switching between SSRIs is typically done only if there is no response at all. Since the patient has some response, augmentation (with lithium or atypical antipsychotics) is preferred.  \r\n\r\n- C) An MAO inhibitor  \r\nIncorrect. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine) are reserved for treatment-resistant depression when multiple first-line agents fail. They require a 2-week washout due to the risk of serotonin syndrome with fluoxetine.  \r\n\r\n- D) Clonazepam  \r\nIncorrect. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine, which may help anxiety symptoms but does not enhance antidepressant effects or address treatment resistance. It is also not a long-term treatment for MDD due to dependency risks.  ",
