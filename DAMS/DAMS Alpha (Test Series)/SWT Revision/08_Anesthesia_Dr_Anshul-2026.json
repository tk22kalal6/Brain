      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) \r\n\r\n• The complications of tracheal intubation can be divided into those associated with direct laryngoscopy and intubation of the trachea, tracheal tube placement, and extubation of the trachea. \r\n• The most frequent complication associated with direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is dental trauma. \r\n• Other complications of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation include hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmias, and aspiration of gastric contents. \r\n• The most common complication that occurs while the endotracheal tube is in place is inadvertent endobronchial intubation. \r\n• Flexion, not extension, of the neck or a change from the supine position to the head-down position can shift the carina upward, which may convert a midtracheal tube placement into a bronchial intubation. \r\n• Extension of the neck can cause cephalad displacement of the tube into the pharynx. \r\n• The complications associated with extubation of the trachea can be immediate or delayed immediate complications associated with extubation of the trachea, the two most serious are laryngospasm and aspiration of gastric contents.  \r\n• Pharyngitis is another frequent complication after extubation of the trachea. \r\n• It occurs most commonly in female individuals, presumably because of the thinner mucosal covering over the posterior vocal cords in comparison with male individuals. \r\n• Delayed complications associated with extubation of the trachea include laryngeal ulcerations, tracheitis, tracheal stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, and arytenoid cartilage dislocation \r\n• While using magills forceps for guiding nasal intubation right nostril is preferred to make visualization of larynx and manipulation of endotracheal tube easier.\r\n",

Narcotics delivered by spinal or epidural methods function at the same site in the spinal cord (substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn of the spinal column) \r\n• Interestingly, the analgesic properties of Intra Thecal Narcotics are not affected by narcotic antagonists given by other routes.\r\n• Pain during the second stage of labour is a combination of visceral and somatic pain from distention and tearing of the perineal tissues. \r\n• Intrathecal narcotics are not particularly effective for this pain, but local anesthetic agents, such as bupivacaine, are beneficial and can be added to spinal “cocktails.”\r\n• Lipophilic opioids get absorbed in the blood faster and therefore have less propensity for delayed respiratory depression\r\n",

The use of volume control or pressure control is largely a matter of personal\r\npreference, although some patients breathe more comfortably with pressure control.\r\n\r\n(B) Tidal Volume\r\nThe following recommendations are from the lung protective ventilation protocol\r\n1. Select an initial tidal volume of 8 mL/kg using predicted body weight.\r\n2. Reduce the tidal volume to 6 mL/kg over the next 2 hours, if possible.\r\n3. Monitor the peak alveolar pressure and keep it ≤30 cm H2O (to limit the risk of volutrauma).\r\n\r\nInspiratory Flow Rate\r\n1. Select an inspiratory flow rate of 60 L/min if the patient is breathing quietly or has no spontaneous respirations.\r\n2. Use higher inspiratory flow rates (e.g., ≥80 L/min) for patients with respiratory distress or a high minute ventilation (≥10 L/min).\r\nI:E Ratio\r\n1. The I:E ratio should be ≥1:2.\r\n2.

Segmental inhibition: Local inhibition in the dorsal horn is mediated by the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters like glycine and GABA.<br><br>c. Gate control theory of pain: It states that activating the larger diameter A beta fibres leads to inhibition of pain signals transmitted via smaller diameter A delta and C fibres. <br><br>An inhibitory interneuron acts as a physiological gate which is closed by stimulation of A beta fibres. <br><br>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), spinal cord stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation was established based on this principle. <br><br>d.
