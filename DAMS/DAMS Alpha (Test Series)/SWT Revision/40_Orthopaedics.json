The ankle, midtarsal, and subtalar joints all are involved in the pathological process.\r\n•\tThe heel appears to be in varus because the calcaneus rotates through the talocalcaneal joint in a coronal plane and horizontally. \r\n•\tThe talonavicular joint is in an extreme position of inversion as the navicular moves around the head of the talus. The cuboid is displaced medially on the calcaneus\r\n•\tThe order of correction by serial manipulation and casting should be as follows: first, correction of forefoot adduction; next, correction of heel varus; and finally, correction of hindfootequinus. \r\n•\tCorrection should be pursued in this order so that a rocker-bottom deformity would be prevented by dorsiflexing the foot through the hindfoot rather than the midfoot.\r\n",

Achondroplasia is indeed inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning a single copy of the mutated gene (FGFR3) is sufficient to cause the condition.\r\n\r\nB. It is the most common cause of Disproportionate dwarfism: This statement is True. Achondroplasia is the most frequent cause of disproportionate short stature, where the limbs are significantly shorter than the trunk.\r\n\r\nC. Maximum height achieved is usually 4 feet: This statement is True. The average adult height for individuals with achondroplasia is typically around 131 cm (4 feet 3 inches) for males and 124 cm (4 feet 1 inch) for females, making \"usually 4 feet\" a reasonable approximation.\r\n\r\nD. It’s a defect in intramembranous ossification: This statement is False. Achondroplasia is a defect in endochondral ossification, which is the process by which most bones, especially long bones, develop from cartilage templates. Intramembranous ossification is the process by which flat bones (like those of the skull and clavicle) develop directly from mesenchymal tissue without a cartilage intermediate.",

Neurologic disorders and osseous abnormalities, such as Klippel-Feil, are less common.\r\n•\tUltrasonography is considered the modality of choice for differentiating (CMT) from other more serious pathologies in the neck when a palpable mass is present. The initial treatment of of CMT is conservative, and good outcomes can be expected in the majority of these cases. \r\n•\tTang et al used US to examine affected sternocleidomastoid muscles in patients with CMT classified as having one of four types of fibrosis. \r\n•\tThey determined the change in fibrosis type over time and concluded that CMT is a dynamic disease which can be accurately assessed and followed by ultrasonography. \r\n•\tBenign paroxysmal torticollis is a self-limiting condition occurring during infancy. It resolves by the age of two to three years. \r\n•\tParoxysmal torticollis of infancy is a rare disorder characterized by periodic episodes of torticollis which are associated with pallor, agitation and ataxia. \r\n•\tThe etiology is unknown and no treatment is effective, however the condition is usually benign and self-limiting.\r\n",

It usually occurs in the long bones of a growing child, especially the upper part of the humerus (50 - 60% of the time) or the upper part of the femur (25-30 % of the time). Other bones, however, can be affected.\r\n•\tThese cysts usually affect children primarily between the ages of 5 to 15, but can affect older children or adults. In older children and adults, they tend to occur in flat bones (such as the pelvis, jaw, skull or rib cage) or in the large heel bone (calcaneus)\r\n•\tUnicameral bone cysts are considered benign. They do not metastasize (spread) beyond the bone. Some heal spontaneously, while others enlarge. More invasive cysts can grow to fill most of the bone's metaphysis (the transitional zone where the shaft of the bone joins the end of the bone) and cause what is known as a pathological fracture. A more invasive cyst could also destroy the bone's growth plate, leading to shortening of the bone. Shortening in the upper arm (humerus) usually does not cause a functional problem, but it may produce a cosmetic problem if it occurs in early childhood.\r\n",

A positive test is found when this causes worsening of the tingling when the nerve is tapped – positive in carpal tunnel syndrome. \r\n•\tPhalen’s Sign : Phalen’s test is done by pushing the back of your hands together for one minute. This compresses the carpal tunnel and is also positive when it causes the same symptoms you have been experiencing with your carpal tunnel syndrome. \r\n•\tElectrodiagnostic test : Definitive analysis of nerve function can be performed with a device called an EMG (electromyography) which, can detect abnormalities in nerve impulse conduction; these nerve conduction abnormalities are the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. \r\n•\tThe EMC does not always need to be performed, but may be done if a patient’s symptoms are not typical of carpal tunnel syndrome. \r\n•\tAdson's test is used to assess for the presence of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome at the scalene triangle.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nVolar tilt\r\nRef: Read the text below    \r\nSol:\r\nCOLLES’ FRACTURE – \r\n•\tThis is a fracture at the distal end of the radius, at its cortico-cancellous junction (about 2 cm from the distal articular surface), in adults, with typical displacement. \r\n•\tIt is the commonest fracture in people above 40 years of age, and is particularly common in women because of post-menopausal osteoporosis. \r\n•\tIt nearly always results from a fall on an out-stretched hand. \r\nPATHOANATOMY – \r\n•\tThe fracture line runs transversely at the cortico-cancellous junction. \r\n•\tIn the majority of cases, one or more of the following displacements occur – \r\n•\tImpaction of fragments\r\n•\tDorsal displacement\r\n•\tDorsal tilt\r\n•\tLateral (Radial) displacement\r\n•\tLateral (Radial) tilt\r\n•\tSupination. \r\n•\tAs the displacement occurs, some amount of communition of the dorsal and lateral cortices, and that of the soft cancellous bone of the distal fragment occurs. \r\n•\tSome of the injuries commonly associated with Colles’ fracture are – \r\n•\tFracture of the styloid process of the ulna\r\n•\tRupture of the ulnar collateral ligament\r\n•\tRupture of the triangular cartilage of the ulna\r\n•\tRupture of the inter-osseous radio-ulnar ligament, causing radio-ulnar subluxation. \r\nDIAGNOSIS – \r\n•\tThe patient presents with pain, swelling and deformity of the wrist. \r\n•\tOn examination, tenderness and irregularity of the lower end of the radius is found. \r\n•\tThere may be a typical ‘dinner fork deformity’. \r\n•\tThe radial styloid process comes to lie at the same level or at a little higher than the ulnar styloid process. \r\nRADIOLOGICAL FEATURES – \r\n•\tThe dorsal tilt is the most characteristic displacement. \r\n•\tIt can be detected by looking at the direction of the distal articular surface of the radius on a lateral X-ray. \r\n•\tNormally it faces ventrally. \r\n•\tSimilarly, a lateral tilt can be detected on an antero-posterior X-ray. \r\n•\tNormally, the distal articular surface faces medially. \r\nTREATMENT – \r\n•\tTreatment of Colles’ fracture is essentially conservative. \r\n•\tFor an undisplaced fracture, immobilization in a below-elbow plaster cast for six weeks is sufficient. \r\n•\tFor displaced fractures, the standard method of treatment is manipulative reduction followed by immobilization in a Colles’ cast. \r\nCOMPLICATIONS – \r\n•\tStiffness of joints\r\n•\tMalunion – Persistence of dinner fork deformity\r\n•\tSubluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint\r\n•\tCarpal tunnel syndrome\r\n•\tSudeck’s osteodystrophy\r\n•\tRupture of the extensor pollicis  longus tendon\r\n",
