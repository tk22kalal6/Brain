Under normal conditions, inactivated G protein contains GDP, which is produced by a phosphatase catalyzing the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.\r\n•\tWhen GDP is so bound to the G protein, the adenylate cyclase is inactive. Upon hormone binding to the receptor, GTP is exchanged for GDP and the G protein is in an active state, allowing adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic AMP.\r\n•\tBecause cholera toxin prevents the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, the adenylate cyclase remains in an irreversibly active state, continuously producing cyclic AMP in the intestinal mucosal cells.

These are the hexokinase (glucokinase), PFK-1, and PKcatalyzed reactions. Reactions that are essentially irreversible in most metabolic pathways are subject to complex regulatory controls and represent rate-limiting steps in the pathway.\r\n•\tThe primary site of regulation of glycolysis occurs at the level of the PFK-1-catalyzed step.Hence, this reaction is the rate-limiting step in glycolysis. PFK-1 is subject to allosteric control by numerous compounds.\r\n•\tCitrate and ATP inhibit the activity of PFK-1, while AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6-BP) activate the enzyme. The principal control of PFK-1 activity is exerted by alterations in the level of F2,6-BP. This compound is synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate by the bifunctional enzyme, PFK-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/F2,6-BPase).\r\n•\tPFK-2 contains two catalytic domains, one a kinase and the other a phosphatase, the activities of which are affected by the state of phosphorylation. The phosphatase domain is active when the enzyme is phosphorylated and converts F2,6-BP back to F6-P, thereby reducing the levels of this powerful activator of PFK-1.\r\n•\tThus, although the activity f PFK-2 will determine the rate of activity of PFK-1, it is itself not the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. \r\n",

This leads to an increase in glucose usage with concomitant hypoglycemia. The deficit in the energy production from fatty acid oxidation, necessary for the liver to use other carbon sources, such as glycerol and amino acids, for gluconeogenesis further exacerbates the hypoglycemia.\r\n•\tNormally, hypoglycemia is accompanied by an increase in ketone formation from the increased oxidation of fatty acids. In MCAD deficiency there is a reduced level of fatty acid oxidation, hence near normal levels of ketones are detected in the serum.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n Human leukcocyte antigen (HLA) complex iron protein (HFE)\r\nRef– Read the text below\r\nSol:\r\n•\tHemochromatosis is defined as a disorder in iron metabolism that is characterized by excess iron absorption, saturation of iron-binding proteins, and deposition of hemosiderin in the tissues.\r\n•\tThe primary affected tissues are the liver, pancreas, and skin. Iron deposition in the liver leads to cirrhosis and in the pancreas causes diabetes.\r\n•\tThe excess iron deposition leads to bronze pigmentation of the organs and skin. In fact, the bronze skin pigmentation seen in hemochromatosis, coupled with the resulatant diabetes lead to the designation of this condition as bronze diabetes. The primary cause of hemochromatosis is the inheritance of an autosomal recessive allele.\r\n•\tThe locus causing hemochromatosis has been designated HFE and is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-1 gene. The gene encodes an alpha-chain protein with three immunoglobulinlike domains. This alpha-chain protein associates with beta-2-microglobulin.\r\n•\tNormal HFE has been shown to form a complex with the transferrin receptor and in so doing is thought to regulate the rate of iron transfer into cells. A mutation in HFE will therefore, lead to increased iron uptake and storage. The majority of hereditary hemochromatosis patients harbor a mutation in HFE that results in the substitution of Cys 282 for a Tyr.\r\n•\tThis mutation causes loss of conformation of one of the immunoglobulin domains in HFE. Another mutation found in HFE causes a change of His 68 to Asp. \r\n",

Apo B48 is synthesized from an mRNA that is transcribed from the apo B100 gene.\r\n•\tFollowing transcription, the mRNA is edited within the intestinal epithelium yielding the apo B48 transcript. Apo(a) is an apoprotein found disulfide bonded to apo B100.\r\n•\tThis then forms a complex with LDL, generating a novel lipoprotein particle identified as lipoprotein(a), Lp(a). Lp(a) has a strong resemblance to plasminogen and its presence in the circulation is highly correlated with premature coronary artery disease.\r\n•\tApo CII is present in chylomicrons, VLDLs, LDLs, IDLs, and HDLs and is necessary for the activation of endothelial cell LPL. Apo D is found exclusively with HDLs and is also associated with cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) activity.\r\n•\tApo E is found in chylomicrons,VLDLs, LDLs, IDLs, and HDLs. It is necessary for interaction of lipoprotein with the LDL-receptor (which is also referred to as the apo B100/apo E receptor).\r\n",

ER with aggregations of ribosomes is often called the rough ER because of its dense, speckled appearance. \r\n•\tProteins that are ultimately destined for the cytoplasm (e.g., hexokinase) do not have a special signal, and their translation is finished on free ribosomes void of any ER interaction. \r\n•\tProteins are typically translocated across the ER membrane into the lumen cotranslationally. N-linked glycosylation occurs in the ER. The ER plays a major role not only in protein synthesis but also in lipid biosynthesis. \r\n•\tIt may also function to sequester calcium from the cytoplasm by actively pumping calcium into the ER lumen (e.g., sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle).\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n Folate\r\nRef– Read the text below\r\nSol:\r\n•\tFolic acid is the vitamin component of tetrahydrofolate, THF. Folic acid is reduced within cells (principally the liver where it is stored) to THF through the action of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an NADPH-requiring enzyme.\r\n•\tThe function of THF derivatives is to carry and transfer various forms of one carbon units during biosynthetic reactions.\r\n•\tOne of the more important roles for THF is in the conversion of dUMP to dTMP catalyzed by thymidylate synthase, with the methyl group being donated by N5,N10-methylene-THF.\r\n•\tFolate deficiency results in complications nearly identical to those described for vitamin B12 deficiency.The most pronounced effect of folate deficiency on cellular processes is on DNA synthesis due to an impairment in dTMP synthesis. This leads to cell-cycle arrest in S-phase of rapidly proliferating cells, in particular hematopoietic cells.\r\n•\tDeficiencies in ascorbate, vitamin C , leads to defects in collagen processing and the disorder is identified as scurvy. Deficiencies in biotin are extremely rare but would manifest as hypoglycemia following fasting due to the role of biotin in gluconeogenesis at the pyruvate carboxylase step.\r\n•\tDeficiencies of niacin, B3, are characterized by the “3 Ds”: depression, dermatitis, and diarrhea and are associated with the condition known as pellagra. Deficiencies in thiamin cause constipation, appetite suppression, nausea as well as mental depression, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue.\r\n•\tChronic thiamin deficiency leads to more severe neurologic symptoms including ataxia, mental confusion, and loss of eye coordination. The severe thiamin deficiency disease known as beriberi is the result of a diet that is carbohydrate rich and thiamin deficient. An additional thiamin deficiency related disease is known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This disease is most commonly found in chronic alcoholics due to their poor dietetic lifestyles.\r\n",

A positive effector increases substrate binding.\r\n•\tThis is the case with cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase of the glycogen phosphorylase cascade. Cyclic AMP binds the regulatory subunit that dissociates from the catalytic subunit and thereby activates it. In the absence of cyclic AMP, the regulatory subunit tightly binds the catalytic subunit and inactivates the enzymes.\r\n•\tMany allosteric enzymes are often placed at the first, or committed, step of a metabolic pathway. The end product of the pathway then acts as a negative effector of the enzyme. This is called feedback inhibition.\r\n•\tAn allosteric enzyme does not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics.\r\n",
