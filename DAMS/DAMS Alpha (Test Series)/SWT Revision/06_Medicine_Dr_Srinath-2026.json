This noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is identical to\r\ncongestive cardiac pulmonary edema in its effect on the mechanical properties of the lung and on gas exchange. Just as in cardiac pulmonary edema, the increase in lung water associated with ARDS produces interstitial edema and alveolar collapse, and so the affected lung becomes stiff and the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference widens.\r\n-Unlike cardiac edema, however, the increase in lung water in ARDS occurs as a result of an increase in alveolar capillary permeability and is not due to an increase in hydrostatic forces.\r\n-In clinical practice, determination of pulmonary artery wedge pressure is the most helpful\r\ndiscriminant between ARDS and cardiac failure\r\n",

This leads to dehydration and can cause renal dysfunction due to tubular defect. It is associated with increased risk of renal calculi due to hypercalciuria. The same pump maintains endolymph concentration in the cochlea and leads to sensorineural deafness.\r\nRenal dysfunction with deafness in a young male can mimic Alport’s syndrome. But Alport’s syndrome causes recurrent hematuria (dysmorphic) due to glomerulonephritis and associated with Lens defect.\r\n",

If non-response, rescue medical therapies with anti-TNF biological therapy or cyclosporin can be considered. Alternatively, non-response to intravenous (IV) steroid therapy and rescue medical therapies require a surgical review for consideration of subtotal colectomy and ileostomy.

HBV replication is usually suppressed by HDV. Liver damage is believed to be due to HDV and persistent HDV replication in co-infected patients leads to higher annual rates of cirrhosis and HCC.

Accumalation of fluid in the pericardium, resulting in impaired filling of the cardiac chambers and equalises the pressure in all chambers. It also impedes the venous return. \r\nPatient presents with “Beck’s triad”: Tachycardia, hypotension and muffled heart sounds. \r\nPulsus Paradoxus and Kussmaul’s sign maybe present in both tamponade and constrictive\r\npericarditis. Hence differentiation is based on Echocardiography. The diastolic collapse of the RV to the increased pressure in the pericardial cavity is pathognomic of the disease.\r\nTreatment is emergency therapeutic pericardiocentesis with a favourable prognosis. \r\nTamponade not relieved  by pericardiocentesis is often lethal.\r\n",
