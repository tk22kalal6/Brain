Cellular oxidation reactions require the net transfer of electrons to an electron acceptor, such as NAD+, to yield NADH. The electrons of NADH are consumed in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) to drive ATP synthesis, coupling cellular oxidation reactions to oxidative phosphorylation. Since cytosolic NADH cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane directly, reducing equivalents from NADH are indirectly transported to the mitochondrial matrix via the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) or directly to the ETC via the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle. Both shuttles regenerate cytosolic NAD+ to sustain cytosolic oxidative pathways such as glycolysis.",

It is located mainly on the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it interacts strongly to control many integral membrane proteins in a manner that is determined by its physical and structural properties, but it also regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contact sites. In summary, it is involved in the biogenesis, morphology and stability of mitochondrial cristae, in mitochondrial quality control and dynamics through fission and fusion, and in innumerable aspects of mitochondrial metabolism. Bioenergetic processes, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and β oxidation of fatty acids, are performed within the matrix.",

First described by Dr. Edgar Von Gierke in 1929, GSD I results from mutations affecting glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity, leading to excessive glycogen accumulation in the liver and kidneys. This disruption causes severe fasting hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatomegaly. The primary subtypes of GSD I are GSD Ia, caused by G6Pase deficiency due to mutations in the G6PC gene, and GSD Ib, resulting from mutations in the SLC37A4 gene, which affects glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT). While GSD Ia primarily affects glucose metabolism, GSD Ib also leads to neutropenia and increased infection risk due to impaired neutrophil function. ",

However, apart from insulin itself, various other factors may also affect glucose regulation in diabetes . One of these factors may be the dysregulation of glucagon upon pancreatic α-cell dysfunction . By enhancing gluconeogenesis in the liver, glucagon levels are elevated upon fasting to prevent hypoglycemia . The secretory mechanism of glucagon from α-cells has been proposed to be regulated by insulin concentrations from β-cells, which are located closely to α-cells . From a theoretical view, when insulin secretion increases after meals, glucagon secretion must be suppressed . However, this mechanism appears to be dysregulated in diabetic patients who show relatively higher postprandial glucagon levels than normal subjects .",

The ROS generated by NADPH oxidases have crucial roles in various physiological processes, including innate immunity, modulation of redox-dependent signalling cascades, and as cofactors in the production of hormones.\r\nNOX enzymes are a family of transmembrane proteins comprising seven members (NOX1-NOX5 and DUOX1 and DUOX2), each with a specific tissue distribution and activation mechanism. They catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide anion, which in turn reacts quickly to generate other ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide. Although basic NOX activity is crucial for normal physiology, overshooting activity of NOX enzymes leads to disease",

However, three steps require bypassing since they are performed by irreversible enzymatic reactions. The first irreversible step requires two reactions, the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase in the mitochondria followed by the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate by PEP carboxykinase in the cytosol. The second irreversible step is the conversion of fructose-1,6-biphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the cytosol. The final step is the dephosphorylation of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum. \r\n",

Furthermore, other family members have suffered early myocardial infarctions in their 30s.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThis patient’s presentation is consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, which is treated with either ethanol or fomepizole. \r\n\r\nChildren are at risk of ethylene glycol toxicity as ethylene glycol is a sweet, odorless liquid that is commonly found in homes. The ethylene glycol metabolite glycolic acid is toxic to the kidneys. Glycolic acid is eventually metabolized to oxalic acid, which forms calcium oxalate crystals that cause systemic damage. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning include ethanol and fomepizole. Ethanol has a higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase than ethylene glycol and this competitive inhibition slows the production of ethylene glycol metabolites. Fomepizole is also an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. While fomepizole has fewer side effects than ethanol, it is much more expensive and less readily available. ",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n  \r\nThis patient presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of gallstone cholestasis, which is associated with malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins. The only water soluble vitamin in this list is vitamin C, which causes scurvy when deficient. \r\n\r\nVitamins are classified into the water soluble and fat soluble classes depending on their relative partition between oil and water layers. The important distinction to be aware of in this case is that fat soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) require bile mediated fat micelle formation in order to be properly absorbed. Any prolonged episode of cholestasis can therefore cause malabsorption of these vitamins and in time lead to the associated deficiency syndromes that are discussed in the incorrect answers section. \r\n\r\nThe key to approaching a question about abdominal pain is first to localize the syndrome to a quadrant of the abdomen. In this case, the pain is in the right upper quadrant and therefore the differential to consider are liver conditions such as hepatitis and gallbladder disease such as cholecystitis, cholestasis, and cholangitis. The combination of postprandial pain and squeezing pain is referred to as colic and is associated with obstruction of a hollow tube such as the bile duct system. This diagnosis is supported by pruritus and light colored stools due to retention of bile acids. There are no infectious symptoms in this case, but it is important to be aware of Charcot's triad of fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice and is highly suggestive of infectious cholangitis\r\n",

Deficiency of this fat-soluble vitamin is rare, but can be caused by diseases that cause fat malabsorption such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and abetalipoproteinemia. \r\n\r\nVitamin E deficiency is uncommon due to the abundance of tocopherols in the typical diet--even patients consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet are not at risk for this condition. The typical patient has impaired absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K); conditions that may cause this include pancreatic insufficiency, Crohn and celiac diseases, cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis, cholestatic liver disease, and small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the microsomal transfer protein (MTP) gene. This loss-of-function mutation in MTP prevents assembly of apoB in the liver and intestine, leading to the absence of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins such as LDL and VLDL and impaired transport of fat-soluble vitamins. \r\n",

The excess fructose-6-phosphate is either degraded by other metabolic pathways or is excreted in the urine as fructose.
