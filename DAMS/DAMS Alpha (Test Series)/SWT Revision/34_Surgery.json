Primary end-to-end anastomosis is preferable if this can be accomplished without tension. When 5 cm of artery has been destroyed, it is impossible to perform a tension-free primary anastomosis, and a reversed saphenous vein graft is the repair of choice. Ligation of the artery cannot be done as it will lead to gangrene and limb loss. The use of prosthetic material (Dacron or PTFE) in a potentially infected field is also to be avoided as infection at the suture line often leads to delayed hemorrhage. Harvesting an arterial graft of similar diameter from elsewhere in the body is hazardous and unnecessary when vein is available.\r\n",

In this group of patients, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be useful.\r\n\r\n•\tDPL involves making a small midline incision below the umbilicus and using a needle and small catheter to aspirate intraperitoneal fluid to assess for blood or bile. \r\n\r\n•\tIf the aspirate (DPA) is found to contain 10 mL of gross blood or bile, an exploratory laparotomy is indicated.

This lesion needs to be fixed immediately. With continuing negative pressure in the chest, each breath sucks more of the abdominal contents into the chest and increases the likelihood of vascular compromise of the herniated viscera. While the diaphragm is easily fixed from the left chest, this injury should be approached from the abdomen. The possibility of injury below the diaphragm after sufficient blunt injury to rupture the diaphragm mandates examination of the intraabdominal solid and hollow viscera; adequate exposure of the diaphragm to allow secure repair is possible from this approach.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approach to management of duodenal injuries depends on the location of the injury and the amount of tissue destruction. Hematomas of the duodenal wall will often resolve without intervention and are an issue only if they cause a gastric outlet obstruction. Treatment of obstructing hematomas consists of gastric decompression, initiation of total parenteral nutrition, and reevaluation of gastric emptying with a contrast study after 5 to 7 days. If the duodenal obstruction persists after approximately 14 days, operative exploration is warranted to evacuate hematoma, evaluate for perforation, stricture, or associated pancreatic injury. Hematomas will frequently decompress spontaneously during mobilization of the duodenum and the intestinal wall should then be evaluated for injury. Duodenal hematomas identified incidentally during laparotomy should not be intentionally opened unless there is a concern for full-thickness injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/28(48).png\" style=\"height:107px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\n An open pneumothorax happens when air builds up in the pleural cavity, due to a hole in the chest wall. It differs from a closed pneumothorax, during which air enters the pleural cavity from the lungs themselves. An open pneumothorax can occur as a result of direct trauma or could be iatrogenic.\r\nAn open pneumothorax is treated by applying a three-way dressing to the wound, which involves taping the dressing on only three of the edges. The intent is to prevent the individual from breathing in air through the opening in the chest wall while allowing them to exhale air from their lungs. An inserted chest tube will further assist the individual in breathing. If the dressing is not properly applied, and it allows air into the chest space without allowing it to escape, a tension pneumothorax may develop.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C) Superior pulmonary sulcus tumors, also called Pancoast tumors, arise from the apical pleuropulmonary groove located superior to the first rib. When these tumors involve the surrounding structures such as the brachial plexus, cervical paravertebral sympathetic nervous system, and stellate ganglion, they cause a group of signs and symptoms that are collectively called Pancoast syndrome. This is characterized by ipsilateral shoulder and arm pain, paresthesias, paresis and atrophy of the thenar muscles of the hand, and Horner&#39;s syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis). Pancoast syndrome refers to the collective group of symptoms associated with these tumors, which is secondary to the involvement of brachial plexus and associated chest wall, vertebral, or rib pain. Shoulder or arm pain with associated paresthesias along the medial half of the fourth, fifth fingers and medial side of the hand, arm, and forearm due to C8 through T1 radiculopathy are usually primary symptoms associated. Since they are apically located, pulmonary symptoms of shortness of breath do not develop until later, as the tumor begins to involve more of the lung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">Physical examination findings include ipsilateral facial flushing and sweating due to the involvement of the sympathetic trunk and cervical ganglion.

An umbilical pyogenic granuloma is a common, benign abnormality in neonates. It develops within the first few weeks of life and should not be present at birth. It forms from excess granulation tissue persisting at the base of the umbilicus after cord separation. Umbilical granulomas often appear pedunculated and can secrete a small amount of serous or serosanguineous drainage. Conventional management has been to dry the umbilical stump and carefully cauterize the granuloma with a 75 percent silver nitrate stick.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThis radiograph of a child with a scaphoid abdomen and respiratory disease is characteristic of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. These defects are posterolateral and occur from failure of the embryologic diaphragm to fuse between the eighth and twelfth weeks of intrauterine life. The size of the defect does not correlate with the symptoms. Even a large diaphragmatic hernia can be missed on prenatal sonogram if the abdominal contents have slipped back into the abdomen at the time of the study. Hernias of Morgagni are anteromedial and do not present as emergencies at birth. Any abdominal organ— pancreas, kidney, small and large intestine, stomach, liver, or spleen—can herniate into the chest. The abdominal organ acts as a space-occupying lesion and retards growth of the lung, which results in pulmonary hypoplasia. Respiratory problems at birth stem from primary pulmonary hypertension, the consequence of hypoplasia, rather than from compression of the lung by abdominal contents. Most experts recommend stabilizing the pulmonary hypertensive crisis medically or with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) prior to attempting repair.\r\n",

Common in immunodeficiency syndrome, autoimmune disease, carcinoma, or another systemic disorder\r\n\r\n•\tThere is inadequate killing of bacteria by macrophages due to defective phagolysosomal activity.\r\n\r\n•\tIt is more common in immunosuppressed, DM, Lymphoma and Rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n\r\n•\tIt is hypothesized that bacteria or bacterial fragments form the nidus for the calcium phosphate crystals that laminate the Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. \r\n\r\n•\tThe diagnosis is made by biopsy.

USG shows key hole sign (Prenatal diagnosis can be made on USG after 28 weeks)\r\nEndoscopic fulguration is treatment of choice\r\nIn deranged renal function or urinary ascites Vasicostomy is best (Blockson’s technique)\r\n\r\nPosterior urethral valve is most common obstructive urethral lesion in male child. It occurs only male child and is present at the distal prostatic urethra. Most common type is type 1 (Below Veru Montanum). Presents with obstructive urinary symptom, distended bladder, severe hydroureteronephrosis, urinary ascites, VUR and renal failure. Associated oligohydroamnios may be found in severe cases.\r\nMCU (Micturating custourethragram or voiding cystourethragram) is the best investigation. \r\n USG: Detects large volume bladder with trabaculation, hydroureter and hydronephrosis. It may show dilated posterior urethra and can be used, in-utero, to detect urethral valves (as aerly as 28 weeks).\r\nCystoscopy: The valves are difficult to see at cystoscopy, because irrigating fluid sweeps them into open position.\r\nTreatment: Cystoscopic fugulration is the treatment of choice. If in a newborn, Bladder is excessively dilated with complete atony and presence of hydrouretronephrosis, first stage diversion may be done by vesicostomy or uretrostomy.\r\nPulonary hypoplasia is most common cause of death\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nThis is type I choledochal cyst which is the commonest type (>85%)\r\nFive major types are (Todani):\r\n\r\n•\tType I cysts are the most common and represent 80-90% of choledochal cysts. They consist of saccular or fusiform dilatations of the common bile duct, which involve either a segment of the duct or the entire duct. \r\n•\tType II choledochal cysts appear as an isolated diverticulum protruding from the wall of the common bile duct. \r\n•\tType III choledochal cysts arise from the intraduodenal portion of the common bile duct (choledochocele).\r\n\r\nThe surgical management for each choledochal cyst type is described as follows:\r\n•\tType I: Complete excision of cyst followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.\r\n•\tType II: Complete excision of the dilated diverticulum comprising a type II choledochal cyst; the resultant defect in the common bile duct is closed over a T-tube\r\n•\tType III (choledochocele): choledochoceles measuring 3 cm or less can be treated effectively with endoscopic sphincterotomy, whereas lesions larger than 3 cm are excised surgically via a transduodenal approach.\r\n•\tType IV: Complete excision of the dilated extrahepatic duct, followed by a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy to restore continuity.\r\n•\tType V (Caroli disease): Hepatic lobectomy for disease limited to one hepatic lobe (left lobe usually affected); patients with bilobar disease manifesting signs of liver failure, biliary cirrhosis, or portal hypertension may require liver transplantation\r\n•\tLilly technique: When the cyst adheres densely to the portal vein secondary to long-standing inflammatory reaction, it may not be possible to perform a complete, full-thickness excision of the cyst; the Lilly technique allows the serosal surface of the duct to be left adhering to the portal vein, while the mucosa of the cyst wall is obliterated by curettage or cautery—theoretically, this removes the risk of malignant transformation in that segment of the duct\r\n",
