A heart rate of 130 bpm indicates effective resuscitation. Chest compressions and epinephrine are only indicated if the heart rate remains &lt;60 bpm despite adequate ventilation and chest compressions.\r\n",

Exudative pharyngitis and generalized lymphadenopathy are more suggestive of viral infections. Fever in Kawasaki disease is typically persistent, often exceeding 5 days.\r\n",
