Some premature infants in whom severe IVH develops may have acute deterioration on the 2nd or 3rd day of life. Hypotension, apnea, pallor, or cyanosis; poor suck; abnormal eye signs; a high-pitched, shrill cry; convulsions, or decreased muscle tone; metabolic acidosis; shock; and a decreased hematocrit or failure of the hematocrit to increase after transfusion may be the first clinical indications. IVH may rarely manifest at birth; 50% of cases are diagnosed within the 1st day of life, and up to 75% within the 1st 3 days. A small percentage of infants have late hemorrhage, between days 14 and 30. IVH as a primary event is rare after the 1st mo of life.",

All at-risk infants should undergo follow-up ultrasonography at 36-40 wk of postmenstrual age to evaluate adequately for PVL, because cystic changes related to perinatal injury may not be visible for at least 2-4 wk. In one study, 29% of low-birthweight (LBW) infants who later experienced cerebral palsy did not have radiographic evidence of PVL until after 28 days of age.\r\n\r\nUltrasonography also detects the precystic and cystic symmetric lesions of PVL and the asymmetric intraparenchymal echogenic lesions of cortical hemorrhagic infarction. Furthermore, the delayed development of cortical atrophy, porencephaly, and the severity, progression, or regression of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus can be determined by serial ultrasonographic examinations.",

Kangaroo position\r\n\r\n• The kangaroo position consists of skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between the mother and the infant in a vertical position, between the mother’s breasts and under her clothes\r\n\r\n• The provider must keep herself in a semi- reclining position to avoid the gastric reflux in the infant\r\n\r\n• The kangaroo position is maintained until the infant no longer tolerates it- as indicated by sweating in the baby or baby refusing to stay in KMC position\r\n\r\n• When continuous care is not possible, the kangaroo position can be used intermittently, providing the proven emotional and breastfeeding promotion benefits\r\n\r\n• The kangaroo position must be offered for as long as possible (but at least 1-2 hr/sitting), provided the infant tolerates it well.\r\n\r\n2. Kangaroo nutrition\r\n\r\n• Kangaroo nutrition is the delivery of nutrition to “kangarooed” infants as soon as oral feeding is possible.\r\n\r\n• Goal is to provide exclusive or nearly exclusive breastfeeding with fortification, if needed.\r\n\r\n3. Kangaroo discharge and follow up\r\n\r\n• Early home discharge in the kangaroo position from the neonatal unit is one of the original components of the KMC intervention.\r\n\r\n• Mothers at home require adequate support and follow up hence a follow-up program and access to emergency services must be ensured.",

Galactosemia, fructosemia, tyrosinosis, and glucose-6- phosphatase deficiency represent diseases in which a congenital deficiency of enzyme causes an interruption of a normal metabolic pathway and an accumulation of metabolic precursors that damage vital organs. Galactose (found in milk) and fructose (found in fruit juices) produce urinary-reducing substances in their respective disorders. The mode of inheritance of galactosemia, fructosemia, and most forms of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is autosomal recessive. In galactosemia and fructosemia, errors in carbohydrate metabolism cause the accumulation of toxic metabolites when specific dietary sugars are introduced (lactose in galactosemia; fructose and sucrose in fructosemia). Exclusion of the offending carbohydrate from the diet will prevent liver damage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by an inability to absorb sufficient zinc from the diet. The genetic defect is in the intestinal zinc specific transporter gene SLC39A4. Initial signs and symptoms usually occur in the 1st few months of life, often after weaning from breast milk to cow's milk. The cutaneous eruption consists of vesiculobullous, eczematous, dry, scaly, or psoriasiform skin lesions symmetrically distributed in the perioral, acral, and perineal areas and on the cheeks, knees, and elbows. The hair often has a peculiar, reddish tint, and alopecia of some degree is characteristic. Ocular manifestations include photophobia, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and corneal dystrophy detectable by slit-lamp examination. Associated manifestations include chronic diarrhea, stomatitis, glossitis, paronychia, nail dystrophy, growth retardation, irritability, delayed wound healing, intercurrent bacterial infections, and superinfection with Candida albicans. Lymphocyte function and free radical scavenging are impaired. Without treatment, the course is chronic and intermittent but often relentlessly progressive. When the disease is less severe, only growth retardation and delayed development may be apparent",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nd-Transposition of the great arteries is a medical emergency. Cyanosis and tachypnea are most often recognized within the 1st hours or days of life. If it is not treated, the vast majority of these infants would not survive the neonatal period. Hypoxemia is usually moderate to severe, depending on the degree of atrial level shunting and whether the ductus is partially open or totally closed. Infants who remain severely hypoxic or acidotic despite prostaglandin infusion should undergo Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy. A successful Rashkind atrial septostomy should result in a rise in PaO2 to 35-50 mm Hg and elimination of any pressure gradient across the atrial septum. Some patients with\r\n\r\nTGA and VSD may require balloon atrial septostomy because of poor mixing, even though the VSD is large. If the VSD associated with d-TGA is small, the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment are similar to those described previously for transposition with an intact ventricular septum.\r\n\r\nWhen the VSD is large and not restrictive to ventricular ejection, significant mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood usually occurs and clinical manifestations of cardiac failure are seen. The degree of cyanosis may be subtle and sometimes may not be recognized until an oxygen saturation measurement is performed. The physiology of l-TGA is quite different from that of d-TGA. The double inversion of the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial relationships result in desaturated right atrial blood appropriately flowing to the lungs and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood appropriately flowing to the aorta. The circulation is thus physiologically \"corrected.\" Without other defects, the hemodynamics would be nearly normal.",

In this example, the child had pulmonary atresia without a corresponding VSD; another example would have been transposition of the great vessels without a septal defect to allow mixing of oxygenated and non-oxygenated blood. Cyanotic infants who do not improve their saturations with supplemental oxygen should be evaluated carefully for structural heart disease. The ductus arteriosis typically closes in the first few hours of life; thus, these children will develop their cyanosis in the same time frame. Prostaglandin E1 will help keep the ductus patent until a surgical procedure can be performed. PGE1 does have the tendency to cause hypoventilation, so arrangements must be made for a potential artificial airway if necessary. Indomethacin closes a patent ductus arteriosis. Adenosine is used for supraventricular tachycardia.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C) TOF. In older children with unrepaired tetralogy, dyspnea occurs on exertion. They may play actively for a short time and then sit or lie down. Older children may be able to walk a block or so before stopping to rest. Characteristically, children assume a squatting position for the relief of dyspnea caused by physical effort; the child is usually able to resume physical activity after a few minutes of squatting. These findings occur most often in patients with significant cyanosis at rest. Paroxysmal hypercyanotic attacks (hypoxic, &quot;blue,&quot; or &quot;tet&quot; spells) are a particular problem during the 1st 2 years of life. The infant becomes hyperpneic and restless, cyanosis increases, gasping respirations ensue, and syncope may follow. The spells occur most frequently in the morning on initially awakening or after episodes of vigorous crying. Temporary disappearance or a decrease in intensity of the systolic murmur is usual as flow across the right ventricular outflow tract diminishes. The spells may last from a few minutes to a few hours. Short episodes are followed by generalized weakness and sleep. Severe spells may progress to unconsciousness and, occasionally, to convulsions or hemiparesis. The onset is usually spontaneous and unpredictable.</p>\r\n",

The early stages of cerebritis and abscess formation are associated with nonspecific symptoms, including low-grade fever, headache, and lethargy.

These features include the young age group affected, epidemics with wavelike geographic spread of illness, the self-limited nature of the acute febrile illness, and the combination of clinical features fever, rash, enanthem, conjunctival injection, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Further evidence of an infectious trigger includes the infrequent occurrence of the illness in infants younger than 3 mo, likely the result of maternal antibodies, and the virtual absence of cases in adults, likely the result of prior exposures with subsequent immunity. Nonetheless, it is unusual to have multiple cases present at the same time within a family or daycare center. A genetic role in the pathogenesis of KD seems likely, as evidenced by the higher risk of KD in Asian children regardless of country of residence and in siblings and children of individuals with a history of KD.

The radiography shows the typical “thumb” sign of a swollen epiglottis. Epiglottitis is a life-threatening form of infection-produced upper airway obstruction. The course of the illness is brief and prodromal symptoms are lacking. The patient experiences a sudden onset of sore throat, high fever, and prostration that is out of proportion to the duration of the illness. Drooling and difficulty in swallowing, a muffled voice, and preference for a characteristic sitting posture with the neck hyperextended may be noted. Radiography of the neck, which may delay definitive treatment, is often avoided.",

For mildly ill children who do not require hospitalization, amoxicillin is recommended.

Therapeutic alternatives include cefuroxime axetil and amoxicillin/clavulanate. For school-aged children and in children in whom infection with M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae is suggested, a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin is an appropriate choice. In adolescents, a respiratory fluoroquinolone\r\n(levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin) may be considered as an alternative. The empirical treatment of suspected bacterial pneumonia in a hospitalized child requires an approach based on the clinical manifestations at the time of presentation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nP. aeruginosa causes low morbidity in burn patients\r\n\r\nP. aeruginosa is a classic opportunist. It rarely causes disease in people who do not have a predisposing risk factor. The surfaces of burns or wounds are frequently populated by Pseudomonas and other gram-negative organisms; this initial colonization with a low number of adherent organisms is a necessary prerequisite to invasive disease. P. aeruginosa colonization of a burn site may develop into burn wound sepsis, which has a high mortality rate. P. aeruginosa is common in children with cystic fibrosis, with a prevalence that increases with increasing age and severity of pulmonary disease. Initial infection may be caused by nonmucoid strains of P. aeruginosa, but after a variable period of time, mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa that produce the antiphagocytic exopolysaccharide alginate, which are rarely encountered in other conditions predominate. Repeated isolation of mucoid P. aeruginosa from the sputum is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The infection begins insidiously or even asymptomatically, and the progression has a highly variable pace. In children with cystic fibrosis, antibody does not eradicate the organism and antibiotics are only partially effective; thus, after infection becomes chronic it cannot be completely eradicated. Repeated courses of antibiotics select for P. aeruginosa strains that are highly antibiotic resistant.",

Complete or incomplete intestinal obstruction by viscid faecal material in the terminal ileum and proximal colon - distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) - is a common complication in cystic fibrosis. Estimates of prevalence range from 5 to 12 episodes per 1000 patients per year in children, with higher rates reported in adults. DIOS is mainly seen in patients with pancreatic insufficiency, positive history of meconium ileus and previous episodes of DIOS. DIOS is being described with increasing frequency following organ transplantation. Diagnosis is based on suggestive symptoms with a right lower quadrant mass confirmed on X-ray. The main differential is chronic constipation. Treatment consists of rehydration combined with stool softening laxatives or gut lavage with balanced electrolyte solutions. Rapid fluid shifts have been described following osmotic agents. Avoiding dehydration and optimizing pancreatic enzyme dosage may reduce the chance of further episodes. Prophylactic laxative therapy is widely used, but is not evidence-based.",

With newborn screening, diagnosis is often made prior to obvious clinical manifestations such as failure to thrive and chronic cough. Diagnostic criteria have been recommended to include additional testing procedures. More than 60 mEq/L of chloride in sweat is diagnostic of CF when 1 or more other criteria are present. Threshold levels of 30-40 mEq/L for infants have been suggested. Borderline (or intermediate) values of 40 to 60 mEq/L have been reported in patients of all ages who have CF with atypical involvement and require further testing. Chloride concentrations in sweat are somewhat lower in individuals who retain exocrine pancreatic function but usually remain within the diagnostic range. The finding of increased potential differences across nasal epithelium, the loss of this difference with topical amiloride application, and the absence of a voltage response to a ß-adrenergic agonist have been used to confirm the diagnosis of CF in patients with equivocal or frankly normal sweat chloride values. An alternative test is DNA testing; the patient must have two mutations identified (over 1500 mutations are associated with CF, one of which is  DeltaF508 mutation).",

In AIDS patients with very few CD4+ T cells, the onset of hypoxia and symptoms is subtle, with tachypnea progressing to nasal flaring, often without fever; intercostal, suprasternal, and infrasternal retractions; and cyanosis in severe cases. The chest radiograph reveals bilateral diffuse alveolar disease with a granular pattern. The earliest densities are perihilar, and progression proceeds peripherally, sparing the apical areas until last. Definitive diagnosis of P. jiroveci pneumonia requires demonstration of P. jiroveci in the lung in the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of the infection. Organisms can be detected in specimens collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal aspirate, transbronchial lung biopsy, bronchial brushings, percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration, and open lung biopsy. Hypertonic saline–induced sputum samples are helpful if P. jiroveci is found, but the absence of the organisms in induced sputum does not exclude the infection and BAL should be performed. Open-lung biopsy is the most reliable method, although BAL is more practical in most cases. Estimates of the diagnostic yield of the various specimens are 20-40% for induced sputum, 50-60% for tracheal aspirate, 75-95% for BAL, 75-85% for transbronchial biopsy, and 90-100% for open lung biopsy.",

Thus, it is unusual for patients to manifest signs of adrenal insufficiency such as hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Approximately 65% of patients become hypertensive, although this can take several years to develop. Hypertension is probably a consequence of elevated levels of deoxycorticosterone, which has mineralocorticoid activity. Infants may transiently develop signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency after treatment with hydrocortisone is instituted. This is presumably from sudden suppression of deoxycorticosterone secretion in a patient with atrophy of the zona glomerulosa caused by chronic suppression of renin activity.

It has been linked to mutations in many genes including CACNB4; CLNC2; EJM2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9; GABRA1; GABRD; and Myoclonin1/EFHC1. Typically, it starts in early adolescence with 1 or more of the following manifestations: myoclonic jerks in the morning, often causing the patient to drop things; generalized tonic&ndash; clonic or clonic&ndash;tonic&ndash;clonic seizures upon awakening; and juvenile absences. Sleep deprivation, alcohol (in older patients), and photic stimulation, or, rarely, certain cognitive activities can act as precipitants.

It is an acute necrotizing infection generally involving the frontal and/or temporal cortex and the limbic system and, beyond the neonatal period, is almost always caused by HSV-1. The infection may manifest as nonspecific findings, including fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, nausea, vomiting, generalized seizures, and alteration of consciousness. Injury to the frontal or temporal cortex or limbic system may produce findings more indicative of HSV encephalitis, including anosmia, memory loss, peculiar behavior, expressive aphasia and other changes in speech, hallucinations, and focal seizures. The untreated infection progresses to coma and death in 75% of cases. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically shows a moderate number of mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, a mildly elevated protein concentration, a normal or slightly decreased glucose concentration, and often a moderate number of erythrocytes.",
