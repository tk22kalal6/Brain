This is the pressure of tracheal mucosal capillaries. \r\n•\tBevel of the tip always faces left in an endotracheal tube and it improves visualization of vocal cords during intubation.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\n•\tAfter induction of anesthesia, including a muscle relaxant, maintaining pre-oxygenation and some ventilation is of paramount importance to avoid hypoxia. \r\n•\tEspecially in larger individuals, redundant tissue may make positive pressure ventilation difficult. \r\n•\tOnce the face mask fails to provide an adequate seal, an LMA is a good choice to provide a seal further down the airway.\r\n•\tThe LMA is designed to create a seal around the larynx to allow positive pressure ventilation up to a certain pressure, which can vary between patients and the design of the LMA. \r\n•\tOnce the patient's saturation begins to fall, swift and decisive action such as inserting an LMA will help to prevent further hypoxia.\r\n•\tIn addition to bypassing facial features, missing teeth, and full beards, LMAs can also be useful to slide past redundant pharyngeal tissues which might obstruct the upper airway.\r\n•\tLMA's have different designs and features, such as silicone cuffs, gastric access ports, non-inflatable gel cuffs. \r\n•\t2nd generation LMAs often provide higher seal pressure to allow for higher positive pressure ventilation pressures and are preferred in a rescue situation. \r\n•\tLMA's, preferably 2nd generation, should be immediately available during induction of anesthesia if airway rescue becomes necessary.\r\n",

This rapid change in end-tidal volatile, rather than a slow titration, can increase HR and BP transiently.\r\n•\tIn this patient with a history of CAD, sympathetic stimulation should be avoided to prevent further ischemia.\r\n•\tWhile desflurane is a malignant hyperthermia triggering agent, it is unlikely given the patient's modest elevation in EtCO2, which is more likely explained by his history of OSA. The elevation in HR and BP are non-specific, and it would be much more likely to malignant hyperthermia with a much more rapid elevation in EtCO2. \r\n•\tThe non-specific nature of isolated tachycardia and hypertension are much more commonly associated with rapid titration of desflurane as opposed to MH in this scenario. \r\n•\tInadequate depth of anesthesia certainly presents as hypertension and tachycardia. However, it is much less likely in this scenario where the patient has no surgical stimulation yet as the prep is ongoing, and it has been 10 minutes since the stimulation of placing the LMA occurred. \r\n•\tIn addition, the patient's MAC is > 1, which is more than adequate given the lack of stimulation at this time. In fact, it is because of the rapid titration of the volatile agent desflurane which likely led to the tachycardia and hypertension. \r\n•\tAllergic or anaphylactic reactions are common with steroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs as well as perioperative antibiotics. \r\n•\tHowever, it is much more commonly associated with hypotension, tachycardia, and increased peak airway pressures. \r\n•\tThe Etiology of this patient's tachycardia and hypertension are much more likely caused by sympathetic stimulation from desflurane. The mechanism by which the sympathetic stimulation occurs is not fully understood, but rapid titration tends to increase the incidence of stimulation.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n•\tThe oculocardiac reflex (OCR), also known as the Aschner reflex or trigeminovagal reflex (TVR), was first described in 1908 as a reduction in heart rate secondary to direct pressure placed on the eyeball. \r\n•\tIt is defined by a decrease in heart rate by greater than 20% following globe pressure or traction of the extraocular muscles. \r\n•\tThe reflex most commonly results in sinus bradycardia. However, it also has a reported association with reduced arterial pressure, arrhythmia, asystole, and even cardiac arrest. \r\n•\tThis reflex has most notably been depicted during ophthalmologic procedures, more specifically during strabismus surgery; however, it also may be activated by facial trauma, regional anesthetic nerve blocks, and during mechanical stimulation.\r\n•\tPaediatric patients are also more susceptible to the detrimental consequences of this reflex secondary to having a greater dependency on heart rate to maintain cardiac output.\r\n\r\nRisk Factors\r\nTRIGGERING STIMULI: \r\n1.\ttraction to the extraocular muscles (most common)\r\n2.\tdirect pressure to the globe\r\n3.\tocular manipulation\r\n4.\tocular pain\r\n\r\nAnatomy and Physiology\r\n•\tThe OCR arc consists of an afferent and efferent limb. \r\n•\tThe trigeminal nerve, otherwise known as the fifth cranial nerve, serves as the sensory afferent limb. The vagus nerve, also known as cranial nerve ten, comprises the efferent limb of the OCR. \r\n•\tThe pathway is initiated by activation of stretch receptors in the ocular and periorbital tissues. \r\n•\tThe short and long ciliary nerves conduct impulses that carry the sensory message to the ciliary ganglion. From there the impulses are transported by way of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to the Gasserian ganglion, followed by the trigeminal nucleus, where the afferent limb will terminate in the central nervous system (CNS). \r\n•\tThis stimulates the efferent limb, causing impulses to exit the brainstem and transmit to the myocardium to synapse as the sinoatrial node and activate the vagal motor response. \r\n•\tThe resultant effects include negative chronotropy, leading to bradycardia.\r\nCOMPLICATIONS\r\nThe complications secondary to the OCR are related to the vagal responses and may include the following:\r\n1.\tSinus bradycardia\r\n2.\tArrhythmia\r\n3.\tReduced atrial pressure.\r\n4.\tVentricular tachycardia\r\n5.\tVentricular fibrillation\r\n6.\tMultifocal premature ventricular contractions\r\n7.\tVentricular bigeminy\r\n8.\tAsystole\r\n9.\tCardiac arrest\r\n10.\tDizziness\r\n11.\tLight-headedness\r\n12.\tNausea\r\n13.\tWeakness\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n•\tOnly definitive treatment is the immediate cessation of the triggering stimulus.\r\n•\tIntravenous atropine has been shown to cause vagolysis and increase the heart rate in an event of OCR.\r\n",

It is the primary drug used for the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia.\r\n•\tMalignant hyperthermia is triggered in susceptible individuals primarily by inhalational anesthetic agents and the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. \r\n•\tMalignant hyperthermia is not an allergy but an inherited disorder.

Her baseline vitals were recorded; the blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, the heart rate was 86/min, and the cardiac monitor showed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient was maintained in an upright sitting position. The anesthesia was induced via a 25 G Quincke cutting needle inserted at L4-5 interspinous space. The subarachnoid space was at a depth of about six cms from the skin surface, and it was confirmed by the presence of clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dripping from the needle. The syringe containing the recommended standard dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine was attached to the spinal needle. The anesthesiologist overlooked the step to re-aspirate CSF into the needle and proceeded with the intrathecal administration of the drug. After completion of the injection, blood-tinged fluid dripped from the back of the spinal needle. Early in labor, the patient suddenly developed hypotension and was immediately administered with a suitable vasopressor. Soon after, the ECG showed an abnormal rhythm.

Failure to aspirate the clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after attaching the syringe to the spinal needle demands to reposition the needle, and it is a crucial step while performing the saddle block anesthesia.\r\n•\tBupivacaine is a cardiotoxic drug. The inadvertent intravascular injection can produce very high serum drug levels.\r\n•\tThe high serum levels of bupivacaine affect the cardiovascular system by causing hypotension, depressed cardiac contractility, and arrhythmias.\r\n•\tThe total spinal block causes motor paralysis that presents as upper extremity weakness and respiratory depression which requires emergent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. \r\n•\tA traumatic neuraxial block may cause epidural hematoma that causes sharp back and leg pain accompanied by lower extremity motor weakness. \r\n•\tCauda equina syndrome is caused by compression or damage to nerve roots and has a presentation similar to epidural hematoma.\r\n",
