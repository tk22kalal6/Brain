      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)<br><br>Canalicular<br>Normal fetal alveolar development occurs in the following stages:<br><br>●Embryonic period – At approximately 26 days gestation, the embryonic stage begins with the first appearance of the fetal lung, which appears as a protrusion of the foregut. The initial branching of the lung occurs at 33 days gestation forming the prospective main bronchi, which begin to extend into the mesenchyme. Further branching forms the segmental bronchi as the lung enters the next stage of development.<br><br>●Pseudoglandular stage – In the pseudoglandular stage (5th to 16th weeks of gestation), 15 to 20 generations of airway branching occur starting from the main segmental bronchi and ending as terminal bronchioles. At the end of the pseudoglandular stage, the airways are surrounded by a loosely packed mesenchyme, which includes a few blood vessels, and is lined by glycogen-rich and morphologically undifferentiated epithelial cells with a columnar to cuboidal shape. In general, epithelial differentiation is centrifugal, so the proximal airways are lined with the most differentiated cells, with progressively less differentiation in the more distal tubules.<br><br>●Canalicular stage – During the canalicular stage (16th to 25th weeks of gestation), the transition from previable to a potential viable lung occurs as the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts of the gas exchange region of the lung are formed. The surrounding mesenchyme becomes more vascular and condenses around the airways. The closer vascular proximity ultimately results in fusion of the capillary and epithelial basement membranes. After 20 weeks gestation, cuboidal epithelial cells begin to differentiate into alveolar type II cells with formation of cytoplasmic lamellar bodies. The presence of lamellar bodies indicates the production of surfactant, which is produced from glycogen and stored in the lamellar bodies.<br><br>●Saccular stage – At the beginning of the saccular stage (approximately 24 weeks gestation), there is potential for viability because gas exchange is possible due to the presence of large and primitive forms of the future alveoli. In this stage, formation of alveoli (ie, alveolarization) occurs by the outgrowth of septae that subdivide terminal saccules into anatomic alveoli, where air exchange occurs. The number of alveoli in each lung increases from zero at 32 weeks gestation to between 50 and 150 million alveoli in term infants and 300 million in adults. Alveolar growth continues for at least two years after birth at term.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/633857410.jpg\"></p>",

During fetal life, patency of the ductus arteriosus appears to be maintained by the combined relaxant effects of low oxygen tension and endogenously produced prostaglandins, specifically prostaglandin E2 . In a full-term neonate, oxygen is the most important factor controlling ductal closure. When the PO 2 of the blood passing through the ductus reaches about 50 mm Hg, the ductal wall begins to constrict. The effects of oxygen on ductal smooth muscle may be direct or mediated by its effects on prostaglandin synthesis.\r\n",

Therefore, progressively severe cyanosis occurs as the ductus closes and blood flow to the lungs decreases. \r\n●Patients with critically obstructive left heart lesions (eg, HLHS, critical aortic valve stenosis) who have an adequate atrial septal communication and a patent ductus will typically exhibit only minimal desaturation. For those with sufficient prograde flow across the aortic valve to supply the right subclavian artery fully, the preductal saturations can be normal. However, postductal saturations will be lower as right to left shunting at the PDA supplies the lower body circulation. However, upon closure of the ductus, systemic circulation is compromised, resulting in poor peripheral perfusion (ie, cardiogenic shock) and cyanosis. \r\n- Patients with critical left heart obstruction and a restrictive atrial communication will exhibit more profound cyanosis even with ductal patency. A restrictive atrial communication results in decreased shunting of the oxygenated pulmonary venous return into the right heart, severe pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension, all of which contribute to decreased systemic oxygenation.\r\n●Patients with parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations (eg, transposition of the great arteries depend upon the PDA and atrial communications for mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. With ductal closure in the absence of an adequate atrial septal defect, profound cyanosis ensues.\r\n●Neonates with Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve may be cyanotic and ductal dependent for pulmonary blood flow in the situation where there is a functional pulmonary atresia\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nNebulised racemic epinephrine\r\n\r\nNebulized racemic epinephrine is the established treatment for moderate or\r\nsevere croup. The mechanism of action is believed to be constriction of the\r\nprecapillary arterioles through the β-adrenergic receptors, causing fluid\r\nresorption from the interstitial space and a decrease in the laryngeal mucosal\r\nedema. Traditionally, racemic epinephrine, a 1 : 1 mixture of the D - and L -\r\nisomers of epinephrine, has been administered. A dose of 0.25-0.5 mL of 2.25%\r\nracemic epinephrine in 3 mL of normal saline can be used as often as every 20\r\nmin. Racemic epinephrine was initially chosen over the more active and more\r\nreadily available L -epinephrine to minimize anticipated cardiovascular side\r\neffects such as tachycardia and hypertension. Current evidence does not favor\r\nracemic epinephrine over L-epinephrine (5 mL of 1 : 1,000 solution) in terms of\r\nefficacy or safety.\r\nThe indications for the administration of nebulized epinephrine include\r\nmoderate to severe stridor at rest, the possible need for intubation, respiratory\r\ndistress, and hypoxia.\r\n",
