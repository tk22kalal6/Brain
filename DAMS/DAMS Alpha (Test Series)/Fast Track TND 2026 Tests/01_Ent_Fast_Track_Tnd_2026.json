The presence of TAU protein is diagnostic of CSF (a serum test for TAU protein if performed helps to increase certainty). There is no modern day role for glucose testing in the investigation of CSF leaks.\r\n• Imaging. High-resolution CT imaging of the skull base is good at identifying the location of leak; however, artefacts can occur (e.g. vessels passing through skull base). The CT is also necessary if navigation-guided surgery is planned. \r\n• MRI can also be useful in identifying the site if there is also a skull base defect such as meningocele.\r\n",

The ‘double ring’ sign around the cochlea on CT is typical of this disease. Osteogenesis imperfecta can lead to a similar CT appearance but is far less common in the temporal bone.\r\n• Various drug treatment strategies have been proposed for stabilising hearing with inner-ear involvement. There are several studies (although relatively low grade) suggesting that uoride treatment may slow the progression of sensorineural hearing loss, although the dosage and treatment duration is very heterogenous in these studies. More recently, bisphosphonates, particularly third-generation bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate or risedronate, have been suggested to be useful in stabilising hearing as well.\r\n• Hearing rehabilitation options always include standard hearing aids. In few cases, consideration should strongly be given to stapedotomy to close the air-bone gap followed by hearing aids. This would allow much better function with the hearing aids. The third option is cochlear implantation. But it should be considered if hearing is not satisfactory with hearing aids even after stapedotomy or stapedectomy. \r\n",

Several factors are taken into account in deciding the chemotherapy regimen. Firstly, efficacy: the figures for event-free survival are similar for most small chemotherapy series but therapy usually involves fairly high-dose radiotherapy to the nasopharynx – 60 to 65 Gy. However, the most promising results with a recent update, are those obtained using the Mertens protocol NPC-91-GPOH (Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology).\r\n• Radiotherapy. Although treatment with radiotherapy controls the primary tumor,it does not prevent the appearance of distant metastases Radiotherapy is given with megavoltage equipment after initial chemotherapy. A maximum dose of 45 Gy is given to the clinical target volume, which is a 1 cm margin around the MRI-detected primary site, and inferiorly down to the clavicles to include the lymph nodes.\r\n",
