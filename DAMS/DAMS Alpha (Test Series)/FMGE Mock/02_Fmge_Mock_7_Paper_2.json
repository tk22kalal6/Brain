Anti-tubercular therapy should be started as the next step in the management of this condition.<br />\r\nThis patient presents with cough, cold, fever, and malaise associated with weight loss, and a radiograph showing a homogenous dense infiltrate in the right lung is consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The presence of ascites along with the above-mentioned signs and symptoms is suggestive of tuberculous peritonitis.<br />\r\nThe various pathogenic mechanisms of gastrointestinal TB include direct seeding into the abdomen due to swallowing of the sputum, hematogenous seeding of tubercle bacilli from rupture of lymph nodes or intraabdominal organs, and ingestion of milk from cows infected with bovine TB. It presents with abdominal pain, swelling, obstruction, hematochezia, and a palpable abdominal mass. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, and anorexia are also present.<br />\r\nThe terminal ileum and cecum are the most commonly involved sites.<br />\r\nThe presence of fever, abdominal pain, and ascites should raise the suspicion of tuberculous peritonitis. The clinical presentation may be similar to Crohn&#39;s disease if the intestinal wall is involved, leading to ulcerations and fistulae.<br />\r\nParacentesis reveals an exudate with high protein content, lymphocytosis, and elevated levels of adenosine deaminase(ADA). Elevated ADA levels have very high sensitivity for tuberculous peritonitis. Standard anti-tubercular therapy is recommended for ascites caused by tuberculous peritonitis. If the etiology of the ascites is uncertain, laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsy for culture and histology remains the gold standard.</p>\r\n",

This is primarily due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which contributes to its dissociative anesthesia properties. It affects the thalamo-cortical junction, leading to an altered perception of the environment and vivid imagery.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If torsion is confirmed, the recommended treatment involves administering antibiotics and analgesics and scheduling corrective surgery after 14 days.<br />\r\nTesticular torsion refers to the twisting of the spermatic cord, which supplies blood to the testicle. It is a urological emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent testicular ischemia and potential loss of the testicle. The classic presentation of testicular torsion includes sudden-onset severe testicular pain, swelling, and tenderness. In the given clinical case, the high-riding testicle, tenderness, and absence of the cremasteric reflex (which is normally elicited by stroking the inner thigh and causes elevation of the testicle) strongly suggest testicular torsion. The horizontal lie of the testicle may be observed due to the twisting of the spermatic cord. &nbsp;If torsion is confirmed, the recommended treatment involves administering antibiotics and analgesics and performing immediate corrective surgery.</p>\r\n",

Bladder exstrophy is a congenital malformation characterized by a visible bladder on the anterior abdominal wall due to the failure of the lower abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the bladder to fuse properly during embryonic development. The presentation of a visible bladder exposed and not covered by the abdominal wall shortly after birth is highly suggestive of bladder exstrophy. This condition is typically apparent at birth and may be associated with other abnormalities such as epispadias (malformation of the urethra).</p>\r\n",

The unenhanced CT scan (CT KUB) is the gold standard imaging test in this scenario.\r\nRationale for Using Unenhanced CT:\r\n1. High Sensitivity and Specificity:\r\no Unenhanced CT is highly accurate for detecting renal and ureteric stones.\r\no It allows visualization of the size, location, and density of the stones.\r\n2. No Contrast Required:\r\no Contrast media can obscure the stones and is unnecessary for the initial diagnosis of urolithiasis.\r\no Additionally, patients with potential impaired renal function or contraindications to contrast are safeguarded.\r\n3. Quick and Readily Available:\r\no CT KUB provides rapid results, which is critical in the acute setting.\r\n",

Progesterone negative feedback works at the hypothalamus to decrease the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. This, in turn, will decrease the secretion of folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and decreases the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH).&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
