      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nMyasthenia gravis (MG)\r\n\r\nThe clinical presentation of muscle weakness worsening with activity but improving after rest, along with ocular symptoms such as bilateral ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles, is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, particularly affecting the skeletal muscles that control eye movements, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing, and speaking.\r\n\r\nOption A, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), typically presents with progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, without significant improvement after rest. ALS commonly affects both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to widespread muscle weakness.\r\n\r\nOption B, multiple sclerosis (MS), is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Although MS can cause various neurological symptoms, it typically presents with sensory and motor deficits that are not usually worsened by activity or improved with rest. In addition, MS commonly presents with symptoms such as optic neuritis, sensory disturbances, and problems with coordination.\r\n \r\nOption D, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), is an acute inflammatory condition affecting peripheral nerves and typically presents with ascending motor weakness and sensory abnormalities. Unlike MG, muscle weakness in GBS does not improve with rest.\r\nTherefore, based on the clinical presentation of muscle weakness worsening with activity, improving after rest, and the presence of bilateral ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles, the most likely diagnosis in this case is C) Myasthenia gravis (MG).\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) Otosclerosis Otosclerosis is a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, which can lead to progressive hearing loss. However, the Carhart notch is not typically associated with otosclerosis. In otosclerosis, the hearing loss is often more gradual and affects a broader range of frequencies.This is the correct answer. The Carhart notch is commonly associated with noise-induced hearing loss. It is characterized by a distinct dip or notch in the audiogram at around 2,000 Hz. This notch occurs due to the damaging effects of prolonged or excessive noise exposure on the sensory cells in the cochlea, specifically affecting the frequencies within the speech range. The hearing thresholds usually improve at higher frequencies.</p>\r\n",

It arises from extension of infection and inflammation in the mastoid, with eventual inflammation of the adjacent lateral or sigmoid sinus. Headache is the most common symptom, with papilledema, sixth-nerve palsy, and vertigo being less frequently present. Occlusion of the lateral sinus produces pain over the ear and mastoid and may cause edema over the mastoid (Griesinger sign). Involvement of cranial nerves V and VI produces ipsilateral facial pain and lateral rectus weakness (Gradenigo syndrome).\r\n",

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart defect that consists of four anatomical abnormalities: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, overriding aorta, and ventricular septal defect (VSD). In this case, the infant presents with episodes of cyanosis that occur during crying and feeding. This is consistent with the characteristic \"tet spell\" seen in TOF, where the cyanosis worsens during episodes of increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. The grade 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border is due to the presence of pulmonary stenosis, which is a hallmark feature of TOF. Additionally, the palpable liver edge 3 cm below the right costal margin suggests right ventricular hypertrophy causing hepatomegaly.\r\n",
