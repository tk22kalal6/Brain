Spermatic cord liposarcomas are usually identified by an extratesticular mass on ultrasound. Granulosa cell tumors in general are rare and seen in very young patients. The testicle is a very rare site for a metastatic carcinoma as well. Leydig cell tumors can occur in this age population but are less frequent in incidence than lymphomas</p>\r\n",

It is triggered by preformed &nbsp;antibodies against the donor&rsquo;s human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or ABO blood group antigens. These antibodies activate a series of events that result in diffuse intravascular coagulation, causing ischemic necrosis of the graft. Fortunately, pre transplant blood group typing and cross-matching (in which the donor&rsquo;s cells are mixed with the recipient&rsquo;s serum, and then destruction of the cells is observed) have virtually eliminated the incidence of hyperacute rejection.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nComments Horseshoe kidneys are the most common fusion abnormality of the kidneys. They arise from the fusion of the inferior renal poles while they still reside in the pelvis. This union impedes subsequent medial rotation and ascent of the kidneys, as the area of fusion cannot progress cephalad to the inferior mesenteric artery. The lack of medial rotation deter- mines that the ureters remain in an anterior location. Vascular development is also hindered, and horseshoe kidneys often preserve their primitive blood supply arising from the distal aorta and iliac vessels [4].<br />\r\nWhile up to one third of horseshoe kidneys remain asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally, the abnormal blood supply and ureteral implantation predispose to urinary stasis and reflux, leading to nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infections.<br />\r\nHorseshoe kidneys are more vulnerable to trauma due to their lack of protection by the ribs. In addition, the isthmus may be compressed against the spinal column. There have been reports of tumors arising from horseshoe kidneys, and it is unclear whether horseshoe kidney is a predisposing factor for renal cell carcinoma. Finally, horseshoe kidneys represent an obstacle in the repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. This obstacle can be circumvented by the use of endovascular or retroperitoneal approaches.<br />\r\nHorseshoe kidneys do not require any specific treatment. Division of the isthmus and attempts at relocation are contrain- dicated. However, surgery may be undertaken to address urinary reflux and stones&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

C1 is someone who has telangiectasias or reticular veins on examination. A telangiectasia is a &ldquo;spider&rdquo; vein that is a collection of smaller veins, each less than 1 mm in size. A reticular vein is a vein below the dermis that is between 1 and 3 mm and usually tortuous. C2 patients have varicose veins, and C3 patients have significant edema. C4 is divided into 4a, those with skin changes including pigmentation and/or eczema, and 4b, skin changes of lipodermatosclerosis and or atrophie blanche. C5 includes healed venous ulcers, and C6 has active ulceration. An &ldquo;S&rdquo; designation is for patients with symptoms of aching pain, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, and muscle cramps. An &ldquo;A&rdquo; designation is for patients who are asymptomatic. The Etiology of a disease can be congenital, primary, or secondary. The pathophysiology for the venous problem can be due to reflux, obstruction, or both. Generally, patients with C3 or C4 usually have nonoperative management. Their treatment includes compression stockings and skin lubricants. C5 and C6 can undergo operative intervention depending on the etiology and anatomy of the disease to prevent a long-term ulcer recurrence.</p>\r\n",

The central zone of coagulation is necrotic and irreversiblydamaged; it represents a full-thickness injury that will require excisionand grafting. The zone of stasis refers to the immediatelysurrounding region and is characterized by constricted vessels andhypoxia. Initially viable, this tissue may convert to coagulation ora full-thickness injury as a result of edema, infection, or shock withdecreased perfusion. The zone of stasis may remain viable if adequatelyperfused. In a patient with a large-TBSA burn, the viabilityof this zone may be critical in providing donor sites and reducingthe total area that requires grafting. The zone of hyperemia surroundingthis is characterized by vasodilation as a result of inflammatorymediators and is viable.</p>\r\n",

Although many women have family history of breast cancer, a strong family history of breast and ovarian can- cer should prompt referral for consideration of genetic testing.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;Phyllodes tumors, also known as cystosarcoma phyl- lodes, are stromal tumors. They are well circumscribed and do not have a true capsule. The cut surface of one of these tumors tends to be mucoid.<br />\r\nPhyllodes tend to occur in an older population<br />\r\nwhen compared to fibroadenomas (FAs). FAs are also stromal tumors, and it is thought that phyllodes may arise from these benign tumors. Phyllodes tend to occur in the fourth decade of life and most commonly present as painless mobile masses. On mammogram and ultrasound, they are similar in appearance to fibroadenomas&mdash;smooth, solid, and with multilobulated margins. There may also be fluid within the mass on ultrasound, suggesting phyllodes over FA.<br />\r\nSeventy-five percent of phyllodes tumors are benign. Similar to other stromal tumors, malignancy is difficult to establish and is based on histologic appearance. Stromal overgrowth is now considered the most important predictor of aggressive behavior. Other characteristics that are consid- ered are cellular atypia, mitotic activity, and tumor margins.<br />\r\nPhyllodes tend to recur regardless of benign or malignant status<br />\r\nincidence is 20&ndash;25% of recurrence. Current recom- mendations for initial surgical treatment of these tumors are wide local excision with at least a 1-cm margin. This can usually be done without requiring a mastectomy and is based on tumor&ndash;to&ndash;breast mass ratio. Regional lymph node metastases are rare and axillary evaluation is not warranted. Radiation ther- apy is also not indicated because this is not a mul- tifocal disease like ductal breast cancer. The tumors are only weakly radiosensitive; however, radiation therapy may offer some palliation for malignant or recurrent disease</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFibroadenoma is the most commonly diagnosed breast tumour in women under 30 years of age. They are benign tumours originating from the breast lobule. They show proliferation of both epithelium and connective tissue elements, and are considered an &lsquo;aberration of nor-mal development and involution&rsquo; (ANDI). Most fibroadenomas measure 2&ndash;3 cm in diameter and are common between the ages of 16&ndash;24; the incidence decreases towards menopause. Fibroadenomas are usually mobile, firm and smooth lumps but are sometimes lobulated. They may be multiple in approximately 10% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by triple assessment: (1) clinical examination, (2) radiological assessment (mammography or ultrasound scan), and&nbsp;(3) cytological (FNA) or histological (core biopsy) confirmation</p>\r\n",
