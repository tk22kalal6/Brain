      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Positive pressure ventilation (PPV)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: The first priority in neonatal resuscitation for a newborn with poor respiratory effort is to provide Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV) to help establish effective breathing. PPV is the most common intervention and should be initiated when a newborn shows signs of inadequate respiratory effort or heart rate below 100 bpm. Endotracheal intubation and chest compressions are considered if there is no improvement with PPV. Epinephrine is used when there is a persistently low heart rate (&lt;60 bpm) despite effective ventilation and chest compressions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

A score of 6 at 1 minute suggests some mild distress, but a score of 9 at 5 minutes indicates improvement in the baby&rsquo;s status. The score typically rises as the infant stabilizes after birth, particularly if the initial score was slightly low due to transient factors.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This prevents oxygenated blood from reaching the systemic circulation unless there is a shunt (PDA, PFO, or VSD) to allow mixing. Without mixing, the neonate rapidly develops profound cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood into systemic circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
