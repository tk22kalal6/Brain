They invade nasal tissues when the host’s defense mechanisms are compromised due to immune-suppressive drugs.\r\nClinical features are those of acute or subacute rhinitis or sinusitis. A black or greyish membrane is seen in the nasal mucosa. Exploration of maxillary sinus reveals a fungus ball containing semisolid cheesy-white or blackish material.
