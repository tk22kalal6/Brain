      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pain is produced by the noxious stimuli perceived by specific sensory receptors called nociceptors which are there at the free nerve endings of primary afferent terminals of A delta and C fibres.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An action potential is generated at this nociceptor (transduction) which are then further carried by the A delta and C fibres towards the higher centre (transmission) and make us feel pain (perception).<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pain is a unique sensory signal as it is maximally changed on its way towards the higher cortical centres (modulation)<br />\r\nSome of the modulation systems are described below:<br />\r\na. Endogenous pain modulation system: Endogenous opioids like endorphins,<br />\r\nenkephalins and dynorphins act on the opioid receptors present in the dorsal horn and results in presynaptic inhibition.<br />\r\nb. Segmental inhibition: Local inhibition in the dorsal horn is mediated by the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters like glycine and GABA.<br />\r\nc. Gate control theory of pain:&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It states that activating the larger diameter A beta fibres leads to inhibition of pain signals transmitted via smaller diameter A delta and C fibres.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An inhibitory interneuron acts as a physiological gate which is closed by stimulation of A beta fibres.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), spinal cord stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation was established based on this principle.&nbsp;<br />\r\nd. Descending inhibitory pathways:&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Periaqueductal grey (PAG) and the rostral ventromedial medulla in the midbrain sends descending fibres which project into the dorsal horn of the same side of tissue damage.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These inhibitory neurons are activated by serotonin (SHT) and norepinephrine (NE).&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They send an inhibitory signal in the dorsal horn and reduce the intensity of the signal which is transmitted from first order neuron to the second order neuron. &nbsp;Antidepressant medications activate this system and increase the level of SHT and NE and help in reducing the intensity of pain.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Capture(1397).JPG\" style=\"height:381px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

Aspiration of gastric contents can be fatal.\r\n•\tThe difference between a 1st and 2nd generation LMA is in the cuff material and a separate access hole to the esophagus.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Head Tilt/Chin Lift</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The head tilt/chin lift is one of the most common active maneuvers used to open a patient&#39;s airway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; This maneuver should be used only if the clinician is confident that there is no risk of cervical spine injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Standing on the side of the patient, the clinician places one hand on the patient&#39;s forehead while simultaneously placing the fingers of the other hand under the patient&#39;s mandible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The head is then tilted backward while lifting the mandible forward, extending the neck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; This action creates an open airway by lifting the tongue from the posterior pharynx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; If effectively applied, the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver may allow the patient to resume unobstructed breathing without further intervention. Jaw thrust:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The jaw thrust is preferred over the above mentioned techniques in known or suspected cases of cervical spine injuries because the head and neck remain in a more neutral position when it is applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; When performing a jaw-thrust maneuver, the clinician stands behind the head of the patient, places the fingers of both hands on the left and right sides under the angles of the mandible, and applies forward and upward pressure (Fig.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; As with the head tilt/chin lift, the jaw-thrust maneuver displaces the tongue from the posterior pharynx, but does so while keeping the patient&#39;s head and neck in a neutral position, and may allow the patient to resume unobstructed breathing without further intervention. Sniffing position:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The sniffing position has traditionally been recommended as the best head position to facilitate effective airway management in patients who are not at risk of cervical spine injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The sniffing position is achieved by elevating the head (15&deg;) and extending it on the neck (35&deg;) of a patient in the supine position (Fig. ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Its main advantage is to provide optimal exposure of the glottis by aligning the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes Manual inline Stabilization ( MILS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; In a patient with a known or suspected cervical spine injury, regardless of the maneuver used, the clinician must minimize head and neck movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Failure to do so can cause significant and permanent neurologic injury to the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; There are 2 generally accepted techniques to minimize cervical spine movement: the cervical collar and manual in-line stabilization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Capture(1404).JPG\" style=\"height:414px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",
