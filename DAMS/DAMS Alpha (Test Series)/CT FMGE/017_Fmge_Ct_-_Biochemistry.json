      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nIn type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is an inadequate production of insulin or the insulin produced does not meet its purpose of introducing glucose into the cells, thus depriving them of energy. This condition is called “insulin resistance” because while there is insulin, it cannot introduce glucose into the cells and thus there is an accumulation of glucose in the blood. This is also the main disorder that occurs in the early stages of type 2 diabetes.\r\n",

The characteristic features of neonatal jaundice include yellowish skin, sclerae, and mucous membranes. Neonatal jaundice is usually a mild, transient, and self-limiting condition known as physiologic jaundice. However, this should be distinguished from the more severe pathologic jaundice. The two types of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. In most neonates, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the cause of clinical jaundice. However, some infants have conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is always pathologic and signifies an underlying medical or surgical etiology. Failure to identify and treat pathologic jaundice may result in bilirubin encephalopathy and associated neurological sequelae.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It occurs due to the deposition of needle-like crystals of uric acid in the joints, leading to inflammation and intense pain. Symptoms typically come and go in flares known as gout attacks, and it can be triggered by factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, and certain medications. Treatment options include medications to relieve pain and inflammation, lifestyle changes, and dietary adjustments to manage uric acid levels.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In biology, histones are highly basic proteins abundant in lysine and arginine residues that are found in eukaryotic cell nuclei and in most Archaeal phyla. They act as spools around which DNA winds to create structural units called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes in turn are wrapped into 30-nanometer fibers that form tightly packed chromatin. Histones prevent DNA from becoming tangled and protect it from DNA damage. In addition, histones play important roles in gene regulation and DNA replication. Without histones, unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long. For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA if completely stretched out; however, when wound about histones, this length is reduced to about 9 micrometers (0.09 mm) of 30 nm diameter chromatin fibers.</p>\r\n",

There are a number of classes of molecular chaperones, all of which function to assist large proteins in proper protein folding during or after synthesis, and after partial denaturation. Chaperones are also involved in the translocation of proteins for proteolysis.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a serious condition resulting from a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often associated with alcohol use disorder. It comprises two disorders: Wernicke&#39;s encephalopathy, which is acute and presents with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, and Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by memory disturbances and confabulation. Immediate treatment is crucial, typically involving thiamine supplementation to prevent further brain damage. WKS is considered an alcohol-related brain injury due to long-term alcohol abuse leading to severe thiamine deficiency.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
