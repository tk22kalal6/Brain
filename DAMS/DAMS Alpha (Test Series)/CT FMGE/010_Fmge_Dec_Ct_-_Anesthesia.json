      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\n• Local anesthetics bind a specific region of the α subunit and inhibit voltage-gated Sodium channels, preventing channel activation and inhibiting the Na influx associated with membrane depolarization.\r\n• With increasing local anesthetic concentrations, an increasing fraction of the Na channels in the membrane bind a local anesthetic molecule and cannot conduct Na ions as consequence, impulse conduction slows, the rate of rise and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation and impulse conduction increases progressively.\r\n• At high enough local anesthetic concentrations and with a sufficient fraction of local anesthetic-bound Na channels, an action potential can no longer be generated, and impulse propagation is abolished.\r\n• Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. (AIIMSQ)\r\n• Local anesthetic binding to Na channels does not alter the resting membrane potential. (NEETQ)\r\n\r\n",

While most providers prefer to use them for patients who are breathing spontaneously, positive pressure ventilation can be provided with a well seated LMA.\r\n• LMA's do not protect against gastric content aspiration. Aspiration of gastric contents can be fatal.\r\n• The difference between a 1st and 2nd generation LMA is in the cuff material and a separate access hole to the esophagus. They are designed to provide a higher seal pressure allowing for higher positive pressure ventilation.\r\n• In an emergency procedure, an LMA is not a good choice for primary airway management as LMAs do not protect against gastric content aspiration. \r\n• Endotracheal intubation is a gold standard method of airway access when there is increased risk of aspiration.\r\n\r\n",

In the setting of a patient whose cardiac status is tenuous, elevating the heart rate may increase myocardial oxygen demand and thereby increase ischemia. \r\n• Fentanyl, used alone, has good analgesic properties via a central mechanism (blunting frontal lobe function) but, in doses sufficient to make painful procedures tolerable, may suppress respirations. \r\n• Propofol has a good analgesic and hypnotic properties, it drops peripheral vascular resistance and thus may cause a hypotension.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nInhalational Induction of Anesthesia\r\n\r\nAnother option for the induction of general anesthesia is inhalational induction with volatile anesthetic. This technique is commonly used in pediatric anesthesia to provide a painless, needle-free experience for the child. In adults, an inhalational induction of anesthesia is used when IV access is not available or when the specific advantages of the technique are desirable. Advantages of an inhalational induction of anesthesia are the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation and the potential for gradual changes in the depth of anesthesia and associated respiratory and cardiovascular effects. Inhalational induction of anesthesia has also been used for RSI, with a rapid-onset NMBD administered at LOC (also see Chapter 27).\r\n\r\nSevoflurane is currently the most commonly used volatile anesthetic for inhalational induction because of its lack of pungency and low blood:gas solubility, allowing for a smooth induction of anesthesia that can provide suitable conditions for airway management with or without adjuvant drugs such as NMBDs or opioids.\r\n\r\n• One main disadvantage of halothane is its high blood:gas partition coefficient, which leads to relatively long induction times. \r\n• It also can produce cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial depression, and halothane-induced hepatitis. \r\n• Because of the inability to achieve deep levels of anesthesia with halothane because of its side effects, the use of NMBDs, opioids, or both, is often required\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) \r\n\r\n• After induction of anesthesia, including a muscle relaxant, maintaining pre-oxygenation and some ventilation is of paramount importance to avoid hypoxia. \r\n• Especially in larger individuals, redundant tissue may make positive pressure ventilation difficult. \r\n• Once the face mask fails to provide an adequate seal, an LMA is a good choice to provide a seal further down the airway.\r\n• The LMA is designed to create a seal around the larynx to allow positive pressure ventilation up to a certain pressure, which can vary between patients and the design of the LMA. \r\n• Once the patient's saturation begins to fall, swift and decisive action such as inserting an LMA will help to prevent further hypoxia.\r\n• In addition to bypassing facial features, missing teeth, and full beards, LMAs can also be useful to slide past redundant pharyngeal tissues which might obstruct the upper airway.\r\n• LMA's have different designs and features, such as silicone cuffs, gastric access ports, non-inflatable gel cuffs. \r\n• 2nd generation LMAs often provide higher seal pressure to allow for higher positive pressure ventilation pressures and are preferred in a rescue situation. \r\n• LMA's, preferably 2nd generation, should be immediately available during induction of anesthesia if airway rescue becomes necessary.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nConfirmation of placement of tube:\r\n• Tracheal intubation is one of the essential medical procedures. \r\n• Unrecognised or accidental endobronchial intubation results in hypoventilation and collapse of the non-ventilated lung, barotrauma or pneumothorax in the ventilated lung.\r\n• Unrecognised oesophageal intubation can lead to severe morbidity like hypoxic brain damage. \r\n• Therefore, verification of correct positioning of endotracheal tube (ETT) is essential to avoid serious consequences.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been described to identify the correct position of ETT like:\r\n• intubation under direct vision\r\n• inspection of chest wall movements\r\n• auscultation of bilateral breath sounds\r\n• monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2)\r\n• use of negative pressure devices\r\n• fibreoptic bronchoscopy\r\n• chest X-ray. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Among all, though capnography is considered the most commonly used method, but it may not be reliable under certain conditions, e.g., endobronchial intubation, poor circulatory perfusion as in cardiac arrest, severe hypotension, pulmonary embolism, severe bronchospasm, poor pulmonary reserve like pleural effusion, pneumothorax and pulmonary malignancy.\r\n Prior bag-mask ventilation leading to gastric insufflation, antacid consumption or ingestion of carbonated beverages also may lead to false positive results with capnography.\r\n\r\n",
