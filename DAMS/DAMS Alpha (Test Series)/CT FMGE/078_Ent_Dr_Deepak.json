The amplitude of force can be from front or below.\r\n•\tNasal bone fracture, are also common. Traumatic forces may act from the front or side depend on amplitude.\r\nTypes\r\n•\tDepressed: Due to frontal blow.\r\n•\tAngulated: Due to lateral blow.\r\nSymptoms\r\n•\tSwelling within few hours of trauma\r\n•\tTenderness\r\n•\tNasal deformity\r\n•\tEpistaxis\r\n•\tNasal obstruction - due to hematoma or septal injury\r\n•\tPeriorbital ecchymosis\r\nDiagnosis\r\n•\tOn physical examination\r\n•\tX-rays should include Waters view, right and left lateral views and occlusal view\r\nTreatment\r\n•\tSimple fractures without displacement need no treatment\r\n•\tOthers-may  require closed or open reduction\r\n•\tPresence of edema interferes with accurate reduction by closed methods.\r\n•\tSo, best time me to reduce fracture is before the appearance of oedema, or after it has subsided, which is usually in 5-7 days.\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nOtosclerosis\r\nRef: Read the text below\r\nSol:  \r\n•\tOtosclerosis is traditionally diagnosed by characteristic clinical findings, which include progressive conductive hearing loss, a normal tympanic membrane, and no evidence of middle ear inflammation. The cochlear promontory may have a faint pink tinge reflecting the vascularity of the lesion, referred to as the Schwartze sign.\r\n•\tConductive hearing loss is usually secondary to impingement of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral otosclerosis.\r\n•\tThe most common location of involvement of otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram.\r\n•\tThe fissula is a thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondral layer, approximately between the oval window and the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendon turns laterally toward the malleus.\r\n•\tAs 2 kHz is the resonant frequency of the ossicular chain, the largest increase in bone conduction threshold (around 15 dB) occurs at this frequency – the resultant notch is called \r\n•\tCarhart's notch and is a useful clinical marker for medial ossicular-chain fixation.\r\n",

There is, however, a severe subtype of external otitis, malignant external otitis, of which you should be aware. This form is specifically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tends to affect elderly diabetics and AIDS patients, causing the findings illustrated in the question stem. It is particularly worrisome both because the Pseudomonas organism is so tissue destructive and because it is often highly resistant to most intravenous antibiotics. (Consult your local microbiology or pharmacology departments for advice about local sensitivities if you encounter the condition.) Complications can be devastating, including deafness, facial nerve paralysis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis. \r\n•\tEscherichia coli can cause both external otitis and acute otitis media, but does not usually cause malignant external otitis. \r\n•\tHaemophilus influenza is an important cause of acute otitis media. \r\nProteus vulgaris can cause external otitis, but does not usually cause the malignant form. \r\n",

Stridor may be inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic depending on its timing in the respiratory cycle.\r\n•\tInspiratory stridor suggests an extrathoracic lesion (eg, laryngeal, nasal, pharyngeal).\r\n•\tExpiratory stridor implies an intrathoracic lesion (eg, tracheal, bronchial). Biphasic stridor suggests a subglottic or glottic anomaly.Inspiratory stridor is the hallmark of upper airway obstruction.\r\n•\tAmong the disorders that can involve the upper airway and cause stridor are epiglottitis, infectious laryngotracheitis,angioneurotic edema, and foreign- body aspiration. In contrast, acute bronchospasm prolongs the expiratory phase of respiration and causes predominantly expiratory wheezing rather than inspiratory stridor.\r\n",
