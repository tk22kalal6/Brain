Vital Signs: T 36.5°C, P 70/min, R 15/min, BP 124/80 mm Hg, BMI 27. Muscle strength testing: Normal. Deep tendon reflexes: Normal. When asked to walk, the patient had difficulty in balancing and maintaining a normal gait. Patellar tendon reflexes were normal. The muscles, however, were weak. LABORATORY STUDIES- MRI indicated Gd-enhancing brain lesions, as well as one infratentorial lesion and three periventricular lesions in the brain. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed an oligoclonal IgG band. During the initial stages of this disease, how would the velocity of action potential transmission be altered within the central nervous system?  ",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nMyelinated axons would show a decreased conduction velocity, and unmyelinated axons would show no change in conduction velocity.\r\n\r\nMultiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that leads to loss of myelin from central nervous system axons. The lost myelin is replaced by scar tissue called sclerosis. The central nervous system damage results in multiple lesions that are visible on magnetic resonance imaging. Demyelinating diseases diminish the speed of axonal transmission. Consequently, this negatively impacts the coordinated and sequential activation of motor neurons necessary for walking. The difficulty in walking is likely due to damage to the myelinated axons of the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Deep tendon reflexes are normal because the neuromuscular transmission is working normally in the early stage of the disease. Similarly, muscle weakness may not be apparent. However, over time, the degeneration of the nerves will lead to muscle atrophy and weakness.",

During inspiration, air flows into the lungs when alveolar pressure becomes lower (due to contraction of the diaphragm) than atmospheric pressure; if alveolar pressure were not lower than atmospheric pressure, air would not flow inward.
