After the first psychotic episode, a patient gradually recovers and may then function relatively normally for a long time. Patients usually relapse, however, and the pattern of illness during the first 5 years after the diagnosis generally indicates the patient’s course. Further deterioration in the patient’s baseline functioning follows each relapse of the psychosis. This failure to return to baseline functioning after each relapse is the major distinction between schizophrenia and the mood disorders. Sometimes a clinically observable postpsychotic depression follows a psychotic episode, and the schizophrenia patient’s vulnerability to stress is usually lifelong. Positive symptoms tend to become less severe with time, but the socially debilitating negative or deficit symptoms may increase in severity. Although about one-third of all schizophrenia patients have some marginal or integrated social existence, most have lives characterized by aimlessness; inactivity; frequent hospitalizations; and, in urban settings, homelessness and poverty.\r\n",
