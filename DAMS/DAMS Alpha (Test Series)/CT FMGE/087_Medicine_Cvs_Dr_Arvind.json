      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThe pulse described here is Pulsus alternans which is a sign of marked left ventricular dysfunction characterized by alternating strong and weak ventricular contractions, which results in alternating intensity of the peripheral pulses. It is thought to reflect cyclic changes in intracellular calcium levels and action potential duration. It is more easily detectable in the femoral than in the brachial, radial, or carotid artery. When present, this sign can be enhanced with maneuvers that decrease venous return, such as assumption of erect posture. Because patients with pulsus alternans generally have markedly reduced ventricular contractile function, an S3 gallop sound is common. Electrical alternans of the QRS complex on the ECG is found in patients with large pericardial effusions.\r\n",

Staphylococcus aureus\r\n\r\nMore aggressive; causes acute endocarditis\r\n\r\nCommon in IV drug users, prosthetic valves, or central line infections\r\n\r\nB.

In contrast, Mobitz type I second-degree AV block is characterised by progressive lengthening of the P–R interval block.
