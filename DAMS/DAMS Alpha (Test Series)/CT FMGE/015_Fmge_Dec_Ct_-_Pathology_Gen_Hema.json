PGI2 is a potent vasodilator, platelet anti-aggregant in contrast with thrombaxin A2 (TXA2) which is also inhibited by aspirin but TXA2 is platet aggregant and vasoconstrictor.

The inactive X known as the Barr body, or X chromatin. The molecular basis of X inactivation involves a unique gene called XIST, initiates a gene-silencing process by chromatin modification and DNA methylation. The XIST allele is switched off in the active X.\r\n",
