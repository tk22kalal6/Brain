The cochlear promontory may have a faint pink tinge reflecting the vascularity of the lesion, referred to as the Schwartze sign.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conductive hearing loss is usually secondary to impingement of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral otosclerosis.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most common location of involvement of otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fissula is a thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondral layer, approximately between the oval window and the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendon turns laterally toward the malleus.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As 2 kHz is the resonant frequency of the ossicular chain, the largest increase in bone conduction threshold (around 15 dB) occurs at this frequency &ndash; the resultant notch is called&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carhart&#39;s notch and is a useful clinical marker for medial ossicular-chain fixation.</p>\r\n",

This form is specifically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tends to affect elderly diabetics and AIDS patients, causing the findings illustrated in the question stem. It is particularly worrisome both because the Pseudomonas organism is so tissue destructive and because it is often highly resistant to most intravenous antibiotics.
