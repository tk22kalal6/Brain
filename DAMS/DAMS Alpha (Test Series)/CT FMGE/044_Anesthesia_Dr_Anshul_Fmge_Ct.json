(AIIMSQ)\r\n\r\n•\tLocal anesthetic binding to Na channels does not alter the resting membrane potential. (NEETQ)",

Vivid dreams, delirium and hallucinations may follow its use. \r\n\r\nCerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption and intracranial pressure (ICP) are all increased and this should be considered when dealing with patients with head injuries or raised ICP.\r\n\r\nFollowing administration, ketamine (which is only 25% protein bound) is demethylated to the active metabolite norketamine by P450 enzymes in the liver. \r\n\r\nNorketamine (which is 30% as potent) is further metabolized to inactive glucuronides, which are then excreted in the urine.",
