ACS occurs in the setting of intraabdominal hypertension and evidence of abdominal hypoperfusion.  ACS reduces the GFR secondary to elevated renal venous pressure and causes oliguria. Other physiologic derangements that can be seen are elevation of the diaphragms impeding oxygenation and ventilation raising the central intrathoracic, venous, and intracranial pressures.  All of these issues can be treated with decompressive laparotomy. Decompressive laparotomy should be employed as a  treatment for  ACS when there is evidence of end-organ dysfunction. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nKeloids are caused by an imbalance between collagen production and degradation.  The result is a scar that extends beyond the boundaries of the original wound.  Theabsolute  number  of  fibroblasts  is  not  increased.  Treatment  of keloids  is  difficult.  There  is  often  some  improvement  with  excision and intralesional steroid injection. If this technique is not successful, excision and radiation treatment can be used. Hypertrophic scars contain an overabundance of collagen, but the dimensions  of  the  scar  are  confined  to  the  boundaries  of  the original wound. Hypertrophic scars are often seen in the upper part  of  the  torso  and  across  flexor  surfaces.  Scar  formation  is affected by multiple factors, including the patient’s genetic makeup,  wound  location,  age,  nutritional  status,  infection, tension, and surgical technique. In planning for surgical incisions, an effort to parallel natural tension lines will promote improved wound healing\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nA  carotid body tumor  is the most common  paraganglioma  in the head and neck. Other paragangliomas that occur in this region include the vagal and jugulotympanic types.  The majority  of  paragangliomas are  solitary  and  nonfamilial. Multicentricity is reported in about 10% of cases, with about a 6% rate of malignancy. Only about 1%–3% of them are considered functional and can be evaluated with a 24-h urine collection for the analysis of catecholamines.  The  “Fontaine sign” refers to mobility  in  only the  lateral direction  on palpation, whereas pain occurring with chewing is called “first-bite  syndrome.” Histopathologic evaluation of this tumor demonstrates two types of cells: type I, chief cells/granular cells, and type II, sustentacular supporting cells. Unlike most head and neck tumors, malignancy is not diagnosed by the presence of dysplastic changes in the primary tumor.  The presence of a metastatic disease either  to  the  regional  cervical  lymphatics  or  to  the  distant  sites  is  the only diagnostic criteria. Imaging is the major modality for primary diagnosis since needle biopsy is contraindicated. CT  will show a hypervascular mass at the carotid bifurcation, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating a classic “salt and pepper” appearance on  T2-weighted sequences because of hemorrhage and f lowvoids.Onangiography,theinternalandexternalcarotidarteries willbebowedapart,afindingreferredtoasthe“lyre sign.” These tumors are best treated surgically, and vascular reconstruction maybe necessary. Radiation therapy can stop the growth of these lesions but  not  shrink  their  size.  Patients  should  be  aware  of  the  potential risk of injury to the vagus.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nBlunt injury  to  the  thorax  often results in varying degrees of hemothorax, pneumothorax, or both.  Tube thoracostomy is the initial management  of all injuries, both blunt and penetrating, to the thoracic cavity that result in  hemothorax  or  pneumothorax. Many such injuries can be managed  with tube thoracostomy alone. With regard to hemothorax, two metrics are generally accepted  as indications  for thoracotomy:  (1) volume  of initial  drainage  after tube thoracostomy of 1500 mL  or more or (2) ongoing bloody chest tube output of greater than 200 mL/h.  A  drop in hemoglobin or hematocrit  is often associated  with a multiply  injured  trauma  victim and is not by itself  an indication  for thoracotomy. Opacities  on a chest  radiograph  in  trauma  patients  are  relatively  nonspecific  and may represent lung contusion, atelectasis,  pneumonia,  pleural  effusion, or retained  hemothorax.  Their presence, although  important to  ongoing  care  of the  patient,  is not  an  indication  for  surgical exploration.  Most pneumothoraces  from trauma will resolve with tube thoracostomy\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n FAST has become a vital component in the initial evaluation of trauma patients. Currently, the primary focus of the FAST  examination  is  to  detect  fluid  presumed  to  be  blood,  but  as time progresses, more advanced applications will undoubtedly arise.  The examination is completed quickly during a primary survey (of an unstable patient) or a secondary survey (of a stable patient)  and  focuses  on  detecting  fluid  in  the  pericardial  space and dependent portions of the abdomen.  The examination is divided into three parts: cardiac, abdominal, and thoracic.  The cardiac examination consists of a sagittal view in the subxiphoid region.  The abdominal examination focuses on longitudinal views of the left and right upper quadrants and a transverse view of the pelvis.  The thoracic portion is an upward scan from the upper abdominal quadrants and can detect pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Despite the usefulness of the FAST  examination, it does have limitations.  The FAST  examination can quickly evaluate  for  the  presence  of  both  pericardial  fluid  and  pleural effusion. However, it does not evaluate the retroperitoneum and does not detect a cardiac contusion. CT  still has many practical applications in trauma patients and has not been fully replaced by the FAST  examination.  Transabdominal ultrasound has several advantages  over CT,  including  cost,  portability,  safety,  and  speed of the examination. However, ultrasound examinations are operator dependent.  The quality of the images, or lack thereof, depends on  the  technical  expertise  of  the  person  operating  the  ultrasound machine\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n  Blunt pelvic  trauma is the most common  cause of a urethral injury. Urethral disruption may cause the classic triad of blood at  the  meatus,  a palpable  bladder, and inability  to  urinate. Approximately  10% of pelvic  fractures in  males  result  in a urethral injury.  Disruption  usually  occurs  at  or  above  the  membranous portion  of the  urethra  because  the  anterior  prostatic  and membranousportionsarerelativelyfixedbythepuboprostaticligaments and the urogenital  diaphragm. A urethral  injury  should  be  suspected  if  blood  is  noted  at  the meatus or if the patient is unable to void clear urine. Urethral catheterization should not be attempted under these circumstances.  The risk of inserting a catheter is that partial disruption may be converted to complete disruption. Instead, a retrograde urethrogramshouldbeobtainedtoconfirmthesuspected diagnosis. In most cases, the complications of incontinence, stricture, and impotence  are minimized by the  performance of  suprapubic cystostomy and delayed repair of a urethral injury. Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes will not decompress the bladder and therefore leave the patient at risk for bladder rupture. Perineal urethrostomy does not divert the urine proximal to the site of injury and is of no value in  such a situation. Immediate  retropubic surgical realignment has a place in selected clinical situations, such as major bladder neck laceration, prostatic fragmentation, or severe dislocation of the prostate with severely displaced bone fragments. The site of bladder rupture with pelvic fracture is usually extraperitoneal because it has been caused by the shearing force of the pelvic fracture. Isolated extraperitoneal bladder rupture istreatedwith7to10daysofFoleycatheterdrainage.Blunt injury  without  pelvic fracture is associated with intraperitoneal rupture,  particularly if  the  bladder is  full  at  the time  of  injury. This perforation is typically at the dome of the bladder.  A bladder injury should be suspected in any patient with lower abdominal trauma if there is any hematuria or the patient is unable to void. Single-viewcystographymaymissasignificantinjury.Anterior,posterior,lateral,oblique,and,inparticular,postvoidfilms are necessary.  Alternatively, a CT  cystogram may be performed by injecting 300 to 400 mL  of contrast material through a Foley catheter followed by CT  of the pelvis.  The usual treatment of intraperitoneal rupture involves a two-layer, watertight closure with absorbable suture and transurethral or suprapubic bladder drainage. An iatrogenic injury recognized  at the time of an operation does not  generally  require  suprapubic  cystotomy  but  does  require repair with absorbable suture and urethral  catheter  drainage  for 5 to7days.ItisalsonecessarytobevigilantthattheFoleycatheter does not become  obstructed,  such as with blood, and cause  the bladder  to become  distended.\r\n",

A  common  power source  of  DC electricity  is  the  battery.  This  is  not  used  with  electrosurgery and thus plays no role  in the  function  of monopolar  or bipolar  devices.  When  the  current  alternates  (when the  polarity switches),  the  ions move  past  one  another  toward  the  oppositely charged  electrodes.  As they  oscillate,  friction  is generated,  and  this form of mechanical  energy is converted  to  thermal  energy, causing an increase in intracellular  temperature.  A  common power source of  AC electricity  is the  standard  wall  outlet.  This  principle  is the basis for electrosurgery and thus for both the monopolar  and bipolar devices.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\n: The GCS score allows multiple  health  professionals to follow a patient’s neurologic  status. It is based on the evaluation  of three  examinations—eyes,  verbal,  and  motor—that  are independently  recorded and added together  to obtain  an overall score.  Table  11.1  lists  the  GCS score that  correlates  to particular clinical  exam  findings.  The  best  examination  from  each  category is utilized.  The motor component  is the most important  regarding prognosis.  As with all  trauma  patients,  repeated  examinations  with a focus on the fundamentals  of airway, breathing,  and circulation are  key.  This patient  demonstrates  a  decline  in  GCS score, which should prompt an evaluation  of his airway and intubation.  A  GCS score  of 8 is often used as a marker for the  need  for intubation  to secure an airway.  Any patient  with a GCS  score  ≤  14 or loss of consciousness  should  get  a  CT  of  the  brain  without  contrast  to evaluate  for an  intracranial  injury;  however, this  is secondary  in this patient.  The overall  goal in treating  patients  with a traumatic head  injury  is  maintaining  adequate  cerebral  blood  flow.  An  estimate  of  this  flow  is  obtained  by  calculating  CPP  (CPP  =  mean  blood pressure  −  ICP).  The  goal  CPP  in  an  adult  is  60  to  70  mmHg. Therefore patients  should be aggressively volume resuscitated or started  on  vasopressors to  maintain  adequate  mean  blood  pressure. ICP  monitors are indicated  in patients with a GCS  score of 3 to 8 and  either  (1)  an  abnormal  finding  on  CT  of  the  head  or  (2)  any two of the  following:  (a)  age  older  than  40 years,  (b) posturing response to pain, or (c) systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg.

Treatment  measures used  to  decrease  ICP  include  elevation  of  the  head  of  the  bed  to  30 degrees or more, hyperventilation  of patients  to a PaCO2  of 35 mmHg, barbiturates,  and mannitol  at a dose of 1 g/kg IV. PaCO2 should not be kept below 30 mmHg to avoid worsening the cerebral ischemia.  Steroids do not have a role in the treatment  of acute traumatic  head injury.\r\n",

The clinical  examination  requires visual  inspection  of  the  chest  rise  for  symmetry,  open  wound with air bubbles, paradoxical  motion, and jugular venous distention. Palpation  can  detect  crepitus  and  instability  of  ribs  and  sternum, while  auscultation  identifies  absent  or  diminished  breath  sounds  or dullness  of heart  tones.  Extended  FAST  can  also  be used as part  of the  primary survey to  detect  a pneumothorax  or pericardial  effusion. Once the diagnosis is determined,  immediate  intervention must  take  place.  A  tension  pneumothorax  is classically  described with absent breath sounds, hypotension, distended  neck veins, and tracheal  deviation  and requires urgent chest tube placement.  Many start with needle decompression; however, many times this intervention  is done  incorrectly, provides  a  false  sense of security, and delays  definitive  treatment  with  tube  thoracostomy.  Cardiac  tamponade  pre sents  with  distended  neck  veins,  muffled  heart  sounds, and  hypotension  due  to  fluid  in  the  pericardial  sac,  decreased  right atrial  filling,  and  decreased  venous  return.  This  requires  a  pericardiocentesis  or pericardial  window\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nPatients who are critically ill are at risk for a number of gastrointestinal emergencies as a result of their index injury.  A  Curling’s ulcer is upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a burn patient, related to gastritis. Incidence is now decreased to 4% due to improved critical care, chemical ulcer prophylaxis, and early tube feeding.  A  Cushing’s ulcer is similar, but presents in patients  with severe neurologic injury and is likely related to increased  intracranial  pressure. Management  of both  types  of ulcers is similar, with the patient receiving aggressive resuscitation,  correction of coagulopathies, proton pump inhibitor administration, and endoscopic coagulation or clipping of any visiblesourcesofbleeding.Selectedarterialembolizationcan be used as an adjunct. Surgery is a last resort for patients who have persistent bleeding.  A  Marjolin’s ulcer is the malignant transformation of a chronic wound (burn scars, hidradenitis suppurativa,venousstasisulcers,fistulatracts,oranyotherchronic wound)  into  squamous  cell  carcinoma.  This  type  of  squamous cell  carcinoma is  very aggressive and will need wide local excision and metastatic workup.  A  Dieulafoy’s lesion is a vascular malformation of large vessels (1 to 3 mm), in the stomach, usually along the lesser curve submucosa, and can result in massive blood loss.  The mucosal defect overlying the vessel is often small, but the vessel itself is usually amenable to endoscopicclipping,whichissuccessful>80%ofthetime.Boerhaave’s syndrome is an esophageal perforation, usually distal, resulting  from esophageal sphincter dysfunction caused by repeated  vomiting.\r\n",

The median age at diagnosis is 68 years, 5 years older than that in women. Risk factors include increasing age, radiation exposure, factors related to abnormalities  in  estrogen  and  androgen  balance  (testicular  disease,  infertility, obesity, and cirrhosis), and genetic predisposition, including Klinefelter  syndrome, family history, and  BRCA2  gene  mutations.  Ninety  percent  of  male  breast  cancers  are  invasive  ductal carcinomas.  The majority of men with breast cancer have a breastmass, and when matched for age and stage, survival is similar to that in women.  Treatment of carcinoma in the male breast is similar to that in the female breast, and prognostic factors include nodal involvement, tumor size, histologic grade, and hormone receptor status.\r\n",

Randomized trials  have studied breast  conservation  for tumors up to 5 cm  in size.

SLNB  is  an  acceptable  method  of  staging the  axilla  in  breast cancer  patients  without  clinically  suspicious lymph nodes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThe  two  most  commonly  used  modalities  of  definitive therapy for stage I and II breast cancers are (1)  modified  radical mastectomy, which preserves the pectoralis major muscle while excising all breast tissue, including the nipple and axillary nodal basin, and (2) wide local excision of the breast tumor (lumpectomy/ partial  mastectomy) and axillary evaluation (SLNB  or  axillary dissection, or both) in conjunction with postoperative whole-breast irradiation.  A  number of large randomized trials have shown no significant  disease-free  survival  advantage  for  the  more  radical  (pectoralis-removing) Halsted mastectomy. Lumpectomy plus radiation therapy is associated with a local recurrence rate of 14%.  Genomic testing  currently  consists  of  assays  that  predict  the  risk  for  tumor recurrence  based  on  tumor  biology.  Genomic  testing  is increasingly  being  used  to  determine  the  aggressiveness  of  certain  cancers and can therefore help guide decisions regarding adjuvant therapy. The  National  Surgical  Adjuvant  Breast  and  Bowel  Project  B-06 (NSABP B-06)  trial  showed that regardless of the nodal status, there was  no difference in the overall survival between patients undergoing modified  radical  mastectomy  and  those  undergoing  lumpectomy with surgical axillary staging and radiation therapy.  A  nipple-sparing mastectomy can be performed for invasive cancer if immediate reconstruction is planned, and the tumor is remote from the nippleareolar complex  (>2 cm) and does not have a detrimental effect on long-term survival or local recurrence rates.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n: The  NSABP B-06  trial  demonstrated  that  lumpectomy  followed by radiation  therapy  to the  breast  is an appropriate treatment  for  patients  with  primary  tumors  4 cm  or  less  in  diameter and either positive  or negative  axillary lymph  nodes.  Several  other trials  have  confirmed  these  results  for  patients  with  stage  I  and  II breast cancers.  The 20-year results from the NSABP  B-06 trial showed an equal  overall  survival  and disease-free  survival  for all patients  whether  they  were  treated  by breast  preservation  or mastectomy. However, the cohort of patients treated by lumpectomy alone without irradiation suffered a 35% recurrence rate in the ipsilateral  breast.  This recurrence  rate  is considered  unacceptably high when compared  with the  10% risk for  ipsilateral  breast recurrences  in  patients  who underwent  radiation  therapy  of the breast  following  lumpectomy. Several  series have  shown that patients  with certain  collagen  vascular  diseases may incur increased toxicity  from radiation  therapy.  Although excessive  complications have not been consistently  shown with all types of collagen  vascular  disorders,  severe  fibrosis  and  soft  tissue  necrosis  have  been associated  with scleroderma,  thus suggesting that  patients  with scleroderma  may be better  served with a mastectomy. Patients  with active  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  and  rheumatoid  arthritis may also be at an increased  risk for toxicity  from radiation  therapy. Mastectomy is recommended  for patients who  have had previous radiation  therapy  to  the  chest  or  to  a  mantle  field  (which  includes the neck, axilla,  mediastinum,  and pulmonary hila) because the radiation  tolerance  of regional  normal tissues may be exceeded  and result in excessive toxicity.\r\n",

Histologically,  the  gland exhibits  a  dense  lymphocytic infiltrate  associated  with  a  dense  fibrosis.  When  the  disease  is active,  patients  can experience  symptoms associated  with either hypothyroidism  or  hyperthyroidism.

Surgery is rarely    indicated  except in the setting  of (1)  debilitating  symptoms  of  thyroid  dysfunction,  (2) compressive  symptoms  from    multinodular  goiter, and  (3) suspicion of malignancy.  The    presence  of a nodular disease mandates  FNA to rule out    lymphoma or papillary thyroid carcinoma.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nClassification  systems  help  to  standardize  diagnosis  and  treatment.  The  CEAP  classification  system  was  created  to aid  in diagnosing the  severity  of a  disease  and  to  improve  the  care of patients with venous disease.  According  to this system, a patient with C0 has no visible or palpable  signs of venous disease. C1 is someone who has telangiectasias  or reticular  veins on examination. A  telangiectasia  is  a  “spider”  vein  that  is  a  collection  of  smaller veins, each less than  1 mm  in size.  A  reticular  vein is a vein  below the  dermis that  is between  1 and  3 mm  and  usually  tortuous.  C2 patients  have  varicose  veins,  and  C3  patients  have  significant edema.  C4 is  divided  into  4a,  those  with  skin changes  including pigmentation  and/or eczema,  and 4b, skin changes of lipodermatosclerosis and or atrophie  blanche.  C5 includes  healed  venous ulcers, and  C6  has  active  ulceration.  An  “S”  designation  is  for  patients with  symptoms  of aching  pain,  tightness,  skin  irritation,  heaviness, and  muscle  cramps.  An  “A”  designation  is  for  patients  who  are asymptomatic. The  Etiology of a disease can be congenital,  primary, or secondary.  The pathophysiology for the venous problem can be due  to  reflux,  obstruction,  or  both.  Generally,  patients  with  C3  or C4 usually have nonoperative  management.  Their  treatment includes compression stockings and skin lubricants. C5 and C6 can undergo operative  intervention  depending on the etiology and anatomy  of the disease to prevent  a long-term  ulcer  recurrence.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPhyllodes tumors, also known as cystosarcoma phyl- lodes, are stromal tumors. They are well circumscribed and do not have a true capsule. The cut surface of one of these tumors tends to be mucoid.\r\nPhyllodes tend to occur in an older population\r\nwhen compared to fibroadenomas (FAs). FAs are also stromal tumors, and it is thought that phyllodes may arise from these benign tumors. Phyllodes tend to occur in the fourth decade of life and most commonly present as painless mobile masses. On mammogram and ultrasound, they are similar in appearance to fibroadenomas—smooth, solid, and with multilobulated margins. There may also be fluid within the mass on ultrasound, suggesting phyllodes over FA.\r\nSeventy-five percent of phyllodes tumors are benign. Similar to other stromal tumors, malignancy is difficult to establish and is based on histologic appearance. Stromal overgrowth is now considered the most important predictor of aggressive behavior. Other characteristics that are consid- ered are cellular atypia, mitotic activity, and tumor margins.\r\nPhyllodes tend to recur regardless of benign or malignant status\r\nincidence is 20–25% of recurrence. Current recom- mendations for initial surgical treatment of these tumors are wide local excision with at least a 1-cm margin. This can usually be done without requiring a mastectomy and is based on tumor–to–breast mass ratio. Regional lymph node metastases are rare and axillary evaluation is not warranted. Radiation ther- apy is also not indicated because this is not a mul- tifocal disease like ductal breast cancer. The tumors are only weakly radiosensitive; however, radiation therapy may offer some palliation for malignant or recurrent disease\r\n",

This is most commonly injured during the mobili- zation of the superior pedicle&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the relationship of the nerves associ- ated with the thyroid gland is important in avoiding injuries during thyroidectomy. The recurrent laryngeal nerve originates from the vagus and provides motor function to all muscles of the larynx, except the crico- thyroid muscle. On the right, the nerve loops under the subclavian artery, and on the left, it passes under the arch of the aorta and then continues to travel cephalad in the tracheal esophageal groove on each side to the insertion site at the cricothyroid joint (</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recurrent laryngeal nerve is intimately associated with the inferior thyroid artery, whereas the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is most com- monly in proximity to the superior thyroid artery and vein (). It is during the mobilization of the superior pedicle that most injuries to the external branchofthesuperiorlaryngealnerveoccur,whichis why these vessels must be ligated as close to the thy- roid as possible. Injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve results in the inability to attain and sustain high-pitched notes and the loss of ability to project one&rsquo;s voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The superior laryngeal nerve also originates from&nbsp;the vagus nerve and divides into internal and external branches.

Graves disease is the most common autoimmune dis- ease in the United States. The peak age of incidence is between 40 and 60 years. Patients will most often pres- ent with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, though in rare cases Graves disease can initially present with exoph- thalmos alone. Other clinical manifestations specific&nbsp;to Graves disease include diffuse goiter, dermopathy, and lymphoid hyperplasia. Common diseases associ- ated with Graves are diabetes mellitus, Addison disease,&nbsp;vitiligo, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, alopecia, and other autoimmune diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laboratory evaluation of Graves disease shows hyper- thyroidism with elevated T3/T4 levels and a low serum TSH, along with elevated TSI/TSAb. The differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism includes Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, toxic nodule, thyroiditis, and iatro- genic hyperthyroidism, which can be distinguished on thyroid scintigraphy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thyroid scintigraphy gives a picture of the func- tional status of the thyroid. It is based on the idea that active thyroid cells take up iodine. Thyroid scintigraphy uses 99mTc to allow us to see the rate of isotope uptake within the thyroid. Graves affects the whole thyroid and therefore projects a picture of high uptake throughout both lobes on thyroid scintigraphy.</p>\r\n",
