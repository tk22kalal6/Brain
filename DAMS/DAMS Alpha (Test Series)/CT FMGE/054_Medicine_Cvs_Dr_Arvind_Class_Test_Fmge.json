Some P waves do not conduct and there is no preceding increase in the P&ndash;R interval before the blocked P wave.

In contrast, Mobitz type I second-degree AV block is characterised by progressive lengthening of the P&ndash;R interval block.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Magnesium sulphate reduces the risk of torsades without affecting the QT interval and is first-line treatment. Isoproterenol and pacing increase the underlying ventricular rate and reduce the risk of recurrence, as torsades is a bradycardia-dependent arrhythmia, although they are infrequently needed. Hypokalaemia worsens the risk of torsades, so correction is beneficial. Procainamide is a class Ia anti-dysrhythmic drug that further prolongs ventricular repolarisation and would worsen the risk of torsades.</p>\r\n",
