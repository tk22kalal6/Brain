Based on the sputum production, the cases can be classified into “Significant” and “non-significant” expectoration. Normal sputum production is 60-100ml/day. Quantity more than 100ml/day is bronchorrhea. The presence of bronchorrhea, mucopurulent sputum with hemoptysis is significant expectoration. It is common in Airway/parenchymal disorders.\r\n\r\nNon-significant expectoration is common feature in Upper respiratory tract infection. It is also seen in Interstitial and Pleural disorders",
