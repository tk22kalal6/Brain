The oculomotor nerve originates in the\r\noculomotor nucleus of the midbrain, emerges from the anterior midbrain, and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The patient also has loss of the corneal reflex on the left side. The sensory limb of the corneal reflex is mediated by the nasociliary branch of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (CNV,). The motor component of the corneal reflex is carried primarily by the temporal branch of the facial\r\nnerve (CN VII). Like the oculomotor nerve, the nasociliary nerve enters the orbit through the superior\r\norbital fissure. Thus, a lesion involving the superior orbital fissure would cause the described deficits\r\nThe trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI), and superior ophthalmic vein also enter the orbit\r\nvia the superior orbital fissure.",
