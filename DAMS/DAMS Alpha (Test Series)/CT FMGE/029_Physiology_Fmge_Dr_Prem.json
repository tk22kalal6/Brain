      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An elevation of intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is common to the mechanism of excitation&ndash;contraction coupling in skeletal and smooth muscle. In skeletal muscle, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to troponin C, initiating the cross-bridge cycle. In smooth muscle, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to calmodulin. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>&ndash;calmodulin complex activates myosin light chain kinase, which phosphorylates myosin so that shortening can occur. The striated appearance of the sarcomeres and the presence of troponin are characteristic of skeletal, not smooth, muscle. Spontaneous depolarizations and gap junctions are characteristics of unitary smooth muscle but not skeletal muscle.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During repeated stimulation of a muscle fiber, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) more quickly than it can be reaccumulated; therefore, the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] does not return to resting levels as it would after a single twitch. The increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] allows more cross- bridges to form and, therefore, produces increased tension (tetanus). Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations do not change during the action potential. Very few Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> ions move into or out of the muscle cell, so bulk concentrations are unaffected. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels would, if anything, decrease during tetanus.</p>\r\n",

Surfactant appears between the 24th and the 35th gestational week. In the absence of surfactant, the surface tension of the small alveoli is too high. When the pressure on the small alveoli is too high (P = 2T/r), the small alveoli collapse into larger alveoli. There is decreased gas exchange with the larger, collapsed alveoli; and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoxemia, and cyanosis occur. The lack of surfactant also decreases lung compliance, making it harder to inflate the lungs, increasing the work of breathing, and producing dyspnea (shortness of breath).

In fetal hemoglobin, the β chains are replaced by γ chains, which do not bind 2,3-DPG, so the curve is shifted to the left.

The action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on the collecting duct (V2 receptors) is mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), although the other action of ADH (vascular smooth muscle, V1 receptors) is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3).

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the parent molecule in the anterior pituitary for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), &beta;-endorphin, &alpha;-lipotropin, and &beta;-lipotropin (and in the intermediary lobe for melanocyte-stimulating hormone [MSH]). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is not a member of this &ldquo;family&rdquo;; rather, it is a member of the thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) &ldquo;family.&rdquo; MSH, a component of POMC and ACTH, may stimulate melatonin production. Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone are produced by the adrenal cortex.</p>\r\n",
