      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nABPA\r\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an eosinophilic pulmonary disorder that occurs in response to allergic sensitization to antigens from Aspergillus species fungi. The predominant clinical presentation of ABPA is an asthmatic phenotype，often accompanied by cough with production of brownish plugs of mucus. ABPA has also been well described as a complication of cystic fibrosis. ABPA is a distinct diagnosis from simple asthma， characterized by prominent peripheral eosinophilia and elevated circulating levels of IgE (>417 IU/mL). Establishing a diagnosis of ABPA also requires establishing sensitivity to Aspergillus antigens by skin test reactivity, positive serum precipitins for Aspergillus and/or direct measurement of circulating specific IgG and IgE to Aspergillus. Central bronchiectasis is described as a classic finding on chest imaging in ABPA but is not necessary for making a diagnosis. Other possible findings on chest imaging include patchy infiltrates and evidence of mucus impaction. Systemic glucocorticoids may be used in the treatment of ABPA that is persistently symptomatic despite the use of inhaled therapies for asthma. Monoclonal antibody against IgE (Omalizumab) can be used in treating severe ABPA, particularly in individuals with ABPA as a complication of cystic fibrosis.\r\n",
