In that exercise, the man or the woman stimulates the erect penis until the earliest sensations of impending orgasm and ejaculation are felt. Penile stimulation is then stopped abruptly, and the coronal ridge of the penis is squeezed forcibly for several seconds. The technique is repeated several times.<br />\r\nDuring those exercises, called sensate focus exercises, the couple is given much reinforcement to lessen anxiety. They are urged to use fantasies to distract them from obsessive concerns about performance, which is termed spectatoring.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It does not have any clinically significant effect on histaminergic, GABAergic, or acetylcholinergic transmission. Paroxetine has clinically significant anticholinergic activity.
