      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cefaclor is a second-generation cephalosporin, which belongs to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins (like cefaclor), and carbapenems. This resistance is due to the presence of the mecA gene, which encodes an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) that beta-lactams cannot effectively bind to. As a result, cefclor is ineffective against MRSA and is not used in its treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Options Explained:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole) is often used for community-acquired MRSA infections and has good activity in many cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, may have variable activity against MRSA. While not first-line, it may be used if the isolate is shown to be sensitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vancomycin is a first-line agent for serious MRSA infections, especially those acquired in the hospital. It works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis through a mechanism different from beta-lactams, and MRSA strains are usually susceptible to it.</p>\r\n",
