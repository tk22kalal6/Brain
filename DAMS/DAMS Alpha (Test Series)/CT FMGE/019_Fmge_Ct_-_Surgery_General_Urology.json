This unfortunate complication can be avoided by care- ful attention to replacing the foreskin after catheterisation and by regular inspection of the penis whilst a catheter is in situ. Phimosis is usually picked up in childhood by a concerned parent that the child has problems passing urine or that his foreskin balloons up on passing urine. The condition is due to a narrowing of the preputial orifice and will usually require correction by circum- cision. Epispadias is a defect in penile development where the urethra opens on the ventral aspect of the penis. More commonly found is the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; defect; hypospadias, where the urethra opens on the dorsal aspect of the penis in an abnormal position anywhere from base of the shaft to the glans penis. Peyronie&rsquo;s disease manifests as an angulation of the erect penis due to fibro- sis. It is associated with Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture and atheroma.</p>\r\n",

Injuries to the urethra may be classified as anterior (penile and bulbar urethra) or posterior (membra- nous urethra). Causes of anterior urethral injuries include straddle inju- ries (as in this scenario), penile fractures and iatrogenic injury, e.g. by repeated attempts at catheterization. Posterior urethral injuries are more common and almost always associated with a pelvic fracture. Urethral injuries are more common in men (as they have a longer urethra). Presenting symptoms vary depending on the site of injury but include oedema and ecchymosis of the penis (in anterior blunt injuries), blood at the urethral meatus, a high-riding prostate (in pelvic fractures), scrotal haematoma, butterfly haematoma of the perineum (caused by extravasa- tion of blood not contained within Buck&rsquo;s fascia) and haematuria. If a ure- thral injury is suspected then urethral catheterization is contraindicated (as this could damage the urethra further). Diagnosis is with a retrograde urethrogram, where a Foley catheter is gently placed into the urethra and injected with contrast. Extravasation of dye indicates urethral rupture. Following diagnosis, a suprapubic catheter is inserted and surgical repair can be performed (sometimes as a delayed procedure). Complications of urethral injury include stricture formation leading to difficulty in void- ing, impotence and incontinence. In the multiply injured patient and in those with a pelvic fracture, a CT would be the most appropriate inves- tigation in the first instance, with a retrograde urethrogram being per- formed once the patient is stable.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hydrocele is a fluid collection within the processus and/or tunica vaginalis of the scrotum. Communicating hydroceles develop as a result of a failed closure of the pro- cessus vaginalis during embryologic development, allowing for peritoneal fluid to enter the scrotum. Non-communicating hydroceles have no connection to the perito- neum, and fluid accumulation develops from the mesothelial lining of the tunica vagi- nalis. The majority of infants born with hydroceles will have spontaneous resolution by the time they are 1 year old; thus, reassurance and observation are the most appropri- ate forms of management. Surgical repair is not typically done unless the hydrocele<br />\r\nis persistent past the first year of life (A). There are no available medical therapies for managing hydroceles (B). There is no indication for ultrasound with this classic pre- sentation (C). Hydroceles are sometimes confused with hernias; however, ultrasound is neither sensitive nor specific for distinguishing the two. Ultrasound would be more suitable for ruling out malignancy in a young adult with a testicular mass. There is no role for needle aspiration</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is vital for surgeons to understand the principles behind the various types of suture needles and their applications in surgery. Round-bodied needles tend to separate tissue fibres (i.e. instead of cutting them). They are therefore used in bowel and vascular anastomoses, as they encourage tissues to close tightly around the suture material, forming a leak-proof suture line.<br />\r\nBlunt round-point needles literally &lsquo;dissect&rsquo; rather than cut, and are useful when suturing extremely friable vascular tissue (e.g. liver, kidney, and spleen) and mass closure of the abdominal wall. For tough tissues like skin, ligament and tendon, reverse cutting needles are beneficial as their triangular cross section (with the apex on the outer convex curvature of the needle) offers the most effective tissue penetration with minimal collateral trauma. Reverse cutting needles<br />\r\nare especially useful in ophthalmic and cosmetic procedures, where minimal trauma, early tissue regeneration, and minimal scar formation are the primary aims.<br />\r\nBlunt taperpoint needles are employed when needlestick injury is a major concern (i.e. in high- risk patients). In contrast, tapercut needles combine the initial penetration of a cutting needle with the minimized trauma of the round-bodied needle, making this needle appropriate for use on fascia, ligament, or scar tissue</p>\r\n",

Frozen sections have no role in the diagnosis or treatment o melanoma. Once the dermis in invaded the probability of regional or distant metastases increases substantially. Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel lymph node biopsy became the primary method of identifying nodal drainage patterns replacing the prior suggested nodal drainage based on location. Tragus and anterior pinna lesions were thought to metastasize to the parotid gland and anterior cervical lymph nodes, whereas posterior pinna lesions were thought to spread to the mastoid bone and occipital and posterior cervical nodes. Complete surgical excision with 1 to 2 cm margin is the treatment of choice. Elective neck dissection is generally not recommended or lesions less than 1mm in thickness, whereas lymphadenectomy may offer survival advantage and better local control or lesions &gt; 1 mm in depth and positive sentinel lymph node biopsy.<br />\r\nInterferon alpha-2b is recommended or patients with lymph node positive disease.
