      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nOsteoporosis is characterized by reduction of normally mineralized osteoid matrix.\r\n\r\nOsteoporosis\r\nOsteoporosis is a condition of bone atrophy. It is a lesion in which the volume of bone tissue per unit volume of anatomical bone is reduced. It may be generalized (most common) or localized (following pressure or disuse). The hallmark is a reduction in the amount of osteoid matrix, which, however, remains normally mineralized. It is therefore distinct from osteomalacia in which there is abundant osteoid which is poorly calcified. In osteoporosis the bony trabeculae are greatly thinned which significantly reduces the tensile strength of the bone and renders it at increased risk of pathological fracture.\r\nIt is only visible on plain films when the calcium content is approximately halved. More subtle changes can be appreciated by use of DEXA scanning.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\nFractures are treated according to their site and mechanism of injury. Those deemed to occur as a result of osteoporosis should also be addressed medically to treat the underlying osteoporosis.\r\nDrugs that can be prescribed to prevent fragility fractures include bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate and zoledronic acid) and non- bisphosphonates (raloxifene, denosumab, teriparatide, calcitriol and hormone replacement therapy).\r\nCalcium and vitamin D supplements are also administered.\r\nIndividuals at risk of fragility fractures should also be considered for prophylactic medical treatment as outlined above.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThis is an unstable ankle injury that is likely to require surgical fixation. The immediate management of a displaced ankle fracture is to reduce the fracture to prevent soft tissues compromise and help reduce swelling. This can be performed before an x-ray is obtained if performing the x-ray will significantly delay reduction.\r\n\r\nAnkle injuries\r\n \r\nAn ankle fracture relates to a fracture around the tibio-talar joint. It generally refers to a fracture involving the lateral, and/or medial and/or posterior malleolus. Pilon and Tillaux fractures are also considered to be ankle fractures, but are not covered here.\r\nAnkle fractures are common. They effect men and women in equal numbers, but men have a higher rate as young adults (sports and contact injuries), and women a higher rate post-menopausal (fragility type fracture).\r\n\r\nOsseous anatomy\r\nThe ankle (or mortise) joint consists of the distal tibia (tibial plafond and posterior malleolus), the distal fibula (lateral malleolus), and the talus. The main movement at the ankle joint is plantar and dorsiflexion.\r\n\r\nLigamentous anatomy\r\nMedial side: Deltoid ligament. This is divided into superficial and deep portions. It is the primary restraint to valgus tilting of the talus.\r\nLateral side: Lateral ligament complex consisting from anterior to posterior of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and the posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL). Together they resist valgus stress to the ankle, and are a restraint to anterior translation of the talus within the mortise joint.\r\nSyndesmosis: The syndesmosis is a ligament complex between the distal tibia and fibula, holding the two bones together. It is fundamental to the integrity of the ankle joint, and its disruption leads to instability. It consists of (from anterior to posterior) the anterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), the transverse tibiofibular ligament (TTFL), the interosseous membrane, and the posterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL).\r\n\r\nPresentation and initial management\r\nPatients will present following a traumatic event with a painful, swollen ankle, and reluctance/inability to weight bear. The Ottawa rules can be applied to differentiate between an ankle fracture and sprain, but can be unreliable.\r\nIn high energy injuries, management should follow ATLS principles to identify more significant injuries first. Neurovascular status of the foot should be documented, and open injuries should be excluded. If an open injury is identified, it should be managed in line with BOAST 4 principles1. If an obvious deformity exists, it should be reduced as soon as possible with appropriate analgesia or conscious sedation.\r\nRadiographs of clearly deformed or dislocated joints are not necessary, and removing the pressure on the surrounding soft tissues from the underlying bony deformity is the priority. If the fracture pattern is not clinically obvious then plain radiographs are appropriate and will guide the subsequent manipulation during\r\n \r\nplaster-of-paris below knee backslab application.\r\nImaging\r\nAP, lateral and mortise views (20 degrees internal rotation) are essential to evaluate fracture displacement and syndesmotic injury. Decreased tibiofibular overlap, medial joint clear space and lateral talar shift all indicate a syndesmotic injury. (In subtle cases of shift, imaging the uninjured ankle can be helpful as a proportion of the population have little or no tibiotalar overlap-reference 2.)\r\nWhere there is suspicion of syndesmosis involvement in the absence of radiographic evidence, stress radiographs can be diagnostic.\r\nComplex fracture patterns (and increasingly posterior malleolar fractures) are best defined using CT.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification\r\nThe most commonly used classifications are Lauge-Hansen and Danis-Weber.\r\n\r\nLauge-Hansen\r\nComprises two parts: first part is the foot position, and the second part is the force applied. Useful for understanding the forces involved and therefore predict the ligamentous or bony injury. Results in four injury patterns:\r\nSupination - Adduction (SA) - 10-20% Supination - External rotation (SER) - 40-75% Pronation - Abduction (PA) - 5-20% Pronation - External rotation (PER) - 5-20%\r\n\r\nNot often used in clinical practice but good for understanding the principles of ankle fracture.\r\n\r\nDanis-Weber\r\nCommonly used. Based on the level of the fibula fracture in relation to the syndesmosis. The more proximal, the greater the risk of syndesmotic injury and therefore fracture instability.\r\nA - fracture below the level of the syndesmosis\r\nB - fracture at the level of the syndesmosis / level of the tibial plafond\r\nC - fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. This includes Maisonneuve fractures (proximal fibula fracture), which can be associated with ankle instability. Beware the high fibula fracture - it may be an ankle fracture!\r\nThe Weber classification is based purely on the the lateral side. All injuries can include a medial or posterior bony or ligamentous injury which also dictates fracture\r\n \r\nstability (bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures are more unstable).\r\nTreatment\r\nWhen deciding upon treatment for an ankle fracture, one must consider both the fracture and the patient. Diabetic patients and smokers are at greater risk of post- operative complication, especially wound problems and infection. Likewise, the long term outcome of post-traumatic arthritis from a malunited ankle fracture is extremely important for a young patient, but not as relevant in the elderly. Therefore, normal surgical decision processes apply as with all fractures.\r\n\r\nDefining stability of an ankle fracture underpins the treatment decision. Weber A - Unimalleolar Weber A Weber fractures by definition are stable and therefore can be mobilised fully weight bearing in an ankle boot.\r\nWeber C - Fractures tend to include syndesmotic disruption and are usually bimalleolar (either bony or ligamentous). They are therefore unstable and usually require operative fixation. In addition to the fracture fixation, the syndesmosis usually requires reconstruction/augmentation with screws to restore the joint integrity and function.\r\n\r\nWeber B - B fractures vary greatly. They can be part of a trimalleolar injury and therefore extremely unstable, requiring fixation. Alternatively, a uni-malleolar Weber B fracture can be a stable injury, and therefore mobilised immediately in an ankle boot. Defining the stability can be challenging, and often involves stress radiographs, or a trial of mobilisation and repeat radiographs. However, treating undisplaced ankle fractures in a below knee plaster, non-weight bearing for six weeks is still widely practised, and a safe approach.\r\nWhen operative fixation is appropriate, it is usually via open reduction and internal fixation using plates and screws. It must be carried out when soft tissue swelling has settled in order to minimise the risk of wound problems. This can often take a week to settle.\r\nThe use of fibula nails is expanding, but is not yet mainstream. Ankle fractures can also be treated with external fixation, or with a hind foot nail in patients who need fixation but where soft tissue or bone quality is poor.\r\n\r\nPost operative management\r\nAnkle fractures generally take 6 weeks to unite enough to prevent secondary displacement. This is therefore an appropriate time period to keep a cast on in a conservatively managed patient. Weight bearing post-operatively depends on the quality of the fixation and bone quality, and preference varies between surgeons, ranging from aggressive early mobilisation to a period of non-weight bearing. Return to activities takes approximately three months, and often requires assistance of a physiotherapist to improve range-of-movement and muscle strengthening.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThis is a Weber B fracture and therefore potentially unstable. Medial malleolar tenderness indicates deltoid ligament injury. As the fracture is currently undisplaced and the ankle mortise is congruent, the injury can be initially managed conservatively in a moon boot but the patient should be monitored in the outpatient clinic for fracture displacement in the first few weeks.\r\n \r\nAnkle injuries\r\nAn ankle fracture relates to a fracture around the tibio-talar joint. It generally refers to a fracture involving the lateral, and/or medial and/or posterior malleolus. Pilon and Tillaux fractures are also considered to be ankle fractures, but are not covered here.\r\nAnkle fractures are common. They effect men and women in equal numbers, but men have a higher rate as young adults (sports and contact injuries), and women a higher rate post-menopausal (fragility type fracture).\r\n\r\nOsseous anatomy\r\nThe ankle (or mortise) joint consists of the distal tibia (tibial plafond and posterior malleolus), the distal fibula (lateral malleolus), and the talus. The main movement at the ankle joint is plantar and dorsiflexion.\r\nLigamentous anatomy\r\nMedial side: Deltoid ligament. This is divided into superficial and deep portions. It is the primary restraint to valgus tilting of the talus.\r\n\r\nLateral side: Lateral ligament complex consisting from anterior to posterior of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and the posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL). Together they resist valgus stress to the ankle, and are a restraint to anterior translation of the talus within the mortise joint.\r\n\r\nSyndesmosis: The syndesmosis is a ligament complex between the distal tibia and fibula, holding the two bones together. It is fundamental to the integrity of the ankle joint, and its disruption leads to instability. It consists of (from anterior to posterior) the anterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), the transverse tibiofibular ligament (TTFL), the interosseous membrane, and the posterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL).\r\nPresentation and initial management\r\nPatients will present following a traumatic event with a painful, swollen ankle, and reluctance/inability to weight bear. The Ottawa rules can be applied to differentiate between an ankle fracture and sprain, but can be unreliable.\r\nIn high energy injuries, management should follow ATLS principles to identify more significant injuries first. Neurovascular status of the foot should be documented, and open injuries should be excluded. If an open injury is identified, it should be managed in line with BOAST 4 principles1. If an obvious deformity exists, it should be reduced as soon as possible with appropriate analgesia or conscious sedation.\r\nRadiographs of clearly deformed or dislocated joints are not necessary, and removing the pressure on the surrounding soft tissues from the underlying bony\r\n \r\ndeformity is the priority. If the fracture pattern is not clinically obvious then plain radiographs are appropriate and will guide the subsequent manipulation during plaster-of-paris below knee backslab application.\r\nImaging\r\nAP, lateral and mortise views (20 degrees internal rotation) are essential to evaluate fracture displacement and syndesmotic injury. Decreased tibiofibular overlap, medial joint clear space and lateral talar shift all indicate a syndesmotic injury. (In subtle cases of shift, imaging the uninjured ankle can be helpful as a proportion of the population have little or no tibiotalar overlap-reference 2.)\r\nWhere there is suspicion of syndesmosis involvement in the absence of radiographic evidence, stress radiographs can be diagnostic.\r\nComplex fracture patterns (and increasingly posterior malleolar fractures) are best defined using CT.\r\nClassification\r\nThe most commonly used classifications are Lauge-Hansen and Danis-Weber.\r\n\r\nLauge-Hansen\r\nComprises two parts: first part is the foot position, and the second part is the force applied. Useful for understanding the forces involved and therefore predict the ligamentous or bony injury. Results in four injury patterns:\r\nSupination - Adduction (SA) - 10-20% Supination - External rotation (SER) - 40-75% Pronation - Abduction (PA) - 5-20% Pronation - External rotation (PER) - 5-20%\r\n\r\nNot often used in clinical practice but good for understanding the principles of ankle fracture.\r\n\r\nDanis-Weber\r\nCommonly used. Based on the level of the fibula fracture in relation to the syndesmosis. The more proximal, the greater the risk of syndesmotic injury and therefore fracture instability.\r\nA - fracture below the level of the syndesmosis\r\nB - fracture at the level of the syndesmosis / level of the tibial plafond\r\nC - fracture above the level of the syndesmosis. This includes Maisonneuve fractures (proximal fibula fracture), which can be associated with ankle instability. Beware the high fibula fracture - it may be an ankle fracture!\r\nThe Weber classification is based purely on the the lateral side. All injuries can include a medial or posterior bony or ligamentous injury which also dictates fracture\r\n \r\nstability (bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures are more unstable).\r\nTreatment\r\nWhen deciding upon treatment for an ankle fracture, one must consider both the fracture and the patient. Diabetic patients and smokers are at greater risk of post- operative complication, especially wound problems and infection. Likewise, the long term outcome of post-traumatic arthritis from a malunited ankle fracture is extremely important for a young patient, but not as relevant in the elderly. Therefore, normal surgical decision processes apply as with all fractures.\r\n\r\nDefining stability of an ankle fracture underpins the treatment decision. Weber A - Unimalleolar Weber A Weber fractures by definition are stable and therefore can be mobilised fully weight bearing in an ankle boot.\r\nWeber C - Fractures tend to include syndesmotic disruption and are usually bimalleolar (either bony or ligamentous). They are therefore unstable and usually require operative fixation. In addition to the fracture fixation, the syndesmosis usually requires reconstruction/augmentation with screws to restore the joint integrity and function.\r\nWeber B - B fractures vary greatly. They can be part of a trimalleolar injury and therefore extremely unstable, requiring fixation. Alternatively, a uni-malleolar Weber B fracture can be a stable injury, and therefore mobilised immediately in an ankle boot. Defining the stability can be challenging, and often involves stress radiographs, or a trial of mobilisation and repeat radiographs. However, treating undisplaced ankle fractures in a below knee plaster, non-weight bearing for six weeks is still widely practised, and a safe approach.\r\nWhen operative fixation is appropriate, it is usually via open reduction and internal fixation using plates and screws. It must be carried out when soft tissue swelling has settled in order to minimise the risk of wound problems. This can often take a week to settle.\r\nThe use of fibula nails is expanding, but is not yet mainstream. Ankle fractures can also be treated with external fixation, or with a hind foot nail in patients who need fixation but where soft tissue or bone quality is poor.\r\n\r\nPost operative management\r\nAnkle fractures generally take 6 weeks to unite enough to prevent secondary displacement. This is therefore an appropriate time period to keep a cast on in a conservatively managed patient. Weight bearing post-operatively depends on the quality of the fixation and bone quality, and preference varies between surgeons, ranging from aggressive early mobilisation to a period of non-weight bearing. Return to activities takes approximately three months, and often requires assistance of a physiotherapist to improve range-of-movement and muscle strengthening\r\n",

Revascularisation using vascular shunts should be performed before skeletal fixation.<br><br>Open fractures<br>The term open fracture refers to a disruption of the bony cortex associated with a breach in the overlying skin. Any wound that is present in the same limb as a fracture should be suspected as being representative of an open fracture. One of the main problems with open fractures is the associated injuries to the surrounding soft tissues. Whilst the skin is usually relatively resistant to trauma, underlying muscle can be damaged or devitalised, nerves, blood vessels and periosteum may all be disrupted the degree to which this occurs correlates with the severity of the injury and the outcome. These can be graded using the Gustilo and Anderson system &#40;see below&#41;.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/629398045.1.png\" xss=removed><br></p><p>In Type IIIc injuries, the mangled extremity scoring system &#40;MESS&#41; can help to predict the need for primary amputation.<br><br>Key points for initial management<br>• Remove obvious contaminants from very contaminated wounds in the ED<br>• Wound lavage should usually be undertaken in the OR<br>• Early wound photography should be performed<br>• Consider transfer of complex cases to centres that provide orthoplastic care<br>• All wounds should be managed within 24 hours and high velocity ones within 12 hours, those with vascular compromise should be managed immediately<br>• CT angiography is useful in delineating the extent of concommitant vascular injury<br></p>",
