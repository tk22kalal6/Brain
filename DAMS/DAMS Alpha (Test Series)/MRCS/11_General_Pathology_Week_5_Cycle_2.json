Potent mediators of vascular dilatation include; histamine, prostaglandins, nitric oxide, platelet activating factor, complement C5a (and C3a) and lysosomal compounds. Although serotonin is associated with acute inflammation it is a vasoconstrictor. The effects of serotonin are dependent upon the state of the vessels in the tissues. Intact and healthy tissues and vessels will respond to a serotonin infusion with vasodilation (hence the flushing seen in carcinoid syndrome). In contrast it worsens cardiac ischaemia in myocardial infarcts when released from damaged platelets.",
