      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nEctopic testes are those that come to lie outside the normal range of embryological descent (i.e. in the superficial inguinal pouch). Other sites of ectopic testes include; base of penis, femoral triangle and perineum.\r\n\r\nTesticular disorders-paediatric\r\n\r\nTesticular disorders\r\n\r\nTesticular disorders are some of the commonest conditions present in paediatric urological practice.\r\n\r\nCryptorchidism\r\n\r\n• The embryological descent of the testicle from within the abdominal cavity may be subject to a number of variations. Distinctions need to be made clinically from a non descended testis and a testis that is retractile.\r\n\r\n• Testis that lie outside the normal path of embryological descent are termed ectopic testis. Undescended testis occurs in 1% of male infants. Where the testis does not lie in an intra scrotal location, its location should be ascertained (by laparoscopy in first instance). Where both testes are absent, the infant may be intersex.\r\n\r\n• MRI scanning may reveal intra-abdominal testes; however a GA is often needed to perform this investigation in this age group.\r\n\r\n• Testes that are undescended should be placed in the scrotum after 1 year of age, as the testosterone surge that may facilitate descent occurs at 6 months of age.\r\n\r\n• Where the testes lie distally e.g. Superficial inguinal pouch an open orchidopexy is the procedure of choice.\r\n\r\n• With abdominal testes a laparoscopy should be performed. The risk of seminoma is increased in individuals with a non descended testes and this risk is not reduced by orchidopexy.\r\n\r\nTesticular torsion\r\n\r\n• Typically the patient has severe sudden onset of scrotal pain. The difficulty in paediatric practice is the lack of clear history.\r\n\r\n• On examination the testis is tender and enlarged.\r\n\r\n• Management is by surgical exploration.\r\n\r\n• Delay beyond 6 hours is associated with low salvage rates.\r\n\r\n• A torted hyatid produces pain that is far more localised and the testis itself should feel normal. However, diagnostic doubt often exists and in such cases surgical exploration is warranted.\r\n\r\nHydrocele\r\n\r\n• Occur secondary to patent processus vaginalis\r\n\r\n• Present as fluid filling in scrotum or as cyst of the spermatic cord\r\n\r\n• Communicating hydroceles are treated by a trans inguinal ligation of the PPV\r\n\r\n• Cystic hydroceles in older children may be treated with scrotal exploration",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nA patent urachus will present with umbilical urinary discharge. The skin may become macerated if not properly cared for. The discharge is most likely to be present when intra-abdominal pressure is raised. It is associated with posterior urethral valves.\r\n\r\nPaediatric umbilical disorders\r\n\r\nEmbryology\r\nDuring development the umbilicus has two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The arteries are continuous with the internal iliac arteries and the vein is continuous with the falciform ligament (ductus venosus). After birth the cord dessicates and separates and the umbilical ring closes.\r\nUmbilical hernia\r\n \r\nUp to 20% of neonates may have an umbilical hernia, it is more common in premature infants. The majority of these hernias will close spontaneously (may take between 12 months and three years). Strangulation is rare.\r\nParaumbilical hernia\r\nThese are due to defects in the linea alba that are in close proximity to the umbilicus. The edges of a paraumbilical hernia are more clearly defined than those of an umbilical hernia. They are less likely to resolve spontaneously than an umbilical hernia.\r\n\r\nOmphalitis\r\nThis condition consists of infection of the umbilicus. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus is the commonest cause. The condition is potentially serious as infection may spread rapidly through the umbilical vessels in neonates with a risk of portal pyaemia, and portal vein thrombosis. Treatment is usually with a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics.\r\nUmbilical granuloma\r\nThese consist of cherry red lesions surrounding the umbilicus, they may bleed on contact and be a site of seropurulent discharge. Infection is unusual and they will often respond favorably to chemical cautery with topically applied silver nitrate.\r\n\r\nPersistent urachus\r\nThis is characterised by urinary discharge from the umbilicus. It is caused by persistence of the urachus which attaches to the bladder. They are associated with other urogenital abnormalities.\r\nPersistent vitello-intestinal duct\r\n\r\nThis will typically present as an umbilical discharge that discharges small bowel content. Complete persistence of the duct is a rare condition. Much more common is the persistence of part of the duct (Meckels diverticulum). Persistent vitello-intestinal ducts are best imaged using a contrast study to delineate the anatomy and are managed by laparotomy and surgical closure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nIntestinal malrotation with volvulus is treated with a Ladd's procedure. Intestinal malrotation in neonates\r\n\r\nNormal embryology\r\nDuring the fourth week of embryogenesis the intestine moves into the abdomen via the base of the umbilicus. Through a combination of foetal growth and bowel maturation the bowel resides in the abdominal cavity and undergoes a\r\n270o counterclockwise twist. At the conclusion of this process the ligament of Treitz lies to the left of the spine and the caecum in the right lower quadrant. Malrotation occurs when the rotational process described is incomplete. Typically the duodenal loop lies to the left of the caecum and therefore lacks 90 o of its 270o rotation. It becomes fixed in this position with peritoneal attachments (Ladds bands).\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\nBilious vomiting is the cardinal symptom and sign. In most cases there are no antecedent symptoms. If untreated then gut perfusion may be impaired with resultant development of further symptoms.\r\n \r\nDiagnosis\r\nThe main problem is that the infant develops mid gut volvulus. In this situation the bowel undergoes a 720o twist, the bowel viability depends upon a narrow mesentery containing the superior mesenteric artery. To ascertain whether this has occurred the two main tests include an abdominal ultrasound scan to determine the relationship between the superior mesenteric artery and vein (normally SMA lies to the left of the SMV). This test is complemented with an upper GI contrast series and this aims to establish that the DJ flexure is correctly sited to the left of the vertebral bodies.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\nLaparotomy and division of adhesional bands (Ladds procedure). The division of the congenital adhesions allows widening of the small bowel mesentery. The bowel is untwisted and assessed for viability. The bowel is returned to the abdominal cavity in the non rotated fashion with the small bowel on the right hand side and the large bowel on the left, the caecum is positioned in the left upper quadrant. Because the caecum is located in this new location many surgeons will also perform an appendicectomy due to the diagnostic difficulty posed in diagnosing appendicitis in this group of patients.\r\n",

For example, if the problem was that the surgical department was not using the prosthetic mesh material in the most effective manner during the surgery, such as incorrect placement or incorrect sizing, then an operational audit would be more appropriate. The audit would focus on evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the surgical procedures being performed, including the policies and procedures, resources, and performance metrics. The audit would identify any inefficiencies or breakdowns in the day-to-day operations that are contributing to the problem and recommend solutions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the surgical procedures. So, in summary, the type of audit that is most appropriate depends on the nature of the problem being investigated. If the problem is related to a breakdown in the system or technology infrastructure, then a system-based audit would be more appropriate. If the problem is related to day-to-day operations, policies, and procedures, then an operational audit would be more appropriate\r\n",
