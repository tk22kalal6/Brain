Its thoracic portion is 2.5- 3.5 cm in length and\r\nruns superolaterally to the sternoclavicular joint.\r\nIn the thorax\r\nThe vessel is in contact, from below upwards, with the trachea, left\r\nrecurrent laryngeal nerve, left margin of the oesophagus. Anteriorly the left\r\nbrachiocephalic vein runs across the artery, and the cardiac branches from\r\nthe left vagus descend in front of it. These structures together with the\r\nthymus and the anterior margins of the left lung and pleura separate the\r\nartery from the manubrium.\r\nIn the neck\r\nThe artery runs superiorly deep to sternocleidomastoid and then enters the\r\nanterior triangle. At this point it lies within the carotid sheath with the vagus\r\nnerve and the internal jugular vein. Posteriorly the sympathetic trunk lies\r\nbetween the vessel and the prevertebral fascia. At the level of C7 the\r\nvertebral artery and thoracic duct lie behind it. The anterior tubercle of C6\r\ntransverse process is prominent and the artery can be compressed against\r\nthis structure (it corresponds to the level of the cricoid).\r\nAnteriorly at C6 the omohyoid muscle passes superficial to the artery.\r\nWithin the carotid sheath the jugular vein lies lateral to the artery.\r\nRight common carotid artery\r\nThe right common carotid arises from the brachiocephalic artery. The right\r\ncommon carotid artery corresponds with the cervical portion of the left\r\ncommon carotid, except that there is no thoracic duct on the right. The\r\noesophagus is less closely related to the right carotid than the left.\r\nSummary points about the carotid anatomy\r\nPath\r\nPasses behind the sternoclavicular joint (12% patients above this level) to\r\nthe upper border of the thyroid cartilage, to divide into the external (ECA)\r\nand internal carotid arteries (ICA).\r\nRelations\r\n• Level of 6th cervical vertebra crossed by omohyoid\r\n• Then passes deep to the thyrohyoid, sternohyoid, sternomastoid\r\nmuscles.\r\n• Passes anterior to the carotid tubercle (transverse process 6th\r\ncervical vertebra)-NB compression here stops haemorrhage.\r\n• The inferior thyroid artery passes posterior to the common carotid\r\nartery.\r\n• Then : Left common carotid artery crosses the thoracic duct, Right\r\ncommon carotid artery crossed by recurrent laryngeal nerve",

The labyrinthine artery is long and slender and may arise from the lower part of the basilar artery. It accompanies the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves into the internal auditory meatus. The posterior cerebral artery is often larger than the superior cerebellar artery and it is separated from the vessel, near it's origin, by the oculomotor nerve. Arterial decompression is a well established therapy for trigeminal neuralgia.",
