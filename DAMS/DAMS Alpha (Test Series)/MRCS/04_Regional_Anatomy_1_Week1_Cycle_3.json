      "solution": "Correct Answer: B. Chest drains There are a number of different indications for chest drain insertion. In general terms large bore chest drains are preferred for trauma and haemothorax drainage. Smaller diameter chest drains can be used for pneumothorax or pleural effusion drainage. Insertion can be performed either using anatomical guidance or through ultrasound guidance. In the exam, the anatomical method is usually tested. It is advised that chest drains are placed in the 'safe triangle'. The triangle is located in the mid axillary line of the 5th intercostal space. It is bordered by: Anterior edge latissimus dorsi, the lateral border of pectoralis major, a line superior to the horizontal level of the nipple, and the apex below the axilla. Another triangle is situated behind the scapula. It is bounded above by the trapezius, below by the latissimus dorsi, and laterally by the vertebral border of the scapula; the floor is partly formed by the rhomboid major. If the scapula is drawn forward by folding the arms across the chest, and the trunk bent forward, parts of the sixth and seventh ribs and the interspace between them become subcutaneous and available for auscultation. The space is therefore known as the triangle of auscultation.",

This consists of flexion of the 4th and 5th interphalangeal joints and extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints. The effects are potentiated when flexor digitorum profundus is  not affected, and the clawing is more pronounced.More proximally sited ulnar nerve lesions produce a milder clinical picture owing to the simultaneous paralysis of flexor digitorum profundus (ulnar half). This is the 'ulnar paradox', due to the more proximal level of transection the hand will typically not have a claw like appearance that may be seen following a more distal injury. The first dorsal interosseous muscle will be affected as it is supplied by the ulnar nerve.",

The nerve descends between the axillary artery and vein, posterior to the cutaneous nerve of the forearm and then lies anterior to triceps on the medial side of the brachial artery. In the distal half of the arm it passes through the medial intermuscular septum, and continues between this structure and the medial head of triceps to enter the forearm between the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the olecranon. It may be injured at this site in this scenario.",
