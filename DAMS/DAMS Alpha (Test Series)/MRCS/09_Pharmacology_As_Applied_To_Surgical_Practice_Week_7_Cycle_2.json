      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)<br><br>This is a process referred to as data dredging and can lead to erroneous results. Post hoc testing in general can be a problem in research and to try and minimise the potential for error some advocate the use of the Bonferroni method. This adjusts the test to take account of the number of tests that have been performed on the data.<br><br>Statistics<br>Statistics is a topic that generally strikes fear and dread into most surgeons hearts. The MRCS is not an examination designed to test mathematical skill but the examiners do expect you to have working knowledge of commonly used tests so that you can appraise the literature properly.<br><br>Data types<br>Before selecting a method of statistical analysis it is imperative that the type of data to be analysed is correctly categorised. Commonly used terms include nominal, ordinal, interval and continuous.<br><br>Analysing data<br>Having ascribed the data it is then possible to begin the process of analysis. Nominal data is often tabulated into categories because of the nature of the underlying data sets. Continuous data may be displayed graphically often as individual data points.<br>When the sample size is large enough, continuous data can be analysed to determine the distribution of the data points. Often, but not always these will be in the form of a gaussian distribution. Determining whether data is normally distributed or not is key to making sense of the subsequent statistical tests. Parametric tests are used to test normally distributed data, the T Test is one of the best examples. Data which is not normally distributed cannot be analysed in this way and a non parametric test must be used. Examples of such tests include Chi Squared and Mann Whitney U tests. Chi squared tests often appear in the medical literature. There are some assumptions that are made in relation to Chi squared tests; these include the need to use 2 degrees of freedom (usually) and the minimum sample size. Where the sample size is small then a different test is appropriate and the Fishers exact test is often used.<br>In situations where data is normally distributed and paired samples are taken from the same individuals (such as following an intervention) then the paired T Test may be used.<br><br>Multiple testing and post hoc analysis<br>In the ideal world statistical analysis is conducted on data that is collected prospectively according to pre set power calculations and defined end points. Occasionally, data does not produce an expected outcome or a certain type of patient appears to have a different result. Subsequent analysis of such groups is termed a post hoc analysis. This can be perfectly legitimate, alternatively it can represent the last ditch attempt of a researcher to try and find any aspect of the data that is worthwhile. This can lead to errors and false rejection of a null hypothesis. A statistically significant result is more likely to occur if the same dataset is subjected to multiple analyses. To counteract this problem some researchers will apply a Bonferroni correction, this adjusts the analysis to allow for multiple testing.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/679422417.1.png\" xss=removed></p>",

It is often used to graphically display meta analyses of randomised controlled trials.\r\n\r\nThe graph may be plotted on a natural logarithmic scale when using odds ratios or other ratio-based effect measures, so that the confidence intervals are symmetrical about the means from each study and to ensure undue emphasis is not given to odds ratios greater than 1 when compared to those less than 1. The area of each square is proportional to the study's weight in the meta-analysis. The overall meta- analysed measure of effect is often represented on the plot as a vertical line. This meta-analysed measure of effect is commonly plotted as a diamond, the lateral points of which indicate confidence intervals for this estimate.\r\n\r\nA vertical line representing no effect is also plotted. If the confidence intervals for individual studies overlap with this line, it demonstrates that at the given level of confidence their effect sizes do not differ from no effect for the individual study.

It is often given in combination with a short acting opiate such as fentanyl for analgesic purposes.
