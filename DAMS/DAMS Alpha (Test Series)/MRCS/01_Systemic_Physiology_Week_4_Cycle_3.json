The colon is an important site of water absorption, however, its overall contribution is relatively small. The importance of the colonic component to water absorption may increase following extensive small bowel resections.\r\nWater absorption\r\nDuring a 24 hours period the average person will ingest up to 2000ml of liquid orally. In addition a further 8000ml of fluid will enter the small bowel as gastrointestinal secretions. Intestinal water absorption is a passive process and is related to solute load. In the jejunum the active absorption of glucose and amino acids will create a concentration gradient that water will flow across. In the ileum most water is absorbed by a process of facilitated diffusion (with sodium).\r\nApproximately 150ml of water enters the colon daily, most is absorbed, the colon can adapt to, and increase this amount following resection.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: B. Hypercapnia will tend to produce cerebral vasodilation. This is of considerable importance in patients with cranial trauma as it may increase intracranial pressure.\r\n Applied neurophysiology\r\n• Pressure within the cranium is governed by the Monroe-Kelly doctrine. This considers the skull as a closed box. Increases in mass can be accommodated by loss of CSF. Once a critical point is reached (usually 100- 120ml of CSF lost) there can be no further compensation and ICP rises sharply. The next step is that pressure will begin to equate with MAP and neuronal death will occur. Herniation will also accompany this process.\r\n• The CNS can autoregulate its own blood supply. Vaso constriction and dilatation of the cerebral blood vessels is the primary method by which this occurs. Extremes of blood pressure can exceed this capacity resulting in risk of stroke. Other metabolic factors such as hypercapnia will also cause vasodilation, which is of importance in ventilating head injured patients.\r\n• The brain can only metabolise glucose, when glucose levels fall, consciousness will be impaired.\r\n",

They act in the medullary and cortical aspects of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This results in a decreased medullary concentration gradient and increases free water excretion (as well as loss of sodium). Because loop diuretics result in the loss of both sodium and water they are less frequently associated with hyponatraemia than thiazide diuretics (these latter agents act in the cortex and do not affect urine concentrating ability).\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: C. The normal intracranial pressure is between 7 and 15 mm Hg. The brain can accommodate increases up to 24 mm Hg, thereafter clinical features will become evident.\r\nApplied neurophysiology\r\n• Pressure within the cranium is governed by the Monroe-Kelly doctrine. This considers the skull as a closed box. Increases in mass can be accommodated by loss of CSF. Once a critical point is reached (usually 100- 120ml of CSF lost) there can be no further compensation and ICP rises sharply. The next step is that pressure will begin to equate with MAP and neuronal death will occur. Herniation will also accompany this process.\r\n• The CNS can autoregulate its own blood supply. Vaso constriction and dilatation of the cerebral blood vessels is the primary method by which this occurs. Extremes of blood pressure can exceed this capacity resulting in risk of stroke. Other metabolic factors such as hypercapnia will also cause vasodilation, which is of importance in ventilating head injured patients.\r\n• The brain can only metabolise glucose, when glucose levels fall, consciousness will be impaired.\r\n",

Anatomical dead space is measured by Fowlers method.\r\nA patient inhales 100% oxygen to empty the conducting zone gases of nitrogen and then exhales through a mouthpiece which analyses the nitrogen concentration at the mouth. Initially the exhaled gases contain no nitrogen as this is dead space gas; the nitrogen concentration will increase as the alveolar gases are exhaled. Nitrogen which is measured following the breath of 100% oxygen must then have come only from gas exchanging areas of the lung and not dead space.\r\nAlveolar ventilation\r\n- Minute ventilation is the total volume of gas ventilated per minute.\r\nMV (ml/min)= tidal volume x Respiratory rate (resps/min).\r\n\r\n• Dead space ventilation describes the volume of gas not involved in exchange in the blood.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 types:\r\n1. Anatomical dead space: 150mls\r\n• Volume of gas in the respiratory tree not involved in gaseous exchange: mouth, pharynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal bronchioles\r\n• Measured by Fowlers method\r\n• Increased by:\r\n• Standing, increased size of person, increased lung volume and drugs causing bronchodilatation e.g. Adrenaline\r\n\r\n2.
