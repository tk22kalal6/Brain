The other\r\nparameters tend to decrease during an acute phase response. \r\nAcute phase proteins\r\n• CRP\r\n• procalcitonin\r\n• ferritin\r\n• fibrinogen\r\n• alpha-1 antitrypsin\r\n• caeruloplasmin\r\n• serum amyloid A\r\n• haptoglobin\r\n• complement\r\nDuring the acute phase response the liver decreases the production of other proteins\r\n(sometimes referred to as negative acute phase proteins). Examples include:\r\n• albumin\r\n• transthyretin (formerly known as prealbumin)\r\n• transferrin\r\n• retinol binding protein\r\n• cortisol binding protein\r\nLevels of CRP are commonly measured in acutely unwell patients. CRP is a protein\r\nsynthesised in the liver and binds to phosphocholine in bacterial cells and on those\r\ncells undergoing apoptosis. In binding to these cells it is then able to activate the\r\ncomplement system. CRP levels are known to rise in patients following surgery.\r\nHowever, levels of greater than 150 at 48 hours post operatively are suggestive of\r\nevolving complications.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer: E.\r\nPotassium depletion occurs either through the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney. Chronic vomiting in itself is less prone to induce potassium loss than diarrhoea as gastric secretions contain less potassium than those in the lower GI tract. If vomiting produces a metabolic alkalosis then renal potassium wasting may occur as potassium is excreted in preference to hydrogen ions. The converse may occur in potassium depletion resulting in acid urine.",

Uraemia is a condition in which there is a buildup\r\nof urea and other nitrogenous wastes in the blood, leading to the production of acidic\r\nmetabolites. Paraldehyde is a medication used to treat alcohol withdrawal, but it can\r\ncause metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde. Diabetic\r\nketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes in which there is an accumulation of ketone\r\nbodies in the blood, leading to metabolic acidosis. Ethylene glycol, which is found in\r\nantifreeze, can be metabolized into acidic metabolites that can cause metabolic\r\nacidosis. Acetazolamide, on the other hand, is a medication that works by inhibiting\r\ncarbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that is involved in the production of bicarbonate in the\r\nbody. As a result, acetazolamide can cause a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to\r\nthe loss of bicarbonate, but it does not cause an increased anion gap acidosis.",
