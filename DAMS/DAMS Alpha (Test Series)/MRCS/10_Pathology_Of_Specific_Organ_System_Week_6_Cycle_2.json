      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nRhabdomyosarcomas as one of the more common malignant solid tumours in children (though all are rare). They have an aggressive behavior pattern and metastases are common. Teratomas are nearly always benign in younger children. Seminomas are very rare indeed. Malignant fibrous histiocytomas are almost never found in this location.\r\n\r\nSarcomas\r\n\r\n• Malignant tumours of mesenchymal origin\r\n\r\nTypes\r\n\r\nMay be either bone or soft tissue in origin. Bone sarcoma include:\r\n\r\n• Osteosarcoma\r\n• Ewings sarcoma (although non bony sites recognised)\r\n• Chondrosarcoma - originate from Chondrocytes\r\n\r\nSoft tissue sarcoma are a far more heterogeneous group and include:\r\n• Liposarcoma-adipocytes\r\n• Rhabdomyosarcoma-striated muscle\r\n• Leiomyosarcoma-smooth muscle\r\n• Synovial sarcomas- close to joints (cell of origin not known but not synovium)\r\n\r\nMalignant fibrous histiocytoma is now referred to as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Careful histological assessment of lesions now allows more accurate categorisation of sarcoma subtypes than was previously possible.\r\n \r\nFeatures\r\nCertain features of a mass or swelling should raise suspicion for a sarcoma these include:\r\n• Large >5cm soft tissue mass\r\n• Deep tissue location or intra muscular location\r\n• Rapid growth\r\n• Painful lump\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\nImaging of suspicious masses should utilise a combination of MRI, CT and USS. Blind biopsy should not be performed prior to imaging and where required should be done in such a way that the biopsy tract can be subsequently included in any resection.\r\n\r\nEwings sarcoma\r\n• Commoner in males\r\n• Incidence of 0.3 / 1, 000, 000\r\n• Onset typically between 10 and 20 years of age\r\n• Location by femoral diaphysis is commonest site\r\n• Histologically it is a small round tumour\r\n• Blood borne metastasis is common and chemotherapy is often combined with surgery\r\n\r\nOsteosarcoma\r\n• Mesenchymal cells with osteoblastic differentiation\r\n• 20% of all primary bone tumours\r\n• Incidence of 5 per 1,000,000\r\n• Peak age 15-30, commoner in males\r\n• Limb preserving surgery may be possible and many patients will receive chemotherapy\r\n\r\nLiposarcoma\r\n• Malignancy of adipocytes\r\n• Rare, approximately 2.5 per 1,000,000. They are the most common soft tissue sarcoma\r\n• Typically located in deep locations such as retroperitoneum\r\n• Affect older age group usually >40 years of age\r\n \r\n• May be well differentiated and thus slow growing although may undergo de- differentiation and disease progression\r\n• Many tumours will have a pseudocapsule that can misleadingly allow surgeons to feel that they can 'shell out' these lesions. In reality, tumour may invade at the edge of the pseudocapsule and result in local recurrence if this strategy is adopted\r\n• Usually resistant to radiotherapy, although this is often used in a palliative setting\r\n\r\nMalignant Fibrous Histiocytoma\r\n• Tumour with large number of histiocytes\r\n• Also described as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma NOS (i.e. Cell of origin is not known)\r\n• Four major subtypes are recognised: storiform-pleomorphic (70",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThis is likely to be due to metastatic lesions from a colonic primary. DALM lesions should be excised by oncological colectomy for this reason. This burden of metastatic disease is unlikely to precipitate jaundice directly and nodal disease at the porta hepatis is the most likely cause in this case.\r\n\r\nLiver tumours\r\n\r\nPrimary liver tumours\r\n\r\nThe most common primary tumours are cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall metastatic disease accounts for 95% of all liver malignancies making the primary liver tumours comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nPrimary liver tumours include:\r\n• Cholangiocarcinoma\r\n• Hepatocellular carcinoma\r\n• Hepatoblastoma\r\n• Sarcomas (Rare)\r\n• Lymphomas\r\n• Carcinoids (most often secondary although primary may occur)\r\n\r\nHepatocellular carcinoma\r\n\r\nThese account for the bulk of primary liver tumours (75",
