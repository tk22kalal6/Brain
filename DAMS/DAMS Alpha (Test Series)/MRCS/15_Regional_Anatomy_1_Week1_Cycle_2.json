If divided, there are notable effects on bladder function and this can result in impaired detrusor muscle function as parasympathetic nerves are responsible for detrusor contraction. The sympathetic nerves cause detrusor relaxation. The external sphincter is not affected. This is one of the reasons that patients may develop urinary retention following colon resections</p>\r\n",

The gonadal vessels and ureter are important posterior relations that are at risk during a right hemicolectomy. During latter stages of the procedure, the ileocolic artery and vein are traced along the anterior aspect of the duodenum. At this point it is possible to injure these, the superior mesenteric vein or the middle colic vein, injury to any of these can result in torrential bleeding that is very difficult to control.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not confuse the blood supply of the bile duct with that of the cystic duct. The bile duct has an axial blood supply which is derived from the hepatic artery and from retroduodenal branches of the gastroduodenal artery. Unlike the liver there is no contribution by the portal vein to the blood supply of the bile duct. Damage to the hepatic artery during a difficult cholecystectomy is a recognised cause of bile duct strictures. In this scenario the distal vessels have been removed as the patient is undergoing a resection.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adrenal rests are a very common finding in term neonates (50%) and most regress so that by adulthood the population incidence is 1%. The adrenal glands and gonads both develop from the urogenital ridge. In early embryogenesis, the adrenal cortical tissue can migrate with the descending gonads. Adrenal gland embryology First detected at 6 weeks&#39; gestation, the adrenal cortex is derived from the mesoderm of the posterior abdominal wall. Steroid secretion from the fetal cortex begins shortly thereafter. Adult-type zona glomerulosa and fasciculata are detected in fetal life but make up only a small proportion of the gland, and the zona reticularis is not present at all. The fetal cortex predominates throughout fetal life. The adrenal medulla is of ectodermal origin, arising from neural crest cells that migrate to the medial aspect of the developing cortex. The fetal adrenal gland is relatively large. At 4 months&#39; gestation, it is 4 times the size of the kidney; however, at birth, it is a third of the size of the kidney. This occurs because of the rapid regression of the fetal cortex at birth. It disappears almost completely by age 1 year; by age 4-5 years, the permanent adult-type adrenal cortex has fully developed. Anatomic anomalies of the adrenal gland may occur. Because the development of the adrenals is closely associated with that of the kidneys, agenesis of an adrenal gland is usually associated with ipsilateral agenesis of the kidney, and fused adrenal glands (whereby the 2 glands join across the midline posterior to the aorta) are also associated with a fused kidney. Adrenal hypoplasia occurs in the following 2 forms: (1) hypoplasia or absence of the fetal cortex with a poorly formed medulla and (2) disorganized fetal cortex and medulla with no permanent cortex present. Adrenal heterotopia describes a normal adrenal gland in an abnormal location, such as within the renal or hepatic capsules. Accessory adrenal tissue (adrenal rests), which is usually comprised only of cortex but seen combined with medulla in some cases, is most commonly located in the broad ligament or spermatic cord but can be found anywhere within the abdomen. Even intracranial adrenal rests have been reported.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (E)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No single one of the above nerves is responsible for direct cardiac innervation (which those who have handled the heart surgically will appreciate). The heart receives its nerves from the superficial and deep cardiac plexuses. The cardiac plexuses send small branches to the heart along the major vessels, continuing with the right and left coronary arteries. The vagal efferent fibres emerge from the brainstem in the roots of the vagus and accessory nerves, and run to ganglia in the cardiac plexuses and within the heart itself. The background vagal discharge serves to limit heart rate, and loss of this background vagal tone accounts for the higher resting heart rate seen following cardiac transplant.</p>\r\n",
