      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nCentral lines (and particularly subclavian lines) are risk factors for the development of pneumothorax. In the context of positive pressure ventilation a tension pneumothorax is a strong possibility and would be associated with haemodynamic instability.\r\n\r\nIntravenous access\r\n\r\nVenous access\r\nA number of routes for establishing venous access are available.\r\n\r\nPeripheral venous cannula\r\nEasy to insert with minimal morbidity. Wide lumen cannulae can provide rapid fluid infusions. When properly managed infections may be promptly identified and the cannula easily re sited. Problems relate to their peripheral sites and they are unsuitable for the administration of vaso active drugs, such as inotropes and irritant drugs such as TPN (except in the very short term setting).\r\n\r\nCentral lines\r\nInsertion is more difficult and most operators and NICE advocate the use of ultra sound. Coagulopathies may lead to haemorrhage following iatrogenic arterial injury. Femoral lines are easier to insert and iatrogenic injuries easier to manage in this site however they are prone to high infection rates. Internal jugular route is preferred.\r\nThey have multiple lumens allowing for administration of multiple infusions. The lumens are relatively narrow and thus they do not allow particularly rapid rates of infusion.\r\n\r\nIntraosseous access\r\nThis is typically undertaken at the anteromedial aspect of the proximal tibia and provides access to the marrow cavity and circulatory system. Although traditionally preferred in paediatric practice they may be used in adults and a wide range of fluids can be infused using these devices.\r\n\r\nTunneled lines\r\nTunneled lines such as Groshong and Hickman lines are popular devices for patients with long term therapeutic requirements. These devices are usually inserted using ultrasound guidance into the internal jugular vein and then tunneled under the skin. A cuff of woven material is sited near the end and helps to anchor the device into the tissues. These cuffs require formal dissection to allow the device to be removed.\r\nTunneled lines can be linked to injection ports that are located under the skin. These are especially popular in paediatric practice.\r\n\r\nPeripherally inserted central cannula\r\nReferred to as PICC lines, these are popular methods for establishing central venous access. Because they are inserted peripherally they are less prone to major complications relating to device insertion than conventional central lines.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)<br><br>Normal saline has a higher chloride content (154 mEq/L) compared to plasma. The administration of large volumes of saline can result in specific metabolic disturbances: Hyperchloremic acidosis: This is a common complication associated with the infusion of large volumes of normal saline. The excess chloride disrupts the normal balance between sodium and chloride ions, which can reduce the strong ion difference and lead to a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This condition is characterized by a normal anion gap (difference between the concentrations of serum sodium and the sum of chloride and bicarbonate) but decreased serum bicarbonate due to the dilution and relative increase in chloride. Hypochloremic alkalosis: This condition would generally be seen in scenarios involving excessive loss of chloride, such as through gastric suctioning or chronic vomiting, not from saline infusion which actually increases chloride levels. Hyperchloremic alkalosis: This term is contradictory in terms, as hyperchloremia typically leads to acidosis, not alkalosis, because of the reasons explained above regarding the impact of chloride on acid- base balance. Acute renal failure: While not directly caused by hyperchloremic acidosis, excessive infusion of fluids, especially in the context of other underlying conditions or surgical complications, could contribute to fluid overload. However, acute renal failure wouldn’t be a direct consequence of hyperchloremia alone unless other factors such as hypotension, nephrotoxic agents, or sepsis were also present.<br>Given these options and the clinical context, the most likely complication from receiving a total of 6 liters of 0.9% sodium chloride solution over 24 hours is Hyperchloremic acidosis. This condition arises due to the high chloride content relative to sodium in normal saline, leading to acid-base balance disruptions as described.+</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/30314185.1.jpg\" xss=removed><br>Post operative fluid management<br>In the UK the GIFTASUP and NICE (CG174 2017) guidelines (see reference below) were devised to try and provide some consensus guidance as to how intravenous fluids should be administered. Some time ago it was a commonly held belief that little harm would occur as a result of excessive administration of normal saline and many oliguric post operative patients received enormous quantities of IV fluids. As a result they developed hyperchloraemic acidosis. With greater understanding of this potential complication, the use of electrolyte balanced solutions (Ringers lactate/ Hartmans) is now favored over normal saline.<br>The other guidance includes:<br><br>• Fluids given should be documented clearly and easily available<br>• Assess the patient's fluid status when they leave theatre<br>• If a patient is haemodynamically stable and euvolaemic, aim to restart oral fluid intake as soon as possible<br>• Review patients whose urinary sodium is < 20>• If a patient is oedematous, hypovolaemia if present should be treated first.

There must be an identifiable pathology causing irremediable brain damage. This may be intra - or extra - cranial.\r\n2. The patient must be deeply unconscious.\r\na. Hypothermia must be excluded as the cause of unconsciousness and the patients core temperature should be over 34oC.\r\nb. There should be no evidence that the patients state is due to depressant drugs. This refers to narcotics, hypnotics and tranquillisers as well as neuromuscular blocking drugs. A\r\ncareful drug history is required, whilst drug levels and antagonists may need to be used.\r\n \r\nc. Potentially reversible circulatory, metabolic and endocrine disturbances must have been\r\nexcluded as the cause of the continuing unconsciousness. Some of these disturbances may occur as a result of the condition rather than the cause and these do not preclude the diagnosis of brain stem death.\r\n\r\n3. The patient must be apnoeic, needing mechanical ventilation. This condition must not be secondary to the effect of sedative drugs of neuromuscular blockade. This may require testing with a nerve stimulator to show intact neuromuscular transmission. Alternatively, demonstration of tendon reflexes can also demonstrate intact transmission\r\nCriteria for brain death\r\n\r\n• Fixed pupils which do not respond to sharp changes in the intensity of incident light\r\n• No corneal reflex\r\n• Absent oculo-vestibular reflexes - no eye movements following the slow injection of at least 50ml of ice-cold water into each ear in turn (the caloric test)\r\n• No response to supraorbital pressure\r\n• No cough reflex to bronchial stimulation or gagging response to pharyngeal stimulation\r\n• No observed respiratory effort in response to disconnection of the ventilator for long enough (typically 5 minutes) to ensure elevation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide to at least 6.0 kPa (6.5 kPa in patients with chronic carbon dioxide retention). Adequate oxygenation is ensured by pre- oxygenation and diffusion oxygenation during the disconnection (so the brain stem respiratory centre is not challenged by the ultimate, anoxic, drive stimulus)\r\n\r\nThe test should be undertaken by two appropriately experienced doctors on two separate occasions.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThis patient is likely to have had compartment syndrome (tibial fracture + fasciotomies) which may produce myoglobinuria. The presence of worsening renal function, together with muddy brown casts is strongly suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. Acute interstitial nephritis usually arises from drug toxicity and does not usually produce urinary muddy brown casts. Thin basement membrane disease is an autosomal dominant condition that causes persistent microscopic haematuria, but not worsening renal function.\r\n\r\nAcute Renal Failure\r\n- Final pathway is tubular cell death.\r\n• Renal medulla is a relatively hypoxic environment making it susceptible to renal tubular hypoxia.\r\n• Renovascular autoregulation maintains renal blood flow across a range of arterial pressures.\r\n• Estimates of GFR are best indices of level of renal function. Useful clinical estimates can be obtained by considering serum creatinine, age, race, gender and body size. eGFR calculations such as the Cockcroft and Gault equation are less reliable in populations with high GFR's.\r\n• Nephrotoxic stimuli such as aminoglycosides and radiological contrast media induce apoptosis. Myoglobinuria and haemolysis result in necrosis. Overlap exists and proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in potentiating ongoing damage.\r\n• Post-operative renal failure is more likely to occur in patients who are elderly, have peripheral vascular disease, high BMI, have COPD, receive vasopressors, are on nephrotoxic medication or undergo emergency surgery.\r\n• Avoiding hypotension will reduce risk of renal tubular damage.\r\n• There is no evidence that administration of ACE inhibitors or dopamine reduces the incidence of post-operative renal failure.\r\n",

They are not the same as an end stoma, by definition they are usually seen in patients who have an end stoma. They are typically seen following a sub total colectomy where the distal sigmoid colon is deemed too friable to close and it then brought onto the skin as a mucous fistula.<br></p><p>Abdominal stomas<br><br>Stomas may be sited during a range of abdominal procedures and involve bringing the lumen or visceral contents onto the skin. In most cases this applies to the bowel. However, other organs or their contents may be diverted in case of need.<br><br>With bowel stomas the type method of construction and to a lesser extent the site will be determined by the contents of the bowel.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe description is one of aortic regurgitation and the acute nature of the presentation would equate to this being due to aortic dissection. For this reason a CT angiogram is the preferred investigation.\r\n\r\nChest pain\r\n\r\nAortic dissection\r\n\r\n• This occurs when there is a flap or filling defect within the aortic intima. Blood tracks into the medial layer and splits the tissues with the subsequent creation of a false lumen. It most commonly occurs in the ascending aorta or just distal to the left subclavian artery (less common). It is most common in Afro- carribean males aged 50-70 years.\r\n• Patients usually present with a tearing intrascapular pain, which may be similar to the pain of a myocardial infarct.\r\n• The dissection may spread either proximally or distally with subsequent disruption to the arterial branches that are encountered.\r\n• In the Stanford classification system the disease is classified into lesions with a proximal origin (Type A) and those that commence distal to the left subclavian (Type B).\r\n• Diagnosis may be suggested by a chest x-ray showing a widened mediastinum. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually made by use of CT angiography\r\n \r\n• Proximal (Type A) lesions are usually treated surgically, type B lesions are usually managed non operatively.\r\n\r\nPulmonary embolism\r\n\r\n• Typically sudden onset of chest pain, haemoptysis, hypoxia and small pleural effusions may be present.\r\n• Most patients will have an underlying deep vein thrombosis\r\n• Diagnosis may be suggested by various ECG findings including S waves in lead I, Q waves in lead III and inverted T waves in lead III. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually made through use of CT pulmonary angiography.\r\n• Treatment is with anticoagulation, in those patients who develop a cardiac arrest or severe compromise from their PE, consideration may be given to thrombolysis.\r\n\r\nMyocardial infarction\r\n\r\n• Traditionally described as sudden onset of central, crushing chest pain. It may radiate into the neck and down the left arm. Signs of autonomic dysfunction may be present. The presenting features may be atypical in the elderly and those with diabetes.\r\n• Diagnosis is made through identification of new and usually dynamic ECG changes (and cardiac enzyme changes). Inferior and anterior infarcts may be distinguished by the presence of specific ECG changes (usually II, III and aVF for inferior, leads V1-V5 for anterior).\r\n• Treatment is with oral antiplatelet agents, primary coronary angioplasty and/ or thrombolysis.\r\n\r\nPerforated peptic ulcer\r\n\r\n• Patients usually develop sudden onset of epigastric abdominal pain, it may be soon followed by generalised abdominal pain.\r\n• There may be features of antecendant abdominal discomfort, the pain of gastric ulcer is typically worse immediately after eating.\r\n• Diagnosis may be made by erect chest x-ray which may show a small amount of free intra-abdominal air (very large amounts of air are more typically associated with colonic perforation).\r\n \r\n• Treatment is usually with a laparotomy, small defects may be excised and overlaid with an omental patch, larger defects are best managed with a partial gastrectomy.\r\n\r\nBoerhaaves syndrome\r\n\r\n• Spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus that occurs as a result of repeated episodes of vomiting.\r\n• The rupture is usually distally sited and on the left side.\r\n• Patients usually give a history of sudden onset of severe chest pain that may complicate severe vomiting.\r\n• Severe sepsis occurs secondary to mediastinitis.\r\n• Diagnosis is CT contrast swallow.\r\n• Treatment is with thoracotomy and lavage, if less than 12 hours after onset then primary repair is usually feasible, surgery delayed beyond 12 hours is best managed by insertion of a T tube to create a controlled fistula between oesophagus and skin.\r\n• Delays beyond 24 hours are associated with a very high mortality rate.\r\n",

Strong opioids may no longer be required and adequate analgesia can be obtained by using combinations of peripherally acting agents and weak opioids.\r\n• The final step is when the pain can be controlled by peripherally acting agents alone.\r\n\r\nLocal anaesthetics\r\n\r\n• Infiltration of a wound with a long-acting local anaesthetic such as Bupivacaine\r\n• Analgesia for several hours\r\n• Further pain relief can be obtained with repeat injections or by infusions via a thin catheter\r\n• Blockade of plexuses or peripheral nerves will provide selective analgesia in those parts of the body supplied by the plexus or nerves\r\n• Can either be used to provide anaesthesia for the surgery or specifically for postoperative pain relief\r\n• Especially useful where a sympathetic block is needed to improve postoperative blood supply or where central blockade such as spinal or epidural blockade is contraindicated.\r\n\r\nSpinal anaesthesia\r\nProvides excellent analgesia for surgery in the lower half of the body and pain relief can last many hours after completion of the operation if long-acting drugs\r\n \r\ncontaining vasoconstrictors are used.\r\n\r\n- Side effects of spinal anaesthesia include: hypotension, sensory and motor block, nausea and urinary retention.\r\n\r\nEpidural anaesthesia\r\nAn indwelling epidural catheter inserted. This can then be used to provide a continuous infusion of analgesic agents. It can provide excellent analgesia. They are still the preferred option following major open abdominal procedures and help prevent post operative respiratory compromise resulting from pain.\r\n- Disadvantages of epidurals is that they usually confine patients to bed, especially if a motor block is present. In addition an indwelling urinary catheter is required. Which may not only impair mobility but also serve as a conduit for infection. They are contraindicated in coagulopathies.\r\n\r\nTransversus Abdominal Plane block (TAP)\r\nIn this technique an ultrasound is used to identify the correct muscle plane and local anaesthetic (usually bupivicaine) is injected. The agent diffuses in the plane and blocks many of the spinal nerves. It is an attractive technique as it provides a wide field of blockade but does not require the placement of any indwelling devices. There is no post operative motor impairment. For this reason it is the preferred technique when extensive laparoscopic abdominal procedures are performed. They will then provide analgesia immediately following surgery but as they do not confine the patient to bed, the focus on enhanced recovery can begin sooner.\r\n\r\n-The main disadvantage is that their duration of action is limited to the half life of the local anaesthetic agent chosen. In addition some anaesthetists do not have the USS skills required to site the injections.\r\n\r\nPatient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)\r\n\r\n- Patients administer their own intravenous analgesia and titrate the dose to their own end-point of pain relief using a small microprocessor - controlled pump.\r\nMorphine is the most popular drug used.\r\n\r\nStrong Opioids\r\n\r\nSevere pain arising from deep or visceral structures requires the use of strong opioids\r\n \r\nMorphine\r\n\r\n• Short half life and poor bioavailability.\r\n• Metabolised in the liver and clearance is reduced in patients with liver disease, in the elderly and the debilitated\r\n• Side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation and respiratory depression.\r\n• Tolerance may occur with repeated dosage\r\n\r\nPethidine\r\n\r\n• Synthetic opioid which is structurally different from morphine but which has similar actions. Has 10% potency of morphine.\r\n• Short half life and similar bioavailability and clearance to morphine.\r\n• Short duration of action and may need to be given hourly.\r\n• Pethidine has a toxic metabolite (norpethidine) which is cleared by the kidney, but which accumulates in renal failure or following frequent and prolonged doses and may lead to muscle twitching and convulsions. Extreme caution is advised if pethidine is used over a prolonged period or in patients with renal failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeak opioids\r\nCodeine: markedly less active than morphine, has predictable effects when given orally and is effective against mild to moderate pain.\r\nNon opioid analgesics\r\n- Mild to moderate pain.\r\n\r\nParacetamol\r\n\r\n• Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.\r\n• Analgesic and antipyretic properties but little anti-inflammatory effect\r\n• It is well absorbed orally and is metabolised almost entirely in the liver\r\n• Side effects in normal dosage and is widely used for the treatment of minor pain. It causes hepatotoxicity in over dosage by overloading the normal metabolic pathways with the formation of a toxic metabolite.\r\n \r\nNSAIDs\r\n\r\n• Analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions\r\n• Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by the enzyme Cyclooxygenase which catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to the various prostaglandins that are the chief mediators of inflammation. All NSAIDs work in the same way and thus there is no point in giving more than one at a time. .\r\n• NSAIDs are, in general, more useful for superficial pain arising from the skin, buccal mucosa, joint surfaces and bone.\r\n• Relative contraindications: history of peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding diathesis; operations associated with high blood loss, asthma, moderate to severe renal impairment, dehydration and any history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs or aspirin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeuropathic pain\r\nNational Institute of Clinical Excellence (UK) guidelines:\r\n\r\n• First line: Amitriptyline (Imipramine if cannot tolerate) or pregabalin\r\n• Second line: Amitriptyline AND pregabalin\r\n• Third line: refer to pain specialist. Give tramadol in the interim (avoid morphine)\r\n• If diabetic neuropathic pain: Duloxetine\r\n• As of 1 April 2019, pregabalin and gabapentin are Class C controlled substances (under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971) and scheduled under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 as Schedule 3. Evaluate patients carefully for a history of drug abuse before prescribing and observe patients for development of signs of abuse and dependence (MHRA, Drug Safety Update April 2019).\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nFNAC is the first line investigation in this setting. Whereas FNAC has declined in popularity recently (in breast investigation), it remain a very popular option in the investigation of thyroid masses. It cannot reliably diagnose a follicular tumour.\r\nTissue sampling\r\nTissue sampling is an important surgical process. Biopsy modalities vary according to the site, experience and subsequent planned therapeutic outcome\r\n\r\nThe modalities comprise:\r\n-Fine needle aspiration cytology\r\n-Core biopsy\r\n-Excision biopsy\r\n-Tru cut biopsy\r\n-Punch biopsy\r\n-Cytological smears\r\n-Endoscopic or laparoscopic biopsy\r\n\r\nWhen the lesion is superficial the decision needs to be taken as to whether complete excision is desirable or whether excision biopsy is acceptable. In malignant melanoma for example the need for safe margins will mean that a more radical surgical approach needs to be adopted after diagnostic confirmation from excision biopsy than would be the case in basal cell carcinoma. Punch biopsies are useful in gaining histological diagnosis of unclear skin lesions where excision biopsy is undesirable such as in establishing whether a skin lesion is vasculitic or not.\r\n\r\nFine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an operator dependent procedure that may or may not be image guided and essentially involves passing a needle through a lesion whilst suction is applied to a syringe. The material thus obtained is expressed onto a slide and sent for cytological assessment. This test can be limited by operator inexperience and also by the lack of histological architectural information (e.g.\r\nFollicular carcinoma of the thyroid). Where a discharge is present a sample may be\r\n \r\nsent for cytology although in some sites (e.g. Nipple discharge ) the information gleaned may be meaningless.\r\n\r\nTissue samples may be obtained by both core and tru cut biopsy. A core biopsy is obtained by use of a spring loaded gun with a needle passing quickly through the lesion of interest. A tru cut biopsy achieves the same objective but the needle moved by hand.

Warm compresses increase the risk of doxorubicin ulceration.\r\nHyaluronidase is indicated in the extravasation of contrast media, TPN and vinca alkaloids.\r\n\r\nHowever, if administered following doxorubicin extravasation it will dramatically worsen the situation and is contra indicated.\r\nUp to 50% of those sustaining severe injuries will require delayed surgical reconstruction.\r\nExtravasation injury\r\n\r\nChemotherapy may be complicated by extravasation reactions in up to 6% of cases. The following chemotherapy agents are recognised causes of extravasation reactions; doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, mitomycin and mithramycin.\r\n\r\nUp to 30% of extravasation reactions may be complicated by the development of ulceration.\r\nWhen an extravasation reaction is suspected, the infusion should be stopped and the infusing device aspirated. The extremity should be elevated. As a general rule cold compresses have been shown to reduce the incidence of subsequent ulceration with doxorubicin. Warm compresses have been found to be beneficial in extravasation of vinca alkaloids. Dimethylsulfoxide may be infused in some cases, ideally within 5 hours of the event occurring. No conclusive evidence exists to support the use of\r\n \r\ncorticosteroids or sodium bicarbonate for extravasation injuries.\r\n\r\nExtravasation of total parenteral nutrition solutions is usually managed by the local administration of hyaluronidase to the infusion site.",

The NHS screening programme starts at 50 in the UK. FIT testing is used. In selected high prevalence areas, younger targeted programmes are sometimes used.\r\n\r\nColorectal cancer screening and diagnosis\r\nOverview\r\n• Most cancers develop from adenomatous polyps. Screening for colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce mortality by 16%\r\n• The NHS now has a national screening programme offering screening every 2 years to all men and women aged 50 to 69 years. Patients aged over 70 years may request screening\r\n• Eligible patients are sent faecal immunohistochemical (FIT) tests through the post.\r\n• Patients with abnormal results are offered a colonoscopy At colonoscopy, approximately:\r\n• 5 out of 10 patients will have a normal exam\r\n• 4 out of 10 patients will be found to have polyps which may be removed due to their premalignant potential\r\n• 1 out of 10 patients will be found to have cancer\r\nDiagnosis\r\nEssentially the following patients need referral:\r\n- Altered bowel habit for more than six weeks\r\n- New onset of rectal bleeding\r\n- Symptoms of tenesmus\r\n\r\nColonoscopy is the gold standard, provided it is complete and good mucosal visualisation is achieved. Other options include double contrast barium enema and CT colonography.\r\n\r\nStaging\r\nOnce a malignant diagnosis is made patients with colonic cancer will be staged using\r\n \r\nchest / abdomen and pelvic CT. Patients with rectal cancer will also undergo evaluation of the mesorectum with pelvic MRI scanning.\r\n\r\nFor examination purposes the Dukes and TNM systems are preferred.\r\n\r\nTumour markers\r\nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the main tumour marker in colorectal cancer. Not all tumours secrete this, and it may be raised in conditions such as IBD. However, absolute levels do correlate (roughly) with disease burden and it is once again being used routinely in follow up.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nWith long standing very large goitre, there is a risk of tracheomalacia. In the UK this is very rarely seen. However, patients from other countries can have enourmous goitres and this then becomes a concern. The fact that the wound is satisfactory makes a bleed less likely and whilst total thyroidectomy can be a risk factor for hypocalcaemia, this is a little early.\r\n\r\nComplications following thyroid surgery\r\nThe major immediate risk following thyroidectomy is haemorrhage. A tension haematoma deep to the cervical fascia is usually the result of reactionary haemorrhage from an arterial source. This results in the development of laryngeal oedema and airway compromise. The treatment is by urgent wound decompression of all layers prior to return to theatre for haemostasis. Sub cutnaeous haematomas and seromas may accumulate under skin flaps and can often be managed conservatively or by simple aspiration.\r\n\r\nIn patients with longstanding large goitres there is the risk of tracheomalacia. This is characterised by the development of flacidity of the tracheal cartilage. This can result in airway compromise. In the normal situation the tracheal diameter increases slightly during inspiration and narrows during expiration. In tracheomalacia these processes are exaggerated and the trachea may collapse in expiration resulting in stridor. In the immediate situation an endotracheal tube will need to be inserted.\r\n\r\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve injury is recognised following thyroid surgery and may be unilateral or bilateral depending upon the procedure performed. The risk is 1.8% at one month which declines to 0.5% at three months following first time explorations. It is rare for nerve injury alone to result in airway compromise. However, it may occur when nerve injury is associated with minor degrees of laryngeal oedema (such as following intubation).\r\n \r\nHypoparathyroidism is a recognised complication following thyroid surgery and damage to the blood supply to the parathyroid glands is probably the commonest cause. The incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism is in the region of 1 to 3%. It can present dramatically in the first 2-5 post operative days. In the emergency setting treatment is with intravenous calcium gluconate. Oral calcium carbonate is used in the longer term.",

      "solution": " Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nConsider above knee amputation in patients with fixed flexion deformity.\r\nThis patient will not be able to walk with a below knee amputation, therefore an above knee amputation would be preferable, as it guarantees better healing in the short term.\r\n \r\nAmputations\r\nAmputations are indicated when the affected limb is one of the following:\r\n• Dead non viable\r\n• Deadly where it is posing a major threat to life\r\n• Dead useless where it is viable but a prosthesis would be preferable\r\nOrthopaedic surgery\r\n• Amputation is often undertaken as an option of last resort e.g. Limb salvage has failed and the limb is so non functional that mobility needs would be best met with prosthesis.\r\n• Chronic fracture non union or significant limb shortening following trauma would fit into this category. Occasionally following major trauma a primary amputation is preferable. This would be the case in an open fracture with major distal neurovascular compromise and other more life threatening injuries are present.\r\nVascular surgery\r\n• The first two categories are the most prevalent.\r\n• Diabetic foot sepsis is often a major cause of sepsis which can spread rapidly in the presence of established peripheral vascular disease.\r\n• As a general rule the main issue in vascular surgery is to optimise vascular inflow prior to surgery. The more distal the planned amputation is to be, the more important this rule becomes.\r\n• In other situations there has been something such as an embolic event that has not been revascularised in time. In this case the limb shows fixed mottling and an amputation will be needed.\r\nTypes of amputations\r\nAs the vast majority of commonly performed amputations affect the lower limbs these will be covered here.\r\nThe main categories of amputations are:\r\n• Pelvic disarticulation (hindquarter)\r\n• Above knee amputation\r\n• Gritti Stokes (through knee amputation)\r\n• Below knee amputation (using either Skew or Burgess flaps)\r\n• Syme's amputation (through ankle)\r\n• Amputations of mid foot and digits\r\n \r\nChoosing a level of amputation depends on:\r\n• The disease process being treated\r\n• Desired functional outcome\r\n• Co-morbidities of the patient\r\nAbove knee amputations\r\n• Quick to perform\r\n• Heal reliably\r\n• Patients regain their general health quickly\r\n• For this benefit, a functional price has to be paid and many patients over the age of 70 will never walk on an above knee prosthesis.\r\n• Above knee amputations use equal anterior-posterior flaps\r\nBelow knee amputations\r\n• Technically more challenging to perform\r\n• Heal less reliably than their above knee counterparts.\r\n• However, many more patients are able to walk using a below knee prosthesis.\r\n• In below knee amputations the two main flaps are Skew flaps or the Burgess long posterior flap. Skew flaps result in a less bulky limb that is easier to attach a prosthesis to.\r\nIt is worth remembering that whilst it may be technically feasible to offer a below knee amputation there may be circumstances where an above knee option is preferable. For example, in fixed flexion deformities of the lower limb, little functional benefit would be gained from below knee amputation surgery.\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)<br><br> In most cases the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis is an acute cholecystectomy performed early in the illness. Delayed surgery particularly around 5- 7 days after presentation is much more technically challenging and is often best deferred. In most cases the procedure can be performed laparoscopically, even when acute inflammation is present.<br><br>Gallstones<br> <br>Up to 24% of women and 12% of men may have gallstones. Of these up to 30% may develop local infection and cholecystitis. In patients subjected to surgery 12% will have stones contained within the common bile duct. The majority of gallstones are of a mixed composition (50%) with pure cholesterol stones accounting for 20% of cases.<br>The aetiology of CBD stones differs in the world, in the West most CBD stones are the result of migration. In the East a far higher proportion arise in the CBD de novo. The classical symptoms are of colicky right upper quadrant pain that occurs post prandially. The symptoms are usually worst following a fatty meal when cholecystokinin levels are highest and gallbladder contraction is maximal.<br><br>Investigation<br>In almost all suspected cases the standard diagnostic work up consists of abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests. Of patients who have stones within the bile duct, 60% will have at least one abnormal result on LFT's. Ultrasound is an important test, but is operator dependent and therefore may occasionally need to be repeated if a negative result is at odds with the clinical picture. Where stones are suspected in the bile duct, the options lie between magnetic resonance cholangiography and intraoperative imaging. The choice between these two options is determined by the skills and experience of the surgeon. The advantages of intra operative imaging are less useful in making therapeutic decisions if the operator is unhappy about proceeding the bile duct exploration, and in such circumstances pre operative MRCP is probably a better option.<br>Treatment<br>Patients with asymptomatic gallstones rarely develop symptoms related to them (less than 2% per year) and may therefore be managed expectantly. In almost all cases of<br> <br>symptomatic gallstones the treatment of choice is cholecystectomy performed via the laparoscopic route. In the very frail patient there is sometimes a role for selective use of ultrasound guided cholecystostomy.<br><br>During the course of the procedure some surgeons will routinely perform either intra operative cholangiography or laparoscopic USS to either confirm anatomy or to exclude CBD stones. The latter may be more easily achieved by use of laparoscopic ultrasound. If stones are found then the options lie between early ERCP in the day or so following surgery or immediate surgical exploration of the bile duct. When performed via the trans cystic route this adds little in the way of morbidity and certainly results in faster recovery. Where transcystic exploration fails the alternative strategy is that of formal choledochotomy. The exploration of a small duct is challenging and ducts of less than 8mm should not be explored. Small stones that measure less than 5mm may be safely left and most will pass spontaneously.<br><br>Risks of ERCP(1)<br><br><br>• Bleeding 0.9% (rises to 1.5% if sphincterotomy performed)<br>• Duodenal perforation 0.4%<br>• Cholangitis 1.1%<br>• Pancreatitis 1.5%</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/432451550.1.jpg\"></p>",
