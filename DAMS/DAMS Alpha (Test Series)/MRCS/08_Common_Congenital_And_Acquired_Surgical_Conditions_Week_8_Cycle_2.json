      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nA fistula is an abnormal connection between two epithelial lined surfaces, in the case of a fistula in ano it will be lined by squamous cells.\r\n\r\nFistulas\r\n• A fistula is defined as an abnormal connection between two epithelial surfaces.\r\n• There are many types ranging from Branchial fistulae in the neck to entero- cutaneous fistulae abdominally.\r\n• In general surgical practice the abdominal cavity generates the majority and most of these arise from diverticular disease and Crohn's.\r\n• As a general rule all fistulae will resolve spontaneously as long as there is no distal obstruction. This is particularly true of intestinal fistulae.\r\n\r\nThe four types of fistulae are:\r\n \r\nEnterocutaneous\r\nThese link the intestine to the skin. They may be high (>500ml) or low output (&lt;250ml) depending upon source. Duodenal /jejunal fistulae will tend to produce high volume, electrolyte rich secretions which can lead to severe excoriation of the skin. Colo-cutaneous fistulae will tend to leak faeculent material. Both fistulae may result from the spontaneous rupture of an abscess cavity onto the skin (such as following perianal abscess drainage) or may occur as a result of iatrogenic input. In some cases it may even be surgically desirable e.g. mucous fistula following sub total colectomy for colitis.\r\n\r\nSuspect if there is excess fluid in the drain.\r\nEnteroenteric or Enterocolic\r\nThis is a fistula that involves the large or small intestine. They may originate in a similar manner to enterocutaneous fistulae. A particular problem with this fistula type is that bacterial overgrowth may precipitate malabsorption syndromes. This may be particularly serious in inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n\r\nEnterovaginal\r\n\r\nAetiology as above.\r\n\r\nEnterovesical\r\nThis type of fistula goes to the bladder. These fistulas may result in frequent urinary tract infections, or the passage of gas from the urethra during urination.\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nSome rules relating to fistula management:\r\n\r\n• They will heal provided there is no underlying inflammatory bowel disease and no distal obstruction, so conservative measures may be the best option\r\n• Where there is skin involvement, protect the overlying skin, often using a well fitted stoma bag- skin damage is difficult to treat\r\n• A high output fistula may be rendered more easily managed by the use of octreotide, this will tend to reduce the volume of pancreatic secretions.\r\n• Nutritional complications are common especially with high fistula (e.g. high jejunal or duodenal) these may necessitate the use of TPN to provide nutritional support together with the concomitant use of octreotide to reduce volume and protect skin.\r\n• When managing perianal fistulae surgeons should avoid probing the fistula where acute inflammation is present, this almost always worsens outcomes.\r\n• When perianal fistulae occur secondary to Crohn's disease the best management option is often to drain acute sepsis and maintain that drainage through the judicious use of setons whilst medical management is implemented.\r\n• Always attempt to delineate the fistula anatomy, for abscesses and fistulae that have an intra abdominal source the use of barium and CT studies should show a track. For perianal fistulae surgeons should recall Goodsall's rule in relation to internal and external openings.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nGallstone ileus occurs as a result of the fistula developing between the gallbladder and the duodenum. These tend to become impacted somewhat proximal to the ileocaecal valve and cause small bowel obstruction. The correct management is to remove the gallstone from an enterotomy proximal to the site of stone impaction. The bowel at the site of impaction itself may not heal well and an enterotomy performed at this site may well result in the need for a resection. The standard surgical teaching is that under almost all circumstances the gallbladder should be left in situ, as the anatomy in this area is often hostile and unpredictable.\r\n\r\nDisconnecting it from the duodenum leaves a large defect that is difficult to close.",
