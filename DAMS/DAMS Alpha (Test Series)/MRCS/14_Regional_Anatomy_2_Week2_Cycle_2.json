      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nTrendelenburg test\r\n\r\nInjury or division of the superior gluteal nerve results in a motor deficit that consists of weakened abduction of the thigh by gluteus medius, a disabling gluteus medius limp and a compensatory list of the body to the weakened gluteal side. The compensation results in a gravitational shift so that the body is supported on the unaffected limb.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is asked to stand on one leg, the gluteus medius usually contracts as soon as the contralateral leg leaves the floor, preventing the pelvis from dipping towards the unsupported side. When a person with paralysis of the superior gluteal nerve is asked to stand on one leg, the pelvis on the unsupported side descends, indicating that the gluteus medius on the affected side is weak or non functional ( a positive Trendelenburg test).\r\n\r\nThis eponymous test also refers to a vascular investigation in which tourniquets are placed around the upper thigh, these can help determine whether saphenofemoral incompetence is present.",

The nerve descends lateral to the brachial artery, crosses to its medial side (usually passing anterior to the artery). It passes deep to the bicipital aponeurosis and the median cubital vein at the elbow.\r\nIt passes between the two heads of the pronator teres muscle, and runs on the deep surface of flexor digitorum superficialis (within its fascial sheath).\r\n\r\nNear the wrist it becomes superficial between the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor carpi radialis, deep to palmaris longus tendon. It passes deep to the flexor retinaculum to enter the palm, but lies anterior to the long flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel.",
