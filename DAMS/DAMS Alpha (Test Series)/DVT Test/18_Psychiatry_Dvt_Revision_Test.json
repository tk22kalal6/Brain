It was originally developed by Masters and Johnson. In this method, just before ejaculation is about to occur, the penis is squeezed firmly (usually at the base of the glans) to reduce arousal and delay ejaculation. This technique helps the individual gain better control over the ejaculatory reflex through repeated practice. It is often combined with other psychological and behavioral strategies in the management of this common sexual dysfunction.</p>\r\n",

This term was prevalent during the mid-20th century when subtle neurological impairments in children&mdash;without obvious brain damage&mdash;were recognized to cause behavioral and academic difficulties such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. As understanding of the condition evolved, and diagnostic criteria became more refined, the term MBD was replaced by ADHD in the DSM-III (1980) to better reflect the core symptoms and to standardize the terminology. ADHD is now recognized as a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development.</p>\r\n",

It is easily accessible, often perceived as less harmful, and frequently used recreationally across various age groups and cultures. Although cannabis dependence is generally considered less severe compared to opioids or stimulants, chronic use can lead to cannabis use disorder, characterized by tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite harm.</p>\r\n",

This allows the individual to seek treatment voluntarily without coercion, respecting their autonomy and rights. After this period, if further hospitalization is required, the admission status may need to be reviewed or converted to involuntary admission based on clinical evaluation.</p>\r\n",
