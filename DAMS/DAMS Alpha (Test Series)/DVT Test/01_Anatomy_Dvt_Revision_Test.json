      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a submandibular gland excision, the <strong>lingual nerve</strong> is one of the most vulnerable structures. The submandibular gland lies in the submandibular triangle, and the lingual nerve runs in close proximity to the gland, specifically looping inferiorly below the submandibular duct (Wharton&#39;s duct) and then ascending to supply sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and providing parasympathetic innervation for the sublingual gland. Due to its anatomical course, which brings it very close to the superior aspect of the submandibular gland and duct, it is at significant risk of injury (e.g., stretching, compression, or transection) during dissection, especially when ligating or dividing the submandibular duct. Injury to the lingual nerve can lead to loss of taste sensation and general sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue on the affected side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/1(640).jpg\" style=\"height:162px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/1(640).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The saphenous nerve is a sensory branch of the femoral nerve. It accompanies the great saphenous vein for a significant portion of its course in the leg and ankle. In the thigh, it travels with the femoral artery and vein in the adductor canal. In the leg, it emerges from the adductor canal and descends alongside the great saphenous vein, passing anterior to the medial malleolus at the ankle. Due to this close anatomical relationship, especially when the great saphenous vein is harvested or dissected for use in bypass grafts (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafts, peripheral bypass grafts) or when central venous access is gained through the saphenous vein, the saphenous nerve is highly vulnerable to injury. Damage to the saphenous nerve can result in numbness, paresthesia, or pain along the medial aspect of the leg and foot, which is its area of sensory distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/4(480).jpg\" style=\"height:471px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/4(480).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anterior communicating artery (AComA) is a short vessel that connects the two anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) across the midline, forming a crucial part of the Circle of Willis. It lies in extremely close anatomical proximity, directly superior and often anterior, to the <strong>optic chiasm</strong>. The optic chiasm is where nerve fibers from the medial (nasal) halves of both retinas cross over, while fibers from the lateral (temporal) halves continue uncrossed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, an aneurysm arising from the AComA, when it enlarges, can exert direct compressive force on the optic chiasm. This compression specifically damages the crossing fibers, leading to a classic visual field defect known as <strong>bitemporal hemianopia</strong> (loss of vision in the outer half of both visual fields). This makes AComA aneurysms a significant cause of visual defects due to chiasmal compression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/6(366).jpg\" style=\"height:256px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/6(366).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

It is a small, hook-like bony projection from the anterior surface of the scapula, lying just below the clavicle (in the infraclavicular area). Clinically, the coracoid process serves as an important landmark for procedures such as brachial plexus blocks and is also a site of attachment for several muscles and ligaments including the pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and the short head of the biceps brachii. Due to its anterior and superficial position, it can be easily palpated just medial to the shoulder joint beneath the clavicle.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hand deformity in the image is a classic example of &quot;ulnar claw hand&quot;, which occurs due to ulnar nerve injury. This deformity is characterized by hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal (PIP and DIP) joints, most prominently in the ring and little fingers. This occurs because the ulnar nerve innervates the medial two lumbricals and interossei muscles, which normally flex the MCP and extend the IP joints. When the ulnar nerve is damaged, these muscles become non-functional, and the unopposed action of the extensor digitorum and long finger flexors causes the characteristic claw-like posture.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cervical rib is an extra rib arising from the seventh cervical vertebra. Its presence can compress the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery as they pass over the first rib. This compression leads to a combination of neurological and vascular symptoms. The atrophy of intrinsic muscles of the hand and sensory deficit on the medial side of the forearm and hand occur due to involvement of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8-T1 nerve roots), which supplies these muscles and skin areas. The diminished radial pulse on turning the head (Adson&rsquo;s test positive) is caused by compression of the subclavian artery by the cervical rib, leading to vascular compromise. This cluster of signs and symptoms is characteristic of thoracic outlet syndrome caused by a cervical rib.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/21(159).jpg\" style=\"height:242px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/21(159).jpg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an alcoholic patient found unconscious or immobile for a prolonged period, the most common cause of a persistent foot drop is compression injury to the common peroneal nerve. This nerve wraps around the neck of the fibula, a superficial location where it is vulnerable to external pressure, especially during prolonged immobility (e.g., lying on a hard surface). Compression leads to weakness of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, resulting in foot drop. Sensory loss typically affects the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot. The common peroneal nerve is therefore the most likely nerve involved in this scenario.</p>\r\n",
