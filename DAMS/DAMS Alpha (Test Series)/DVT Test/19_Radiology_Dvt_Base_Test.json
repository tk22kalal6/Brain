      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MRI utilizes powerful magnetic fields to generate images. If a ferromagnetic metallic foreign body is present within or near the eye, exposure to these strong magnetic fields can cause the foreign body to move, twist, or dislodge. Such movement can lead to catastrophic damage to delicate ocular structures, including the retina, optic nerve, lens, or blood vessels, potentially causing further hemorrhage, inflammation, or even blindness. Additionally, metallic objects can heat up during an MRI scan, leading to thermal injury. Therefore, MRI is strongly contraindicated when a ferromagnetic intraocular foreign body is suspected until its presence and nature are ruled out by safer imaging modalities.</p>\r\n",

GCT typically occurs in adults between 20 to 40 years of age and involves the epiphysis of long bones. The distal radius is a common location. Radiologically, GCT presents as an eccentric, expansile, lytic lesion often extending to the articular surface without sclerotic margins, as seen in the X-ray provided. The soft tissue swelling and thinning of the cortex seen in the image further support this diagnosis.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putty Kidney</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The X-ray displays extensive, dense, and amorphous calcification in the region of one of the kidneys (appearing on the anatomical right, which is the left side of the image as conventionally viewed if the &quot;R&quot; marker is for the patient&#39;s right side). This appearance, where the kidney is essentially replaced by caseous, calcified material, giving it a putty-like consistency and appearance on imaging, is characteristic of end-stage renal tuberculosis. Renal tuberculosis is a common cause of &quot;sterile pyuria,&quot; which means there are white blood cells in the urine, but routine bacterial cultures are negative; this occurs because <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> requires special culture techniques and does not grow on standard media. Abdominal or flank pain can also be a symptom of renal tuberculosis. Thus, the combination of clinical symptoms (abdominal pain, sterile pyuria) and the classic radiological appearance strongly points towards a putty kidney secondary to tuberculosis.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supracardiac TAPVC-Snowman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC) is a congenital heart defect where all four pulmonary veins abnormally drain into the right atrium or veins leading to it, instead of the left atrium. In the supracardiac type, the pulmonary veins typically connect to a common vertical vein, which then drains into the innominate (brachiocephalic) vein and subsequently into the superior vena cava (SVC). This anomalous venous pathway causes the SVC and the vertical vein to dilate, creating a widened superior mediastinal shadow that forms the &quot;head&quot; of the snowman. The enlarged heart, resulting from right-sided volume overload due to the shunting of the entire pulmonary venous return to the right side, forms the &quot;body&quot; of the snowman. The increased pulmonary blood flow (pulmonary plethora) often seen with TAPVC is also consistent with the radiographic findings. Fatigue is a plausible symptom in a child with this condition due to inefficient circulation and potential cyanosis or heart failure.</p>\r\n",

This type of pain typically improves with activity and worsens with rest. Furthermore, the history of redness of the eye is highly suggestive of uveitis or iritis, which is a common extra-articular manifestation associated with AS. The provided X-ray of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis demonstrates significant changes in the sacroiliac (SI) joints. There appears to be bilateral sacroiliitis, characterized by irregularity, haziness, sclerosis (increased bone density), and likely partial or complete fusion (ankylosis) of these joints. Bilateral sacroiliitis is a hallmark radiological feature of ankylosing spondylitis and is often one of the earliest and most definitive signs of the disease.</p>\r\n",

The key feature identifying the dilated segment is the presence of valvulae conniventes (also known as plicae circulares), which are mucosal folds that characteristically extend all the way across the lumen of the bowel. These folds are relatively closely spaced and prominent in the dilated loops visible in the image, giving a classic &quot;stack of coins&quot; or &quot;coiled spring&quot; appearance. This specific appearance, particularly the closely packed and prominent circumferential folds, is most characteristic of dilated B. Jejunum. The jejunum constitutes the middle part of the small intestine, and its numerous valvulae conniventes are a distinguishing feature that helps differentiate it from other parts of the bowel on radiographic studies, especially when dilated due to obstruction or other pathology.</p>\r\n",

The child developed difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), which is a primary symptom indicating an obstruction or irritation within the esophagus. The chest X-rays provide definitive evidence: in the anteroposterior (AP) view, the coin appears &quot;en face&quot; (as a full circle), and in the lateral view, it appears &quot;on edge&quot; (as a thin line). This specific orientation is classic for a flat foreign body lodged in the esophagus; due to the structure of the esophageal musculature, flat objects tend to align themselves in the coronal plane. Furthermore, on the lateral view, the foreign body is situated posterior to the air-filled shadow of the trachea and anterior to the vertebral column, which is the anatomical location of the esophagus. The reported lack of respiratory distress is also more consistent with an esophageal foreign body than one in the airway.</p>\r\n",

CSOM can lead to the spread of infection to adjacent structures, with the temporal lobe and cerebellum being common sites for brain abscess formation. The provided axial CT scan shows an area of low attenuation (hypodensity) within the right temporal lobe, which is consistent with cerebritis (inflammation of brain tissue) or an early brain abscess, even without contrast administration (which would typically show ring enhancement in a mature abscess). The temporal lobe&#39;s proximity to the middle ear and mastoid makes it a frequent location for otogenic brain abscesses. Symptoms like fever are indicative of an active infection, and an abscess is a serious infectious complication.</p>\r\n",

Mature neurons in the adult brain are highly differentiated, specialized cells that are largely post-mitotic, meaning they do not typically undergo cell division. Due to this low rate of cell turnover and high degree of differentiation, nervous tissue, particularly mature neurons, is relatively radioresistant compared to tissues with rapidly proliferating cell populations. While high doses of radiation can still cause significant long-term damage to the brain, including radiation necrosis or cognitive impairment, the acute cell-killing effect is less pronounced in mature neurons compared to the other options listed.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4 shows Psoas</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient&#39;s history of untreated spinal tuberculosis (TB) leading to a swelling in the left groin is highly suggestive of a psoas abscess. A psoas abscess occurs when an infection from the spine (like TB) tracks down along the psoas muscle sheath. Irritation or inflammation of the psoas muscle (a condition known as psoasitis, often caused by the abscess) leads the patient to adopt a posture that minimizes pain by reducing stretch on this muscle. The psoas major muscle is a primary flexor of the hip. Therefore, irritation of this muscle will typically cause the hip to be held in flexion. Looking at the provided coronal CT scan and the numbered labels, the structure labeled 4 clearly represents the Left Psoas Muscle. Thus, the most appropriate marked muscle responsible for the flexion component of the limb&#39;s attitude is the psoas muscle. While the psoas major also contributes to external rotation of the hip, the clinical scenario of a psoas abscess most prominently explains the hip flexion. The internal rotation component mentioned in the question might be due to complex pain-related posturing, secondary muscle spasm, or involvement of adjacent structures, but the flexion is a direct consequence of psoas irritation.</p>\r\n",

This is typically achieved by inserting a large-bore needle into the pleural cavity (needle thoracostomy or needle decompression), often in the 5th intercostal space in the anterior or mid-axillary line as per current ATLS guidelines (or the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line traditionally). This rapidly converts the tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax, allowing the lung to re-expand partially and, critically, relieving the pressure on the mediastinal structures, which improves venous return and cardiac output, thereby addressing the hypotension. Following this emergency needle decompression, a definitive chest tube (Intercostal Drain - ICD) must be inserted to allow for continuous drainage of air and full re-expansion of the lung. Option C describes this complete and appropriate sequence of initial management for a tension pneumothorax.</p>\r\n",

MRI, with its superior soft-tissue contrast resolution compared to CT, is exceptionally valuable in assessing the extent of these tumors. It can more accurately delineate tumor invasion into the chest wall (including ribs and vertebrae), the brachial plexus, subclavian vessels, and the neural foramina or spinal canal. This detailed information regarding local invasion is critical for determining resectability, planning complex surgical approaches, and guiding radiation therapy. Therefore, MRI plays a crucial role in the comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning for Pancoast tumors.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiation dose at a point is inversely proportional to the square of distance from the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This principle is known as the Inverse Square Law, which is a fundamental concept in radiation physics. It states that for a point source of radiation that emits radiation isotropically (equally in all directions), the intensity of the radiation (and consequently the dose received) at any given point decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from that source. For instance, if you double the distance from the radiation source, the radiation dose will be reduced to one-quarter (1/2&sup2;) of its original value, and if you triple the distance, the dose will be reduced to one-ninth (1/3&sup2;). This law is critical for understanding radiation exposure and for implementing radiation protection measures, such as maintaining distance from radiation sources.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popliteal vein</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;Mickey Mouse sign&quot; is a characteristic sonographic view obtained in the transverse plane at the level of the groin, specifically depicting the saphenofemoral junction. In this sign, the large Common Femoral Vein (CFV) forms the &quot;face&quot; of Mickey Mouse. The Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) joining the CFV anteromedially forms one of Mickey&#39;s &quot;ears,&quot; and the Common Femoral Artery (CFA), positioned anterolateral or lateral to the CFV, typically forms the other &quot;ear.&quot; The popliteal vein, however, is located much more distally in the leg, within the popliteal fossa behind the knee. Therefore, due to its distinct anatomical location, the popliteal vein is not a component of the &quot;Mickey Mouse sign&quot; visualized in the groin.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TLD badge (Thermoluminescent Dosimeter badge).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TLD badges are passive radiation detection devices that are worn by individuals for a specified period (typically one to three months). They contain a crystalline material, such as lithium fluoride or calcium fluoride, which absorbs and stores energy when exposed to ionizing radiation. When the badge is processed, this material is heated, causing it to release the stored energy in the form of light. The intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the radiation dose received by the wearer. TLDs are widely used because they are relatively accurate, can measure a range of radiation doses and types (beta, gamma, X-rays), are reusable after annealing (though processing is usually done by specialized services), and provide a reliable record of an individual&#39;s cumulative radiation exposure for regulatory and safety purposes.</p>\r\n",

The IVC is a large, thin-walled, venous structure seen anterior and slightly to the right of the vertebral body on axial CT images. It returns deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the heart. In contrast to the aorta, which has a thicker wall and is usually located to the left of the spine, the IVC appears more ovoid or crescentic due to its compressibility and is often located more to the right. The position and the radiologic density of the structure in this scan match those of the IVC, confirming this as the correct answer.</p>\r\n",

It is located in the midline just inferior to the corpus callosum and can be visualized on axial CT scans as a paired structure running between the lateral ventricles. In the given image, the arrows point to two thin, white, symmetrical lines near the midline, which are characteristic of the columns of the fornix. These structures are surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid in the lateral ventricles, making them more visible on a CT scan. The fornix plays a critical role in the limbic system, involved in memory formation and recall.</p>\r\n",

This appearance occurs because simple fluid, which typically fills a cyst, offers very little resistance to the passage of ultrasound waves and reflects minimal to no sound waves back to the transducer. Therefore, the fluid-filled lumen of a simple cyst (like a renal cyst, ovarian cyst, or a ganglion cyst) will appear black. Other sonographic features of a simple cyst often include well-defined, thin walls and posterior acoustic enhancement (increased echogenicity behind the cyst) due to the unimpeded passage of sound through the fluid.</p>\r\n",
