      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genomic imprinting</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: Differential expression of parental genetic material in the child is known as genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon where certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. This means that depending on whether a gene is inherited from the mother or the father, it will be either expressed or silenced. This silencing occurs without changes to the underlying DNA sequence but through epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation. This leads to only one of the two parental alleles being expressed in the offspring.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient presents with a history of fatigue, weight loss, and multiple infections, coupled with a significant 20-year history of benzene exposure. Benzene is a well-established hematotoxic agent and a known human carcinogen, primarily targeting the bone marrow. Chronic exposure to benzene significantly increases the risk of developing hematological malignancies, which are cancers of the blood and blood-forming tissues. Conditions such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), and other leukemias and lymphomas are strongly associated with long-term benzene exposure. The patient&#39;s symptoms of fatigue (potentially due to anemia), weight loss (a common constitutional symptom of cancer), and multiple infections (suggesting impaired immune function or neutropenia secondary to bone marrow dysfunction) are all consistent with a hematological malignancy. While benzene exposure might have other systemic effects, its most prominent and well-documented carcinogenic effect is on the blood and bone marrow. Lung, bladder, and bowel cancers have different primary risk factors and are not as directly or strongly linked to benzene exposure as blood cancers are.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient presents with a mediastinal mass and has been diagnosed with red cell aplasia (also known as Pure Red Cell Aplasia - PRCA). PRCA is a condition characterized by anemia due to the failure of red blood cell production in the bone marrow, while other cell lines (white blood cells and platelets) are typically normal. There is a well-established and strong association between PRCA and thymic neoplasms, particularly thymoma, which is a tumor of the thymus gland located in the mediastinum. In adults, thymoma is the most common cause of paraneoplastic PRCA, with a significant percentage of PRCA cases occurring in patients with thymoma, and conversely, a smaller but notable percentage of thymoma patients developing PRCA. While other conditions listed, such as bronchogenic carcinoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, can also be mediastinal masses and are occasionally associated with paraneoplastic syndromes or hematological abnormalities, the link between thymic neoplasia and PRCA is particularly prominent and well-documented. Breast cancer is less likely to present primarily as a mediastinal mass causing PRCA in this direct manner. Therefore, in a patient with a mediastinal mass and red cell aplasia, a thymic neoplasm is the most probable underlying cause of the aplasia.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient presents with general fatigue and enlarged superficial lymph nodes. While the peripheral blood counts (TLC, DLC) are normal, the lymph node biopsy provides crucial diagnostic information. The biopsy shows effaced lymph node architecture, which means the normal structure is replaced by abnormal cells. These atypical cells are described as having indented nuclei (characteristic of centrocytes) and prominent nucleoli (seen in centroblasts). Immunohistochemistry reveals that these atypical cells are positive for CD10 and BCL2. CD10 is a marker often found on germinal center B-cells and lymphomas derived from them. BCL2 protein expression in the context of a CD10-positive B-cell proliferation with follicular features is a hallmark of Follicular Lymphoma. In normal reactive follicles, BCL2 is typically downregulated in germinal center B-cells, but in Follicular Lymphoma (often due to a t(14;18) translocation involving the BCL2 gene), BCL2 is aberrantly overexpressed. Burkitt Lymphoma is typically BCL2 negative. Hodgkin Lymphoma has different characteristic cells (Reed-Sternberg cells) and immunophenotype (usually CD30+, CD15+). Mycosis fungoides is a T-cell lymphoma primarily affecting the skin. Therefore, the combination of histological features and the CD10+/BCL2+ immunophenotype is most consistent with Follicular Lymphoma.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 20-year-old boy presents with symptoms suggestive of bone marrow failure: fever (persisting for 2 months, possibly due to neutropenia and infections), gum bleeding, petechiae, and easy bruising (indicative of thrombocytopenia). The peripheral blood (PB) findings show macrocytosis (enlarged red blood cells) and a very low reticulocyte count (0.5%), which signifies an inadequate bone marrow response to anemia (reticulocytopenia). The bone marrow (BM) examination is key, revealing a fatty marrow (hypocellular), absence of blasts (ruling out acute leukemia as the primary finding), and no megakaryocytes (explaining the severe thrombocytopenia). This combination of pancytopenia (implied by symptoms and specific findings like lack of megakaryocytes and anemia with no marrow response) originating from a hypocellular, fatty bone marrow that lacks hematopoietic precursors and blasts is characteristic of Aplastic Anemia. Atypical mycobacterial infection might cause marrow suppression, but the &quot;fatty marrow&quot; description is most classic for aplasia. Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) can be associated with bone marrow failure, but the primary picture here is aplasia. Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) typically present with a cellular or hypercellular marrow with dysplastic features, although hypocellular MDS exists, the overall picture strongly favors aplastic anemia.</p>\r\n",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In iron deficiency anemia (IDA), the body&#39;s iron stores are depleted. This leads to several characteristic changes in iron study parameters. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is increased because the liver produces more transferrin (the main iron transport protein) in an attempt to sequester more iron. Red cell protoporphyrin (or free erythrocyte protoporphyrin) levels are increased because when iron is unavailable for heme synthesis, protoporphyrin accumulates within red blood cells. Serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels are also increased as cells upregulate transferrin receptors on their surface in response to iron scarcity, and these receptors are shed into the circulation. However, transferrin saturation, which represents the percentage of transferrin that is bound to iron (calculated as serum iron divided by TIBC, multiplied by 100), is significantly decreased in IDA. This is because serum iron levels are low while TIBC is high. Therefore, transferrin saturation is the parameter that is not increased; it is characteristically reduced in iron deficiency anemia.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 35-year-old patient presents with weak upper limb pulses, retinal hemorrhage, and visual disturbance. This constellation of symptoms is highly suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects large blood vessels, particularly the aorta and its main branches (such as the subclavian, carotid, and vertebral arteries). The inflammation can lead to stenosis (narrowing), occlusion (blockage), or aneurysm formation in these arteries. Weak upper limb pulses (often referred to as &quot;pulseless disease&quot; in severe cases) are a classic sign resulting from stenosis of the subclavian or brachiocephalic arteries. Retinal hemorrhages and visual disturbances can occur due to involvement of the carotid or ophthalmic arteries, leading to ocular ischemia, or as a consequence of hypertension if the renal arteries are affected. Polyarteritis nodosa typically affects medium-sized arteries and is less commonly associated with prominent large vessel signs like markedly weakened upper limb pulses. Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein Purpura (IgA vasculitis) and Microscopic Polyangiitis are small vessel vasculitides and do not typically cause the large artery manifestations described.</p>\r\n",

These findings are characteristic of Mallory-Denk bodies (MDBs), also known as Mallory&#39;s hyaline. MDBs are intracytoplasmic inclusions found in hepatocytes that are under stress or undergoing injury, commonly seen in conditions like alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other chronic liver diseases leading to cirrhosis. Cytokeratins are proteins that form intermediate filaments, which are a major component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells, including hepatocytes (liver cells). Specifically, MDBs are composed of aggregates of disorganized cytokeratin intermediate filaments (primarily keratins 8 and 18 in the liver), along with other proteins such as ubiquitin. Actin and microtubules are other components of the cytoskeleton, but they are not the primary constituents of these cytokeratin-positive eosinophilic inclusions. Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein and would not be described as an intracellular cytokeratin-positive material. Therefore, the eosinophilic, cytokeratin-positive materials are most likely composed of intermediate filaments.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 50-year-old male presents with symptoms and laboratory findings highly suggestive of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). These include fatigability, massive splenomegaly, marked leukocytosis (TLC 120x10^9/L) with a spectrum of myeloid precursors in the peripheral blood (myeloblasts, myelocytes, bands), thrombocytosis (platelets 500x10^9/L), basophilia (4%), and a significantly increased M:E ratio (18:1) indicating myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow. CML is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is a result of the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) chromosomal translocation, leading to the formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The most specific and definitive diagnostic test for CML is the detection of this genetic abnormality. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) can directly identify the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or the Philadelphia chromosome in cells, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), particularly Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), can detect the BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcript. Immunophenotyping is useful for characterizing cell lineage but is not the primary diagnostic test for CML. A whole body PET CT is an imaging modality not typically used for the initial diagnosis of CML. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score is characteristically low in CML, but this test is less specific and has largely been replaced by more definitive genetic testing. Therefore, FISH and/or PCR for BCR-ABL1 are the most specific further investigations.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pap smear findings in the 21-year-old female describe cellular abnormalities including hyperchromatic nuclei (darkly stained nuclei indicating increased DNA content), pleomorphism (variation in the size and shape of cells and their nuclei), and a low maturation index, with these changes involving &quot;almost all thickness.&quot; These features are characteristic of dysplasia. Dysplasia refers to disordered growth and differentiation of epithelial cells, characterized by cellular atypia and a loss of normal maturation and architectural organization. It is considered a pre-malignant condition. Metaplasia is a reversible change from one mature cell type to another. Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells, which are typically normal in appearance. Carcinoma refers to invasive cancer.

The &quot;starry sky&quot; pattern is created by sheets of rapidly proliferating lymphoma cells (the &quot;sky&quot;) interspersed with benign tangible body macrophages that have ingested apoptotic tumor cells (the &quot;stars&quot;). Burkitt Lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is almost invariably associated with genetic translocations involving the MYC oncogene, located on chromosome 8q24. The most common translocation is t(8;14)(q24;q32), which places the MYC gene under the control of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers, leading to its constitutive overexpression. This drives uncontrolled cell proliferation. While RAS mutations and P53 mutations can occur in various cancers, and the BCR-ABL fusion gene is characteristic of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and some Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias, the MYC translocation is the defining genetic hallmark of Burkitt Lymphoma.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 65-year-old male presents with easy fatigue, and his peripheral blood smear (PBS) shows smudge cells. Smudge cells are disrupted lymphocytes that are characteristically found in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), as the neoplastic B-lymphocytes in CLL are more fragile than normal lymphocytes. Given this strong indicator, the next crucial step is to confirm the presence of a clonal B-cell population with an immunophenotype consistent with CLL. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry is the diagnostic investigation of choice for this purpose. This technique identifies specific cell surface markers (CD antigens) on the lymphocytes. In CLL, the neoplastic cells typically express B-cell markers (such as CD19, CD20 usually dim, CD23) along with the aberrant expression of the T-cell marker CD5, and show light chain restriction (kappa or lambda), confirming their monoclonality. While FISH and PCR (A) are important for prognostication in confirmed CLL by detecting chromosomal abnormalities or IGHV mutation status, immunophenotyping establishes the diagnosis itself. Whole body PET CT (C) is an imaging modality for staging or assessing transformation, not primary diagnosis from smudge cells. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (D) is relevant for distinguishing CML from leukemoid reactions and is not used in the diagnosis of CLL.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image displays the characteristic &quot;nutmeg&quot; appearance of a liver affected by chronic venous congestion. This pattern arises from a disparity in blood flow and oxygenation within the liver lobules. The dark red or brownish areas correspond to the centrilobular zones (around the central veins). In chronic venous congestion, these regions become engorged with deoxygenated blood due to impaired venous outflow. This leads to significant hypoxia, and consequently, the hepatocytes in these centrilobular areas often undergo necrosis (cell death) and hemorrhage. The paler or yellowish areas represent the periportal zones (around the portal tracts). These regions are relatively better oxygenated because they receive blood first from the portal vein and hepatic artery. Therefore, the hepatocytes in these periportal areas are more likely to remain viable, although they may exhibit fatty change (steatosis) due to the chronic hypoxia or associated metabolic disturbances, contributing to their paler appearance. Thus, the dark areas are typically necrotic due to severe congestion and hypoxia, while the pale areas are generally viable.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 6-year-old boy presents with a white reflex on eye examination, a condition known as leukocoria. In children, leukocoria is a significant clinical sign that warrants immediate investigation, as it can be indicative of serious intraocular conditions, most notably retinoblastoma. The biopsy finding of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes is a key histological feature that strongly supports this diagnosis. Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes are specific microscopic structures composed of tumor cells arranged in a spoke-like pattern around a central lumen, representing an attempt at photoreceptor differentiation. These rosettes are highly characteristic of retinoblastoma, which is the most common intraocular malignancy in childhood. Medulloblastoma is a brain tumor and does not cause leukocoria as a primary sign, nor does it typically show Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (it may show Homer Wright rosettes). Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the orbit but has a different histological appearance. Optic nerve glioma affects the optic nerve and also does not present with these specific rosettes or typically cause leukocoria in this manner.</p>\r\n",

The complete blood count (CBC) reveals a hemoglobin level of 9gm%, indicating anemia. The Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is 60 fL, which signifies microcytic anemia (normal MCV is typically 80-100 fL). Microscopy confirms the presence of microcytic red blood cells. A notable finding is the Red Blood Cell (RBC) count of 5.2 million, which is in the normal to high-normal range. This combination of microcytic anemia with a normal or elevated RBC count is a characteristic feature often seen in thalassemia trait, particularly beta-thalassemia trait. In iron deficiency anemia, another common cause of microcytic anemia, the RBC count is usually reduced along with hemoglobin and MCV. While serum ferritin is a crucial test for diagnosing iron deficiency, the specific pattern of low MCV and normal/high RBC count raises a strong suspicion for thalassemia. HbA2 quantification is a key diagnostic test for beta-thalassemia trait, as individuals with this condition typically have elevated levels of HbA2. Serum folate levels are relevant for macrocytic anemia, and homocysteine levels are not the primary investigation for microcytic anemia. Therefore, given the constellation of findings (microcytosis with a disproportionately normal/high RBC count for the degree of anemia), an HbA2 level is the most appropriate next investigation to explore the possibility of beta-thalassemia trait.</p>\r\n",

The provided peripheral blood smear image shows red blood cells that are predominantly microcytic (smaller than normal) and hypochromic (pale-staining with an increased area of central pallor, indicating reduced hemoglobin content). There is also evidence of anisocytosis (variation in cell size). These microscopic features are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. Chronic blood loss is a common cause of iron deficiency, as the body loses iron faster than it can be replenished through diet. Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, and its deficiency impairs hemoglobin synthesis, resulting in smaller red blood cells with less hemoglobin. B12 deficiency typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cells). Thalassemia can also cause microcytic and hypochromic anemia, but the history of hemorrhoids strongly points to an acquired cause like iron deficiency due to blood loss. Sickle cell anemia is characterized by sickle-shaped red blood cells, which are not evident in the provided image. Therefore, the clinical presentation and the peripheral smear findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of iron deficiency.</p>\r\n",

The peripheral smear findings of leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) with an increase in basophils (basophilia), along with the presence of immature myeloid cells like myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the peripheral blood, are highly characteristic of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. The cytogenetic hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, denoted as t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). This translocation leads to the formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, which drives the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. The other options are associated with different hematological malignancies: t(15;17) is characteristic of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL); t(1;22) is seen in a type of infant acute megakaryoblastic leukemia; and t(11;14) is typically found in Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Given the clinical and hematological picture, the t(9;22) translocation is the expected finding in this patient.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10-year-old child presents with bone pain and sclerotic changes in the bone, suggestive of osteomyelitis. The provided peripheral smear image clearly shows sickle-shaped red blood cells (drepanocytes), which are pathognomonic for Sickle Cell Disease. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease are particularly susceptible to osteomyelitis. While <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in the general population and remains a significant pathogen in sickle cell patients, <em>Salmonella</em> species have a markedly increased incidence and are classically associated with osteomyelitis in individuals with Sickle Cell Disease. This predisposition is thought to be due to factors such as functional asplenia (impaired spleen function leading to reduced clearance of encapsulated bacteria), intestinal infarcts allowing bacterial translocation, and defects in complement activation. Therefore, in a patient with confirmed Sickle Cell Disease presenting with osteomyelitis, <em>Salmonella</em> is the most characteristically implied organism.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient presents with jaundice and elevated bilirubin, indicating hemolysis or liver dysfunction. The peripheral blood smear is crucial here, as it shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells, indicated by the arrow). The presence of schistocytes is a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) or mechanical damage to red blood cells. This type of hemolysis leads to increased red blood cell breakdown, causing elevated bilirubin levels and subsequent jaundice. One of the significant causes of mechanical hemolysis and schistocyte formation is the presence of a prosthetic mechanical heart valve. These valves can cause shear stress and trauma to red blood cells as they pass through, leading to their fragmentation. Mechanical heart valves are also known to produce characteristic clicking or &quot;mechanical&quot; heart sounds, including an altered second heart sound (S2). Therefore, a &quot;Mechanical 2nd heart sound&quot; is directly associated with a potential cause (mechanical heart valve) of the observed hemolytic anemia with schistocytes and jaundice. Heme in stools indicates gastrointestinal bleeding, which doesn&#39;t typically cause schistocytic hemolysis. While splenomegaly can be seen in various hemolytic anemias as the spleen removes damaged cells, it is not as specifically linked to the <em>cause</em> of schistocyte formation as a mechanical valve is. A goitre is related to thyroid disorders and is not directly associated with this hematological picture.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 12-year-old boy presents with diarrhea and is noted to have the HLA DQ2 genetic marker. HLA DQ2, along with HLA DQ8, is strongly associated with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) in genetically predisposed individuals. In celiac disease, gluten consumption leads to an immune reaction that damages the lining of the small intestine, resulting in malabsorption and symptoms such as diarrhea. The cornerstone and most effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. This involves eliminating all sources of gluten, which allows the intestinal lining to heal and symptoms to resolve. Steroids might be used in severe, complicated cases but are not the primary treatment. A low lactose diet could be helpful if secondary lactose intolerance develops due to intestinal damage, but it doesn&#39;t treat the underlying celiac disease. Antibiotics are not indicated as celiac disease is not an infection. Therefore, a low gluten (gluten-free) diet is the appropriate treatment.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 25-year-old patient presents with a constellation of symptoms including a history of oral ulcers, arthritis, and rashes, along with the finding of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine (hematuria). This clinical picture, characterized by multi-system involvement (mucocutaneous, joint, and renal), is highly suggestive of a systemic autoimmune disease. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune condition that commonly affects young adults and can manifest with oral ulcers, various types of arthritis, a wide range of skin rashes, and kidney involvement. When SLE affects the kidneys, it is termed Lupus Nephritis, which frequently presents with hematuria and/or proteinuria. Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN) typically follows a streptococcal infection and primarily manifests as renal disease without the characteristic systemic features like chronic oral ulcers and widespread rashes. Acute Interstitial Nephritis is often drug-induced and may present with rash and hematuria but usually not the chronic history of oral ulcers and arthritis. Cystitis is a bladder infection that can cause hematuria but would not explain the systemic symptoms of oral ulcers, arthritis, and rashes. Therefore, Lupus Nephritis is the most likely diagnosis as it encompasses all the patient&#39;s reported symptoms and findings.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient, a software engineer, presents with easy fatigue, a common symptom of anemia. The complete blood count (CBC) reveals a hemoglobin (Hb) of 9gm%, confirming anemia, and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 120 fL. An MCV greater than 100 fL indicates macrocytic anemia. The patient&#39;s history of consuming more junk food and fewer fruits and vegetables is a crucial etiological clue. Folic acid (Vitamin B9) is primarily found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, and legumes. A deficiency in folic acid leads to impaired DNA synthesis, which affects rapidly dividing cells, including red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. This results in the production of large, immature, and dysfunctional red blood cells (megaloblasts), leading to macrocytic (megaloblastic) anemia. While Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) deficiency also causes macrocytic anemia, the patient&#39;s specific dietary history of low fruit and vegetable intake points more directly towards folic acid deficiency. Sideroblastic anemia can sometimes be macrocytic but is less likely given the overall picture and dietary habits. Acute blood loss typically causes normocytic anemia initially, or microcytic anemia if chronic and leading to iron deficiency, not macrocytic anemia of this degree.</p>\r\n",

Entosis is a non-phagocytic, cell-in-cell engulfment process that can lead to cell death or survival, distinct from other forms of cell death like apoptosis or necrosis. In entosis, one cell (the &quot;entotic cell&quot;) invades and is internalized by another cell (the &quot;host cell&quot;). This process is dependent on cell-cell adhesion and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Necrosis is an uncontrolled form of cell death often associated with inflammation. Apoptosis is programmed cell death characterized by specific morphological changes like cell shrinkage and fragmentation. Necroptosis is a form of programmed necrosis, sharing features of both apoptosis and necrosis but differing in its molecular mechanisms.</p>\r\n",
