      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It maintains high fidelity during DNA replication: This statement is incorrect. While telomerase adds specific repetitive sequences to telomeres, it is not primarily involved in the replication of the entire genome. The high fidelity of genomic DNA replication is ensured by replicative DNA polymerases, which possess sophisticated proofreading mechanisms to minimize errors. Telomerase itself is not known for having such high fidelity in the same way as these replicative polymerases; its primary role is to extend telomeric repeats, and it lacks the extensive proofreading capabilities of the main DNA replication machinery. Therefore, it does not maintain high fidelity <em>during</em> the overall process of DNA replication in the context of the entire genome.</p>\r\n",

      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing for the purpose of creating a gene knockout typically relies on the cell&#39;s Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism. When the Cas9 nuclease creates a double-strand break (DSB) at the targeted gene location, the cell attempts to repair this break. The NHEJ pathway is an efficient but often error-prone repair system that directly ligates the broken DNA ends. This process frequently introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the site of the break. If these indels occur within the coding sequence of a gene, they can cause a frameshift mutation, leading to the production of a truncated or non-functional protein, effectively knocking out the gene&#39;s function. While Homology Directed Repair (HDR, sometimes referred to by variations like HEJ) can also repair DSBs, it requires a homologous template and is often used for precise gene editing (like insertions or corrections) rather than straightforward knockout, and NHEJ is generally the more active pathway for DSB repair leading to indels in the absence of a repair template. Base Excision Repair and Nucleotide Excision Repair are pathways that deal with single-base damages or bulky lesions, respectively, not primarily with the repair of double-strand breaks in the context of CRISPR-Cas9 induced knockouts.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) serves as an essential cofactor for two crucial enzymes in human metabolism. One of these is Methylmalonyl CoA mutase (which can also be described functionally as an isomerase as it converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an isomerization reaction). This enzyme plays a vital role in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and certain amino acids (isoleucine, valine, threonine, and methionine). A deficiency in Vitamin B12 leads to impaired function of Methylmalonyl CoA mutase, resulting in the accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA and subsequently elevated levels of methylmalonic acid in the blood and urine (methylmalonic aciduria), which is a specific diagnostic marker for B12 deficiency.</p>\r\n",

The polar hydroxyl groups of glycerol are involved in ester bonds with the fatty acids.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technique primarily used to quantify RNA is Real-time PCR (often in conjunction with a preceding reverse transcription step, making it Real-Time RT-PCR or RT-qPCR). Real-time PCR monitors the amplification of DNA (or cDNA derived from RNA) during each cycle of the PCR reaction. This is typically achieved by using fluorescent dyes or probes that bind to the accumulating DNA, with the fluorescence intensity directly proportional to the amount of PCR product. By measuring the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal crosses a defined threshold (Ct value), researchers can accurately determine the initial quantity of the target nucleic acid in the sample.</p>\r\n",

The hypothesis states that while the base pairing between the first two nucleotides of an mRNA codon and the corresponding tRNA anticodon is precise (following Watson-Crick rules), the pairing between the third nucleotide of the codon and the first nucleotide of the anticodon (the &quot;wobble position&quot;) can be less strict, allowing for non-standard base pairings. This &quot;wobble&quot; allows a single tRNA molecule to recognize and bind to more than one codon, thereby explaining how several different codons can all code for the same amino acid, which is the essence of degeneracy.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, also known as Zellweger syndrome, is a rare, severe genetic disorder characterized by the absence or malfunction of peroxisomes&mdash;cellular organelles crucial for various metabolic processes. One of the primary functions of peroxisomes is the beta-oxidation (breakdown) of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which are fatty acids with 22 or more carbon atoms. In individuals with Zellweger syndrome, the defective peroxisomes are unable to properly metabolize these VLCFAs. Consequently, very long-chain fatty acids accumulate in various tissues and organs, including the brain, liver, and kidneys. This accumulation in the brain leads to severe neurological problems, including impaired neuronal migration, myelination defects, and profound developmental delays, which are characteristic features of the syndrome. The other substances listed&mdash;pyruvate, short-chain fatty acids, and glycogen&mdash;are metabolized through different pathways that are not primarily dependent on peroxisomal function in the context that would lead to their accumulation as the defining feature of this specific disorder.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thiamine (Vitamin B1), in its active form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is an essential cofactor for several key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism. One of the most critical thiamine-dependent enzymes is Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH). The PDH complex catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle for energy production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In cases of thiamine deficiency, the activity of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase complex is impaired due to insufficient TPP. This impairment means that pyruvate cannot be efficiently converted to acetyl-CoA. Consequently, pyruvate accumulates in the cells. The excess pyruvate is then shunted into alternative metabolic pathways, primarily its conversion to lactic acid by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This increased production of lactic acid leads to lactic acidosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of lactate in the blood, lowering its pH.</p>\r\n",

This process is often error-prone and frequently introduces small insertions or deletions of nucleotides (indels) at the site of the break. If these indels occur within the coding sequence of a target gene, they can cause a frameshift mutation, leading to a premature stop codon and the production of a non-functional protein, effectively &quot;knocking out&quot; the gene.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. They primarily function by binding to complementary sequences within target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to translational repression (inhibiting protein production) or mRNA degradation. The most common and well-characterized binding sites for miRNAs are located in the 3&#39; untranslated region (3&#39;UTR) of their target mRNAs. This interaction, often mediated by a &quot;seed sequence&quot; at the 5&#39; end of the miRNA, allows the miRNA-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) to effectively silence the expression of the targeted gene. While some instances of miRNA binding to 5&#39;UTRs or coding regions have been reported, binding to the 3&#39;UTR is the predominant mechanism for miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Binding to gene promoter sequences or intergenic sequences is not the typical mode of action for the canonical gene silencing function of miRNAs.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insulin, a key anabolic hormone released in response to high blood glucose levels, plays a crucial role in promoting energy storage and inhibiting the breakdown of stored reserves. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), an enzyme located within adipocytes (fat cells), is responsible for mobilizing stored triglycerides by hydrolyzing them into fatty acids and glycerol, which are then released into the bloodstream. Insulin strongly downregulates or inhibits the activity of HSL. By doing so, insulin prevents the breakdown of stored fat when energy from dietary sources is abundant, thus favoring fat storage. This contrasts with Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which insulin generally upregulates to promote the uptake of fatty acids into cells from circulating lipoproteins for storage. Gastric and pancreatic lipases are primarily involved in dietary fat digestion and are not directly downregulated by insulin as a primary control mechanism.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: Protein precipitation is a common method for protein purification and concentration. It typically works by altering the solubility of proteins, causing them to aggregate and fall out of solution. Heavy metals and salts (like ammonium sulfate) can cause &quot;salting out&quot; by competing with proteins for water molecules, reducing their hydration shells. Organic solvents like alcohol, acetone, and trichloroacetic acid decrease the dielectric constant of the solution and can disrupt the hydration shell around proteins, leading to their precipitation. Changing the pH to the isoelectric point (pI) of a protein is a common method for precipitation, as at the pI, the net charge of the protein is zero, reducing electrostatic repulsion between molecules and promoting aggregation. However, changing the pH <em>from</em> the isoelectric point would increase the net charge on the protein, making it more soluble due to increased electrostatic repulsion, thus inhibiting precipitation, not causing it. Therefore, changing pH from the isoelectric point is the exception among the listed methods that cause protein precipitation.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: In the early fasting state, the body&#39;s primary energy reserves from carbohydrates (glycogen) begin to deplete. While other tissues, like the brain, still primarily rely on glucose, the liver shifts its energy metabolism to conserve glucose for these tissues. The liver becomes a net producer of glucose (via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) rather than a primary consumer of it. Instead, the liver largely relies on fatty acid oxidation for its own energy needs. Fatty acids are mobilized from adipose tissue and transported to the liver, where they undergo &beta;-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Ketone bodies are also produced by the liver from fatty acids during prolonged fasting, but the liver itself cannot efficiently utilize them for energy; they are primarily exported for use by other tissues (e.g., brain, muscle). Amino acids can be used for energy via gluconeogenesis, but fatty acids are the predominant energy source for the liver in the early fasting state.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: A patient with Marfanoid habitus and dislocated lens, along with deficient cystathionine synthase, points to a diagnosis of homocystinuria. Cystathionine synthase is an enzyme involved in the transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine to cystathionine, and subsequently to cysteine. When cystathionine synthase is deficient, homocysteine accumulates, leading to the symptoms seen in homocystinuria. Since the pathway from methionine to cysteine is blocked, cysteine becomes an essential amino acid in this condition and must be supplemented in the diet. Methionine would accumulate if not for alternative pathways, and homocysteine would be high. Serine is a substrate for cystathionine synthase, but its deficiency is not the primary issue here; rather, the block in the pathway downstream impacts cysteine production.</p>\r\n",
