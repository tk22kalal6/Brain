      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Desflurane</strong> is known for causing the <strong>maximum respiratory irritation</strong> among commonly used inhalational anesthetic agents. It is associated with a pungent odor and can lead to coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm, and increased airway secretions, particularly during induction of anesthesia. This is due to its low blood-gas solubility and rapid onset, which can cause a sudden increase in alveolar concentration, irritating the airway mucosa. Because of this, desflurane is typically avoided for inhalational induction, especially in pediatric or sensitive patients, and is more often used for maintenance of anesthesia once the airway is secured.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etomidate is known to cause significant pain on intravenous (IV) injection, more so than most other anesthetic agents. This pain is likely due to the drug&rsquo;s formulation in a propylene glycol solution or lipid emulsion, which can irritate the vein walls. Patients often report burning or stinging sensations immediately upon administration. In clinical practice, the pain can be reduced by prior injection of lidocaine or using a larger vein. Despite its painful injection, etomidate is favored in certain situations (like hemodynamic instability) due to its minimal cardiovascular effects.</p>\r\n",

BIS is a quantitative EEG-based monitoring tool that gives a numerical value (typically between 0 and 100) reflecting the patient&#39;s level of consciousness. A BIS value of 40&ndash;60 is generally targeted during general anesthesia, indicating an adequate depth for surgical procedures without awareness. BIS helps in titrating anesthetic drugs accurately, reducing the risk of both underdosing (awareness) and overdosing (excessive sedation and complications), and is especially useful in high-risk or long-duration surgeries.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curare acts as a competitive antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) located at the neuromuscular junction. It competes with acetylcholine (ACh) for binding to these receptors but does not activate them, thereby preventing depolarization of the muscle end-plate and leading to skeletal muscle paralysis. This mechanism underlies the use of curare and its derivatives (like tubocurarine) as non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia to induce muscle relaxation during surgery. Since it is competitive, its effects can be reversed by increasing ACh levels using cholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine.</p>\r\n",

Atracurium can lead to histamine-mediated side effects such as hypotension, flushing, and bronchospasm, which are not desirable during anesthesia. Cisatracurium is a more refined stereoisomer of atracurium and retains similar efficacy as a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, but with a cleaner side effect profile, particularly due to the lack of significant histamine release.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)<br />\r\n&bull; Conventional oxygen therapy (COT) is the main supportive treatment administered to patients<br />\r\nafter planned extubation and has conventionally been delivered using nasal prongs, cannula or<br />\r\nmasks.<br />\r\n&bull; However, the maximal oxygen flow rates that these devices can deliver are limited.<br />\r\n&bull; The maximal oxygen flow rate delivered by COT is only 15 L/min, which is far lower than the<br />\r\ndemands of post extubation patients with acute respiratory failure.<br />\r\n&bull; Therefore, ambient air dilutes the supplied oxygen, and finally, the fraction of inspired oxygen<br />\r\n(FiO2) is significantly reduced in the alveoli.<br />\r\n&bull; Furthermore, with oxygen delivered by COT, it is difficult to meet the requirements of heating and<br />\r\nhumidification in these patients.<br />\r\n&bull; High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can supply a mixture of air and oxygen via a heated and<br />\r\nhumidified circuit at a very high flow.<br />\r\n&bull; It can provide almost pure oxygen with a FiO2 of approximately 100% and a maximal flow rate up<br />\r\nto 60 L/min.<br />\r\n&bull; The use of a HFNC may generate a positive airway pressure, ameliorate oxygenation and<br />\r\ndyspnoea, reduce the respiratory rate and work of breathing, and improve comfort</p>\r\n",
