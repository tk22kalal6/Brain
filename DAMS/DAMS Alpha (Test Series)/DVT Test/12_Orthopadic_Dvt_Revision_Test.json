      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colles&rsquo; fracture is a distal radius fracture typically caused by a fall on an outstretched hand. One of its hallmark features is a dorsal tilt or angulation of the distal fracture fragment&mdash;not volar (palmar) tilt. In fact, loss of normal volar tilt or reversal into dorsal tilt is a diagnostic feature seen on X-ray. Therefore, volar tilt is not a feature of Colles&rsquo; fracture and is the correct answer to this question.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poland&rsquo;s Anomaly (also known as Poland Syndrome) is a congenital condition characterized by unilateral absence or underdevelopment of the pectoralis major muscle, often accompanied by ipsilateral upper limb anomalies such as syndactyly (webbed fingers) or shortened fingers. It typically presents as chest wall deformity, with a visible flattening on one side and restricted arm movement. The diagnosis is clinical and based on physical appearance. A 32-year-old man presenting with such characteristic features (chest asymmetry, upper limb abnormalities) strongly suggests Poland&rsquo;s Anomaly.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The device shown in the image is a type of external fixator that specifically resembles a <strong>Rail Road Fixator</strong>. This type of external fixator uses long, strong bars (like rails) that are fixed to the bone segments via pins or wires inserted into the bone. The pins are then clamped to these rails, providing rigid fixation for fractures, limb lengthening, or deformity correction. The multiple parallel bars and the overall structure, with pins inserted into the bone and connected to a sturdy external frame, give it the appearance of a &quot;railroad track,&quot; hence the common name.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The X-ray image shows an oblique intra-articular fracture of the radial styloid process, which is the lateral projection of the distal radius. This specific type of fracture is known as a Chauffeur&#39;s fracture, also called a Hutchinson fracture or backfire fracture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, this fracture occurred in individuals who would start early automobiles by cranking them. If the engine backfired, the crank could violently swing back, striking the hand and forcing the wrist into radial deviation and extension, causing the scaphoid to impact against the radial styloid, leading to its fracture. Clinically, it&#39;s an intra-articular fracture involving the radial styloid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image clearly demonstrates a fracture line extending into the radiocarpal joint (intra-articular) and involving the styloid process of the radius.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement is incorrect. In Paget&#39;s disease of bone, the levels of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) in the blood are typically significantly elevated. ALP is an enzyme produced by osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). Paget&#39;s disease is characterized by disorganized and excessive bone remodeling, involving both increased bone resorption (by osteoclasts) and increased, but abnormal, bone formation (by osteoblasts). This high turnover of bone leads to a marked increase in osteoblastic activity, which in turn leads to a rise in ALP levels in the blood. Elevated ALP is a key biochemical marker used for diagnosis, monitoring disease activity, and assessing response to treatment in Paget&#39;s disease.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement is generally false. Bisphosphonates, including Ibandronic Acid, are well-known for causing gastrointestinal (GI) upset as a common side effect. These can include esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, heartburn, dyspepsia, nausea, and abdominal pain. While newer oral bisphosphonates or different formulations might aim to reduce GI side effects, GI intolerance remains a significant reason for non-adherence to oral bisphosphonate therapy. In fact, many other medications for osteoporosis (e.g., calcitonin, selective estrogen receptor modulators like raloxifene, or even some anabolic agents like teriparatide) typically have a <em>lower</em> incidence of GI upset specifically related to esophageal irritation compared to oral bisphosphonates. Therefore, claiming it has &quot;less chances of GI upset than other medications of Osteoporosis&quot; is incorrect in a general sense.</p>\r\n",
