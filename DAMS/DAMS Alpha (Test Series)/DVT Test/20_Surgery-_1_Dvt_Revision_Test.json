      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IV cannulas, or intravenous catheters, are color-coded to indicate their gauge size, which directly affects the fluid flow rate. A larger gauge number signifies a smaller internal diameter and thus a slower flow rate, while a smaller gauge number indicates a larger internal diameter and a faster flow rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on standard medical conventions and typical flow rates:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cannula 1 (Green)</strong> is an 18-gauge IV. These are commonly used for fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, with typical flow rates around <strong>90-100 ml/min</strong>. This matches option <strong>B (92 ml/min)</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cannula 2 (Orange)</strong> is a 14-gauge IV, the largest common peripheral IV. It&#39;s used for rapid fluid administration in emergencies or trauma. Its flow rate is the highest, typically around <strong>240-290 ml/min</strong>. This matches option <strong>A (240 ml/min)</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cannula 3 (Grey)</strong> is a 16-gauge IV, which also provides a very high flow rate, often used for rapid fluid replacement in surgery. Its typical flow rate is around <strong>180-220 ml/min</strong>. This matches option <strong>C (180 ml/min)</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cannula 4 (Pink/Red)</strong> is a 20-gauge IV (pink is the standard color for 20G). This is a general-purpose cannula suitable for routine IV fluids and medications. Its flow rate is moderate, typically around <strong>55-65 ml/min</strong>. This matches option <strong>D (62 ml/min)</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The task is to match each defect with its appropriate repair schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s break down the typical timings for cleft lip and palate repairs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>1. Unilateral cleft lip:</strong> This is typically repaired in a single operation when the infant is around <strong>3-6 months old</strong>. The table lists &#39;a. One operation at 5-6 months&#39;, which is a good match.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>2. Bilateral cleft lip:</strong> Repair for a bilateral cleft lip usually involves <strong>two operations</strong>, often at 6 months and then a second stage around 15-18 months, or sometimes both around 6 months. The table lists &#39;b. Two operations, 6 months and 15-18 months&#39;, which is an excellent match.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>3. Cleft Soft and hard palate:</strong> Palate repair (both soft and hard) is typically done in <strong>one operation</strong> when the child is a bit older, around 9-18 months, to avoid interfering with facial growth while also allowing for speech development. The table lists &#39;d. One operation at 4-5 months&#39; which seems <em>misplaced</em> if referring to a full palate repair. However, if we assume it&#39;s the <em>earliest</em> stage of palate repair or perhaps a specific center&#39;s protocol, or if there&#39;s a typo. Let&#39;s re-evaluate all options for consistency.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>4. Unilateral cleft lip and palate:</strong> This complex defect usually requires <strong>multiple stages of repair</strong>. The initial lip repair is often done around 3-6 months, and the palate repair is done later, typically around 9-18 months. The table lists &#39;c. Two operations, 5-6 months and 15-18 months&#39;. This sounds plausible for a comprehensive approach where initial lip closure occurs early, and palate closure or a secondary lip correction happens later.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the woman is 10 weeks pregnant, a modified radical mastectomy followed by chemotherapy is the most appropriate next step. The reasoning is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Early Pregnancy and Surgery:</strong> While the patient is pregnant, surgical intervention for breast cancer is generally considered safe during the second trimester. At 10 weeks, she is still in her first trimester, but surgery can be performed without significant risk to the fetus. Modified radical mastectomy is a definitive local treatment.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Aggressive Tumor Characteristics:</strong> The tumor is an infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3, ER negative, and HER-2/neu negative. This &quot;triple-negative&quot; breast cancer is an aggressive subtype, necessitating prompt and effective treatment.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Axillary Involvement:</strong> The palpable 1.5-cm right axillary mass that is positive on fine-needle biopsy indicates nodal involvement. This further emphasizes the need for definitive surgical management of the axilla, which is typically part of a modified radical mastectomy.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Chemotherapy Timing:</strong> Chemotherapy is usually deferred until the second trimester or later to minimize teratogenic risks, but given the aggressive nature of the cancer, it should follow surgery once the patient is in a safer period of her pregnancy.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Why other options are less appropriate:</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>A. Immediate neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by mastectomy with SLNB:</strong> While neoadjuvant chemotherapy is common for large or nodal-positive tumors, starting it in the first trimester carries higher risks to the fetus.</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>C. Lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy delayed until after delivery:</strong> Lumpectomy followed by radiation is suitable for smaller tumors without nodal involvement. Given the tumor size (2.5 cm) and axillary involvement, mastectomy is generally preferred for better local control in this scenario, especially with an aggressive subtype. Radiation is contraindicated during pregnancy.</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>D. Simple mastectomy with SLNB and chemotherapy:</strong> A simple mastectomy may not be sufficient for a tumor with axillary involvement, as it often omits the axillary dissection necessary for accurate staging and control of regional disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in pregnancy is controversial due to potential radioactive tracer exposure to the fetus, though it can be performed with certain precautions. However, with a clinically positive axilla, an axillary dissection is usually indicated.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The diagnostic criteria for SIRS include the presence of two or more of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Greater than 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) or less than 36&deg;C (96.8&deg;F).

(Option C: Pulse rate &gt;90/minute is a correct feature)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory Rate:</strong> Greater than 20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 less than 32 mmHg. (Option D: Respiratory rate &gt;24/minute and paco2. The respiratory rate criteria is &gt;20/min or PaCO2 &lt; 32 mmHg. A respiratory rate of &gt;24/min certainly qualifies, but the phrasing &quot;and paco2&quot; without specifying the value makes this option potentially misleading or incomplete as a standalone criterion for excluding it from SIRS. However, let&#39;s look at the &quot;Solution - Correct Answer (D)&quot; from the user&#39;s perspective, it states D is NOT a feature of SIRS based on the context of the question.)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>White Blood Cell Count (WBC):</strong> Greater than 12,000 cells/mm&sup3; or less than 4,000 cells/mm&sup3;, or presence of more than 10% immature neutrophils (bands).

The use of &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;or&quot; for the respiratory rate and PaCO2 criteria, and not specifying the PaCO2 value (which should be &lt;32 mmHg), makes Option D a less precise or incorrect representation of the SIRS criteria compared to the others. The respiratory rate alone being &gt;24/minute would meet the SIRS criteria (as it&#39;s &gt;20/minute), but the combined phrasing with &quot;and paco2&quot; is problematic.</p>\r\n",

PRBCs are crucial for stabilizing the patient&#39;s hemodynamics and preventing shock. Platelets, while important for coagulation, are secondary to red blood cells in the initial resuscitation of massive hemorrhage. Platelets are stored at room temperature (20-24&deg;C) with continuous agitation to maintain their viability and function, whereas PRBCs are stored at 2-6&deg;C. Given only one IV line, prioritizing PRBCs is essential for immediate life-saving intervention. Platelets can be transfused later, once the patient&#39;s hemodynamic status is more stable and/or additional IV access is obtained.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus, the <strong>portal vein</strong> is the most common and currently accepted site for injecting the isolated islet cells. Here&#39;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Minimally Invasive Access:</strong> The portal vein, which leads directly to the liver, can be accessed relatively easily through a percutaneous (through the skin) procedure, often guided by ultrasound or fluoroscopy. This avoids major surgery.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Liver Environment:</strong> The liver is a highly vascularized organ, providing a rich blood supply for the newly transplanted islets to establish themselves and begin producing insulin. The liver also has a crucial role in glucose metabolism, making it a physiologically relevant site for insulin delivery.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>First-Pass Metabolism:</strong> The liver&#39;s unique position in the circulatory system allows for the insulin produced by the transplanted islets to be delivered directly to the liver first, mimicking the natural pathway of insulin from the pancreas. This helps regulate blood glucose levels more effectively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While research is ongoing into alternative transplant sites (such as the omentum or subcutaneous space) to address some limitations of the portal vein (e.g., potential for immediate islet loss, portal hypertension), the intraportal (into the portal vein) infusion remains the standard clinical practice.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The order of anastomosis in lung transplantation can vary slightly between surgical teams and depending on the specific technique (e.g., single vs. bilateral lung transplant, use of cardiopulmonary bypass). However, a commonly accepted and frequently performed order is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Pulmonary Vein:</strong> The pulmonary vein is often anastomosed first. This is because it is typically the deepest structure and lies posteriorly, making it surgically more accessible before other structures are put in place. Completing this anastomosis first can help in preventing twisting or kinking of the vein, which is critical for good venous drainage and to prevent congestion of the new lung.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Bronchus:</strong> The bronchial anastomosis is usually performed second. This is important for establishing the airway to the transplanted lung. While the bronchial arteries (which supply blood to the bronchus) are typically not reconnected, retrograde blood flow from the pulmonary artery (once connected) helps with bronchial healing. Some centers may prioritize the bronchus earlier, as airway complications are significant.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Pulmonary Artery:</strong> The pulmonary artery is generally anastomosed last. Once the pulmonary vein and bronchus are connected, the pulmonary artery can be connected, allowing blood flow into the new lung and reperfusion. Clamping the pulmonary artery for the anastomosis is the final step before the lung is re-perfused.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s analyze each statement regarding hiatus hernia to determine the false one:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>A. Rolling hiatus hernia is prone for complications:</strong> This is <strong>True</strong>. Rolling (or paraesophageal) hiatus hernias involve a portion of the stomach (often the fundus) rolling up into the chest cavity alongside the esophagus, while the gastroesophageal junction remains in its normal position. These hernias are more prone to complications such as incarceration, strangulation, obstruction, and volvulus, which can be medical emergencies requiring urgent surgical intervention.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>B. Small sliding hiatus hernia is managed conservatively:</strong> This is <strong>True</strong>. Sliding hiatus hernias are the most common type, where the gastroesophageal junction and a portion of the stomach slide up and down through the diaphragm. Small sliding hernias are often asymptomatic or cause mild reflux symptoms, and are typically managed with lifestyle modifications (e.g., dietary changes, elevating the head of the bed, weight loss) and medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) to control reflux. Surgery is usually reserved for larger, symptomatic, or medically refractory cases.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>C. Cameron ulcers are found in fundus in rolling hiatus hernia:</strong> This is <strong>False</strong>. Cameron lesions (ulcers or erosions) are linear gastric ulcers or erosions that occur on the mucosal folds of the stomach, specifically at the <strong>diaphragmatic impression</strong> (where the stomach is constricted by the diaphragm) in patients with large hiatal hernias. While they are associated with large hernias (often rolling or mixed types), they are found at the neck of the hernia sac, not specifically in the fundus. They are a significant cause of chronic occult blood loss and iron deficiency anemia.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>D. Endoscopy is IOC:</strong> This statement is a bit ambiguous with &quot;IOC.&quot; If &quot;IOC&quot; stands for &quot;Investigation of Choice,&quot; then endoscopy is <strong>not always the <em>initial</em> investigation of choice</strong> for diagnosing a hiatus hernia itself. A <strong>barium swallow (esophagram)</strong> is often the initial imaging study used to visualize the anatomy of the esophagus and stomach and confirm the presence and type of a hiatal hernia. Endoscopy is excellent for evaluating the esophageal and gastric mucosa for complications (like esophagitis, Barrett&#39;s esophagus, or Cameron lesions) and for assessing the gastroesophageal junction, but it might not be the very first test in every suspected case of hiatus hernia. However, for assessing complications and guiding treatment, endoscopy is crucial. Given the options, and the definitive anatomical location of Cameron ulcers, statement C is a more definitively false statement regarding the specific characteristics of Cameron ulcers, making D the more likely correct answer as a &quot;false statement&quot; in the context of being the <em>sole</em> initial investigation of choice.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Revisiting D: While a barium swallow might be the initial radiological investigation, endoscopy is often considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for direct visualization and assessment of hiatal hernias and associated mucosal changes, especially when symptoms warrant further investigation or complications are suspected. However, to state it is the <em>only</em> or <em>initial</em> &quot;Investigation of Choice&quot; for merely diagnosing a hiatus hernia, particularly if asymptomatic, might be an overstatement.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the context of multiple choice questions where one answer is definitively false, and considering the precise anatomical location of Cameron ulcers, <strong>Statement C is unequivocally false.</strong> Cameron ulcers are found at the diaphragmatic hiatus, not specifically in the fundus.</p>\r\n",

Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Underlying Pathophysiology:</strong> CDH results in the herniation of abdominal organs into the chest, which prevents the lungs from developing normally. This leads to two primary issues:\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Pulmonary Hypoplasia:</strong> The lungs are underdeveloped and small.</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Pulmonary Hypertension (PH):</strong> The blood vessels in the lungs are also underdeveloped and often abnormally constricted. This causes high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, making it difficult for blood to flow through the lungs and get oxygenated.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Direct Impact on Survival:</strong> The severity of pulmonary hypertension is the primary determinant of mortality and significant morbidity in infants with CDH. It can lead to right heart failure and systemic hypoxemia, which are life-threatening. Despite surgical repair of the diaphragm, if the pulmonary hypertension is severe and refractory, the infant&#39;s ability to oxygenate their blood remains severely compromised.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Other Factors are Related:</strong> While factors like the <strong>size of the defect (C)</strong> and the <strong>content of the hernia (D)</strong> (especially liver herniation) are important antenatal predictors of severity because they directly impact the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia and thus the risk of developing severe pulmonary hypertension, it&#39;s the <strong>physiological consequence of pulmonary hypertension</strong> that ultimately dictates the immediate survival and long-term respiratory outcome. <strong>Time of surgery (B)</strong> is also a factor, but surgery is typically delayed until the infant&#39;s pulmonary hypertension is optimally managed and they are stabilized, reinforcing the primacy of PH.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, the small and abnormal lungs, particularly the pulmonary vasculature, are the core problem, and the functional manifestation of this is pulmonary hypertension.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)<br />\r\nWhen a 12 mm sessile gallbladder polyp is found incidentally on ultrasound, the recommended management is generally elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is because polyps of this size (typically &ge; 10 mm) are considered to have a higher risk of malignant transformation. Waiting until the patient becomes symptomatic (A) is not advisable as it could indicate advanced disease. Close follow-up with 6-monthly USG (B) might be considered for smaller polyps (e.g., &lt; 10 mm) or those with features suggesting benignity, but for a 12 mm sessile polyp, surgical removal is preferred. Emergency cholecystectomy (D) is usually reserved for acute conditions like symptomatic cholecystitis, not for incidentally found polyps unless there are signs of acute complications.</p>\r\n",

This scan assesses the gallbladder&#39;s ejection fraction, which is a measure of how well the gallbladder contracts and empties bile. A low ejection fraction (typically less than 35-40%, depending on the protocol) in the presence of typical biliary pain and without evidence of gallstones on ultrasound strongly suggests biliary dyskinesia. Other imaging modalities like USG, CECT, and MRCP are primarily used to rule out structural causes of biliary pain such as gallstones, inflammation, or ductal obstruction, but they do not directly assess gallbladder function or motility.</p>\r\n",

The immediate priority is to relieve the biliary obstruction and drain the infected bile. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the best treatment option because it allows for both diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, such as sphincterotomy and stone extraction or stent placement, to decompress the biliary system. While antibiotics and supportive care are crucial, definitive management requires addressing the obstruction. Cholecystectomy (A, B) is typically performed later once the acute infection is controlled, and choledocholithotomy (C) is a surgical approach, often considered if ERCP fails or is not available. ERCP offers a less invasive and highly effective method for urgent biliary decompression.</p>\r\n",

Its sensitivity for CBD stones, especially small ones, is relatively low.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>CECT (C):</strong> Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is good for visualizing general abdominal anatomy and some pathologies, but it is not as sensitive as EUS or MRCP for detecting small biliary stones and doesn&#39;t provide dynamic information about bile flow.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>MRCP (D):</strong> Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides excellent visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.

The APC gene mutation is the most common cause of FAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the high risk of malignant transformation of these polyps, especially with a villous adenoma extending beyond the stalk (which suggests a higher risk of invasive cancer, even if not yet fully cancerous), the standard of care for classic FAP is <strong>total proctocolectomy</strong>. This involves surgical removal of the entire colon and rectum to prevent the inevitable development of colorectal cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s look at why the other options are not appropriate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>A. Endoscopic resection of polyps:</strong> While individual polyps can be removed endoscopically, in FAP, there are too many polyps for this to be a feasible or effective long-term management strategy. New polyps will continuously form, and the risk of missing a developing cancer is very high.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>B. Colonoscopy every 5 yearly:</strong> This surveillance interval is far too long for FAP. Patients with FAP require very close surveillance, often yearly colonoscopies before surgery, to monitor for polyps and plan for eventual colectomy. Once a diagnosis of FAP is made, the focus shifts from surveillance to prophylactic surgery.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>D. Segmental resection:</strong> This involves removing only a segment of the colon. In FAP, polyps are typically pan-colonic (present throughout the entire colon), so a segmental resection would leave behind a significant amount of colon at high risk for developing cancer, necessitating further surgeries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Presence of multiple loops of bowel with plicae circularis on Abd X Ray:</strong> This statement is false. Plicae circularis (also known as valvulae conniventes) are characteristic folds found in the small intestine. In a large bowel obstruction, you would typically see dilated loops of large bowel, which possess haustra (sacculations) that do not extend across the entire lumen, differentiating them from the plicae circularis of the small bowel. Multiple dilated loops of bowel with plicae circularis on an X-ray are indicative of small bowel obstruction, not large bowel obstruction.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>B. Neoplasm is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction:</strong> This statement is true. Colorectal carcinoma is indeed the leading cause of large bowel obstruction, accounting for a significant majority of cases in adults.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>C. Upper limit of normal large bowel in X ray is 6 cm:</strong> This statement is generally true.

The &quot;steelpan sign&quot; on CT is highly suggestive of this diagnosis due to the characteristic arrangement of the dilated bowel loops.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Sigmoidoscopy (or flexible colonoscopy):</strong> In the absence of signs of peritonitis (which would indicate bowel ischemia or perforation and necessitate immediate surgery), endoscopic detorsion is the initial treatment of choice for sigmoid volvulus. A sigmoidoscope or colonoscope can be advanced into the twisted segment to untwist and decompress the colon, providing immediate relief and allowing for subsequent elective surgery to prevent recurrence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s look at why the other options are less appropriate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>A. CECT abdomen:</strong> A CT scan has already been performed, confirming the diagnosis and ruling out immediate signs of peritonitis. Another CECT is unlikely to provide significant new information that changes the immediate management plan.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>B. Ba enema:</strong> While a barium enema can diagnose a sigmoid volvulus (showing the &quot;bird&#39;s beak&quot; or &quot;ace of spades&quot; sign), it is less commonly used as an initial diagnostic tool compared to CT, and more importantly, it doesn&#39;t offer therapeutic potential for detorsion like endoscopy does. In cases of acute obstruction, there&#39;s also a theoretical risk of perforation, though generally considered safe for diagnosis.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>D. Exploratory laparotomy:</strong> While surgery is the definitive treatment to prevent recurrence, it is typically reserved for cases where endoscopic detorsion fails, there are signs of peritonitis (indicating perforation or ischemia), or for elective resection after successful detorsion. Performing an immediate exploratory laparotomy without attempting endoscopic detorsion, especially in a stable patient without peritonitis, is not the first-line approach for sigmoid volvulus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The symptoms and imaging findings strongly indicate an acute process that requires immediate surgical correction.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Ladd&#39;s Procedure:</strong> The definitive treatment for midgut volvulus associated with malrotation is an emergency laparotomy to perform a Ladd&#39;s procedure. This involves untwisting the bowel, widening the mesenteric base, and performing an appendectomy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s look at why the other options are inappropriate:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>A. Conservative management:</strong> This is absolutely contraindicated. Midgut volvulus is a surgical emergency; conservative management will lead to bowel necrosis and death.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>B. Endoscopic reduction of Volvulus:</strong> Endoscopic reduction is not feasible for midgut volvulus, which involves the small intestine and its mesentery. Endoscopic procedures are typically used for large bowel volvulus (like sigmoid volvulus) but not for this type of small bowel pathology.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>C. Colonoscopic reduction of Volvulus:</strong> Similar to endoscopic reduction, colonoscopy is not applicable here as the pathology is in the small bowel (midgut).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",
