      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HbF (Fetal Hemoglobin).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (OHDC) indicates an increased affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This means hemoglobin binds to oxygen more tightly, taking it up more readily in the lungs but releasing it less easily to the tissues. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inherently has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin (HbA). This is crucial for fetal development, as it allows the fetus to effectively extract oxygen from the maternal blood across the placenta. The primary reason for HbF&#39;s higher oxygen affinity is its reduced interaction with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). While 2,3-BPG binds to adult hemoglobin and decreases its oxygen affinity (causing a right shift), it binds less avidly to fetal hemoglobin. Consequently, HbF maintains a higher oxygen saturation at any given partial pressure of oxygen, resulting in a left-shifted OHDC relative to HbA.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discriminative touch</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meissner&#39;s corpuscles are specialized sensory receptors (mechanoreceptors) located in the dermal papillae of glabrous (hairless) skin, particularly abundant in areas highly sensitive to touch, such as the fingertips, palms, soles of the feet, and lips. They are rapidly adapting receptors, meaning they respond quickly to changes in stimuli, especially to initial contact and low-frequency vibrations (around 10-50 Hz). Their primary role is to detect light touch and discriminative touch. Discriminative touch refers to the ability to discern fine details about an object through touch, such as its texture (e.g., smooth vs. rough), shape, and the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced points (two-point discrimination). This makes them crucial for tasks like reading Braille or identifying objects by feel.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pituitary</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is a crucial membrane protein responsible for the active transport of iodide (I<sup>&minus;</sup>) into cells. While its most prominent role is in the thyroid gland for hormone synthesis, NIS is also expressed in several other tissues. The question asks to identify the tissue among the options where NIS is <em>not</em> characteristically present or functionally significant for iodide accumulation in the same way as it is in the other listed tissues. The pituitary gland is primarily involved in regulating thyroid function through hormones like Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), which stimulates NIS activity in the thyroid. However, the pituitary gland itself is not recognized as a primary site for concentrating iodide via its own NIS for a distinct physiological purpose comparable to the thyroid, salivary glands, or placenta.</p>\r\n",

This phase of atrial contribution to ventricular filling is also known as the &quot;atrial kick&quot; or the late rapid filling phase.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaporation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an environment where the outside temperature (45 degrees Celsius) is significantly higher than the body&#39;s core temperature (around 37 degrees Celsius), the body will tend to gain heat from the surroundings through radiation, conduction, and convection. During hiking, the student&#39;s metabolic heat production also increases significantly. To prevent overheating, the body must lose this excess heat. Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface is the primary and most effective mechanism for heat loss when the ambient temperature exceeds body temperature. As sweat (liquid) evaporates into water vapor (gas), it requires energy (latent heat of vaporization), which is drawn from the skin, thereby cooling the body. The low relative humidity (20%) in this scenario is highly favorable for efficient evaporation, allowing for substantial heat loss.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renal plasma flow</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renal clearance of a substance is the volume of plasma completely cleared of that substance by the kidneys per unit of time. If a substance is &quot;totally cleared&quot; from the plasma during a single pass through the kidneys, it means that all of the plasma flowing through the kidneys has that substance removed from it. This occurs through a combination of glomerular filtration and maximal tubular secretion, with no reabsorption. In such a scenario, the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely removed per unit time is equivalent to the total volume of plasma that flows through the kidneys per unit time. This total volume of plasma flowing through the kidneys is known as the renal plasma flow (RPF). Therefore, the maximum possible clearance rate for any substance is limited by, and equal to, the renal plasma flow. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) at low concentrations is an example of a substance that is nearly totally cleared and is used to measure effective RPF.</p>\r\n",

The change in the concentration of a substance in the tubular lumen depends on the relative rates of its reabsorption compared to water reabsorption. For chloride (Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>), its concentration typically increases along the length of the PCT. This is because in the early part of the PCT, sodium is preferentially reabsorbed with bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids. Water follows these osmotically active solutes. This reabsorption of water, along with other solutes, occurs to a slightly greater extent initially than the reabsorption of chloride. As a result, chloride becomes more concentrated in the remaining tubular fluid. Although chloride is subsequently reabsorbed in the later parts of the PCT (both passively down its electrochemical gradient and actively), the initial concentrating effect often leads to a net increase in its luminal concentration by the end of the PCT. The tubular fluid to plasma (TF/P) ratio for chloride rises above 1.0, indicating its concentration in the tubule is higher than in the plasma filtrate.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creatinine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decreases by 50% and remains at that level, substances that are primarily cleared by the kidneys through glomerular filtration (and to some extent tubular secretion, like creatinine) will accumulate in the plasma. Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism, and its production rate is relatively constant. Its clearance from the blood is highly dependent on GFR. If GFR is halved, the excretion of creatinine will initially decrease. To reach a new steady state where daily production equals daily excretion, the plasma creatinine concentration must rise, approximately doubling, so that the new lower GFR multiplied by the higher plasma creatinine results in the same amount of creatinine being filtered (and secreted) and ultimately excreted as before the GFR drop. Therefore, a 50% decrease in GFR will lead to roughly a 100% increase (doubling) in plasma creatinine concentration, which is a very substantial increase.</p>\r\n",

Carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity for hemoglobin (approximately 200-250 times greater) than oxygen. When CO is inhaled, it binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). This binding has two critical effects:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. It reduces the number of hemoglobin binding sites available for oxygen, directly leading to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2​​) because a significant fraction of hemoglobin is occupied by CO instead of O<sub>2</sub>​.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. The presence of COHb does not significantly alter the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma, so the PO<sub>2​​</sub> can remain normal, especially in the early stages or if the patient is breathing air with normal oxygen content. Furthermore, CO causes a leftward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, meaning that the hemoglobin that is bound to oxygen releases it less readily to the tissues, exacerbating tissue hypoxia. A garage mechanic is at high risk for CO exposure from vehicle exhaust, and a comatose state is a sign of severe poisoning.</p>\r\n",

Elevated plasma potassium is a direct and potent stimulus for the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete aldosterone. Aldosterone plays a crucial role in potassium homeostasis by acting on the principal cells in the late distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys. It increases the number and activity of potassium channels on the apical membrane and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps on the basolateral membrane, thereby promoting potassium secretion into the tubular lumen and its subsequent excretion in the urine. This increased secretion of aldosterone is a key adaptive mechanism to prevent dangerous levels of hyperkalemia when potassium intake is high.</p>\r\n",

Increased blood volume : This is a correct answer. When the total volume of blood in the circulatory system increases, there&#39;s more fluid to fill the available vascular space.

Think of it like adding more water to a balloon &ndash; the pressure inside increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Increased sympathetic discharge : This is also a correct answer. Increased sympathetic activity leads to venoconstriction (constriction of veins). Veins are the most compliant part of the vasculature and hold a large portion of the blood volume (unstressed volume). When veins constrict, their compliance decreases, and they become &quot;tighter.&quot; This effectively reduces the capacity of the system to hold blood without increasing pressure, or it &quot;squeezes&quot; the existing blood volume into a functionally smaller space, thereby increasing MSFP.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deep tendon reflex (also known as the stretch reflex or myotatic reflex) is initiated by the stretching of a muscle. This stretch is detected by muscle spindles, which are sensory receptors within the muscle. Ia sensory fibres originate from these muscle spindles and carry information about the rate and degree of muscle stretch to the spinal cord. These Ia afferents enter the spinal cord and form direct, monosynaptic excitatory connections with the alpha motor neurons that innervate the same (homonymous) muscle that was stretched. This direct synapse causes the stretched muscle to contract, counteracting the stretch.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under normal physiological conditions, when plasma glucose concentration is within the normal range (roughly 70-100 mg/dl, extending up to the renal threshold of about 180-200 mg/dl), virtually all the glucose that is filtered by the glomeruli is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule. This means that no glucose appears in the urine. Renal clearance is defined as the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance per unit time. If no glucose is excreted in the urine, its clearance is zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As plasma glucose concentration rises above the renal threshold, the transport mechanisms for glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule (primarily SGLT2 and SGLT1 co-transporters) become saturated. Beyond this point, any additional filtered glucose cannot be reabsorbed and is excreted in the urine. Therefore, as plasma glucose concentration increases further, the amount of glucose excreted increases, and consequently, the renal clearance of glucose also starts to increase from zero. Curve D illustrates this: clearance is zero at lower plasma glucose concentrations and then begins to rise as plasma concentration exceeds the transport maximum for reabsorption.</p>\r\n",

This movement disorder is classically associated with damage (often due to a stroke or hemorrhage) to the <strong>subthalamic nucleus</strong>. The subthalamic nucleus is a key component of the basal ganglia indirect pathway. Damage to this nucleus disrupts the normal inhibitory output of the basal ganglia, leading to a reduction in the inhibition of the thalamus. This disinhibition of the thalamus results in the excessive, involuntary, large-amplitude movements typical of ballismus.</p>\r\n",

It actively reabsorbs solutes, primarily sodium, potassium, and chloride (via the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter), but is relatively impermeable to water. This differential transport results in the removal of solutes from the tubular fluid without proportional water removal, thus making the tubular fluid hypotonic (lower osmolarity) compared to plasma by the time it leaves the TAL. This function persists even during dehydration, as the TAL&#39;s primary role in solute reabsorption and dilution is crucial for establishing the medullary osmotic gradient necessary for concentrating urine later if ADH is present.</p>\r\n",
