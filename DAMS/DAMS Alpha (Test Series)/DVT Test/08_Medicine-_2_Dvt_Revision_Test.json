      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a patient with mitral stenosis who develops an irregularly irregular pulse, the most likely rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF). AF significantly increases the risk of thromboembolism, particularly stroke, in patients with mitral stenosis. Even if no thrombus is seen on transesophageal echocardiography, the risk remains high due to blood stasis in the left atrium. Oral anticoagulants (such as warfarin) are the standard of care to prevent stroke in this setting, as they are more effective than antiplatelet agents like aspirin.</p>\r\n",

The prominent &#39;a&#39; wave occurs due to increased resistance to right atrial contraction against a stenotic tricuspid valve. The mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border further supports tricuspid valve involvement. These findings are not typical of mitral valve disease, which presents with murmurs best heard at the apex and does not cause prominent &#39;a&#39; waves.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: In obstructive shock (e.g., cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolism), the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is raised due to impaired venous return or outflow obstruction, but the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) remains low or normal because the left heart filling is reduced. This contrasts with cardiogenic shock, where both JVP and PCWP are elevated due to poor heart function. Hypovolemic shock has low JVP and low PCWP, while septic shock typically has normal or low JVP and variable PCWP.</p>\r\n",

For symptomatic patients (especially WHO functional class II&ndash;III), initial therapy depends on risk stratification. Ambrisentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, is an effective oral agent for improving exercise capacity and slowing disease progression in such patients. Epoprostenol and Iloprost are prostacyclin analogs used in more advanced cases (Class III&ndash;IV) or high-risk patients due to their complexity of administration. Thus, Ambrisentan is the preferred initial therapy here.</p>\r\n",

Chylothorax occurs due to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid (chyle) in the pleural space, often caused by thoracic duct injury or obstruction. This fluid is characteristically milky or white due to the high concentration of triglycerides and chylomicrons. In contrast, pseudochylothorax presents with a milky appearance but has low triglycerides and high cholesterol, while empyema contains pus and appears cloudy or purulent.

Squamous cell carcinoma often arises centrally (as shown by the hilar mass on chest X-ray) and is frequently linked with smoking. Small cell carcinoma can cause other paraneoplastic syndromes (like SIADH or Cushing&rsquo;s), while adenocarcinoma is usually peripheral and large cell carcinoma is less common with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia.</p>\r\n",

It is an aggressive tumor usually located centrally near the major bronchi but does not typically cause cavitation. Squamous cell carcinoma, which is also linked to smoking, is more common centrally and can cavitate, but it does not account for 70% of lung cancers worldwide. Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer overall and tends to be located peripherally rather than centrally.</p>\r\n",

The normal PaO2 (94 mmHg) suggests no significant lung pathology impairing oxygenation. The absence of cough, fever, chest pain, wheeze, or hemoptysis makes asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism less likely. Panic attacks commonly cause hyperventilation leading to respiratory alkalosis and shortness of breath without other respiratory symptoms.</p>\r\n",

Diarrhoea causes loss of bicarbonate-rich intestinal fluids, leading to metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap. In contrast, diabetic ketoacidosis, methanol poisoning, and acute renal failure cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of organic acids or toxins.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: Chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis occurs when the alkalosis can be corrected by administering chloride (usually as saline), and it is typically associated with volume depletion and low aldosterone levels. Causes like recurrent vomiting, NG aspiration, and excessive loop diuretic use lead to loss of chloride and volume depletion, making the alkalosis chloride-responsive. However, primary hyperaldosteronism causes metabolic alkalosis due to increased aldosterone leading to sodium retention and potassium/hydrogen ion loss, and it is <strong>chloride-resistant</strong>, meaning saline administration does not correct the alkalosis.</p>\r\n",
