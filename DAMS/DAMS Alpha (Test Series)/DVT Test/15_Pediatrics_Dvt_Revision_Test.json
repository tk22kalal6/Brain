Mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis, which is a narrowing of the mitral valve, is generally not considered a common or characteristic cardiac malformation seen in individuals with Turner Syndrome. While individuals with Turner Syndrome can have various cardiac issues, primary mitral stenosis is not typically listed among the frequently observed congenital heart defects in this population. Therefore, among the given options, mitral stenosis is the cardiac malformation least likely to be seen in a child with Turner Syndrome.</span></span></p>\r\n",

In Stage II HIE (moderate encephalopathy), infants typically present with lethargy or obtundation. A hallmark of this stage includes autonomic dysfunction characterized by bradycardia (slow heart rate) and constricted pupils (miosis). Seizures are also a common and significant finding in Stage II HIE, often appearing within the first 24 hours of life, as seen in this case where seizures occurred at 6 hours of age. The combination of seizures, constricted pupils, and bradycardia in a term neonate following a potentially traumatic delivery (forceps application) strongly points towards moderate HIE.</p>\r\n",

This means that all the oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the right side of the heart. For survival, there must be an intracardiac shunt (e.g., atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale) allowing this mixed blood to cross to the left side of the heart. As a result of this complete mixing of systemic venous (deoxygenated) and pulmonary venous (oxygenated) blood on the right side, and its subsequent distribution to both systemic and pulmonary circulations, the oxygen saturation becomes essentially uniform across all four cardiac chambers (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle) and great arteries, reflecting the degree of mixing.</span></span></p>\r\n",

The boot-shaped appearance on a chest X-ray in Tetralogy of Fallot is primarily due to the enlargement and thickening of the right ventricle, a condition known as right ventricular hypertrophy. In TOF, the presence of significant pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract) increases the resistance to blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. To overcome this increased resistance, the right ventricle works harder, leading to its muscle walls becoming thicker and larger. This hypertrophy causes the apex of the heart to be uplifted, and in conjunction with the concavity of the main pulmonary artery segment (due to hypoplasia or underdevelopment of the pulmonary artery), it creates the distinctive boot-like outline of the heart on the X-ray.</span></span></p>\r\n",

The image 11.png, showing &quot;Generalized Epileptiform Discharges - 3 Hz Spike and Wave Discharge,&quot; is the classic EEG pattern for absence seizures. Absence seizures are characterized by brief, sudden lapses in consciousness, often mistaken for daydreaming, which can significantly impact school performance.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">C. Valproate. Valproate (valproic acid) is a highly effective broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that is considered one of the first-line treatments for childhood absence epilepsy. It is particularly effective in controlling generalized spike-and-wave discharges seen on EEG, which are characteristic of absence seizures. Valproate works by increasing GABA levels and by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, among other mechanisms, to reduce neuronal excitability. Its efficacy in managing both the absence seizures and potentially improving school performance by reducing seizure burden makes it a strong choice</span></span>.</span></span></p>\r\n",
