      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pemphigus vulgaris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against desmoglein-3 (and often desmoglein-1), which are components of desmosomes responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion between keratinocytes. This disruption of adhesion, known as acantholysis, leads to the formation of intraepidermal blisters. Critically, in pemphigus vulgaris, these blisters are typically suprabasal, meaning the split occurs just above the basal cell layer of the epidermis. Clinically, this manifests as flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving painful, raw erosions that may then crust over. The description of &quot;raw skin lesions and flaccid blisters which crust on drying up&quot; along with the specific histological finding of a &quot;suprabasal blister&quot; is classic for pemphigus vulgaris. Mucous membrane involvement is also common but not explicitly mentioned in this brief description.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A kerion is a severe, inflammatory presentation of tinea capitis, which is a fungal infection of the scalp. The image shows a raised, boggy, erythematous, and crusted plaque on the scalp, which is characteristic of a kerion. The patient being a 10-year-old girl is within the typical age group for tinea capitis. Furthermore, the history of having a pet dog is highly significant, as zoophilic (animal-derived) fungi, such as <em>Microsporum canis</em> (commonly carried by dogs and cats), are frequent causes of tinea capitis and are particularly prone to inducing the intense inflammatory reaction that results in a kerion. This reaction is a delayed hypersensitivity response to the fungal antigens. The lesion is often tender, may have pustules, and can lead to scarring alopecia if not treated appropriately.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continue MDT with corticosteroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type 1 lepra reactions (reversal reactions) are delayed hypersensitivity reactions that occur in patients with borderline types of leprosy, often after starting Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT). These reactions are characterized by inflammation of existing skin lesions and, critically, nerves (neuritis). The presence of &quot;tender nerves&quot; in the patient indicates active neuritis, which is a medical emergency in leprosy as it can rapidly lead to permanent nerve damage and disability if not treated promptly and adequately. The cornerstone of management for Type 1 lepra reactions, especially those involving neuritis, is the administration of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) to suppress the inflammation and prevent further nerve injury. Crucially, the anti-leprosy treatment (MDT) must be continued uninterrupted during the reaction to continue addressing the underlying bacterial load.</p>\r\n",

Lymphangitis indicates a bacterial infection that is spreading along the lymphatic channels. The most common causative organisms for acute paronychia are bacteria, primarily <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>. <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> is particularly notorious for causing rapidly spreading infections like cellulitis and lymphangitis. Co-amoxiclav is a combination of amoxicillin (a beta-lactam antibiotic effective against streptococci) and clavulanic acid (a beta-lactamase inhibitor that extends amoxicillin&#39;s spectrum to cover many beta-lactamase producing strains of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>). Therefore, co-amoxiclav provides appropriate empirical coverage for the likely pathogens involved in paronychia with associated lymphangitis.</p>\r\n",

This condition is caused by the bacterium <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, a gram-negative diplococcus. Gonorrhea is the most common cause of purulent urethritis in sexually active individuals. It typically presents with symptoms such as dysuria (pain during urination) and profuse yellow or greenish discharge from the urethra, often within 2&ndash;7 days after exposure. This discharge is usually copious and thick, as seen in the image. The infection is acquired through unprotected sexual contact and can be diagnosed with gram stain, culture, or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT).

It has a broad spectrum of activity against the common fungi that cause nail infections, including dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds. Amorolfine works by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. As a nail lacquer, it is applied directly to the affected nail(s), typically once or twice a week, allowing the drug to penetrate the nail plate and reach the site of infection. It is often recommended for mild to moderate onychomycosis, particularly when only a few nails are affected or when oral antifungal therapy is contraindicated or not preferred.</p>\r\n",

The clinical presentation described&mdash;asymptomatic lesions on the face in sun-exposed areas&mdash;along with the features visible in the image, is highly characteristic of DLE. The image shows well-demarcated, discoid (coin-shaped) plaques. These lesions typically exhibit erythema (redness), adherent scaling, and follicular plugging (keratinous plugs in hair follicle openings). Crucially, as DLE lesions evolve and heal, they often result in central atrophy (thinning of the skin), scarring, and pigmentary changes (hypopigmentation as seen in the center of the lesion in the image, and sometimes hyperpigmentation, especially at the periphery). The location on the face, a sun-exposed site, further supports this diagnosis, as DLE is known to be photosensitive. The asymptomatic nature of the lesions is also consistent with DLE, although some patients may experience mild itching or tenderness.</p>\r\n",

The rapid increase in size and the invasion are critical features pointing towards this aggressive subtype.

These papules are often skin-colored, hypopigmented (whitish), or sometimes erythematous. Common locations include the flexor surfaces of the upper extremities, the trunk, dorsal aspects of the hands, and the genitalia, including the shaft of the penis. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, as described in the child, although mild pruritus can sometimes occur. The image provided, showing multiple small, discrete, whitish, slightly raised papules, along with the clinical information of asymptomatic lesions on the dorsal hand and shaft of the penis in a child, is highly characteristic of lichen nitidus.</p>\r\n",

The &quot;strawberry cervix&quot; (colpitis macularis), characterized by punctate hemorrhages on the cervical mucosa, is a highly specific sign of this infection, although not seen in all cases. Profuse, frothy, yellowish-green, and malodorous vaginal discharge, along with vulvovaginal itching and irritation, are common symptoms. Metronidazole is an antimicrobial agent with excellent activity against anaerobic protozoa like <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> and is the first-line drug of choice for treating this condition. It is typically given orally, and treatment of sexual partners is also recommended to prevent reinfection.</p>\r\n",

It commonly has an early age of onset, may spread rapidly within the affected segment for a period (typically 6 months to 2 years), and then often stabilizes. A key feature frequently associated with segmental vitiligo is leucotrichia, which is the depigmentation of hair within the vitiliginous patches, as mentioned in the clinical description. The image shows distinct white patches on the face and neck in a seemingly unilateral pattern, consistent with this diagnosis.</p>\r\n",

In adults, atopic dermatitis commonly affects these flexural areas (antecubital and popliteal fossae). The intense itching (pruritus) leads to chronic scratching, which over time can cause the skin to become thickened (lichenified), hyperpigmented (darker than the surrounding skin due to chronic inflammation), and can also lead to excoriations (breaks in the skin) with exudation (oozing or weeping), especially during acute flare-ups or if a secondary bacterial infection occurs. The image, showing the back of the knees with skin changes suggestive of chronic inflammation, thickening, and hyperpigmentation, strongly supports this diagnosis.</p>\r\n",

It is characterized by a clinical triad of tumefaction (swelling), the formation of multiple draining sinuses, and the presence of &quot;grains&quot; or granules (which are colonies of the causative microorganisms) in the discharge from these sinuses. The condition is typically acquired through traumatic inoculation of the causative agent (either fungi, leading to eumycetoma, or aerobic actinomycetes bacteria, leading to actinomycetoma) from contaminated soil or plant material. Farmers are at increased risk due to their occupation.
