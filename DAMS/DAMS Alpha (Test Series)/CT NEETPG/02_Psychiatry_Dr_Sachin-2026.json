The patient is no longer interested in work or going out with friends on weekends. He falls asleep relatively easily at night but awakes very early in the morning and is unable to fall back asleep. He admits to feeling “down in the dumps,” especially when he first wakes up but says that  his mood improves a little during the day. The patient often thinks  about ways that he could have spent more time with his brother. He feels guilty about his brother’s death being his fault “because I am worthless and could not love him enough.” His poor energy and concentration have started to affect his performance at work, and he frequently thinks that he should just quit “because I am bringing everyone down.” The patient has been eating less and has lost 3 kgs over the past few weeks.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Symptoms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>meet the diagnostic criteria of major depressive disorder in this given scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This patient meets diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode (depressed mood, loss of interest, early-morning awakening, weight loss, low energy, impaired concentration, feelings of worthlessness, and excessive guilt lasting at least 2 weeks). He has no prior psychiatric history and so would be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Although his symptoms developed in response to a stressor, they meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, thereby ruling out adjustment disorder and grief reaction.<br />\r\nThe death of a loved one is similar to any other serious stressor that can trigger a major depressive episode.&nbsp;<br />\r\n(Choice A) Adjustment disorders are characterized by increased anxiety, depression, or disturbed behaviour that develops in response to a stressor. Symptoms must develop within 3 months of an identifiable stressor and last no more than 6 months after the stressor ends. In adjustment disorder with depressed mood, the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met. By convention, if the patient&#39;s symptoms meet the full criteria for a major depressive episode, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is not applicable.<br />\r\nNot bereavement because symptoms are present for more than 2 months<br />\r\n(Choice D) Although this patient is grieving, his depression symptoms are more persistent and severe than those seen in a typical grief reaction. The dominant feelings in grief are loss and emptiness; in a major depressive episode, anhedonia and persistent epressed mood predominate. The sadness involved in grief will likely decrease in intensity over a period of weeks, with intermittent increases or &quot;waves&quot; following reminders of the deceased. In contrast, the sadness involved in a major depressive episode is more persistent and less specific. In grief, patients experience memories and thoughts of the deceased. A major depressive episode involves more negative and self-critical ruminations, with feelings of worthlessness and self -loathing.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/8(447).png\" style=\"height:253px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

The primary sign that a child is still in the preoperational stage is that he or she has not achieved the concept of conservation or reversibility. Conservation is the ability to recognize that objects possess different compatible properties and the alteration of one property (e.g. height) does not necessarily alter other properties (e.g. volume). Conservation occurs in various dimensions &ndash; conservation of volume, quantity, number, area, and weight.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Piaget&rsquo;s stages of cognitive development include sensorimotor stage, which begins at birth and lasts up to 2 years.

Social interactions show the expected reciprocal quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 6 months to 2 years of age, however, these children develop progressive encephalopathy with a number of characteristic features.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe signs often include the loss of purposeful hand movements, which are replaced by stereotypic motions, such as hand-wringing; the loss of previously acquired speech; psychomotor retardation; and ataxia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other stereotypical hand movements may occur, such as licking or biting the fingers and tapping or slapping. The head circumference growth decelerates and produces microcephaly. All language skills are lost, and both receptive and expressive communicative and social skills seem to plateau at developmental levels between 6 months and 1 year. Poor muscle coordination and an apraxic gait with an unsteady and stiff quality develop. All of these clinical features are diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Associated features include seizures in up to 75 percent of affected children and disorganized EEGs with some epileptiform discharges in almost all young children with Rett&#39;s disorder, even in the absence of clinical seizures. An additional associated feature is irregular respiration, with episodes of hyperventilation, apnea, and breath holding. The disorganized breathing occurs in most patients while they are awake; during sleep, the breathing usually normalizes. Many patients with Rett&#39;s disorder also have scoliosis. As the disorder progresses, muscle tone seems to change from an initial hypotonic condition to spasticity to rigidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/13(267).png\" style=\"height:236px; width:350px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acute infection (Ref : Kaplan)<br />\r\n&ldquo;Alcohol withdrawal delirium is a medical emergency that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. &nbsp;Untreated, DTs has a mortality rate of 20 percent, usually as a result of an intercurrent medical illness such as pneumonia, renal disease, hepatic insufficiency, or heart failure. The essential feature of the syndrome is delirium occurring within 1 week after a person stops drinking or reduces the intake of alcohol. In addition to the symptoms of delirium, the features of alcohol intoxication delirium include autonomic hyperactivity such as tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever, anxiety, insomnia, and hypertension; perceptual distortions, most frequently visual or tactile hallucinations; and fluctuating levels of psychomotor activity, ranging from hyperexcitability to lethargy. About 5 percent of persons with alcohol-related disorders who are hospitalized have DTs. Because the syndrome usually develops on the third hospital day, a patient admitted for an unrelated condition may unexpectedly have an episode of delirium, the first sign of a previously undiagnosed alcohol-related disorder. Episodes of DTs usually begin in a patient&rsquo;s 30s or 40s after 5 to 15 years of heavy drinking, typically of the binge type. Physical illness (e.g., hepatitis or pancreatitis) predisposes to the syndrome; a person in good physical health rarely has DTs during alcohol withdrawal.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
