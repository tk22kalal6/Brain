      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nUncal herniation\r\nThis patient presented with a moderate brain injury. Up to 20% of such patients can be expected to deteriorate or become comatose. The first thing to consider is an expansion of an intracranial haemorrhage with subsequent raised ICP. The Monro–Kellie concept is useful in explaining why intracranial bleeding may initially be compensated for but, once the threshold for compensation is exceeded, eventually results in rapid decompensation unless intervention supervenes. The cranial vault has a fixed volume; bleeding within the skull has a mass effect and therefore some of the existing volume must be sacrificed. This is initially possible since venous volume and CSF volume can be lost, hence the initial period of compensation. However, once haematoma volume exceeds approxi- mately 150 mL, the ability for the venous and CSF compartments to com- pensate is overwhelmed and ICP rises exponentially with further added volume. With increased ICP, arterial flow is compromised and brain mat- ter is under pressure, leading to herniation.\r\nMost commonly, the result is uncal herniation; the uncus is the medial part of the temporal lobe, which may be pushed against the edge of the tentorial notch. This puts pressure on the III cranial nerve, which runs along the edge of the tentorial notch, resulting first in loss of parasympa- thetic supply, then complete oculomotor palsy. The motor tracts are also vulnerable, positioned superficially at that level of the midbrain. Therefore the typical signs of uncal herniation include ipsilateral parasympathetic ± motor oculomotor nerve palsy with motor weakness. Confusion can arise when considering the motor signs of uncal herniation; hemipare- sis can be contralateral or ipsilateral (Kernohan’s phenomenon) to the lesion depending on the severity of herniation. Therefore, all head injury patients with altered consciousness, third nerve and motor signs should be referred for immediate emergency neurosurgical consultation.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nJackson’s classification of zones of injury in 1953 referred to the varying depth of injury radiating outward from a burn wound and defined the pathophysiology of cutaneous thermal injury. The central zone of coagulation is necrotic and irreversibly damaged; it represents a full-thickness injury that will require excision and grafting. The zone of stasis refers to the immediately surrounding region and is characterized by constricted vessels and hypoxia. Initially viable, this tissue may convert to coagulation or a full-thickness injury as a result of edema, infection, or shock with decreased perfusion. The zone of stasis may remain viable if adequately perfused. In a patient with a large-TBSA burn, the viability of this zone may be critical in providing donor sites and reducing the total area that requires grafting. The zone of hyperemia surrounding this is characterized by vasodilation as a result of inflammatory mediators and is viable.\r\n",

Hereditary Pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant gene mutation with 80 percent penetrance. Symptoms start in childhood with acute recurrent pancreatitis and progress to chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and exocrine insufficiency.  The incidence of pancreatic cancer is increased to 40 percent by age 70.  BRCA1 mutations have been associated with familial pancreas cancer families. SPINK mutations have been associated with chronic tropical pancreatitis. Delta F508 is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis that leads to pancreas insufficiency in childhood.

Patients with a diffusely dilated duct (as above), are the best candidates for a drainage procedure,  such as the lateral pancreaticojejunostomy.   A randomized controlled trial compared lateral pancreatico-jejunostomy to ERCP with pancreatic stenting (+/- lithotripsy), and found that surgical treatment led to improved pain control at 24 months follow-up. Patients with focal ductal disease and pain can be managed by surgical resection of the diseased ductal segment.  (Whipple,  distal pancreatectomy).

When skin is lost due to burns or other causes, fibrotic scarring occurs. When such injuries are circumferential, as in this case, healing can constrict underlying tissues, blood vessels and nerves. Limbs are vulnerable, as is the neck and even the chest, where extensive injury can restrict chest expansion and impair breathing.\r\nThe patient in this case is clearly exhibiting the signs of muscle com- partment compromise secondary to restricted blood supply. There is concomitant paraesthesia, which may be as a result of ischaemia or a direct result of nerve compression. Fluid resuscitation is not required and although an electrolyte imbalance should be ruled out it is unlikely to be causative. Angiography is not indicated. This patient requires urgent escharotomy (incision of scar tissue to release constricting pres- sure). Fasciotomy is rarely required in such cases, but may be indicated if vascular supply remains compromised for a prolonged period and true compartment syndrome develops.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nHigh-energy rapid deceleration chest trauma is most commonly caused by a fall from greater than two stories or from a motor vehicle accident (e.g., steering wheel strik- ing the chest). This mechanism of injury is known to cause aortic injuries which may lead to aortic transection and ultimately death. Autopsy studies of aviation accidents demonstrate that more than 30% of deaths are due to aortic transection. Overall, immediate mortality is greater than 70%. The majority of patients die instantly of exsanguination. Of those who survive, 50% will die within 24 h. Patients will present with a widened mediastinum, deviation of the trachea to the right, and left-sided hemothorax on chest radiographs. They may also have fractures of bones (e.g., first rib, sternum, scapula) that are uncommonly broken as high energy is required to break them. The aortic tear is usually at the ligamentum arteriosum, located just dis- tal to the left subclavian take off, as the aortic arch is relatively fixed to that point. CT angiogram can confirm the diagnosis, and definitive management includes operative repair. Although a ruptured spleen can lead to significant blood loss, instant death is highly unlikely (D). The remaining choices can all cause instant death, but they occur in less frequency than thoracic aortic transection with this mechanism of injury (B) Abdominal aortic transection is extremely rare following blunt trauma as it is more mobile than the thoracic aorta (C).\r\n",

In patients with polyps that are greater than or equal to 10 mm,  cholecystectomy is recommended.  If the polyp is smaller than 10 mm and the patient is felt to have symptoms attributable to the polyp,  cholecystectomy is suggested.  If polyps are smaller than 10 mm without symptoms, ultrasound surveillance is recommended.   In this patient, the polyp is larger than 10 mm and he should undergo a cholecystectomy.

The therapeutic approach should start with an endoscopy; however, this is only successful approximately nine percent of the time. Surgery is often required for definitive management and it is reasonable to have them involved upfront given the low success rate endoscopically. It should be noted that surgical intervention carries an approximately 12 percent mortality rate, likely due to the advanced age and the medical comorbidities of these patients.  In this scenario, the stone has eroded into the duodenal bulb and neither EUS or ERCP will be of benefit. NG tube placement will allow for decompression of the stomach, but it will not resolve the obstruction. Percutaneous drain placement would not be of benefit in this scenario.\r\n",

The diagnosis of Caroli’s syndrome is established by imaging studies.   This patient’s cholangiogram illustrates characteristic features of Caroli’s syndrome including diffuse dilation of the biliary tree with extensive fusiform and saccular dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts.  Other characteristic radiographic features (indicated by arrowheads on CT scan) include the “central dot sign” where intraluminal portal vein radicals appear as foci of contrast enhancement within the dilated bile ducts.  Biliary cysts in Caroli’s syndrome are irregularly shaped and communicate with the bile ducts.  In contrast, cysts in polycystic liver disease are more regularly shaped and do not communicate with bile ducts.  Renal manifestations occur in up to 60 percent of patients with Caroli’s syndrome and include medullary sponge kidney, cortical cysts, autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease, or very rarely, autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.  Patients with Caroli’s syndrome are at increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma which is thought to be due to bile stasis and high concentrations of unconjugated secondary bile salts.\r\n",

Surgical resection should be considered in patients with a single mass (usually less than f ive centimeters) in the setting of good liver function and absence of clinically significant portal hypertension.

It is usually meshed to allow drainage of fluid and applied in a similar fashion to other skin grafts. Allograft will vascularize and engraft, provide wound closure for 2 to 4 weeks, and subsequently be rejected and need tobe replaced with new allograft or autograft if available. Sheets ofallograft may be placed over widely meshed autograft at the timeof surgery to protect grafts as the interstices epithelialize. Porcine  xenograft is cheaper and more easily stored before use, but it doesnot vascularize and engraft. It may be used similar to allograft for temporary biologic coverage of burn wounds, as well as for exfoliative diseases of the skin (e.g., TEN).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nComments The rich anastomotic networks of the blood vessels in the head and neck allow the preservation of blood flow even when some of the blood vessels are compromised.\r\nWhen an external jugular vein is ligated, venous return is redirected towards the contralateral vessel, as well as to the ipsilateral internal jugular. Ligation of the external carotid artery is compensated through multiple collaterals to the contra- lateral external carotid, as well as with the internal carotid artery, through the angular artery.\r\nThe internal jugular vein may be ligated unilaterally without a negative impact on intracranial pressure. However, acute simultaneous bilateral ligation results in engorgement of the intracranial venous system, compromising cerebral blood flow. It has been shown in experimental models that preservation of the external jugular veins ameliorates the increase in intracra- nial pressures \r\nThe internal carotid artery behaves as an end artery, although blood flow to the ipsilateral brain can be partially restored through the circle of Willis. Its ligation is associated with a stroke rate of 20 % and a mortality rate as high as 25 %, which makes this maneuver extremely risky.\r\nAlthough it would seem that ligation of the common carotid artery would result in reconstitution of flow to the internal carotid through the contralateral anastomoses of the external carotid artery, this is unfortunately not the case. What occurs is that flow to the internal carotid on the ligated side is restituted by the circle of Willis. Blood is then diverted from the internal carotid to the external carotid, further compromising brain perfusion in a manner analogous to the subclavian steal syndrome\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nRATIONALE This presentation is concerning for metastatic hepatic angiosarcoma, especially in light of the reported history of a coworker (in this case his brother) who died of a rare liver tumor.  Hepatic angiosarcomas are related to occupational exposure to vinyl chloride, an agent used in chemical manufacturing. It can be misdiagnosed on imaging as cavernous hepatic hemangiomas, but a hemangioma would not be expected to be associated with abnormalities in LFTs, ascites, or splenic nodules. The risk of intraperitoneal bleeding is estimated to be roughly 25 percent and can complicate attempts at needle biopsy. Suggested treatment for hepatic angiosarcoma involves local excision and transarterial embolization, particularly in the case of intraperitoneal bleeding. Some argue that hepatic angiosarcoma is a contraindication to liver transplantation given poor outcomes, and this patient would not be a candidate for liver transplantation given likely metastasis to spleen. Hereditary hepatic hemangioma syndrome is not a real clinical entity.\r\n",

The blunt force typically also produces an underlying pulmonary contusion. To confirm the diagnosis the chest wall can be observed for paradoxical motion of a chest wall segment. On inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall is displaced inwards and therefore less air moves into the lungs. On expiration, the segment moves outwards (paradoxical respiration). Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) and physiotherapy. If a chest tube is in situ, topical intrapleural local analgesia introduced via the tube, can also be used.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nComments The caudate lobe of the liver is unique in that it receives branches from both the right and left portal triads and drains directly into the inferior vena cava. It lies anterior to the cava. The caudate process of the caudate lobe, connecting segments I to VII, may encircle the vena cava to varying degrees.\r\nThe venous drainage of caudate lobe of the liver is not affected by thrombosis of the hepatic veins in Budd–Chiari syn- drome (hepatic vein thrombosis). Given that this lobe drains directly into the vena cava, its venous outflow is preserved. In fact, this lobe is noticeably enlarged, as it comes to replace the function of the remaining liver tissue.\r\nResection of the caudate lobe is practiced with increasing frequency and safety. It is commonly incorporated in right hepa- tectomies.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nTwo wide-bore cannulae inserted bilaterally to the antecubital fossae Optimal fluid volume delivery is through large-bore access achieved with cannulae inserted into the antecubital fossae. Central lines (answers A and C) are generally long conduits with narrow lumens and are therefore less effective at delivering large volumes to hypotensive trauma patients. The same is true of long lines inserted through a femoral approach. It may be necessary to perform a long saphenous venous cut-down, but this approach should be reserved for patients where attempts to obtain standard peripheral venous access have failed.\r\n",
