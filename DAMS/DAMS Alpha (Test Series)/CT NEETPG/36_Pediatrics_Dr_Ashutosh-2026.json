      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n3:1\r\n\r\nExplanation: For neonates requiring chest compressions, the recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio is 3:1. This means three chest compressions followed by one ventilation every 2 seconds. This ratio is adjusted from the typical adult 30:2 ratio to account for the physiological needs of neonates. A proper balance of compressions and ventilations helps improve circulation and oxygenation.",

Favorable histology (triphasic pattern without anaplasia) has an excellent prognosis, while unfavorable histology (anaplastic features with large pleomorphic nuclei and atypical mitoses) is associated with poorer outcomes. Although patient age, tumor size, and LDH levels may influence prognosis, they are not as significant as histology",
