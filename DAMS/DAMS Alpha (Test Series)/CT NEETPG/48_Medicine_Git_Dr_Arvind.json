Current guidelines suggest review at day 3 and then day 5 for clinical and biochemical response. If non-response, rescue medical therapies with anti-TNF biological therapy or cyclosporin can be considered. Alternatively, non-response to intravenous (IV) steroid therapy and rescue medical therapies require a surgical review for consideration of subtotal colectomy and ileostomy. There is no evidence for antibiotic therapy.
