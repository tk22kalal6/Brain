      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDieulafoy lesions are large submucosal abnormality that bleeds spontaneously in brisk and episodic manner. At endoscopy no distinct mucosal abnormality is noted inbetween the bleeding episodes. There is no risk of malignancy, no melanin deposition at lips (seen in Peutz jaghers). Submucosal masses with punctuate hemorrhage is a feature GIST. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nDieulafoy&#39;s lesions are vascular malformations found primarily along the lesser curve of the stomach within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, although they can occur elsewhere in the GI tract. They represent rupture of unusually large vessels (1-3 mm) that are found in the gastric submucosa. Erosion of the gastric mucosa overlying these vessels leads to hemorrhage. The mucosal defect is usually small (2-5 mm) and may be difficult to identify. Given the large size of the underlying artery, bleeding from a Dieulafoy&#39;s lesion can be massive.<br />\r\nInitial attempts at endoscopic control are often successful. Application of thermal or sclerosant therapy is effective in 80% to 100% of cases. In cases that fail endoscopic therapy, angiographic coil embolization can be successful. If these approaches fail, surgical intervention may be necessary and bleeder can be oversewn. In cases in which the bleeding point is not identified, a partial gastrectomy may be necessary.</p>\r\n",

Gastrointestinal carcinoids are distributed via embryologic origins: foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Foregut carcinoids account for approximately 7% of all carcinoids, whereas midgut and hindgut carcinoids represent 62% and 30% of all carcinoids, respectively. Because of the preponderance of APUD cells within the ileum and appendix, the most common sites are ileum, rectosigmoid and appendix.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carcinoid tumors have five histologic patterns: insular, trabecular, glandular, undifferentiated, and mixed<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Urinary tumour marker is 5HIAA<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Serum tumour marker is Chromogranin A<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Best investigation for localization id SRS. In SRS negative patients MIBG scan should be done<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment.<br />\r\nCarcinoid tumours occur most often in the ileum, rectum and appendix, and are usually chance findings at appendicectomy. The tumour arise from the argentaffin of Kulchitzky cells which lie deep in the crypts of Lieberk&uuml;hn and are derived from neural crest tissue. Like other APUD tumours, carcinoids contain numerous neurosecretory granules.&nbsp;<br />\r\nLarge tumours may cause obstruction or intussusception, but symptoms are otherwise rare unless metastases to the liver are responsible for the carcinoid syndrome (seen only in 1% of cases). This syndrome is due to the excessive production of a variety of gut hormones - particularly 5-hydroxytryptamine, but also histamine, kinins, catecholamines, and prostaglandins.&nbsp;<br />\r\nTypically, patients present with episodic facial flushing, watery diarrhoea, and abdominal cramps (due to serotonin), and may have pellagra-like skin lesions as a result of niacin deficiency. Involvement of the right side of the heart is also well recognized (TR&gt; TS&gt; PS), and there may be bronchial lesions. Auscultation may indicate pulmonary and/or tricuspid valve lesions.&nbsp;<br />\r\nMacroscopically, the primary tumours are generally small and extra-appendiceal; and the liver may be almost completely replaced by metastases. Intestinal biopsy shows solid groups of regular polyhedral cells spreading through the submucosa and muscle; the specific neuroendocrine characteristics may be determined from immunocytochemical stains.<br />\r\nSurgical resection is the standard curative modality. If the primary tumor is localized and resectable, 5-year survival rates are excellent (70%-90%). Liver secondaries should be excised because it may cure or at least alleviate carcinoid syndrome features. &nbsp;Chemotherapy response is partial. Radiation therapy has a minor role in patients with regionally unresectable disease and may palliate the pain of bone metastasis. Patients with carcinoid syndrome can usually be effectively palliated by injections of somatostatin analogue octreotide.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here the diagnosis is sigmoid volvulus. Initial treatment for sigmoid volvulus is sigmoidoscopy to derotate the volvulus.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe sigmoid colon is the most common site of volvulus in the gastrointestinal tract. The condition involves the sigmoid colon twisting around its mesenteric axis causing obstruction. The condition tends to occur in the elderly.&nbsp;<br />\r\nPlain X-Ray films show a inverted-U, sausage-like shape of air-filled sigmoid pointing to the right upper quadrant (inner bent tube). If gangrene is not suspected, water-soluble contrast enema usually shows a bird&#39;s-beak deformity at the obstructed rectosigmoid junction.<br />\r\nIn the absence of peritoneal signs, treatment involves rigid sigmoidoscopy (MCQ), with the placement of a rectal tube beyond the point of obstruction (recurrence rate after decompressive approaches is 40%); therefore, elective sigmoid colectomy should be performed.<br />\r\nIf gangrene and peritonitis is present, the patient should undergo laparotomy and Hartmann procedure (sigmoid colectomy, end-descending colostomy, and defunctionalized rectal pouch). Or rarely in the stable patient without significant fecal soilage of the peritoneal cavity is &ldquo;sigmoidectomy, on-table colonic lavage, and colorectal anastomosis with or without proximal fecal diversion (loop ileostomy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/2(905).jpg\" style=\"height:158px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)<br />\r\n(Done for Meconium Ileus)<br />\r\nMeconium Ileus<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meconium Ileus (MI) is the earliest clinical manifestation of Cystic fibrosis (seen in 10-15% of CF2).<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meconium is viscid having high protein and low carbohydrate content causing antenatal or post natal obstruction.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most common presentation is abdominal distension with or without bilious vomiting and a failure or delay in passing meconium after birth.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Occasionally it is diagnosed prenatally on ultrasound scans.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Complicated MI includes those with volvulus, atresia, perforation or giant cystic peritonitis. Abdominal x-ray is likely to show several loops of dilated small bowel without air-fluid levels; and possibly a soap bubble appearance in the right lower quadrant, the so-called Neuhauser sign. Perforation or giant cystic meconium peritonitis calcifications are often noted. Most babies then undergo barium enema to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the publication of Noblett&#39;s report on the use of gastrograffin enemas (GGE) in the treatment of simple MI, non-operative management has become increasingly important. All neonates with complicated and those with 2 unsuccessful GGE require operative intervention.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The surgical management options of MI are varied and include :&nbsp;<br />\r\n1) Enterotomy/appendicectomy with irrigation&nbsp;<br />\r\n2) Enterostomy with/out resection<br />\r\n3) Resection with primary anastomosis<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Treatment of choice is Bishop-Koop (End-to-distal side ileal anastomosis with a distal end ileostomy which allows post-operative irrigation of the meconium pellets)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/17(335).jpg\" style=\"height:263px; width:350px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
