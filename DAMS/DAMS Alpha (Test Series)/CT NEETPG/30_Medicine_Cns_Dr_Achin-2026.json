Despite its good seizure control, it’s generally avoided unless no other AED works.\r\n\r\nClinical Pearl:\r\n\r\nValproate is highly teratogenic—avoid in women of reproductive age if alternatives exist.",

Though respiratory depression is a risk, benefits outweigh it in SE; careful monitoring is used instead of withholding treatment.\r\n\r\n•  Option C: Super-refractory status epilepticus is defined as SE that persists ≥48 hours after anesthetic therapy, not just after benzodiazepines and second-line agents. The scenario described is refractory SE.\r\n\r\n• Option D: In convulsive status epilepticus, the visible seizure may stop, but ongoing electrical seizure activity (non-convulsive SE) can persist — especially in ICU/sedated patients. Continuous EEG monitoring is essential to detect and manage it.\r\n\r\nClinical Pearl:\r\n\r\nAfter convulsive SE resolves clinically, do not assume seizure termination — EEG often reveals silent NCSE, especially in comatose or ICU patients.",

Hence, gait worsens in the dark or with eyes closed (positive Romberg sign), and improves with visual input.\r\n\r\n•  Option C: Spastic hemiparetic gait (classically post-stroke) shows leg circumduction, stiff extended limb, and flexed upper limb posture.\r\n\r\n• Option D (Incorrect): Cerebellar ataxic gait is wide-based, irregular, and unsteady due to poor coordination.

It typically occurs when the affected limb is at rest, diminishes or disappears with voluntary movement, and may re-emerge when posture is maintained (re-emergent tremor).\r\n\r\n•  Option B: Postural instability is a late feature of Parkinson’s disease. Bradykinesia (slowness of movement initiation and execution) is an early and essential diagnostic criterion.\r\n\r\n•  Option C: Parkinsonian rigidity is not velocity-dependent (unlike spasticity) and is described as “lead-pipe” rigidity, sometimes with a “cogwheel” component due to superimposed tremor. Clasp-knife rigidity is seen in upper motor neuron lesions, not Parkinsonism.\r\n\r\n•  Option D: Bradykinesia is not limited to walking. It includes slowness, decrement in amplitude, and reduced spontaneous movements (like facial expression, blinking, handwriting—micrographia).\r\n\r\nGolden Pearl:\r\n\r\n•  Rest tremor + rigidity (lead-pipe/cogwheel) + bradykinesia = Parkinsonism triad\r\n\r\n•   Postural instability is a red flag if it appears early → consider atypical Parkinsonism",

Kayser-Fleischer rings, low ceruloplasmin levels, and copper accumulation are classic.\r\n\r\n• Option B (Incorrect): Levodopa does not cause Parkinsonism. It is the mainstay of Parkinson’s disease treatment.

Nimodipine (oral CCB) is proven to reduce the risk of poor neurologic outcome, though it does not directly relieve vasospasm.\r\n\r\n•  Option D: Seizures may occur early, especially at ictus or post-surgery, but are less common than ischemic complications.\r\n\r\nGolden Pearl:\r\n\r\n Day 4–10 post-SAH?

This is a classic sign of opioid toxicity.\r\n\r\n d) Pontine lesion\r\n\r\n• Pontine strokes can cause pinpoint pupils due to disruption of descending sympathetic pathways → bilateral miosis.\r\n\r\n• Dilated pupils are not typical of pontine lesions.\r\n\r\nClinical Pearl:\r\n\r\nDilated pupil = Think parasympathetic loss (midbrain/3rd nerve lesion)\r\n\r\nConstricted pupil = Think sympathetic loss (Horner’s), or opioid effect, or pontine lesion",

Strongly associated with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) in older smokers.\r\n\r\n•  Option B: This is characteristic of myasthenia gravis, with fatigable weakness, preserved reflexes, and anti-AChR antibodies. Reflexes do not improve with activity in MG.\r\n\r\n•  Option C: Also describes myasthenia gravis, specifically ocular MG, where ptosis and diplopia worsen with fatigue. Reflexes remain normal.\r\n\r\n•  Option D: Describes botulism, which presents with descending paralysis, pupillary involvement, and autonomic dysfunction. Reflexes may be reduced, but sensory function remains intact. Botulism is toxin-mediated, not autoimmune.\r\n\r\nClinical Pearl:\r\n\r\nLEMS = Leg weakness + areflexia + improvement with exercise + autonomic symptoms\r\nThink paraneoplastic → always rule out SCLC.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nEarly impairment of pin-prick and vibration sensation is typical in ALS\r\n\r\nExplanation of Options:\r\n\r\n•  Option A: Correct. ALS is defined by the coexistence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in multiple regions (bulbar, cervical, thoracic, lumbosacral). This patient's spastic legs (UMN) and wasted arms with fasciculations (LMN) fulfill this pattern.\r\n\r\n•  Option B: Correct. A brisk jaw jerk indicates upper motor neuron involvement of the corticobulbar tract, often seen in pseudobulbar palsy, which may accompany ALS.\r\n\r\n•  Option C (Incorrect): ALS is a pure motor neuron disease. Sensory pathways, bowel, and bladder function are typically preserved, especially early. Presence of early sensory loss or autonomic dysfunction suggests an ALS mimic (e.g., cervical myelopathy, MS, syringomyelia).\r\n\r\n•  Option D: Correct. Riluzole reduces presynaptic glutamate release and has been shown to modestly extend survival in ALS.

Dystrophin gene mutations are X-linked and affect skeletal muscle integrity.\r\n\r\n•  Option B: The corticospinal tract is involved in upper motor neuron lesions. SMA is a lower motor neuron disease, affecting anterior horn cells, leading to flaccid weakness and hypotonia.\r\n\r\n•  Option C (Correct): SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q. This gene is critical for survival of motor neurons. The disease leads to degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n• Option D: SMA does not cause sensory loss, and reflexes are diminished or absent (due to LMN involvement).

The correct next step is MRI with contrast to look for characteristic white matter lesions and a CSF PCR for JC virus via lumbar puncture. This helps differentiate between an MS relapse and PML.\r\n\r\n•  Option C: Empiric steroids for presumed MS relapse without excluding PML is dangerous, as it may worsen PML by further suppressing immunity.\r\n\r\n•  Option D: Drug switch may be necessary later but should not be the immediate step. Diagnosis of natalizumab failure vs PML must first be established.\r\n\r\nClinical Pearl:\r\n\r\nIn an MS patient on natalizumab with new neurologic symptoms, always rule out PML with MRI + CSF JC virus PCR before assuming relapse or progression.",

Albendazole is NOT contraindicated in all forms. In fact, albendazole is indicated in viable (colloidal vesicular stage) or single enhancing parenchymal NCC, especially when no signs of raised ICP are present. It is contraindicated in cases of multiple active cysts with increased ICP, subarachnoid NCC, or ventricular cysts without CSF diversion.\r\n\r\n•  Option B: Correct. Seizures are the most common presentation, especially with parenchymal lesions in viable or degenerating stages.\r\n\r\n•  Option C: Correct. The “hole-with-dot” sign seen on MRI or CT is pathognomonic of NCC, with the dot representing the scolex of the larva.\r\n\r\n•  Option D: Correct. The colloidal vesicular stage is marked by ring enhancement, edema, and inflammation, corresponding to host immune response against the degenerating cyst.\r\n\r\n Clinical Pearl:\r\n\r\nSingle ring-enhancing lesion + seizure in endemic areas = Think NCC\r\nAlbendazole + steroids is often used unless raised ICP or multiple lesions contraindicate it.",
