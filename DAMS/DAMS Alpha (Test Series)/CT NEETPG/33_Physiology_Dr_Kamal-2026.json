This is followed by repolarization which is due to opening of voltage gated potassium channels.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>stroke volume<br />\r\nDuring exercise, sympathetic stimulation of the heart increases the contractility and thus, the stroke volume. A decrease in venous compliance, caused by sympathetic stimulation, increases the venous return to the heart, which also increases stroke volume by a Frank- Starling mechanism. The increased stroke volume, coupled with an increase in heart rate, causes an increase in cardiac output. Systemic arterial pressure also increases in response to the increase in cardiac output. Exercise causes release of local metabolites in muscles which leads to local vasodilation. This in turn decreases the total peripheral resistance resulting in a decrease in DBP. The pulmonary blood vessels also undergo a passive dilatation as more blood flows into the pulmonary circulation. As a result, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased venous compliance<br />\r\nMean systemic filling pressure or Psf is the pressure measured everywhere in the systemic circulation after blood flow has been stopped by clamping the great vessels. Without blood flow pressures everywhere in the systemic circulation become equal and this equilibrated pressure level is the mean systemic filling pressure. Normal Psf is 7 mm Hg. Psf is the major pressure affecting venous return. The two main determinants of Psf are (i) blood volume, and (ii) sympathetic stimulation.&nbsp;<br />\r\nMean systemic filling pressure will increase with increase in blood volume. Increased sympathetic discharge will cause a decrease in venous compliance and increase the mean systemic filling pressure increasing the venous return. Therefore, a decreased and not an increased venous compliance will increase the mean systemic filling pressure. Parasympathetic stimulation has no effect on mean systemic filling pressure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

FEV1/ FVC ratio will also be decreased in old age. However, marked reduction such as seen in the figure points towards emphysema. In restrictive lung disease, FEV1/FVC ratios is normal to increased.
