      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nRepeat Usg after 2-3 weeks\r\nFor a premenopausal woman, ovarian cysts are frequently physiological or functional (e.g., follicular cysts, corpus luteum cysts) and are a normal part of the menstrual cycle. These cysts often develop and then resolve spontaneously within one to two menstrual cycles. A 5cm cyst is within the size range that can represent a functional cyst. Since the examination was performed only two weeks after her LMP, it is highly likely that this cyst is physiological. Repeating the ultrasound in 2-3 weeks allows sufficient time for a functional cyst to regress naturally. If the cyst persists or grows, further investigation would then be warranted. This approach avoids unnecessary invasive procedures and investigations for what is likely a benign, self-resolving condition.\r\n",

If the IUD threads are visible, allowing for relatively easy removal, removing the IUD is the recommended course of action. This removal, especially if performed early in the pregnancy, substantially reduces these risks and improves the chances of a successful pregnancy outcome. The goal is to remove the potential source of irritation and infection while allowing the pregnancy to proceed.\r\n",

This involves external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivered concomitantly with chemotherapy, typically a platinum-based agent like cisplatin.

This leads to thinning, drying, and inflammation of the vaginal walls, resulting in symptoms like dryness, itching, irritation, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), and increased susceptibility to urinary tract infections. Low-dose topical estrogen (e.g., in the form of creams, rings, or tablets) directly targets the vaginal tissues, restoring their elasticity, lubrication, and thickness by replenishing estrogen locally. This is the most effective and often preferred treatment for these symptoms, as it provides localized relief with minimal systemic absorption of estrogen.\r\n",

Laparoscopy allows for direct visualization of the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus, enabling the identification of conditions like tubal obstruction, peritubal adhesions, endometriosis (which can cause infertility), and pelvic inflammatory disease sequelae, all of which can contribute to infertility. Chromopertubation (injecting dye through the cervix to check tubal patency) is often performed during diagnostic laparoscopy for infertility workup\r\n",

Tests for ovarian reserve aim to estimate the remaining follicular pool and the ovaries' ability to respond to gonadotropins. Serum progesterone is primarily used to confirm ovulation and the function of the corpus luteum in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. It does not provide information about the number of remaining follicles or the overall functional capacity of the ovaries in terms of long-term fertility potential. Its level fluctuates significantly throughout the cycle, peaking after ovulation, and thus is not a static marker of ovarian reserve.\r\n",

In a reproductive-age woman, ovarian cysts less than 5 cm and simple in appearance are usually functional and may resolve spontaneously. However, a 6 cm cyst—especially if persistent, symptomatic, or complex—warrants surgical evaluation and treatment. The preferred treatment in this case is Cystectomy (surgical removal of the cyst while preserving the ovary), particularly to rule out malignancy, confirm diagnosis, and alleviate symptoms or complications (e.g. torsion, rupture). Hence, the correct answer is:\r\nA cystectomy is indicated for ovarian cysts that are:\r\n>5 cm, especially if persistent,\r\nComplex or symptomatic,\r\nPresent with atypical features on imaging,\r\nOr occur in women with a risk of malignancy.\r\nSurgical removal allows for both diagnosis and therapy, especially when there's uncertainty about the nature of the cyst.

This Müllerian anomaly results from complete or partial failure of one Müllerian duct to develop. Unicornuate uterus is associated with poor obstetric outcomes such as recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labor, ectopic pregnancy, and endometriosis due to retrograde menstruation from a noncommunicating rudimentary horn. \r\nWhile fetal malpresentations (like breech) can occur with uterine anomalies due to abnormal uterine shape and limited space, transverse lie is not classically or frequently associated with a unicornuate uterus. In contrast, transverse lie is more often linked with uterine anomalies such as bicorporeal uterus, placenta previa, or multiparity. Unicornuate uterus usually has a long, narrow endometrial cavity, which typically limits space for full fetal rotation, but doesn’t commonly result in transverse positioning.\r\n",

It has a long half-life, and its active metabolites can persist in the body for an extended period. Tamoxifen is known to be teratogenic (can cause birth defects) and embryotoxic. Therefore, it is crucial to allow sufficient time for the drug and its active metabolites to be cleared from the body before attempting conception to minimize risks to the fetus. A washout period of at least 2-3 months (or generally around 3 months) is widely recommended by most guidelines and expert consensus before a woman attempts to conceive after stopping tamoxifen.

It is especially indicated in elderly women with severe prolapse who are not good surgical candidates due to multiple comorbidities such as cardiac disease, respiratory issues, or other conditions that make prolonged or invasive surgery risky. Since colpocleisis is a quick, low-risk procedure with minimal blood loss and recovery time, it is ideal for frail, elderly women who need definitive prolapse treatment but cannot tolerate more complex reconstructive surgeries.\r\n\r\n",

SUI occurs due to urethral hypermobility and weakened pelvic floor support, often resulting from childbirth or aging. In colposuspension, the anterior vaginal wall near the urethra is sutured to the Cooper’s ligament (iliopectineal ligament), thereby elevating the bladder neck and proximal urethra, restoring continence. It is especially effective in patients with urethral hypermobility and a well-functioning sphincter, and it has been a traditional treatment before the advent of mid-urethral sling procedures.\r\n",

Individuals with PAIS have a 46, XY karyotype and functional testes that produce normal or elevated testosterone and Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH). Due to partial androgen receptor defects, the body responds incompletely to androgens. This leads to variable external genital development—ranging from predominantly female to ambiguous—with features like clitoromegaly and minimal pubic/axillary hair due to androgen resistance. Breast development occurs via peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen. The absence of uterus is due to the effect of AMH.\r\n",

Their presence is considered pathognomonic and is crucial for diagnosis. Endodermal sinus tumors typically occur in young females and are associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels.
