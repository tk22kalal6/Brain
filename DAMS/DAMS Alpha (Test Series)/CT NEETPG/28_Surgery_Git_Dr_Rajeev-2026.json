At endoscopy no distinct mucosal abnormality is noted inbetween the bleeding episodes. There is no risk of malignancy, no melanin deposition at lips (seen in Peutz jaghers). Submucosal masses with punctuate hemorrhage is a feature GIST.   <br><br>Dieulafoy's lesions are vascular malformations found primarily along the lesser curve of the stomach within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, although they can occur elsewhere in the GI tract. They represent rupture of unusually large vessels (1-3 mm) that are found in the gastric submucosa. Erosion of the gastric mucosa overlying these vessels leads to hemorrhage. The mucosal defect is usually small (2-5 mm) and may be difficult to identify. Given the large size of the underlying artery, bleeding from a Dieulafoy's lesion can be massive.<br><br>Initial attempts at endoscopic control are often successful. Application of thermal or sclerosant therapy is effective in 80% to 100% of cases. In cases that fail endoscopic therapy, angiographic coil embolization can be successful. If these approaches fail, surgical intervention may be necessary and bleeder can be oversewn. In cases in which the bleeding point is not identified, a partial gastrectomy may be necessary.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/61712988.1.png\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)  \r\n\r\nThe history of previous surgery is directing you towards a diagnosis of adhesions. Adhesions and herniae are the most common causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction. If conservative management is unsuccessful (nil by mouth, intravenous fluids and nasogastric decompression) then surgery may be required to lyse the adhesions. Unfortunately, intervention surgery itself is a risk factor for further adhesion formation.\r\n\r\nThe causes of intestinal obstruction can be classified as mechanical or nonmechanical.\r\n\r\nMechanical causes can be classified by the nature of the obstruction:\r\n\r\n• extraluminal: adhesions, herniae, abscess, neoplasm, volvulus\r\n\r\n• intraluminal: faecolith, intussusception, gallstone ileus, meconium\r\n\r\n• mural: atresia, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, neoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe most common cause of non-mechanical obstruction in the postoperative patient is paralytic ileus which is believed to occur as a result of the handling of bowel intraoperatively. This should normally not persist for more than a few days. Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypokalaemia) and anticholinergic medications can also give rise to ileus. The term pseudo-obstruction refers to the presentation of symptoms and signs mimicking mechanical obstruction but with no obstructing lesion. It is more common in elderly patients suffering from chronic medical conditions. Treatment is conservative",
