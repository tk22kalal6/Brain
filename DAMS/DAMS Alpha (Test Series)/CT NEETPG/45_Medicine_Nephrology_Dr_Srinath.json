      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liddle&rsquo;s syndrome is a stimulatory defect in eNa+ channels at the DCT. This leads to a state of Pseudo-Hyperaldosteronism. This causes Urinary Na+ and water reabsorption even in absence of a measurable Renin levels leading to increase in Plasma volume. This leads to development of Hypertension which is often diagnosed incidentally. &nbsp;Treatment is available in form of Amiloride (which blocks the eNa+ channels) and offers potential cure.<br />\r\nBarrter&rsquo;s and Gitelman&rsquo;s syndrome are inhibitory defects of Na-K-2Cl ATPase pump and Na-Cl transporter respectively leading to defect in Na+ and water reabsorption.
