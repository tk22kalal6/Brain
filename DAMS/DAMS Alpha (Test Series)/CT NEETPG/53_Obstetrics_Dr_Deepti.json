      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amniocentesis, cordocentesis, cystic hygroma aspiration, and chorionic villus sampling are techniques of obtaining fetal tissues that are amenable to cytogenetic analysis. Amniotic fluid cells require tissue culture to obtain adequate cell numbers for analysis. Chorionic villi can be harvested directly for extremely rapid diagnosis or can be cultured for higher banding (increased detail). Fetal blood obtained by cordocentesis or percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS) requires 2 to 3 days of culturing before a karyotype is obtained. Doppler flow ultrasound is used to assess blood flow through fetal vessels, but is not a substitute for direct analysis of tissue.</p>\r\n",

Most of all PPH s results from uterine atony, the failure of uterine muscles to contract normally after the second and third stages of labor. Without muscular contraction, severed vessels of the placental bed will continue to bleed. Any factor that might cause uterine muscle exhaustion or distend and distort the muscle can cause atony. These factors allow prediction of PPH and preparation of uterotonic medications prior to delivery. Advanced maternal age is not associated with PPH, although it can be associated with multiparity and the development of preeclampsia requiring magnesium</p>\r\n",

There is no consensus on whether antepartum fetal tesƟng is necessary in women with well-controlled gestational diabetes. Antepartum fetal testing is recommended for women with preexisting diabetes mellitus and those who require insulin therapy. There is no good evidence to support routine delivery before 40 weeks when glucose control is good and no other complications supervene.

Immediately after the birth of a 4.1-kg  newborn, the patient experiences massive hemorrhage from extensive vaginal and cervical lacerations. She is brought to the nearest hospital in shock. Over the course of 2 hours, nine units of blood are transfused, and the patient’s blood pressure returns to a reasonable level. A hemoglobin value the next day is 7.5 g/dL, and three more units of packed red blood cells are given. The most likely late sequela to consider in this woman is which of the following? ",

The woman described in the question delivered a large baby, suffered multiple soft tissue injuries, and went into shock, needing nine units of blood by the time she reached the hospital. Sheehan syndrome seems a likely possibility in this woman. This syndrome of anterior pituitary necrosis related to obstetric hemorrhage can be diagnosed by 1-week postpartum, as lactation fails to commence normally. Other symptoms of Sheehan syndrome include amenorrhea, atrophy of the breasts, and loss of thyroid and adrenal function.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Fractures of the clavicle and humerus usually heal rapidly and are clinically insignificant. Injury to the brachial plexus may be localized to the upper or lower roots. In Erb (or Erb-Duchenne) palsy, the upper roots of the brachial plexus are injured (C5-6), resulting in paralysis of the shoulder and arm muscles; the arm hangs limply to the side and is extended and internally rotated. In the case of Klumpke paralysis, the lower nerves of the brachial plexus are affected (C7-T1) and the hand is paralyzed.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bleeding occurs in about 30% to 40% of pregnancies before 20 weeks&rsquo; gestation, with about half of these pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortion. A threatened abortion describes uterine bleeding that occurs without any cervical dilation or effacement. Inevitable abortion occurs when there is bleeding and cervical dilation, with or without rupture of membranes. Incomplete abortion is when only a portion of the products of conception have been expelled, and the cervix remains dilated. Incases where all fetal and placental tissue have been expelled, the cervix is closed, bleeding is minimal and uterine cramps have ceased, a diagnosis of complete abortion may be made. A missed abortion is one in which fetal death occurs before 20 weeks&rsquo; gestation without expulsion of any fetal or maternal tissue for at least 8 weeks thereafter. When a fetus is retained in the uterus beyond 5 weeks after fetal death, consumptive coagulability with hypofibrinogenemia may occur. This is uncommon, however in gestations of less than 14 weeks in duration.</p>\r\n",

There is associated polyhydramnios due to defective swallowing. Duodenal atresia has a strong association with downs syndrome. Duodenal atresia can be an isolated condition (which means no other birth defect or condition occurs with it), but is also more common in infants with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). About one in three babies born with duodenal atresia has Down syndrome. These patients must undergo genetic analysis for the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
