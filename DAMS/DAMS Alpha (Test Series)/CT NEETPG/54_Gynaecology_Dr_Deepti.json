      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isosexual (no virilization) precocious puberty with an adnexal mass usually is a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary. Dermoid cysts are also found in the ovary. They present as a pelvic mass that causes pain due to its rapidly enlarging size, however, they do not cause isosexual precocious puberty. A Sertoli&ndash;Leydig cell tumor is the androgen counterpart to the granulose-theca cell tumor. With a Sertoli&ndash;Leydig cell tumor, testosterone levels are markedly elevated, and patients typically present with hirsutism, virilism, and an adnexal mass. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in the newborn; however, late onset can present in adult women with symptoms of hirsutism and anovulation.</p>\r\n",

Cystourethroscopy is an endoscopic procedure used to evaluate the interior of the bladder and urethra and is not a procedure for the treatment of urinary incontinence. Sacral neuromodulation (InterStim) is used for the treatment of urgency incontinence, not stress incontinence. Colpocleisis is a vaginal obliteration procedure used to treat pelvic organ prolapse in patients who are poor surgical candidates and no longer plan on vaginal intercourse</p>\r\n",

Primary node groups involved in the spread of cervical cancer include the paracervical, parametrial, obturator, hypogastric, external iliac, and sacral nodes, essentially in that order. Less commonly, there is involvement in the common iliac, inguinal, and para-aortic nodes. In stage I, the pelvic nodes are positive in approximately 15% of cases and the para-aortic nodes in 6%. In stage II, pelvic nodes are positive in 28% of cases and para-aortic nodes in 16%. In stage III, pelvic nodes are positive in 47% of cases and para-aortic nodes in 28%</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diagnostic evaluation of an infertile couple should be thorough and completed as rapidly as possible. The primary diagnostic steps in the workup of the infertile couple include (1) documentation of ovulation by measurement of basal body temperature (BBT) or mid&ndash;luteal phase serum progesterone; (2) semen analysis; (3) postcoital test; (4) hysterosalpingogram; and (5) endometrial biopsy. Women should record their BBT for evidence of ovulation. In addition, serial serum progesterone levels may be helpful to confirm ovulation. Serum progesterone values should be obtained 7 days after ovulation and may also be helpful in evaluating inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy may also provide valuable information regarding the status of the luteal phase. The biopsy is obtained 12 days after the thermogenic shift, or 2 to 3 days before the expected onset of menses, on about day 26 of a 28-day cycle. A postcoital test is an in vivo test that evaluates the interaction of sperm and cervical mucus. It is performed during the periovulatory period up to 12 h after coitus</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This patient would be unable to produce endogenous gonadotropin, since her pituitary has been ablated. The patient will therefore need to be given exogenous gonadotropin in the form of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), which contains an extract of urine from postmenopausal women with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in various ratios. Recombinant human FSH (rhFSH) is now also available. Carefully timed administration of hCG, which takes the place of an endogenous LH surge, will be needed to complete oocyte maturation and induce ovulation. Clomiphene citrate acts by competing with endogenous circulating estrogens for estrogen-binding sites in the hypothalamus. Therefore, it blocks the normal negative feedback of the endogenous estrogens and stimulates release of endogenous GnRH. However, the ablated pituitary will not respond in this patient. Endogenous or exogenous GnRH cannot stimulate the release of FSH or LH in this woman because the pituitary gland is nonfunctional.</p>\r\n",

Similarly, having the patient undergo IVF with her own eggs would be of no benefit because the patient&rsquo;s store of eggs has been mostly exhausted; although the new term primary ovarian insufficiency reflects the small, although unlikely, chance that spontaneous pregnancy can take place. Having the patient undergo IVF using an egg donor is plausible and gives her the most likely chance of a successful pregnancy. In this situation, an egg donor would undergo ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, and the donated eggs would be combined with the patient&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s sperm, and the resulting embryos would be transferred into the patient.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Precocious puberty can be treated by agents that reduce gonadotropin levels by exerting negative feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or that directly inhibit gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland. Until about 10 years ago, the greatest experience in the treatment of idiopathic central precocious puberty was with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). MPA was usually administered intramuscularly in a dose of 100 to 200 mg/wk, or orally at 20 to 40 mg/d. Currently, the most effective treatment for central precocious puberty is the use of a long-acting GnRH agonist, such as leurolide (Lupron) and others. These drugs act by downregulating pituitary gonadotropes, eventually decreasing the secretion of FSH and LH, which are inappropriately stimulating the ovaries of these patients. As a result of this induced hypogonadotropic state, ovarian steroids (estrogens, progestins, and androgens) are suppressed back to prepubertal levels and precocious pubertal development stops or regresses. During the first 1 or 2 weeks of therapy there is a flare-up effect of increased gonadotropins and sex steroids, a predicted side effect of these medications. At the time of expected puberty, the GnRH analogue is discontinued and the pubertal sequence resumes.</p>\r\n",

The karyotype is 46,XX. There is normal development of breasts, sexual hair, ovaries, tubes, and external genitalia. There are associated skeletal (12%) and urinary tract (33%) anomalies. Treatment generally consists of progressive vaginal dilation or creation of an artificial vagina with split-thickness skin grafts (McIndoe procedure). Testicular feminization, or congenital androgen insensitivity syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder with a karyotype of 46,XY. The patient presents with an absent uterus and blind vaginal canal. However, in these patients the amount of sexual hair is significantly decreased.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of estrogen in a pubertal girl stimulates the formation of secondary sex characteristics, including development of breasts, production of cervical mucus, and vaginal cornification. As estrogen levels increase, menses begins and ovulation is maintained for several decades. Ovarian estrogen production late in puberty is at least in part responsible for termination of the pubertal growth spurt, thereby determining adult height. Decreasing levels of estrogen are associated with lower frequency of ovulation, eventually leading to menopause. Hair growth during puberty is caused by androgens from the adrenal gland and, later, the ovary</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In young, menstruating women the most common reason for an enlargement of one ovary is the presence of a functional ovarian cyst. Functional cysts are physiologic. Follicular cysts are usually asymptomatic, unilateral, thin-walled, and filled with a watery, straw-coloured fluid. Corpus luteum cysts are less common than follicular cysts. They are usually unilateral, but often appear complex, as they may be haemorrhagic. Patients with a corpus luteum cyst may complain of dull pain on the side of the affected ovary. Theca lutein cysts are the least common of the three types of functional ovarian cysts. They are almost always bilateral and are associated with pregnancy. Since the most common cause of a unilateral, asymptomatic ovarian cyst in a young, menstruating woman is a functional cyst, it is most reasonable to follow the patient conservatively and have her return after 1 to 2 months to recheck her ovary. More aggressive primary management with surgery is not indicated in a young, asymptomatic patient. CT s canning or pelvic ultrasonography may be indicated if the cyst is persistent. CA-125 is a cancer antigen expressed by approximately 80% of ovarian epithelial carcinomas. CA-125 testing is not very specific in women of childbearing age and is not useful for primary evaluation of an ovarian cyst in a young, asymptomatic patient. CA-125 testing is valuable in evaluating postmenopausal women with pelvic masses and in assessing treatment response in women undergoing treatment for CA-125 producing ovarian cancers</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several available tests for the assessment of ovarian reserve. Traditionally, the CCCT was used to assess ovarian reserve. This involves administration of 100 mg of Clomid on days 5 to 9 of the cycle. The FSH level is then measured at days 3 and 10. The CCCT is still a valid test but has largely been replaced by direct measurement of AMH, day 3 FSH, and day 3 estradiol. Measurement of a day 3 FSH level is based on the notion that women with good ovarian reserve will make enough ovarian hormones early in the menstrual cycle to provide inhibition of FSH, thus keeping it at a low level. In general, a day 3 FSH value greater than 20 mIU/mL is indicative of poor ovarian reserve. Measurement of the day 3 estradiol level assesses ovarian reserve by looking for elevated basal rates of estradiol caused by premature follicle recruitment in women with poor ovarian reserve. Thus, a higher day 3 estradiol level measurement of AMH reflects the size of primordial follicle pool, and &gt;80 pg/mL is suggestive of diminished reserve. As women age and the pool declines, a lower amount of AMH is found. A level of less than 0.15 ng/mL is suggestive of a reduced follicle pool and is associated with decreased pregnancy rates. Days 21 to 23 progesterone levels are used to assess ovulation for a given cycle, not ovarian reserve.</p>\r\n",
