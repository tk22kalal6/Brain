      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\n Before the discovery of the ER, all breast cancers were thought to be sensitive to endocrine therapy. Clinical trials and laboratory research established that only cancers containing ER (ER-positive cancers) respond to endocrine treatments. Fur- thermore, because binding of estrogen to its receptor induces progesterone receptor (PR) expression, the presence of PR cor- relates with response to endocrine therapy. The presence of both receptors in a tumor is associated with an almost 80% chance of favorably responding to hormone blockade. Recently, the unique- ness of tumors that are ER negative, PR negative, and HER-2 negative has been investigated, and these triple-negative cancers express proteins in common with myoepithelial cells at the base of mammary ducts and therefore are also called basal-like cancers. Women who carry a disease-associated mutation in BRCA1 (but not BRCA2) are much more likely to contract a basal-like cancer than other subtypes. HER-2 (or the erb-B-2/ neu protein) is a product of the erb-B2 gene and is amplified in about 20% of human breast cancers. Trastuzumab is a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the surface receptor and is an effective treatment for HER-2–positive tumors.\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n In current practice, lumpectomy (wide local exci- sion) is considered in cases in which the tumor can be excised to clear margins and leave an acceptable cosmetic result. Randomized trials have studied breast conservation for tumors up to 5 cm in size. Patients who undergo lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy have the same survival rate as do those who undergo modi- fied radical mastectomy. SLNB is an acceptable method of staging the axilla in breast cancer patients without clinically suspicious lymph nodes. Because the patient is ER and PR negative, she would not derive any benefit from treatment with tamoxifen. However, she is HER-2/neu positive and would therefore benefit from treat- ment with trastuzumab. Recent studies have shown that the addi- tion of trastuzumab to conventional adjuvant chemotherapy significantly reduces the rate of recurrence (almost a 50% reduction)\r\n",

Indeed, chest and pelvis CT might have been unnecessary as well. 123I-MIBG scan can be considered to prove that the adrenal mass is the source of elevated catecholamines. However, in the setting of vastly ele- vated metanephrine levels (>four- to five-fold) this is not necessary. Due to the size of this pheochromocytoma, this patient is not at increased risk of metastases. Thus, a functional imaging modality is not necessary.

Closed method\r\n2. Open method\r\nThe open method is preferred for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgeries as the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound. The use of\r\nthe open technique for creating a pneumoperitoneum avoids the morbidity related to a blind puncture.\r\nTo achieve this, a 1 cm vertical or transverse incision is made at the level of the umbilicus, stay sutures are applied, and the fascia is dissected. Free penetration into the abdominal cavity is confirmed by the gentle introduction of a finger. A Hasson trocar (shown below) is inserted and anchored, and a pneumoperitoneum is created. This is the Hasson or modified Hasson approach.\r\nThe closed method using the Veress needle has a small but significant potential for intestinal or vascular injury on the introduction of the needle or trocar. Proper placement of the needle can be determined by the inability to re-aspirate injected saline. The normal insufflation rate is 4-6 litres/min.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nAortic dissection occurs when a tear in the intimal layer of the vessel permits blood to create a false channel within the wall, causing the aorta to be divided into a true and a false lumen. There are two different classification systems, Debakey and Stanford, based on the anatomic location of the dissection. Debakey type I involves the ascending and thoracoabdominal aorta. Debakey type II is limited to the ascending aorta. Debakey type IIIa is limited to the descending thoracic aorta. Debakey type IIIb involves the descend- ing thoracic and abdominal aorta. Stanford type A involves the ascending aorta, while Stanford type B does not. Diagnosis can be made with CT and echocardiogram to assess the proximal aorta and heart. Acute type A dissection is considered a surgical emergency. Treatment often includes replacement of the aortic valve and the ascending aorta. Type B is characterized as acute (presentation within\r\n14 days of symptoms) or chronic and complicated or uncomplicated. Type B dissections usually begin from a primary tear in the proximal descending thoracic aorta just distal to the origin of the left subcla- vian artery and usually extend antegrade (but can extend retrograde). Traditionally, aggressive medical management has been the treat- ment for uncomplicated type B dissections. With advances in endo- vascular treatments, this management paradigm has started to shift. Specifically, 91% of patients who undergo stent graft placement have been found to have aortic remodeling, which decreases the risk for aneurysmal degeneration in future years. Only 19% of those who undergo medical management have aortic remodeling. The potential for survival benefit following endovascular stenting may increase the use of this technique. Complications of type B dissections include rupture, aneurysmal degeneration, intractable pain, and evidence of malperfusion. Malperfusion to the lower extremities, viscera, or spine can be caused as a result of the dynamic compression of the true lumen by the false thrombosis of either lumen or by the exten- sion of the dissection onto the branch vessels. Signs of malperfusion include renal insufficiency, abdominal pain, mesenteric ischemia, lower extremity ischemia, paresthesia, or paraplegia. Surgical treat- ment includes replacement of the descending aorta or fenestration of the abdominal aorta to address visceral or limb malperfusion. Endo- vascular stent grafts can be used to cover the entry tear, therefore depressurizing the false lumen, expanding the true lumen, and allow- ing for thrombosis of the false lumen and aortic remodeling.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nClassification systems help to standardize diagno- sis and treatment. The CEAP classification system was created to aid in diagnosing the severity of a disease and to improve the care of patients with venous disease. According to this system, a patient with C0 has no visible or palpable signs of venous disease. C1 is someone who has telangiectasias or reticular veins on examination. A telangiectasia is a “spider” vein that is a collection of smaller veins, each less than 1 mm in size. A reticular vein is a vein below the dermis that is between 1 and 3 mm and usually tortuous. C2 patients have varicose veins, and C3 patients have significant edema. C4 is divided into 4a, those with skin changes including pigmentation and/or eczema, and 4b, skin changes of lipodermato- sclerosis and or atrophie blanche. C5 includes healed venous ulcers, and C6 has active ulceration. An “S” designation is for patients with symptoms of aching pain, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, and muscle cramps. An “A” designation is for patients who are asymptomatic. The Etiology of a disease can be congenital, primary, or secondary. The pathophysiology for the venous problem can be due to reflux, obstruction, or both. Generally, patients with C3 or C4 usually have nonoperative management. Their treatment includes compression stockings and skin lubricants. C5 and C6 can undergo operative intervention depending on the etiology and anatomy of the disease to prevent a long-term ulcer recurrence.\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nA carotid body tumor is the most common para- ganglioma in the head and neck. Other paragangliomas that occur in this region include the vagal and jugulotympanic types. The major- ity of paragangliomas are solitary and nonfamilial. Multicentricity is reported in about 10% of cases, with about a 6% rate of malignancy. Only about 1%–3% of them are considered functional and can be evaluated with a 24-h urine collection for the analysis of catechol- amines. The “Fontaine sign” refers to mobility in only the lateral direction on palpation, whereas pain occurring with chewing is called “first-bite syndrome.” Histopathologic evaluation of this tumor demonstrates two types of cells: type I, chief cells/granular cells, and type II, sustentacular supporting cells. Unlike most head and neck tumors, malignancy is not diagnosed by the presence of dysplastic changes in the primary tumor. The presence of a metastatic disease either to the regional cervical lymphatics or to the distant sites is the only diagnostic criteria. Imaging is the major modality for primary diagnosis since needle biopsy is contraindicated. CT will show a hypervascular mass at the carotid bifurcation, with magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) demonstrating a classic “salt and pepper” appearance on T2-weighted sequences because of hemorrhage and flow voids. On angiography, the internal and external carotid arteries will be bowed apart, a finding referred to as the “lyre sign.” These tumors are best treated surgically, and vascular reconstruction may be necessary. Radiation therapy can stop the growth of these lesions but not shrink their size. Patients should be aware of the potential risk of injury to the vagus.\r\n",

Onclinical examination the phyllodes tumours feel firm, well-circumscribed like fibroadenomaand might be slightly larger when first detected. It is impossible to differentiate smallerphyllodes tumour from fibroadenoma clinically. Features that alert a clinician to a phyllodestumour include the following:\r\n1. Older age of the patient\r\n2. Larger tumour size\r\n3. History of rapid growth\r\nPhyllodes tumor is classified as benign, intermediate and malignant.Blood-stained nipple discharge might be caused by duct ectasia, a duct papilloma, or carcinoma.

This forms a false lumen that occupies much of the circumference of the lumen, resulting in a reduction in blood flow to the major arteries supplied by the aorta. It can be classified by Stanford classification into Type A, which involves the ascending aorta, and Type B, which does not.An acute myocardial infarction will also present with acute-onset chest pain; however, there is usu- ally no difference in blood pressure between both arms. If aortic dissection is misdiagnosed as myo- cardial infarction, treatment with thrombolytics or anticoagulants may potentially be catastrophic.\r\nBoerhaave’s syndrome refers to oesophageal rupture due to vomiting. It presents with Mackler’s triad of chest pain, vomiting and subcutaneous emphysema.\r\nCardiac tamponade from a pericardial effusion will present with Beck’s triad of hypotension, raised jugular venous pressure and muffled heart sounds.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nIt is vital for surgeons to understand the principles behind the various types of suture needles and their applications in surgery. Round-bodied needles tend to separate tissue fibres (i.e. instead of cutting them). They are therefore used in bowel and vascular anastomoses, as they encourage tissues to close tightly around the suture material, forming a leak-proof suture line.\r\nBlunt round-point needles literally ‘dissect’ rather than cut, and are useful when suturing extremely friable vascular tissue (e.g. liver, kidney, and spleen) and mass closure of the abdominal wall. For tough tissues like skin, ligament and tendon, reverse cutting needles are beneficial as their triangular cross section (with the apex on the outer convex curvature of the needle) offers the most effective tissue penetration with minimal collateral trauma. Reverse cutting needles\r\nare especially useful in ophthalmic and cosmetic procedures, where minimal trauma, early tissue regeneration, and minimal scar formation are the primary aims.\r\nBlunt taperpoint needles are employed when needlestick injury is a major concern (i.e. in high- risk patients). In contrast, tapercut needles combine the initial penetration of a cutting needle with the minimized trauma of the round-bodied needle, making this needle appropriate for use on fascia, ligament, or scar tissue\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nNon-absorbable suture material should not be used in the biliary tract and urinary tract, as they would act as a nidus for a stone. Absorbable sutures should always be used when closing the common bile duct or placing sutures anywhere from the renal pelvis down to the urinary bladder. In closure of the abdominal wall, mass closure technique is the usual method. In this large bites are taken in short steps using nylon or polypropylene (non-absorbable) or polydiaxanone (PDS, slowly absorbable) sutures. The length of suture material used should be at least four times the length of the incision to be closed; this is to minimise the risk of wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. Knot tying, one of the most basic of surgical techniques, should be thoroughly mastered as sutures lose 50% of their strength at the knot. Suture materials are generally classified as synthetic (non-absorbable) and natural (absorbable). Synthetic suture materials produce minimal tissue reaction. Sutures from biological or natural material elicit tissue reaction and hence are unpredictable in their behaviour. The bodies of needles are round, triangular, or flat. Round-bodied needles gradually taper to a point and are designed to separate tissue fibres, as in intestinal and cardiovascular surgery. Triangular needles have cutting edges and are used when tough or dense tissue such as skin and fascia are to be sutured.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nIf antibiotics are given to prevent infection after surgery or instrumentation, they should be used before bacterial growth becomes established (i.e. within the decisive period &lt; 4hours). Ideally, maximal blood and tissue levels should be present at the time at which the first incision is made and before contamination occurs. Tissue levels of the antibiotic should remain high throughout the operation and antibiotics with a short tissue half life should be avoided. Intravenous administration at induction of anaesthesia is therefore optimal, as unexpected delays in the timing of surgery may occur before then and antibiotic tissue levels may fall off before the surgery starts. In long operations or when there is excessive blood loss, or when unexpected contamination occurs, antibiotics may be repeated at 4-hourly intervals during the surgery, because tissue antibiotic levels often fall faster than serum levels. There is no evidence that further doses of antibiotics after surgery are of any value in prophylaxis against infection and the practice can only encourage the development of antibiotic resistance.\r\nWhen wounds are heavily contaminated or when an incision is made into an abscess, a 5-day course of therapeutic antibiotics may be justified on the assumption that the wound is inevitably infected and so treatment is needed rather than prophylaxis\r\n",

Frequently, the umbilicus is the site of choice, but alternatively, nonmidline sites may be used in patients with previous abdominal surgery. The area of previous incisions should be avoided, and the chosen site should be lateral to the rectus muscle to avoid the major abdominal wall vessels. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication often requires a trocar in the left subcostal position, thus making this an ideal choice for this patient.\r\n\r\n",

The detached stapling head/anvil is introduced into one end of the bowel, usually being secured within it by means of a purse-string suture. The body of the device is then inserted into the other end of the bowel, either via the rectum for a low rectal anastomosis, or via an enterotomy for an oesophago-jejunostomy, and the shaft is either extended through a small opening in the bowel wall or secured by a further purse-string suture. The head/anvil is reattached to the shaft and the two ends approximated. Once the device is fully closed, as indicated by the green indicator in the window, the device is fired, and, after unwinding, the stapler is gently withdrawn. It is important to assess the integrity of the anastomosis by examining the ‘doughnuts’ of tissue excised for completeness. It is essential that no extraneous tissue is allowed to become interposed between the two bowel walls on closing the stapler.\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nZ-Plasty is a technique used widely by plastic surgeons to lengthen or reorient a scar by transposing two Z-shaped flaps or two triangular flaps. The technique, if not executed properly, may result in complications such as haematoma under the flaps, wound infection, ‘trapdoor’ effect and flap necrosis. They have several applications in plastic surgical reconstruction and the theoretical gain in length depends on the angles of the ‘Z’. In theory the following will occur: • A 30° Z-plasty will provide a 25% gain in length. • A 45° Z-plasty will provide a 50% gain in length. • A 60° Z-plasty will provide a 75% gain in length. • A 75° Z-plasty will provide a 100% gain in length. • A 90° Z-plasty will provide a 120% gain in length.\r\n",

Damage to this nerve can result in weakness of the depressor anguli oris, labii inferioris muscles, and mentalis muscle, which gives rise to an inability to lower the lip on the affected side. ● The hypoglossal nerve that lies deep to the digastric muscle, ascends to supply the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. Damage leads to weakness of the tongue muscles and is tested by observing wasting and deviation of the tongue to the affected side. ● The lingual nerve (mandibular division of trigeminal nerve) provides sensory innervation to the tongue and also carries fibres of the Chorda tympani (facial nerve) that provide special sense taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\r\n",

Risk factors for cutaneous SCC include fair skin; light-colored eyes; prior actinic keratosis; xeroderma pigmentosum; and exposure to nitrates, arsenicals, and hydrocarbons. Other risk factors associated with the disease are chronic excessive sun exposure, immunosuppression, previous trauma, and burns. The aggressiveness of these cancers is related to the underlying cause, location, and size of the lesion. It is increased in lesions arising in areas of previous burns (Marjolin ulcer) or trauma and in lesions of the lips and perineum. Excision of cutaneous SCC, generally with margins of 4 to 5 mm, should be accompanied by frozen section evaluation of the surgical margins. These tumors are radiosensitive. Surgery is preferred for tumors arising in scarred, traumatized, or previously irradiated skin. Large lesions may require adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical excision. Mohs surgery may be used for lesions with clinically indistinct margins. Regional lymph node dissection for SCC is performed for clinically evident (palpable) disease\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nDeath due to trauma with hemorrhagic shock is arranged in a trimodal distribution: immediate (at the scene), within the first 24 hours, and 1 week or more fol- lowing the injury. In the acute period after trauma, mor- tality is attributable to massive hemorrhage or neurologic injury. Direct injury to an organ contributes to a primary multiple organ dysfunction in this early period. In con- trast, late deaths, occurring at least 1 week subsequent\r\nto the trauma, generally arise from secondary multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This condition develops in 30–60% of these trauma patients and is asso- ciated with up to an 80% mortality rate, depending on the number of organ systems affected.\r\nMODS is defined as the failure of multiple organs in a critically ill patient in whom the maintenance of homeo- stasis requires intervention. This syndrome appears as the end point in a variety of conditions, not isolated to trauma and hemorrhagic shock. In the case of trauma, the prevalence of MODS is ascribed to a two-hit phe- nomenon, suggesting that trauma represents an initial insult that predisposes the immune system to react later to a lesser injury with a massive response, mediated primarily by neutrophils, resulting in great collateral damage . The primed neutrophils mediate further tissue injury by means of proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and vasoactive substances. Following traumatic hemorrhagic shock, the patient\r\nis resuscitated into not only a local but also a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), with general- ized inflammation generated within 1 hour of injury.\r\nNeutrophils and monocytes are first activated, releas- ing inflammatory mediators. TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6\r\nare particularly implicated in the evolution of MODS, found in studies to induce this syndrome and to be pres- ent in elevated levels. Additionally, the coagulation and alternative complement cascades are initiated. In the absence of further injury, SIRS is beneficial to recovery from the trauma. The second, often trivial, insult, how- ever, results in an enhanced immune response from\r\nthe already primed immune cells, notably neutrophils. This second hit may arise from a mild infection, pul- monary aspiration, or blood transfusion (Table 10-2). Ultimately, organs not involved in the original trauma experience an alteration in function. Usually, the lung\r\nis affected first, with kidneys, liver, and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction occurring late\r\n",
