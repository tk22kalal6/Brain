The hypotension can be worsened markedly with nitrate therapy. Appropriate hemodynamic management includes judicious volume loading, often guided by a pulmonary artery catheter.

Magnesium sulphate reduces the risk of torsades without affecting the QT interval and is first-line treatment. Isoproterenol and pacing increase the underlying ventricular rate and reduce the risk of recurrence, as torsades is a bradycardia-dependent arrhythmia, although they are infrequently needed. Hypokalaemia worsens the risk of torsades, so correction  is beneficial. Procainamide is a class Ia anti-dysrhythmic drug that further prolongs ventricular repolarisation and would worsen the risk of torsades.\r\n",
