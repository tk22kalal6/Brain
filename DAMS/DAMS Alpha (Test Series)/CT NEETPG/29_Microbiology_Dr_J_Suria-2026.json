      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation:<br />\r\nGram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The Lipid A component of LPS is the toxic moiety, responsible for triggering cytokine release, fever, shock, and other systemic effects seen in Gram-negative sepsis. The O-antigen is antigenic but non-toxic, while porins aid in nutrient transport.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
