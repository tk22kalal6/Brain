      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nLiddle’s syndrome is a stimulatory defect in eNa+ channels at the DCT. This leads to a state of Pseudo-Hyperaldosteronism. This causes Urinary Na+ and water reabsorption even in absence of a measurable Renin levels leading to increase in Plasma volume. This leads to development of Hypertension which is often diagnosed incidentally.  Treatment is available in form of Amiloride (which blocks the eNa+ channels) and offers potential cure.\r\nBarrter’s and Gitelman’s syndrome are inhibitory defects of Na-K-2Cl ATPase pump and Na-Cl transporter respectively leading to defect in Na+ and water reabsorption. Hence, both syndromes are associated with dehydration.\r\nConn’s syndrome is Primary Hyperaldosteronism.\r\n",
