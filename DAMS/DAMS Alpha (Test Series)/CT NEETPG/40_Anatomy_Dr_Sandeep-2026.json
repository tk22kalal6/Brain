Neutrophils elastase is inhibited by serum α1antitrypsin and macrophage elastase is inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Neutrophil and macrophage elastases can also degrade each other’s (but not their own) inhibitors, augmenting their destructive capacity when both proteases are present.

During normal swallowing, food is diverted by the epiglottis laterally through the piriform recesses into the esophagus without endangering the airway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A thin layer of mucosa overlying the piriform recess is all that protects the superficially coursing internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (CN X). Unlike the recurrent and external laryngeal nerves that carry motor fibers to the muscles involved in vocal cord function, the internal laryngeal nerve contains only sensory and autonomic fibers. It mediates the afferent limb of the cough reflex by carrying sensation from the mucosa superior to the vocal cords. Foreign bodies, such as chicken or fish bones, can become lodged in the piriform recess. The internal laryngeal nerve can be damaged by the sharpness of these objects or attempts to retrieve them.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nSupraspinatus\r\n\r\nExp:- \r\n\r\n\r\nThe rotator cuff is made up of the tendons of the following muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis (SITS).. The supraspinatus muscle is the main agonistic muscle responsible for the first 10 to 15 degrees of arm abduction. \r\nOf the rotator cuff structures, the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle is most commonly affected in rotator cuff syndrome. Due to its superior location, this tendon is vulnerable to chronic repeated trauma from impingement between the head of the humerus and the acromioclavicular joint. Motions that typically cause inflammation of this tendon are simultaneous abduction and flexion of the arm at the shoulder, but a traumatic fall laterally on an outstretched hand can also cause injury. Inflammation is followed by fibrosis, which worsens the problem by increasing friction between the head of the humerus and the acromion, as well as causing inflammation of the subacromial bursa. \r\n\r\nThe supraspinatus muscle assists in abduction of the arm and stabilization of the glenohumeral joint. The most commonly injured structure in rotator cuff syndrome is the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle. This tendon is vulnerable to injury due to impingement between the acromion and the head of the humerus.",

The shoulder may dislocate anteriorly, interiorly or posteriorly, but anterior dislocations are by far the most common. Flattening of the deltoid muscle after a shoulder injury suggests anterior shoulder dislocation. This injury most commonly results from forceful external rotation and abduction at the shoulder joint.
