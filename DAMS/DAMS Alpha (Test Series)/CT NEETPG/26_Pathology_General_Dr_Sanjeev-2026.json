The patient is having increased expectoration and sputum after 4 or 5 days of an acute episode of bronchospasm this will be a late manifestation of a type I hypersensitivity reaction which are due to eosinophil which secrete eosinophilic cationic protein and major basic proteins which will end up causing tissue destruction, inflammation and increased mucus secretion. On the other hand mast cell occur early, the early phase usually stays for few minutes to few hours after exposure of the antigen which is mediated by histamine which will have bronchospasm and also increased mucus secretion, the late phase typically starts after 1 week and can stay for few days. \r\n",
