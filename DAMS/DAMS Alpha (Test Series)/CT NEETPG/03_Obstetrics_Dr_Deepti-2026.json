      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nGive 300 mcg within 72 hrs of delivery if baby blood group is positive\r\nIn Rh-negative pregnant women, there is a risk of Rh alloimmunization if the fetus is Rh-positive. To prevent this, anti-D immunoglobulin is administered. A routine 300 mcg dose is given at 28 weeks of gestation as antenatal prophylaxis. However, if the newborn is Rh-positive, another 300 mcg dose must be given within 72 hours postpartum. This prevents maternal sensitization from any fetomaternal hemorrhage occurring during delivery. If the baby is Rh-negative, no further anti-D is needed after birth. \r\n",

In early pregnancy (between 10–14 weeks), a chorionicity scan is done to determine whether twins share a placenta (monochorionic) or have separate placentas (dichorionic). In a T-sign, the thin membrane separating the amniotic sacs meets the placenta at a 90° angle, forming a T shape, unlike the lambda or twin peak sign seen in dichorionic twins. Detecting this early helps in anticipating complications and planning closer surveillance.\r\n",

A speculum (P/S) exam is the most appropriate next step because it allows for direct visualization of the cervix and vaginal vault. During this exam, the clinician can confirm if amniotic fluid is leaking (e.g., pooling in the posterior fornix, positive nitrazine test, or ferning test). It's a non-invasive way to diagnose PROM without increasing the risk of infection. If PROM is confirmed, further management would then be guided by the gestational age and clinical situation.\r\n",

It is characterized by microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. AFLP is not primarily associated with maternal LCHAD (Long-Chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase) deficiency. Instead, AFLP is strongly linked to a fetal deficiency in LCHAD. When the fetus has an LCHAD deficiency, it cannot properly metabolize long-chain fatty acids. These unmetabolized fatty acid intermediates then cross the placenta into the maternal circulation, overwhelming the mother's mitochondrial β-oxidation system and leading to liver dysfunction and the characteristic fatty infiltration seen in AFLP.\r\n",

Instead, oliguria can contribute to magnesium sulfate toxicity. Magnesium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.

Station: This refers to the fetal station, which describes the descent of the presenting part of the fetus (usually the head) in relation to the maternal ischial spines.

However, in cases where the patient is intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron (e.g., due to gastrointestinal side effects or poor absorption), the next step is to initiate parenteral iron therapy, most commonly iron sucrose IV. This bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and ensures faster replenishment of iron stores, which is important as the patient is already in the third trimester where time for hematologic correction is limited.\r\n",

Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. At term, the risks associated with continuing the pregnancy for both the mother (e.g., progression to severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, stroke) and the fetus (e.g., placental insufficiency, growth restriction, stillbirth) often outweigh the risks of induction. Inducing labor allows for the delivery of the placenta, which is the definitive treatment for preeclampsia.\r\n",

While the incidence in recurrent losses might be slightly lower than sporadic losses, it still remains the leading cause.

In MCDA twins, both fetuses share a single placenta (monochorionic) but have separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic). Due to vascular anastomoses in the shared placenta, blood can flow disproportionately between the twins. One twin (the donor) becomes hypovolemic and growth-restricted, while the other (the recipient) becomes hypervolemic and may develop polyhydramnios and heart failure. Therefore, TTTS occurs exclusively in MCDA pregnancies\r\n",

For a primigravida, the active phase of labor (where cervical dilation progresses more rapidly) typically begins around 6 cm dilation. At 4 cm, she is still in the latent phase of labor. The latent phase can be quite prolonged, especially in primigravidas, often lasting many hours without indicating abnormal labor progression. Given that she has only reached 4 cm after 10 hours, this is within the expected physiological range for the latent phase. The most appropriate management at this point is to continue to monitor her progress (wait and watch), provide supportive care, and allow labor to progress spontaneously without unnecessary intervention, assuming maternal and fetal conditions are reassuring.\r\n",

By approximately 4 to 5 days after fertilization, the developing embryo reaches the uterine cavity as a morula (a solid ball of cells) and then rapidly develops into a blastocyst. The blastocyst then floats freely in the uterine cavity for about 1-2 days before implantation begins. Therefore, the fertilized ovum, in its early developmental stages, arrives in the uterine cavity around 4-5 days post-fertilization.\r\n",

The fetal head presents with the occipitofrontal diameter as the engaging diameter. In this specific presentation, the part of the head that is just below the occiput (suboccipital region) and the frontal bone (forehead) become the presenting points for measurement, hence the diameter is called Suboccipitofrontal. This diameter measures approximately 10 cm and is larger than the suboccipitobregmatic diameter (which presents in a well-flexed head), making descent through the pelvis more challenging than with a well-flexed head.\r\n",

Warfarin crosses the placenta and poses a significant risk of fetal bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage during late pregnancy and labor. After 36 weeks, the fetus is viable and labor can occur at any time, so anticoagulation needs to be managed safely to minimize maternal thrombotic risk while preventing fetal complications.
