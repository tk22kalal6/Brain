Conversely, hyperechogenicity (brighter than surrounding tissue) is generally associated with benign lesions, such as some types of cysts or fibroadenomas, rather than malignant ones.",

The CSF profile in TBM commonly shows decreased glucose, increased protein, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. The CEMR image, while not explicitly described in detail in the prompt, often shows characteristic findings in TBM, such as basal meningeal enhancement and sometimes hydrocephalus or tuberculomas, due to the thick exudate that forms in the basal cisterns. This combination of clinical symptoms, CSF findings, and typical imaging features makes TBM the most probable diagnosis. ",

The technique exploits the ﬂuid which is present in the biliary and pancreatic ducts as an intrinsic contrast medium by acquiring the images using heavily T2 weighted sequences. Since the ﬂuid-ﬁlled structures in the abdomen have a long T2 relaxation time as compared to the surrounding soft tissue, these structures appear hyperintense against the surrounding non-ﬂuid-containing tissues on a heavily T2 weighted sequence and can easily be distinguished.",

It is more severe in upper lung zones of patients on pentamidine aerosol prophylaxis. Patients may have pneumatoceles that typically develop in the periphery of upper lobes. Curiously, pneumatoceles are only seen in those with HIV infection. Pneumocystic pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic fungal infection that often affects individuals with T-cell immunodeﬁciency. The causative organism has been renamed Pneumocystis jiroveci. The most common imaging manifestation is ground-glass opacities that are perihilar or diffuse. If untreated, PCP evolves into a consolidative appearance. Appropriately treated PCP (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or intravenous pentamidine) carries a very good prognosis with a 90% survival rate.",

The barium enema image likely shows the classic \"coiled spring\" appearance, which is pathognomonic for intussusception, where one segment of the intestine telescopes into another. This condition is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and young children, and a barium enema is often both diagnostic and therapeutic.",

This configuration must be shown in any series of the small intestine. There is no definite border between jejunum and ileum, however, more than half of the small bowel is ileum.\r\n\r\nThe mucosa of the small bowel is characterized by the existence of the valvulae conniventes (also referred to as Kerkrin valves or circular folds). These folds start from the second part of the duodenum, which has a greater number of them, and they decrease in number as the small bowel approaches the ileocecal valve. With gaseous distension of the bowel loops, they are never completely effaced in the jejunum but they may be effaced in the ileum.",
