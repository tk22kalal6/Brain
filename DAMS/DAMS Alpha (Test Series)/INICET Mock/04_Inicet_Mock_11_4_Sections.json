The neural fold is a key feature in the process of neurulation, where the neural plate folds to form the neural tube. The darkly stained, raised lateral edges on either side of the midline (as marked by the arrow) indicate the neural folds, which are moving towards each other to eventually fuse and form the neural tube. This structure is critical for the formation of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The neural folds are visible as the elevated edges of the neural groove, which is the central depression along the embryonic midline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/22(135).png\" style=\"height:502px; width:325px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stylopharyngeus muscle is the only muscle that passes between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscles. It originates from the styloid process of the temporal bone and travels inferiorly along with the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). As it descends, it slips between the superior and middle constrictors to insert into the posterior pharyngeal wall. This anatomical relationship is clinically important, especially in surgeries involving the pharynx and in understanding pathways for nerve blocks. The stylopharyngeus functions to elevate the pharynx during swallowing and speaking, contributing to the coordinated action of the pharyngeal muscles.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin B12 deficiency is the most likely cause of lower limb weakness in a post-gastrectomy patient. After gastrectomy, the stomach&rsquo;s ability to produce intrinsic factor&mdash;a glycoprotein essential for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum&mdash;is impaired. Over time, this leads to vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency can include paresthesias, numbness, and progressive weakness, especially in the lower limbs, due to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (affecting the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts). This can manifest as unsteady gait, spasticity, and weakness. Hematologic findings such as megaloblastic anemia may also be present, but neurological symptoms may precede or occur independently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/34(53).png\" style=\"height:379px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

The underlying defect in Barth syndrome is in the remodeling of cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipin is essential for optimal function of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial energy production. In Barth syndrome, mutations in the TAZ gene lead to abnormal cardiolipin composition, which disrupts mitochondrial structure and energy production, particularly in energy-demanding tissues like the heart and muscles. This explains the clinical presentation of cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness</p>\r\n",

The most common cause of FH is a mutation in the gene coding for the LDL receptor (LDLR). This receptor is responsible for clearing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles from the circulation by mediating their uptake into liver cells. A defect in the LDL receptor leads to reduced clearance of LDL, causing cholesterol to accumulate in the blood.

Phytanic acid is a type of branched-chain fatty acid that cannot be broken down properly without the enzyme phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, which is responsible for initiating alpha-oxidation.\r\n\r\n•   In Refsum disease, the inability to perform alpha-oxidation leads to the accumulation of phytanic acid in various tissues, including the nervous system, retina, and heart, leading to a variety of symptoms, including neurological issues, retinitis pigmentosa, sensorineural hearing loss, and cardiac arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\r\n\r\nB. Alpha oxidation in mitochondria and ER:\r\n•   The primary site of alpha-oxidation is in the peroxisomes, not in the mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This makes option B incorrect.\r\n\r\nC. Omega oxidation:\r\n•   Omega oxidation is another process related to fatty acid metabolism, but it involves the oxidation of fatty acids at the omega end (the terminal carbon of the chain), primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is not involved in the breakdown of phytanic acid.\r\n\r\nD. Beta oxidation:\r\n•   Beta oxidation occurs in the mitochondria and is responsible for the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units. However, Refsum disease specifically relates to the alpha oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids like phytanic acid, not the typical fatty acids involved in beta oxidation.",

The characteristic &quot;mousy&quot; or &quot;musty&quot; body odor seen in individuals with Phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, particularly phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine, which are excreted in sweat and urine.

While it is true that phenylketonuria leads to a decrease in tyrosine, and subsequently dopamine and noradrenaline (since tyrosine is a precursor for catecholamines), this biochemical change is not responsible for the mousy odor. The odor is purely due to the accumulation and excretion of aromatic phenylalanine metabolites, not due to the deficiency of downstream neurotransmitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/37(66).png\" style=\"height:223px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

The build-up of these ketoacids, particularly isoleucine&rsquo;s byproducts, is responsible for the distinctive sweet, burnt sugar-like odor in the urine. Early diagnosis and dietary management are crucial to prevent severe neurological damage.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nMost of the heat loss from the body occurs by radiation in the form of infrared heat waves, which is a type of electromagnetic wave. Heat waves radiate from all objects toward the body, and the body radiates heat waves to all surrounding objects. The reflective surface of the Mylar blanket prevents heat loss by reflecting infrared heat waves from the body back to the body, which causes the body to warm. At room temperature, 60% of the heat loss occurs by radiation, 22% by evaporation, 15% by conduction to air, and 3% by conduction to objects. Convection (i.e., air currents) can increase heat loss by removing the unstirred layer of air close to the skin.\r\n\r\n",

Their amplitudes and plateau phase durations are decreased by the sympathetic &amp; in this case sympathetic agonist. Decreased slow-wave activity decreases the frequency of spike potential development. This decreases GI smooth muscle contractions. Smooth muscle membrane potential changes are mainly driven by calcium flux instead of sodium flux. Hence, an L-type calcium channel agonist stimulates excitation contraction coupling and would aggravate the patient&rsquo;s contractions. Acetylcholine (in this case, a drug that increases its lifetime) increases the amplitude and duration of GI slow waves, which increases the frequency of spike potentials and consequently GI smooth muscle contraction.

When a na&iuml;ve T cell recognizes an antigen presented by an antigen-presenting cell (APC) via the MHC&ndash;TCR interaction, this signal alone is not sufficient for full T cell activation. A second signal is needed &mdash; the co-stimulatory signal &mdash; which is provided when CD28 on the T cell binds to B7 molecules (CD80/CD86) on the APC. This co-stimulatory interaction is essential for the full activation, proliferation, and survival of T cells. Without this second signal, T cells become anergic (non-responsive), ensuring that they are only activated in appropriate immune contexts. Hence, CD28 is indispensable for the proper initiation of the adaptive immune response</span></span></p>\r\n",

These neuroendocrine cells are responsible for secreting calcitonin, a hormone involved in calcium regulation. In MTC, the excess calcitonin secreted by tumor cells can aggregate into amyloid deposits, which are visible histologically in the stroma of the tumor using Congo red staining, showing apple-green birefringence under polarized light. This unique feature helps differentiate medullary carcinoma from other types of thyroid cancers.

The pure tone audiometry (PTA) shows a low-frequency hearing loss (noted by the downward sloping pattern in the low frequencies that improves at higher frequencies), which is a hallmark finding in early endolymphatic hydrops (often seen in Meniere&#39;s disease). The hearing loss typically fluctuates, and the vertigo episodes can last from 20 minutes to several hours, matching the description. Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) also accompanies the condition. Hence, the clinical picture along with the audiogram strongly points toward endolymphatic hydrops.</p>\r\n",

It commonly affects the nasal mucosa and presents as a reddish, friable, polypoidal mass that bleeds easily on touch, exactly like in this case. The history of frequent bathing in ponds is an important clue, as this infection is often associated with exposure to stagnant water. Histopathology reveals multiple sporangia in various stages of maturation surrounded by a dense inflammatory infiltrate, which is the hallmark diagnostic feature seen in the provided microscopic image. Clinically, the presence of a mass studded with white spots (representing mature sporangia) hanging in the nasal cavity is characteristic for rhinosporidiosis.</p>\r\n",

One of the hallmark clinical findings is the enlargement of the tonsils, which appear orange or yellowish due to the deposition of cholesterol esters within the reticuloendothelial cells. The image shows distinctly enlarged, orange-colored tonsils, which is classic for Tangier disease. This color change is unique and helps differentiate it from other causes of tonsillar pathology. Patients may also have hepatosplenomegaly, peripheral neuropathy, and premature cardiovascular disease due to lipid abnormalities.</p>\r\n",

Since the vertical axis has less power and is associated with <strong>more curvature</strong> (i.e., more positive refractive error), the astigmatism is <strong>&quot;with the rule&quot;</strong> (the axis of the greatest power is aligned vertically).

The presence of posterior staphyloma is a hallmark of high myopia and can contribute to various complications, including macular degeneration and retinal tears.</p>\r\n",

Approximately 90&ndash;95% of patients carry the HLA-DQ2 haplotype, and most of the remaining patients carry HLA-DQ8. These genes encode specific MHC class II molecules that present gluten-derived peptides to T cells, initiating the autoimmune response in susceptible individuals. HLA-DQ6 and DQ11, on the other hand, are not associated with celiac disease and their presence would typically argue against the diagnosis in most cases.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, gradually leading to decreased thyroid hormone production. In early stages of the disease, thyroid hormone levels may remain within the normal range, but TSH can be mildly elevated, indicating that the pituitary gland is compensating for subtle declines in thyroid function. The thyroid may appear enlarged and rubbery on palpation due to lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis. The absence of tenderness helps distinguish it from other causes of thyroid enlargement, like subacute thyroiditis.

Intrinsic factor is essential for the absorption of Vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. Without it, even if dietary intake is adequate, B12 cannot be absorbed efficiently, leading to deficiency over time. Vitamin B12 deficiency primarily affects the nervous system and can present as <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord</strong>, which includes symptoms like <strong>lower limb weakness, numbness, tingling, and impaired coordination</strong> due to demyelination of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord. Hematological manifestations like megaloblastic anemia may also occur but neurological symptoms can present even in the absence of anemia. Since B12 stores in the liver can last for a couple of years, these symptoms often appear gradually and are a late complication of gastrectomy.</span></span></h3>\r\n",

Brodie Trendelenburg Test: This test is used to assess saphenofemoral valve competence. The patient is asked to lie down with the legs elevated, and then they are asked to stand while the veins are observed. If the veins fill rapidly as the patient stands, it suggests incompetence of the saphenofemoral valve.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>B. Morrissey&rsquo;s Test: This is another test used to evaluate venous insufficiency, particularly in the case of saphenofemoral incompetence. It involves applying a tourniquet to the thigh and assessing whether the veins empty, indicating valve function.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>C.

If a drug reduces mortality but does not cure the disease, it means patients live longer with the disease. As a result, more people remain in the population with the condition over time, thereby increasing the prevalence.

Atypical antipsychotics, including <strong>clozapine</strong>, <strong>olanzapine</strong>, <strong>risperidone</strong>, and others, primarily act by blocking the <strong>5HT2A receptors</strong> in the brain. This antagonism is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of these drugs in managing <strong>schizophrenia</strong> and other psychotic disorders. The blockade of <strong>5HT2A receptors</strong> helps modulate the effects of serotonin, which plays a critical role in mood regulation and psychosis. This action is also thought to contribute to the lower incidence of side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), compared to typical antipsychotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Psychi3.jpg\" style=\"height:127px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

Folate, or <strong>vitamin B9</strong>, plays a crucial role in the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which are involved in regulating mood. Low levels of folate have been linked to <strong>treatment-resistant depression</strong>. In fact, studies have shown that <strong>folate supplementation</strong> can enhance the effectiveness of antidepressant medications. When folate is deficient, it can impair neurotransmitter synthesis and hinder the body&rsquo;s ability to respond well to antidepressant treatments, making depression more challenging to manage.</p>\r\n",

Second-generation SADs, such as the LMA ProSeal or i-gel, are designed with a separate gastric drain channel that allows for the passage of an orogastric tube. This feature helps to vent gastric contents, reduces the risk of gastric insufflation, and offers a degree of protection against aspiration. This makes them safer in scenarios where gastric insufflation is a concern, such as during positive pressure ventilation. The ability to decompress the stomach is especially useful in longer procedures or in patients at higher risk of regurgitation, making this feature a significant clinical advancement.</span></span></p>\r\n",

As a result, there is insufficient stimulation of the testes, leading to low testosterone production and impaired spermatogenesis. This results in azoospermia (absence of sperm) or severe oligospermia (very low sperm count) due to inadequate FSH stimulation of Sertoli cells and LH stimulation of Leydig cells. Low LH and low FSH levels are hallmark features of this condition because the problem originates at the hypothalamic or pituitary level.

The common findings include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A. Normal calcium: In early stages of nutritional rickets, calcium levels may be normal because the body can compensate by mobilizing calcium from the bones.

High PTH: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is often elevated in nutritional rickets.

It involves inflammation of the blood vessels and can lead to serious complications, especially in the coronary arteries. The typical features of Kawasaki disease include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>B. Strawberry tongue: The strawberry tongue is a classic finding in Kawasaki disease. It is characterized by a red, swollen tongue with enlarged papillae, giving it a &quot;strawberry&quot; appearance. This is a sign of mucosal involvement, which is one of the diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>C. Polymorphic rash: A polymorphic rash is another common feature of Kawasaki disease. The rash can take various forms, including maculopapular, urticarial, or erythematous, and is often seen in the acute phase of the illness. It typically affects the trunk and limbs.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>D.

Tuberculosis of the spine primarily affects the area near the intervertebral disc (paradiscal region). The infection typically begins in the vertebral body and spreads to the adjacent disc. As a result, the vertebral body collapses, leading to deformities such as kyphosis (hunchback) and sometimes spinal instability. This paradiscal involvement is characteristic of the slow, progressive nature of the infection, which can involve multiple vertebrae over time and is often seen in individuals with a weakened immune system or untreated tuberculosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/5(670).png\" style=\"height:324px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",
