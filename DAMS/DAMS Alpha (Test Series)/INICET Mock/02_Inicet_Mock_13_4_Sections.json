Since MTC develops early in life, prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended in RET-positive children, but the timing depends on the type of RET mutation. For MEN 2A, the standard recommendation is before the age of 5 years, as MTC can develop in early childhood but usually not in infancy.\r\n\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nA. Within 1 year: This recommendation applies to MEN 2B, which is more aggressive, with MTC developing in infancy; hence thyroidectomy should be done within the first year of life.\r\n\r\nC. At Puberty: Too late for MEN 2A, as MTC may already be established by then.\r\n\r\nD. Before 25 years: Far too delayed; risk of advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma would be very high.",

It is particularly useful in the prevention of thromboembolic events like ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndromes, and post-stent thrombosis. In this patient with thromboembolic stroke, clopidogrel helps prevent further platelet aggregation and recurrent events.\r\n\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nA. Warfarin: An oral anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X). It does not act on platelets or the P2Y12 receptor.\r\n\r\nB. Aminocaproic acid: An antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits plasminogen activation. It is used in bleeding disorders, not in preventing stroke.\r\n\r\nC.

Methemoglobin (Fe³⁺) has a high affinity for cyanide and so sequesters cyanide away from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (complex IV). By binding cyanide, methemoglobin prevents cyanide from inhibiting cellular respiration, thereby partially reversing the toxic block of oxidative phosphorylation. This is the basis for using nitrites (amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite) as part of an antidotal methemoglobin–forming kit in acute cyanide poisoning (used carefully because methemoglobinemia itself impairs O₂ delivery).",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nThis is type I choledochal cyst which is the commonest type (>85%) Five major types are (Todani): \r\n\r\n• Type I cysts are the most common and represent 80-90% of choledochal cysts. They consist of saccular or fusiform dilatations of the common bile duct, which involve either a segment of the duct or the entire duct. \r\n\r\n• Type II choledochal cysts appear as an isolated diverticulum protruding from the wall of the common bile duct. \r\n\r\n• Type III choledochal cysts arise from the intraduodenal portion of the common bile duct (choledochocele). The surgical\r\nmanagement for each choledochal cyst type is described as follows: \r\n\r\n• Type I: Complete excision of cyst followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. \r\n\r\n• Type II: Complete excision of the dilated diverticulum comprising a type II choledochal cyst; the resultant defect in the common bile duct is\r\nclosed over a T-tube \r\n\r\n• Type III (choledochocele): choledochoceles measuring 3 cm or less can be treated effectively with endoscopic sphincterotomy, whereas lesions larger than 3 cm are excised surgically via a transduodenal approach. \r\n\r\n• Type IV: Complete excision of the dilated extrahepatic duct, followed by a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy to restore continuity. \r\n\r\n• Type V (Caroli disease): Hepatic lobectomy for disease limited to one hepatic lobe (left lobe usually affected); patients with bilobar disease manifesting signs of liver failure, biliary cirrhosis, or portal hypertension may require liver transplantation \r\n\r\n• Lilly technique: When the cyst adheres densely to the portal vein secondary to long-standing inflammatory reaction, it may not be possible to perform a complete, full-thickness excision of the cyst; the Lilly technique allows the serosal surface of the duct to be left adhering to\r\nthe portal vein, while the mucosa of the cyst wall is obliterated by curettage or cautery—theoretically, this removes the risk of malignant transformation in that segment of the duct",

Because the lumen of the right colon is wide and the contents are liquid, obstruction is uncommon. Instead, the tumor often causes chronic occult blood loss, leading to iron deficiency anemia. On examination, a palpable right iliac fossa (RIF) mass may be found due to the bulky lesion.\r\n\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nB. Alternate constipation and diarrhea: More characteristic of left-sided colonic carcinoma, where the lumen is narrow, leading to partial obstruction and altered bowel habits.\r\n\r\nC. Chronic obstruction: Again, more common in left colon cancers (especially sigmoid), since the feces are solid and lumen narrower.\r\n\r\nD.

In Bipolar cautery TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate), normal saline can be used as the irrigation fluid because the current is confined between the two electrodes of the bipolar loop, preventing current dispersion through the patient’s body. This eliminates the need for non-conductive solutions (e.g., glycine, sorbitol) used in monopolar cautery, which carry the risk of TURP syndrome (dilutional hyponatremia, fluid overload, CNS toxicity). Thus, bipolar TURP significantly reduces the risk of this complication.\r\n\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nA. Bigger size prostate can be removed: Not a specific advantage of bipolar cautery. Prostate size management depends more on surgical technique than on type of cautery.\r\n\r\nB. Less operative time: Operative time is generally similar in both monopolar and bipolar TURP; choice of cautery doesn’t significantly shorten surgery.\r\n\r\nC. Less bleeding: Both monopolar and bipolar achieve good hemostasis; bleeding reduction is not the primary distinguishing factor.",

Hematomas of the duodenal wall will often resolve without intervention\r\nand are an issue only if they cause a gastric outlet obstruction.

If the duodenal obstruction persists after\r\napproximately 14 days, operative exploration is warranted to evacuate hematoma, evaluate for\r\nperforation, stricture, or associated pancreatic injury. Hematomas will frequently decompress\r\nspontaneously during mobilization of the duodenum and the intestinal wall should then be evaluated\r\nfor injury. Duodenal hematomas identified incidentally during laparotomy should not be intentionally\r\nopened unless there is a concern for full-thickness injury.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/13621580.png\"></p>",

The\r\ndepth of the lesion appears to correlate with the prognosis of the patient, and nodular melanoma is\r\nless often amenable to definitive treatment than is the superficial spreading variety. Lentigo maligna\r\nmelanoma: 10% are this type. Lentigo MM is most common in elderly people and commonest on the\r\nface. This type of melanoma grows very slowly.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nPentazocine is a mixed opioid agonist-antagonist: it acts as a kappa (κ) receptor agonist producing analgesia, but at mu (μ) receptors, it acts as a full antagonist. In a morphine-dependent patient, pentazocine can displace morphine from μ receptors, leading to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sweating, and tachycardia. This occurs because it blocks the receptor while providing no full μ receptor-mediated effect.\r\n\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nB. A partial agonist action: Partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine at μ receptors) activate the receptor partially, producing some analgesia with lower risk of respiratory depression; pentazocine is not a partial agonist at μ.\r\n\r\nC. A full agonist action: Full agonists (e.g., morphine, fentanyl) fully activate μ receptors to produce maximal analgesia and euphoria; pentazocine does not produce full μ receptor effects.\r\n\r\nD. An inverse agonist action: Inverse agonists (theoretical concept in some receptor systems) produce effects opposite to agonist stimulation; pentazocine is not an inverse agonist at μ receptors.",

This makes it inadequate for distinguishing between a septate and bicornuate uterus, as both anomalies can present with a divided endometrial cavity. The key distinction between these anomalies lies in the external fundal contour: flat or convex in septate uterus vs. concave (greater than 10 mm indentation) in bicornuate uterus. Since hysteroscopy cannot assess this, it cannot differentiate between the two anomalies reliably, making it the incorrect/inadequate modality for differentiation.",

While\r\nthe atypical squamous cells seen in the Pap smear are not directly caused by estrogen (they are\r\ntypically associated with HPV infection or other irritants), the hyperestrogenic state created by a\r\ngranulosa cell tumor can lead to changes in the squamous cells of the lower genital tract, which\r\nmight be the indirect association the question is highlighting.",

It originates from the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and projects to spinal motor neurons to adjust limb and trunk muscles in response to changes in head position.

Dysfunction or temporary overstimulation can lead to imbalance and unsteady gait.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA. Corticospinal tract:\r\nThis tract is primarily responsible for voluntary motor control of limb muscles, not automatic balance adjustments.\r\n\r\nB. Corticobulbar tract:\r\nThis tract controls voluntary movements of cranial muscles, such as facial and jaw muscles. It does not maintain balance.\r\n\r\nD.

This extended period is necessary because isotretinoin has a long half-life and can remain in the body for an extended time. If a woman were to become pregnant during this window, the drug's teratogenic effects could still cause severe and life-threatening birth defects in the fetus. This strict recommendation is a key component of the iPLEDGE program, which is a risk management program designed to prevent fetal exposure to isotretinoin.",

The ductus arteriosis typically closes in the first few hours of life; thus, these children will develop their cyanosis in the same time frame. \r\n\r\nProstaglandin E1 will help keep the ductus patent until a surgical procedure can be performed.

Thus, it is unusual for patients to manifest signs of adrenal insufficiency such as hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Approximately 65% of patients become hypertensive, although this can take several years to develop. Hypertension is probably a consequence of elevated levels of deoxycorticosterone,, which has mineralocorticoid activity. Infants may transiently develop signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency after treatment with hydrocortisone is instituted. \r\n\r\nThis is presumably from sudden suppression of deoxycorticosterone secretion in a patient with atrophy of the zona glomerulosa caused by chronic suppression of rennin activity. All signs and symptoms of androgen excess that are found in 21- hydroxylase deficiency may also occur in 11β-hydroxylase deficiency.",

Traumatic childhood memories are typically not accessible to conscious awareness, making the unconscious the key part responsible.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\nA.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nHistory of post Dural puncture headache\r\n\r\nA history of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is not a contraindication for performing an epidural block. While PDPH can be a complication of spinal anesthesia, it does not necessarily preclude a patient from having an epidural block in the future. The etiology of PDPH involves a dural puncture, which is not typically associated with epidural anesthesia as it involves placing a needle into the epidural space rather than puncturing the dura. In fact, for patients with a history of PDPH from spinal anesthesia, an epidural block may sometimes be preferred as it carries a lower risk of dural puncture.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nOption (A): Patient refusal\r\nPatient refusal is a clear contraindication to any medical procedure, including epidural anesthesia. If a patient refuses to undergo the procedure, it is not ethically or legally permissible to proceed. Consent is a crucial component of patient care, and performing any intervention without consent can lead to legal consequences, as well as compromise patient trust and safety.\r\n\r\nOption (B): Infection at the site of injection\r\nInfection at the site of injection is an absolute contraindication to performing an epidural block. If there is an infection at or near the proposed injection site (such as a skin infection or abscess), the risk of introducing bacteria into the epidural space is significantly increased. This could result in serious complications, such as epidural abscess or meningitis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, an infection at the site must be treated or resolved before proceeding with an epidural.\r\n\r\nOption (C): INR > 1.5\r\nAn INR greater than 1.5 is a contraindication to epidural anesthesia because it indicates an increased risk of bleeding. If the INR is elevated, there is a higher likelihood of bleeding complications, such as epidural hematoma, which can compress the spinal cord and lead to permanent neurological damage. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that the INR is within a safe range (generally less than 1.5) before performing an epidural block.",

If it is not treated, the vast majority of these infants would not survive the neonatal period. Hypoxemia is usually moderate to severe, depending on the degree of atrial level shunting and whether the ductus is partially open or totally closed. Infants who remain severely hypoxic or acidotic despite prostaglandin infusion should undergo Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy. \r\n\r\nA successful Rashkind atrial septostomy should result in a rise in PaO2 to 35-50 mm Hg and elimination of any pressure gradient across the atrial septum. Some patients with TGA and VSD may require balloon atrial septostomy because of poor mixing, even though the VSD is large. If the VSD associated with d-TGA is small, the clinical lit manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment are similar to those described previously for transposition with an intact ventricular\r\nseptum.\r\n\r\nWhen the VSD is large and not restrictive to ventricular ejection, significant mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood usually occurs and clinical manifestations of cardiac failure are seen. The degree of cyanosis may be subtle and sometimes may not be recognized until an oxygen saturation measurement is performed. \r\n\r\nThe physiology of I- TGA is quite different from that of d-TGA. The double inversion of the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial relationships result in desaturated right atrial blood appropriately flowing to the lungs and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood appropriately flowing to the aorta. The circulation is thus physiologically “corrected.” Without other defects, the\r\nhemodynamics would be nearly normal.",

When looking at a white light source, the maddox rod in front of one eye causes the light to be perceived as a bright, colored line. The line's orientation is perpendicular to the cylindrical grooves.\r\n\r\n•  Test Setup: The maddox rod is typically placed in front of one eye, and the patient focuses on a distant or near light source.\r\n\r\n•  Orthotropia (Perfect Eye Alignment): An orthotropic patient is one whose eyes are perfectly aligned, meaning there is no latent or manifest strabismus (eye misalignment).\r\n\r\n•  Patient's Perspective: In the image, the maddox rod is held with its grooves in a vertical orientation in front of the right eye. This causes the right eye to see a horizontal red line. The left eye, which is looking directly at the light source, sees a white dot. Since the patient is orthotropic, their eyes are aligned, and they will see the horizontal line pass directly through the central white dot. Therefore, the patient will see a horizontal line from the right eye and a dot in the center, which are superimposed.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nMydriasis\r\n\r\nMydriasis (dilation of the pupil) is not a typical sign of a successful stellate ganglion block. A stellate ganglion block is performed to block sympathetic nerves and is generally expected to result in a series of signs associated with sympathetic blockade, particularly on the ipsilateral side of the body. However, mydriasis is not one of these signs. In fact, the blockage of the sympathetic fibers should result in miosis (constriction of the pupil) due to the unopposed parasympathetic activity. Mydriasis, or pupil dilation, can occur due to other factors such as certain medications or neural damage but is not an expected effect of a stellate ganglion block.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nOption (A): Ptosis\r\nPtosis (drooping of the eyelid) is a common sign of a successful stellate ganglion block. The sympathetic fibers that are blocked by the stellate ganglion block supply the muscles that elevate the eyelid (the levator palpebrae muscle). Therefore, the loss of sympathetic input can cause ptosis, which is often used as an indicator of successful blockade.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Guttmann’s sign\r\nGuttmann’s sign refers to the warmness and redness of the skin over the affected side of the face following a stellate ganglion block. It is a characteristic sign that indicates successful blockade of the sympathetic nerves. This is because sympathetic blockade leads to vasodilation, which causes the skin to become warm and flushed.\r\n\r\nOption (D): Decreased sweating over the face\r\nDecreased sweating over the face is another typical sign of a successful stellate ganglion block. The sympathetic nerves that innervate sweat glands in the face are blocked, resulting in reduced sweating on the affected side. This is considered one of the hallmark signs of a successful block, along with the other signs such as ptosis and Guttmann's sign.",

ACIOLs are typically rigid, single-piece lenses with distinctive haptics (the arms that hold the lens in place). These haptics are designed to rest in the angle of the anterior chamber, which provides support and fixation for the lens. ACIOLs are often used when the posterior capsule, which normally supports a posterior chamber IOL, is damaged or absent.\r\n• Query successful\r\nThe image displays an intraocular lens (IOL) with large, rigid haptics designed to be placed in the anterior chamber of the eye. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Anterior chamber.\r\nExplanation\r\nAn anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) is an artificial lens designed to be implanted in the front part of the eye, in the space between the iris and the cornea. ACIOLs are typically rigid, single-piece lenses with distinctive haptics (the arms that hold the lens in place). These haptics are designed to rest in the angle of the anterior chamber, which provides support and fixation for the lens. ACIOLs are often used when the posterior capsule, which normally supports a posterior chamber IOL, is damaged or absent.\r\nOther Options\r\n• A. Posterior chamber: Posterior chamber IOLs (PCIOLs) are the most common type of IOL used in cataract surgery today. They are placed behind the iris, within the capsular bag, and typically have a different, less rigid haptic design.\r\n• C. Toric: Toric IOLs are a type of lens designed to correct astigmatism. The distinguishing feature of a toric lens is not its shape, but rather the presence of alignment markers on the optic to ensure proper orientation to correct the astigmatism. They can be either anterior or posterior chamber lenses.\r\n• D. Scleral fixated: Scleral-fixated IOLs are a type of posterior chamber lens that is sutured directly to the sclera of the eye. This method is used when there is insufficient capsular support for a standard PCIOL and when an ACIOL is not a good option. While they have haptics, they are designed differently to accommodate sutures, rather than the broad, prominent haptics seen in the image.\r\n",

In this scenario, the rescuer is performing chest compressions at 90/min, which is below the recommended rate.

Continue the original pattern of CPR\r\nThis is incorrect because the current compression rate of 90/min is too slow. Adequate circulation during CPR depends on maintaining the recommended compression rate. Sticking to 90/min may result in inadequate perfusion to the brain and heart.\r\n\r\nB. Increase the duration of compression\r\nThis is incorrect because the duration of chest compressions is not a focus in CPR. Instead, the emphasis is on achieving the correct rate (100–120/min) and depth (at least 2 inches) of compressions. Increasing the duration of each compression may interfere with maintaining the appropriate compression rate.\r\n\r\nD.

The direction of the tip is indicated by the hook outside.\r\n\r\nRose's sinus douching cannula is a medical instrument primarily used for irrigation or cleansing of the sinuses during certain procedures. It is used to irrigate the sinus cavities, ensuring that they are cleared of debris or infected material.\r\n\r\nLet’s break down the options:\r\n\r\nA. Intranasal antrostomy:\r\nIn intranasal antrostomy, a surgical procedure is performed to create an opening between the maxillary sinus and the nasal cavity, usually to allow for drainage or to treat chronic sinusitis. Rose’s sinus douching cannula is often used for irrigation after such procedures to help cleanse the sinus and ensure proper drainage.

Caldwell-Luc operation:\r\nThe Caldwell-Luc operation is a procedure used to access the maxillary sinus through the maxillary bone to treat conditions like chronic sinusitis, remove polyps, or drain abscesses. Rose's sinus douching cannula is often used in post-operative care to irrigate the sinus, ensuring that it is clear of any residual material. Hence, the cannula would also be used in this procedure.\r\n\r\nC. Trephination:\r\nTrephination refers to a procedure where a hole is made in the skull or a sinus to relieve pressure, often for conditions like abscesses, or to allow drainage. However, this procedure does not typically involve irrigation through a cannula like Rose's sinus douching cannula, especially if the procedure is focused on draining a fluid collection. Therefore, the cannula would not be used in this procedure.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n Lowe syndrome\r\nLowe syndrome, also known as oculocerebrorenal syndrome, is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the OCRL gene, which affects the function of a protein called inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase. The clinical triad of Lowe syndrome includes:\r\n1. Ocular abnormalities: Congenital cataracts are almost always present at birth or shortly after. Glaucoma, characterized by high intraocular pressure, is also a very common feature. The image provided, showing a congenital cataract, aligns with this.\r\n2. Neurological abnormalities: This includes intellectual disability and, as seen in the question, developmental delay and hypotonia (low muscle tone).\r\n3. Renal (kidney) abnormalities: The patient develops renal tubular dysfunction, leading to a condition similar to Fanconi syndrome.\r\nThe combination of hypotonia, developmental delay, glaucoma, and congenital cataracts presented in the question strongly points to Lowe syndrome.\r\n\r\nOther Options\r\n•  A. Alport syndrome: Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting collagen in the kidneys, ears, and eyes. While it can cause ocular abnormalities like anterior lenticonus, which is a cone-shaped lens, it does not typically present with the hypotonia and developmental delay seen in this case. The key features are progressive hearing loss and kidney disease.\r\n•  C. Galactosemia: Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to process galactose. It can cause cataracts, but these are typically described as \"oil droplet\" cataracts and are often reversible if a galactose-free diet is initiated early. It does not present with the hallmark neurological and renal features of Lowe syndrome.\r\n•  D. Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV): This is a congenital developmental anomaly of the eye caused by the failure of the primary vitreous to regress. It is usually unilateral and presents with leukocoria (a white pupillary reflex) and a small, underdeveloped eye (microphthalmia). It is a localized ocular disorder and does not cause systemic features like hypotonia and developmental delay.\r\n",

It is responsible for closing the eyelids, a function known as palpebral fasciculation. Its location is superficial, lying directly beneath the skin of the eyelid. In the diagram, structure 1 is shown as a large, concentric muscle mass that is continuous around the eye, which is the characteristic anatomy of the orbicularis oculi.\r\nOther Options \r\n• A. Levator muscle: The levator palpebrae superioris muscle (marked as 4) is the primary muscle responsible for elevating the upper eyelid. It is located deep within the eyelid, above the other structures.\r\n• C. Tarsus: The tarsus (marked as 3) is a dense connective tissue plate that provides structural support and shape to the eyelid. It is located just deep to the orbicularis muscle.\r\n• D. Muller muscle: The Muller muscle, or superior tarsal muscle (marked as 2), is a small, smooth muscle that helps to maintain the elevated position of the eyelid. It is located deep to the levator muscle and inserts onto the tarsus.\r\n",

The incorrect part of the statement is the claim that it originates from the posterior pharyngeal wall and is arterial. Unlike Kiesselbach’s plexus, which is the main site for anterior epistaxis and is supplied by branches of the external and internal carotid arteries, Woodruff’s plexus is primarily involved in posterior epistaxis, which is often venous in nature.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Anterior epistaxis is more common \r\nAnterior epistaxis accounts for 90% of nosebleeds, commonly originating from Little’s area (Kiesselbach’s plexus). It is usually mild, self-limiting, and more common in children and young adults due to trauma (e.g., nose-picking) or dry air.\r\n\r\nC. In young persons, venous bleeding is more common \r\nIn young individuals, epistaxis often results from minor trauma or mucosal irritation, leading to venous oozing rather than brisk arterial bleeding. Since the anterior nasal mucosa is highly vascularized, small venous bleeds are common in this age group.\r\n\r\nD. Posterior epistaxis usually occurs after 40 years \r\nPosterior epistaxis is more common in older adults (typically above 40 years) and is often associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, or coagulopathies. It is usually more severe than anterior epistaxis and originates from branches of the sphenopalatine artery, requiring more intensive management, including posterior nasal packing or arterial embolization",

Astigmatism.\r\nExplanation\r\nBifocal glasses contain two different lens powers in a single lens: a top segment for viewing distant objects and a bottom segment for viewing close-up objects. These lenses are designed to correct conditions where both near and far vision are impaired.\r\n\r\n• A. Presbyopia: This is the most common indication for bifocals. Presbyopia is the age-related loss of the eye's ability to focus on close objects, which bifocals are specifically designed to correct.\r\n\r\n• B. Pediatric pseudophakia: This refers to a child who has had a cataract removed and replaced with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). Since the eye's natural lens, which provides accommodation (the ability to change focus), has been removed, a bifocal is necessary to provide the child with a clear focus for near vision tasks like reading and writing.\r\n\r\n• C. Accommodative esotropia: This is a type of eye misalignment where the eyes turn inward (esotropia) due to excessive accommodative effort. Bifocals can reduce this effort by providing a separate lens power for near work, thereby helping to control the inward eye turn.\r\n\r\nOther Options \r\n\r\n• D. Astigmatism: Astigmatism is a refractive error caused by an uneven curvature of the cornea or lens, which causes light to focus on multiple points instead of a single one on the retina. It is corrected with a cylindrical lens that counteracts the uneven curvature, not a bifocal lens. A patient with astigmatism may also need bifocals to correct presbyopia, but the bifocal itself does not correct the astigmatism.\r\n",

Sensorineural Deafness \r\nMeniere’s disease leads to progressive sensorineural hearing loss due to damage to the cochlea. Initially, hearing loss is fluctuating and affects low frequencies, but as the disease progresses, it may become permanent and involve all frequencies.\r\n\r\nB. Vertigo \r\nEpisodic vertigo is a hallmark of Meniere’s disease. The vertigo episodes are spontaneous, last from 20 minutes to several hours, and are often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

Greenstick fracture: This is an incomplete fracture where one side of the bone is broken and the other is bent. It occurs most often in children whose bones are softer, not in adults sustaining a direct, high-force blow.\r\n\r\nC. Galeazzi fracture: This is a fracture of the distal third of the radius associated with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) at the wrist. It involves the radius, not just an isolated ulnar shaft fracture.\r\n\r\nD. Monteggia fracture: This is a fracture of the proximal ulna (upper shaft) associated with dislocation of the radial head at the elbow. It involves a severe injury to both bones (or a joint dislocation), which is not an isolated ulnar shaft fracture.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\nExplanation\r\nKlippel-Feil syndrome is a congenital skeletal anomaly that results from a failure of segmentation of the cervical somites, leading to the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae. The cardinal features of this condition, often referred to as the classical triad, are:\r\n• Short webbed neck: This is a key external sign resulting from the shortened cervical spine.\r\n• Low posterior hairline: This is a consequence of the shortened neck and is a defining feature.\r\n• Decreased movements at neck: The fusion of the vertebrae severely restricts the neck's range of motion.\r\nOther Options\r\n• A. Short webbed neck, C. Decreased movements at neck, and D. Low posterior hairline:\r\nThese are the three defining features of the classical triad of Klippel-Feil syndrome. They are all correct features of the condition and are therefore not the answer to the question, which asks for the exception.\r\n• B. Short stature:\r\nWhile some patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome may also have short stature, it is not considered a part of the classical triad. The syndrome's hallmark features are specifically related to the fusion of the cervical vertebrae.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nExplanation\r\n• Hard Exudates: The yellowish, waxy-looking deposits scattered across the retina in the image are hard exudates. They are lipid- and protein-rich deposits that leak from damaged retinal capillaries due to chronic edema. They are a sign of diabetic macular edema and are also seen in other conditions like hypertensive retinopathy.\r\n• Outer Plexiform Layer: Hard exudates are characteristically found in the outer plexiform layer of the retina. This is because this layer contains the nerve endings of the photoreceptors, which create a basket-like structure (Henle's layer) that traps the fluid and deposits, leading to their classic appearance.\r\n\r\nOther options:\r\nSoft Exudates: Soft exudates, also known as cotton wool spots, appear as fluffy, white patches with indistinct borders. They are not waxy like the deposits in the image. They are caused by ischemic infarction of the nerve fiber layer.\r\nNerve Fiber Layer: Soft exudates (cotton wool spots) are located in the nerve fiber layer, while hard exudates are in the outer plexiform layer.\r\nStar-shaped deposits: The \"star\" shape seen in the image, also a collection of hard exudates, is a classic sign of severe macular edema. This star shape occurs because the fluid and exudates are trapped and spread within the basket-like structure of Henle's layer in the outer plexiform layer.\r\n",
