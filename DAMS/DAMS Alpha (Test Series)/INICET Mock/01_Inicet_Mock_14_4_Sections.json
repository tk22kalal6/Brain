      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nPosterior interosseous nerve\r\nThe posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a branch of the radial nerve that innervates the extensor muscles of the fingers (extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, and extensor digiti minimi). A lesion of the PIN leads to finger drop, where the patient is unable to extend the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. However, the wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis), which are innervated by the radial nerve proximal to the PIN, remain functional. This preserves wrist extension, resulting in finger drop without wrist drop.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Responses:\r\n(A) Radial nerve in the radial groove\r\nA lesion of the radial nerve in the radial groove would result in both wrist drop and finger drop. This is because the radial nerve supplies the wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis) before it divides into its branches. Damage at this level affects both finger and wrist extension, making this option incorrect.\r\n\r\n(C) Anterior interosseous nerve\r\nThe anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) is a branch of the median nerve that innervates the flexor pollicis longus, the lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus, and the pronator quadratus. A lesion here would cause weakness in finger flexion (specifically at the distal interphalangeal joints of the index and middle fingers) and thumb flexion, but not finger or wrist extension. This makes it unrelated to finger drop.\r\n\r\n(D) Ulnar nerve behind medial epicondyle\r\nThe ulnar nerve innervates muscles involved in fine motor control of the hand and some flexors of the forearm. A lesion of the ulnar nerve causes a claw hand deformity and weakness in ulnar-sided hand movements but does not affect finger or wrist extension. Therefore, it does not cause finger drop.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) \r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is strongly supported by two lines of evidence:\r\n1. Classic Clinical/Radiological Presentation\r\nThe patient's presentation of hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable abdominal mass is the historical \"classic triad\" for a large, advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). Clear cell RCC (CCRCC) is the most common histological subtype of RCC (accounting for ≈ 70% - 80% of cases) and is the most likely diagnosis when this triad is present in an elderly male.\r\n\r\n2. Pathognomonic Histology\r\nThe microscopic image shows the characteristic features of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma:\r\n\"Clear Cells\": The tumor cells have abundant, pale, or empty-looking cytoplasm. This \"clear\" appearance is an artifact of routine tissue processing, where the high content of lipids (fat) and glycogen within the cytoplasm is washed out.\r\n\r\nNests/Cords: The clear cells are arranged in characteristic nests, cords, or alveolar (sac-like) patterns.\r\nDelicate Vasculature: The nests of cells are separated by a fine, delicate network of thin-\r\nwalled blood vessels (visible as the small, dark lines separating the clear cell clusters). This rich, delicate vasculature is a key feature related to the high vascularity of these tumors.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nGenitofemoral nerve.\r\n\r\nThe rectus sheath is a fibrous structure formed by the aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles, which encloses the rectus abdominis muscle and other associated structures. The genitofemoral nerve is not contained within the rectus sheath. It originates from the L1 and L2 spinal nerves and passes through the anterior surface of the psoas major muscle before splitting into two branches: the genital branch (which travels to the scrotum in males and the labia majora in females) and the femoral branch (which supplies the skin of the anterior thigh). The genitofemoral nerve does not travel through the rectus sheath.\r\n\r\nOption A (Pyramidalis muscle) is incorrect because the pyramidalis muscle is located in the anterior wall of the rectus sheath. It is a small triangular muscle that lies within the sheath, anterior to the rectus abdominis muscle, and serves to tense the linea alba.\r\n\r\nOption C (Inferior epigastric vessels) is incorrect because the inferior epigastric vessels are part of the structures contained within the rectus sheath. These vessels run superiorly and medially, passing through the sheath and supplying blood to the lower part of the rectus abdominis muscle.\r\n\r\nOption D (Superior epigastric vessels) is incorrect because the superior epigastric vessels are also contained within the rectus sheath. These vessels arise from the internal thoracic artery and descend to supply the upper part of the rectus abdominis muscle.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nChorda tympani in the middle ear cavity\r\n\r\nThe chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) that carries parasympathetic fibers responsible for stimulating saliva production in the submandibular and sublingual glands. The chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve before synapsing at the submandibular ganglion, where postganglionic fibers then stimulate salivation. A lesion affecting the chorda tympani, particularly in the middle ear cavity, can result in a loss of salivation from the submandibular gland, leading to symptoms like dryness of the mouth. Hence, the correct answer is option B.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Answers:\r\n\r\nA. Greater petrosal nerve\r\nThe greater petrosal nerve also carries parasympathetic fibers from the facial nerve (CN VII) but primarily innervates the lacrimal gland and mucosal glands of the nasal cavity and palate. While it is involved in parasympathetic functions, it does not directly affect the submandibular gland, making it an incorrect choice for this specific symptom of dryness of the mouth.\r\n\r\nC. Superior cervical ganglion\r\nThe superior cervical ganglion is part of the sympathetic nervous system, providing sympathetic innervation to structures such as the eyes and the salivary glands. It helps regulate blood flow to the glands and can influence secretion, but it does not directly control parasympathetic salivation, particularly from the submandibular gland. A lesion here is less likely to cause the specific dryness of the mouth seen in this patient, which is related to parasympathetic dysfunction.\r\n\r\nD. Lesser petrosal nerve\r\nThe lesser petrosal nerve, another branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), innervates the parotid gland, not the submandibular gland. It carries parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion, which then stimulates salivation from the parotid gland. A lesion of the lesser petrosal nerve would affect parotid secretion, not the submandibular gland, making this option incorrect in the context of this patient's symptoms.",

Bouin's fluid\r\nBouin's fluid is the preferred fixative for a testicular biopsy because it provides superior preservation of delicate tissue structures, particularly the seminiferous tubules and nuclear detail. It causes less shrinkage and hardening than formalin and is excellent for identifying cell types and morphology in the testis.\r\n\r\nII. Electron microscopy C. Glutaraldehyde\r\nGlutaraldehyde is the best primary fixative for tissues undergoing Electron Microscopy (EM) because it cross-links proteins quickly and efficiently, preserving the ultra-fine structure (ultrastructure) of cell organelles and membranes with minimal distortion. This level of detail is necessary for EM.\r\n\r\nIII. FNAC B. Ethyl alcohol\r\nFNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) samples are typically processed as smears. These smears are often fixed immediately using 95% Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) to prevent air-drying artifact before staining (e.g., Papanicolaou stain). This technique is known as wet fixation.\r\n\r\nIV. Sentinel lymphnode A. Frozen section\r\nSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a common intraoperative procedure, especially in breast cancer and melanoma surgery. The immediate analysis of the lymph node is done using a Frozen Section technique, which allows the pathologist to quickly determine (within minutes) if metastasis is present while the patient is still under anesthesia.",

Serum sickness is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction, mediated by immune complex formation (antigen-antibody complexes) that deposit in tissues, activating complement and causing inflammation and tissue injury.\r\n\r\nIncorrect options:\r\n\r\nOption (A): Type I hypersensitivity – IgE-mediated reactions occur immediately (minutes to hours) after exposure and present with anaphylaxis, urticaria, or bronchospasm, not delayed features like purpura and hematuria.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Graft versus host disease – Occurs after allogeneic transplant and involves donor T cells attacking host tissues; unrelated to rituximab therapy.\r\n\r\nOption (D): Tumor lysis syndrome – Results from rapid tumor cell breakdown leading to hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, but does not cause purpura, lymphadenopathy, or conjunctival erythema.",

The soft palate is more flexible and has minor salivary glands to aid in lubrication.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Non-keratinised squamous without submucosa and minor salivary glands – This is not correct for any part of the palate. Non-keratinised epithelium without glands is usually found in areas like the inner lip or buccal mucosa, not the hard palate.\r\n\r\nOption (D): Non-keratinised cuboidal – Cuboidal epithelium is typically found in ducts of glands, not in the lining of the hard palate.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nScalenus medius\r\nThe scalenus medius muscle is attached to the first rib. It is one of the three scalene muscles located in the neck, and its origin is from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (C1 to C7). The muscle inserts into the upper surface of the first rib, making it responsible for the elevation of the first rib during inspiration and contributing to lateral flexion of the neck. This muscle is also important for its role in nerve and vessel passage, with the brachial plexus and subclavian artery passing between the scalenus anterior and scalenus medius.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Responses:\r\n(A) Scalenus posterior\r\nThis is incorrect because the scalenus posterior does not attach to the first rib. It actually attaches to the second rib and plays a role in elevating the second rib. The scalenus posterior is located behind the scalenus medius, but it does not have any attachment to the first rib.\r\n\r\n(B) Serratus posterior superior\r\nThis is incorrect because the serratus posterior superior does not attach to the first rib. Instead, it attaches to the upper ribs (2nd to 5th) and plays a role in elevating these ribs during inspiration. It is not connected to the first rib.\r\n\r\n(D) None of the above\r\nThis is incorrect because option (C) is the correct answer.

Ligation here does not control the main blood supply from the ovarian vessels.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Round ligament – This ligament connects the uterus to the labia majora and does not contain significant vessels supplying the ovary, so ligating it does not control bleeding during ovarian surgery.",

The overall pale, fine, or lace-like appearance of the remaining thyroid tissue suggests this change and the destruction of normal follicles.\r\n\r\nFibrosis: There is often interstitial fibrosis (the pale pink, somewhat disorganized tissue separating the lymphoid aggregates), which contributes to the firm consistency of the goiter (neck swelling) felt clinically.",

This bundle consists of the anterior tibial artery, deep peroneal nerve, and the associated veins. It runs within the deep fascia of the anterior compartment, between the tendons of EHL and EDL, just before it crosses the ankle joint. This anatomical relationship is crucial for the proper function and protection of the neurovascular structures in the anterior compartment.\r\n\r\nExplanation for Incorrect Answers:\r\nB. EDL and peroneus tertius: This statement is incorrect. The peroneus tertius is part of the anterior compartment of the leg but is not situated between the tendons of EDL and the neurovascular bundle. The neurovascular bundle lies between EHL and EDL, not between EDL and peroneus tertius.\r\n\r\nC. Tibialis anterior and EHL: This statement is incorrect. The tibialis anterior tendon is located medial to the neurovascular bundle, while the EHL tendon is lateral to it. The neurovascular bundle does not pass between these two tendons, as they are not situated in that specific arrangement.\r\n\r\nD.

Since the x-intercept is equal to -1/KM, an intercept closer to zero means the apparent Michaelis constant (KM) has increased (its magnitude, -1/KM, has decreased).\r\n\r\n3. Increased Slope: The red line is steeper than the purple line, reflecting the increase in Kм. M\r\nIn Competitive Inhibition, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme's active site, competing with the substrate. This lowers the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, thus increasing Kм. However, at very high substrate concentrations (where 1/[S] approaches zero), the substrate effectively outcompetes the inhibitor, and the reaction can still reach the original Vmax (hence, the same y-intercept).\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options\r\nB. Non-competitive: Non-competitive (or pure non-competitive) inhibition decreases Vinax (higher y-intercept) but leaves KM unchanged (same x-intercept).\r\n\r\nC. Uncompetitive: Uncompetitive inhibition decreases both Vimax and KM proportionally. On a Lineweaver-Burk plot, this is shown by a set of parallel lines.\r\n\r\nD. Suicide enzyme inhibition: This is a type of irreversible inhibition where the inhibitor is processed by the enzyme to create a reactive intermediate that permanently inactivates the enzyme. It is classified mechanistically but is usually not visualized as a single steady-state line on a Lineweaver-Burk plot in this manner.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nThe image is a high-power micrograph showing the classic cellular features of an Adult Granulosa Cell Tumor (AGCT):\r\n\r\n\"Coffee-Bean\" Nuclei (Nuclear Grooves): The most diagnostic feature visible is the appearance of the tumor cell nuclei. They are typically uniform, oval to round, with pale chromatin and a distinctive longitudinal nuclear groove, causing them to resemble a coffee bean (or \"grapefruit nucleus\" in some descriptions). This is a hallmark feature of Granulosa Cell Tumors.\r\n\r\nMonotonous Cell Population: The cells are small to medium-sized and appear relatively uniform and bland (monotonous) with scant, pale cytoplasm.\r\n\r\nHormonal Presentation: The clinical presentation of a tumor in a 30-year-old woman causing abnormal uterine bleeding is highly suggestive of an estrogen-producing tumor. AGCT is the most common malignant sex cord-stromal tumor and often secretes estrogen, which leads to endometrial stimulation, presenting as menstrual irregularities or abnormal bleeding.\r\n\r\nArchitectural Pattern (Implied): While Call-Exner bodies (small rosette-like spaces) are the most famous feature, AGCTs can also grow in diffuse sheets, cords, or trabeculae, as seen here.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options\r\nB. Embryonal carcinoma: This is a malignant germ cell tumor that typically presents in younger patients (teens/20s). Histologically, it consists of large, primitive-looking cells with marked pleomorphism, high mitotic activity, and indistinct cell borders. Their nuclei are large, round, and show prominent nucleoli, completely unlike the uniform, grooved nuclei seen in the image.\r\n\r\nC. Thecoma: Thecomas are pure stromal tumors that are usually benign and often estrogen-producing. However, they are composed of spindle-shaped cells with lipid-laden cytoplasm, resembling fibroblasts or theca cells. They do not have the epithelial-like, grooved, round cells seen in the image.\r\n\r\nD. Sertoli Leydig cell tumor: This is a sex cord-stromal tumor that is typically androgen-producing (causing virilization). Histologically, it is characterized by a distinctive architecture of Sertoli cells forming tubules and Leydig cells in the stroma. It does not show the monotonous cell population with nuclear grooves seen here.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nHIV ELISA. HIV ELISA is not used for the diagnosis of HIV infection in a 2-month-old child because this test detects maternal HIV antibodies (IgG), which can persist in the infant’s circulation for up to 18 months. Since maternal antibodies cross the placenta, a positive ELISA test in a newborn does not necessarily indicate an active HIV infection in the child. Instead, direct detection methods such as DNA PCR, viral culture, or p24 antigen assay are preferred for early diagnosis of HIV in infants.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Incorrect Options:\r\n(A) DNA PCR – Correct method. DNA PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is the gold standard for diagnosing HIV infection in infants under 18 months. This test detects proviral HIV DNA integrated into the infant’s white blood cells, confirming active infection rather than passive maternal antibody transfer.\r\n\r\n(B) Viral culture – Correct method. HIV can be isolated from the infant’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using viral culture techniques, though this method is not widely used due to its labor-intensive nature and long turnaround time.\r\n\r\n(D) p24 antigen assay – Correct method. The p24 antigen test detects the HIV core protein (p24), which appears early in infection before antibody production. It is useful for early diagnosis in neonates but is less sensitive than DNA PCR.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nAbsent melanocytes.\r\n\r\nExplanation for Correct Answer:\r\nVitiligo is characterized by the absence of melanocytes in the affected areas of the skin, leading to depigmented macules or patches. This occurs due to the autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, where the body’s immune system mistakenly targets and destroys these pigment-producing cells. The absence of melanocytes results in a lack of melanin production, causing the characteristic white patches. Histological studies confirm the absence or near absence of melanocytes in affected areas, while unaffected skin retains normal melanocyte density.\r\n\r\nExplanation for Incorrect Options:\r\nB. Defective enzyme tyrosinase is incorrect because tyrosinase deficiency is associated with albinism, not vitiligo. In albinism, melanocytes are present, but they are unable to produce melanin due to a defect in the tyrosinase enzyme. In vitiligo, the issue is the absence of melanocytes, not defective enzyme function.\r\n\r\nC. Defective migration of melanocytes is incorrect because defective migration of melanocytes occurs during embryogenesis and is associated with conditions like piebaldism and Waardenburg syndrome. Vitiligo, however, is an acquired disorder where melanocytes are destroyed after normal development and distribution.\r\n\r\nD. External chemical destruction of melanocytes is incorrect because while external chemicals can cause chemical leukoderma, this is a different condition. Vitiligo is primarily caused by autoimmune mechanisms, not external chemical factors. However, certain chemicals may act as triggers in genetically predisposed individuals.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nAtopic Dermatitis\r\nDennie-Morgan’s fold is a characteristic feature seen in atopic dermatitis. It refers to a prominent crease or fold under the lower eyelids, which results from chronic skin inflammation and edema. It is commonly seen in individuals with atopic dermatitis or those with a history of other allergic conditions (like asthma or hay fever). The presence of Dennie-Morgan’s fold is associated with exaggerated skin folds, which often become more pronounced in children who have atopic eczema.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Mastocytosis:\r\nMastocytosis is a disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin and other organs. It typically manifests with urticaria (hives), cutaneous lesions, and flushing. While urticaria pigmentosa (a type of mastocytosis) can cause skin changes, it does not present with Dennie-Morgan's fold, which is specific to atopic dermatitis. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\r\n\r\n(C) Contact allergic dermatitis:\r\nContact allergic dermatitis is caused by an allergic reaction to substances that come into direct contact with the skin, such as certain metals, fragrances, or plants. While this condition can cause itchy, inflamed rashes, it does not lead to the development of Dennie-Morgan’s fold. Dennie-Morgan’s fold is more specific to atopic dermatitis and its associated chronic skin changes, rather than a response to a localized allergen.\r\n\r\n(D) Seborrheic dermatitis:\r\nSeborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects areas rich in sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, and chest. It presents with yellowish, greasy scales and erythema. While seborrheic dermatitis can cause a rash in the facial area, it does not typically cause Dennie-Morgan's fold, which is primarily associated with atopic dermatitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nLupus vulgaris.\r\n\r\nLupus vulgaris is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis, caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. It typically presents as chronic, reddish-brown lesions on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and ears. These lesions can develop into plaques or nodules and may have an \"apple jelly\" appearance when pressed. Lupus vulgaris is the term specifically used to refer to tuberculosis affecting the skin.\r\n\r\nB. Lupus pernio is incorrect. Lupus pernio is a form of skin involvement seen in sarcoidosis, not tuberculosis. It presents as purple or reddish, raised, and often ulcerated lesions, primarily affecting the nose, cheeks, ears, and fingers. It is not related to tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nC. Lupus profundus is incorrect. Lupus profundus, also known as panniculitis, refers to a deeper form of lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease), not tuberculosis. It affects the deeper layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, causing firm, painful nodules.\r\n\r\nD. Lupus erythematosus is incorrect. Lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin. It is not caused by tuberculosis and does not refer to tuberculosis of the skin. Lupus erythematosus has distinct clinical features, such as the butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks and nose, which is not seen in tuberculosis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nCytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is the most common cause of viral retinitis in HIV/AIDS patients, particularly when the CD4 count falls below 50 cells/µL. CMV retinitis presents with painless progressive visual loss, floaters, and visual disturbances. Fundoscopic examination typically reveals characteristic “pizza pie” or “cottage cheese with ketchup” lesions, consisting of bilateral retinal exudates, perivascular hemorrhages, and necrotizing retinitis. If untreated, CMV retinitis can progress to retinal detachment and blindness. Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet is essential for treatment.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Incorrect Options:\r\n(A) Herpes simplex retinitis – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) retinitis is less common than CMV retinitis in HIV patients. HSV can cause acute retinal necrosis (ARN), which is more aggressive and associated with significant inflammation and vitritis. Unlike CMV retinitis, ARN typically affects immunocompetent individuals rather than HIV/AIDS patients.\r\n\r\n(B) Human herpes virus – Incorrect. The term \"Human herpes virus\" (HHV) is non-specific and includes multiple herpesviruses (e.g., HHV-1 to HHV-8). Among these, CMV (HHV-5) is the most relevant to HIV-associated retinitis, making this answer too broad and unspecific.\r\n\r\n(D) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) – Incorrect. EBV is not a common cause of retinitis in HIV/AIDS patients. Although EBV is associated with malignancies such as primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) in AIDS, it is not a major cause of viral retinitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nCationic\r\nCationic surface active disinfectants (also known as quaternary ammonium compounds or quats) are the most important and widely used disinfectants. They are effective in killing a wide range of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Their effectiveness comes from the positive charge on the cationic molecule, which interacts with the negatively charged bacterial cell membranes, disrupting them and causing cell death. This makes cationic compounds the most important class of surface-active disinfectants.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Anionic:\r\nAnionic surfactants (e.g., soaps) are primarily used for cleaning purposes, as they help reduce surface tension and remove dirt and grease. While they have some antimicrobial properties, they are not as effective as cationic disinfectants in terms of killing microorganisms. Anionic surfactants are not considered the most important surface-active disinfectants.\r\n\r\nC. Non-ionic:\r\nNon-ionic surfactants are used in a variety of cleaning and detergent products but do not possess strong antimicrobial activity compared to cationic disinfectants. They are mainly used for their cleaning and emulsifying properties, rather than as primary disinfectants.\r\n\r\nD. Amphoteric compounds:\r\nAmphoteric surfactants have both positive and negative charges and can act as either cationic or anionic depending on the pH of the solution. While they have some disinfectant properties, they are generally less potent than cationic surfactants and are not considered the most important surface-active disinfectants.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nThe image displays a characteristic star-shaped or flower-like opacity in the lens, which is the pathognomonic finding for a Rosette cataract. Rosette cataracts typically form due to trauma (blunt or penetrating injury) that disrupts the lens fibers. The standard treatment for a visually significant cataract, regardless of its specific morphology, is modern cataract surgery.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis (Rosette Cataract): The opacities are arranged radially along the lines of the lens sutures, creating a distinct \"rosette\" or \"flower-petal\" pattern. This pattern is often referred to as a concussion cataract because it is classically seen following blunt trauma to the eye.\r\n\r\nManagement (Phacoemulsification with IOL): Phacoemulsification (a procedure using ultrasound to emulsify and remove the cloudy lens) followed by IOL (Intraocular Lens) implantation is the current standard of care for treating most types of visually significant cataracts, including rosette cataracts.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options\r\nB. Immature senile cataract: This is a broad term for an age-related cataract that is not yet completely opaque (part of the lens is still clear). It describes the maturity of an age-related cataract, not this specific star-shaped morphology.\r\n\r\nC. Sunflower cataract: This is characterized by a central disc of fine, radiating yellow-brown granules and is specifically a sign of copper deposition, most commonly seen in Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration). The appearance is different from the white, fibrous-looking rosette shown.\r\n\r\nD. Snowflake cataract: This is a type of rapidly progressing metabolic cataract seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Histologically, it involves the accumulation of small, white, flaky opacities in the cortex, resembling snowflakes or snowstorms, which does not match the image. Lensectomy (complete removal of the lens without replacing it with an IOL) is rarely the primary treatment for an uncomplicated cataract unless IOL implantation is contraindicated.",

It is a well-encapsulated, slow-growing vascular tumor that typically arises within the muscle cone of the orbit. Patients often present with progressive, painless, unilateral proptosis (forward displacement of the eye) without visual loss unless the tumor compresses the optic nerve. On imaging (CT or MRI), it appears as a well-circumscribed, enhancing mass. Surgical excision usually results in complete cure.\r\n\r\nIncorrect options:\r\n\r\nOption (A): Optic nerve meningioma – A benign tumor of the meninges around the optic nerve, more common in middle-aged women, but less common than cavernous hemangioma as an overall orbital tumor.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Optic nerve glioma – Typically occurs in children, often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), not the most common benign orbital tumor in adults.\r\n\r\nOption (D): Dermoid – A congenital cystic lesion, more common in children and young adults, usually located at the superotemporal quadrant, not the most common benign orbital tumor in adults.",

The palmar hyperpigmentation and oral lesions (such as mucous patches) are characteristic of secondary syphilis. The most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm syphilis is the VDRL test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory), which detects non-treponemal antibodies that are produced in response to the Treponema pallidum infection. If positive, this test is typically followed by a more specific Treponemal test (e.g., FTA-ABS or TPPA) for confirmation.\r\n\r\nExplanation for Incorrect Options:\r\nA. Skin biopsy: A skin biopsy might be performed to evaluate the lesion morphology and rule out other dermatological conditions, but in the case of suspected syphilis, the VDRL test is more appropriate for diagnosis. Syphilis can be diagnosed easily through serologic testing, and skin biopsy is not typically required unless there is diagnostic uncertainty.\r\n\r\nC. Serum cortisol levels: Serum cortisol levels are typically measured in cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency (such as Addison’s disease) or Cushing’s syndrome, neither of which seems relevant to the patient's presentation. The skin lesions and the other clinical findings point more toward a syphilitic infection rather than an issue with cortisol production.\r\n\r\nD. Arsenic levels in skin, hair, and nails: Testing for arsenic poisoning would be considered if the patient presented with signs of chronic arsenic exposure (such as hyperpigmented skin, keratosis, or neuropathy). However, the clinical presentation of oral lesions and perianal lesions, combined with the hyperpigmented macules on the palms, is more consistent with syphilis rather than arsenic toxicity.",

Low Urine Osmolality (Polyuria): Without ADH, the collecting ducts of the kidney cannot reabsorb water, leading to the excretion of a large volume of dilute urine. A urinary osmolality of 50 mOsm/kg is extremely dilute and characteristic of the polyuria seen in DI.\r\n2. High Serum Osmolality (Hypernatremia): The excessive loss of pure water in the urine leads to water deficit in the body, causing the body fluids, including the serum, to become concentrated. This results in hypernatremia and an elevated serum osmolality. A value of 300 mOsm/kg is above the normal range (typically 275-295 mOsm/kg) and reflects this concentration.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options\r\nB. Urinary Osmolality: 500, Serum Osmolality: 260: This shows appropriately concentrated urine (> 500) and a very low serum osmolality (dilute serum). This pattern is closer to a state of SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH, where the body retains water) or an overhydrated state.\r\nC. Urinary Osmolality: 50, Serum Osmolality: 260: This shows both low serum and low urine osmolality. This usually occurs with polydipsia (excessive water intake) where the kidneys are functioning normally and simply excreting the excess water.\r\nD. Urinary Osmolality: 500, Serum Osmolality: 100: A serum osmolality of 100 mOsm/kg is physiologically impossible for life. Even if that were not the case, a high urine osmolality is inappropriate for DI.\r\n",

SSSS is caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which target desmoglein 1 (a protein in the skin that helps maintain the integrity of the epidermis). This leads to the separation of the epidermis, causing blisters and skin peeling, which are characteristic features of the condition. SSSS commonly affects neonates and young children, and it typically presents without mucosal involvement. The presence of a preceding furuncle points to the source of infection.\r\n\r\nA. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is incorrect because TEN is usually caused by drug reactions and typically presents with widespread epidermal detachment, including mucosal involvement (such as in the mouth, eyes, and genitalia). TEN usually affects older children or adults, and the absence of mucosal lesions in this case makes TEN less likely.\r\n\r\nC. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is incorrect because SJS also involves mucosal lesions and is typically triggered by medications or infections. It presents with a similar skin detachment process as TEN but tends to be less severe. The absence of mucosal involvement and the infant's age make SJS less likely.\r\n\r\nD. Infantile pemphigus is incorrect because pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disorder, characterized by flaccid blisters that typically affect adults (not infants). Pemphigus involves mucosal and cutaneous lesions, whereas this infant's condition is more consistent with toxin-mediated blistering, such as in SSSS, and lacks mucosal involvement.",

These features are characteristic of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to rupture of a posterior communicating artery (PCOM) aneurysm. The ptosis occurs because the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) runs close to the PCOM and is commonly compressed by an aneurysm here, leading to third nerve palsy. Neck stiffness indicates meningeal irritation from blood in the subarachnoid space.\r\n\r\nIncorrect options:\r\n\r\nOption (A): Cerebral embolism – Typically presents with focal neurological deficits (e.g., hemiplegia, aphasia) rather than sudden headache and ptosis.\r\n\r\nOption (C): Anterior communicating artery aneurysm with SAH – Commonly causes sudden headache, but visual or oculomotor nerve deficits like ptosis are rare; it often presents with bitemporal hemianopia or frontal lobe signs.\r\n\r\nOption (D): Cavernous sinus thrombosis – Presents with bilateral eye involvement, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and fever, not an isolated unilateral oculomotor palsy with acute headache.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nSlit lamp examination of eye.\r\n The description of irregular hyperpigmented patches on the trunk and multiple small hyperpigmented macules in the axillae and groins since childhood suggests Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen's disease. One of the common ocular manifestations of NF1 is Lisch nodules, which are pigmented hamartomas of the iris. The slit lamp examination of the eye is the most appropriate investigation to detect these Lisch nodules, which are a diagnostic feature of NF1.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Responses:\r\n\r\nA. Retinal artery angiography is typically used to evaluate the blood vessels of the retina and detect conditions like retinal vascular diseases, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal artery occlusion. It is not useful in diagnosing neurofibromatosis or identifying Lisch nodules.\r\n\r\nB. Examination of fundus involves examining the back of the eye (fundus) to assess for various eye conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy or optic nerve diseases. Although NF1 can affect the optic nerve, fundus examination is not specifically helpful for diagnosing the typical ocular manifestations of NF1, like Lisch nodules.\r\n\r\nC. Measurement of intraocular tension is used to assess for glaucoma, a condition characterized by elevated intraocular pressure. While individuals with NF1 can have an increased risk of certain ocular problems, measuring intraocular pressure is not a diagnostic tool for identifying Lisch nodules or NF1.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe culture medium must be selective\r\n\r\nThe most likely explanation for only Escherichia coli growing and not Staphylococcus epidermidis is that the culture medium is selective for certain types of bacteria. Selective media are designed to favor the growth of specific microorganisms while inhibiting the growth of others. In this case, the medium may be selective for gram-negative bacteria like E. coli, while inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria like S. epidermidis. This would explain why only E. coli grew, while S. epidermidis did not.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. The microbiologist used too much inoculum:\r\nUsing too much inoculum is unlikely to explain the absence of S. epidermidis growth in this case. Excess inoculum might lead to overcrowding or contamination, but it wouldn't typically result in selective inhibition of one species (such as S. epidermidis) while allowing another (like E. coli) to grow. Therefore, this option is not the most likely explanation.\r\n\r\nB. The culture is contaminated:\r\nIf the culture were contaminated, you would expect growth of unwanted microorganisms in addition to either S. epidermidis or E. coli. Since the question specifies that only E. coli grew, contamination is unlikely, as it would likely lead to the growth of other species as well. This makes contamination an unlikely explanation.\r\n\r\nC. The incubation temperature was incorrect:\r\nIf the incubation temperature were incorrect, it would likely affect the growth of both organisms, not just S. epidermidis. Both S. epidermidis and E. coli are capable of growing in a wide range of temperatures (typically around 37°C), so an incorrect temperature would likely prevent the growth of both, not just one of them.\r\n\r\nE. The culture medium must be differential:\r\nDifferential media are used to distinguish between different types of bacteria based on their biochemical characteristics (e.g., color changes), but they do not inhibit the growth of one microorganism over another. This is not the primary purpose of differential media, and it does not explain why only E. coli would grow in this scenario.",

Clonorchis sinensis – (Correct)\r\nClonorchis sinensis, also known as the Chinese liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm that is acquired by ingesting raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain the infective metacercariae. This parasite primarily affects the biliary system, causing chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately increasing the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma, a type of gallbladder cancer. Long-term infection with Clonorchis sinensis is strongly associated with gallbladder and bile duct cancers, which is why ingestion of raw fish containing this parasite can lead to gallbladder cancer.\r\n\r\nB. Hymenolepis diminuta – (Incorrect)\r\nHymenolepis diminuta is a type of tapeworm that primarily infects humans via the ingestion of infected beetles or their larvae, not raw fish. It is not associated with gallbladder cancer. While it can cause symptoms like abdominal pain or discomfort, it does not affect the biliary system in a manner that would lead to cancer.\r\n\r\nC. Angiostrongylus – (Incorrect)\r\nAngiostrongylus refers to a genus of parasitic nematodes that cause diseases such as meningitis in humans, but they do not cause gallbladder cancer. The larvae of Angiostrongylus are typically acquired by ingesting contaminated snails or slugs, not raw fish, and they affect the nervous system rather than the biliary system.\r\n\r\nD. D. latum – (Incorrect)\r\nDiphyllobothrium latum, also known as the broad fish tapeworm, is a parasitic tapeworm acquired by consuming raw or undercooked fish. While it can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, D. latum is not associated with the development of gallbladder cancer.

This age group has an active growth plate (physis) that is susceptible to injury.\r\n\r\nLocation: The arrow points to a fragmented piece of bone that has been avulsed (pulled away) from the main body of the tibia at the site where the patellar tendon inserts.\r\n\r\nAnatomy: The prominent bony eminence on the anterior (front) aspect of the tibia, just below the knee joint, is the tibial tuberosity. The patellar tendon, which is the extension of the quadriceps muscle, inserts onto this tuberosity and is the final component of the knee's extensor mechanism.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis: The image shows a classic tibial tuberosity avulsion fracture. This injury typically occurs in adolescents during sports or a fall, often due to a sudden, forceful contraction of the quadriceps muscle (pulling the tendon) while the tuberosity is still cartilaginous or weakened by an unfused growth plate.\r\n\r\nMedial tubercle and Gerdy’s tubercle are landmarks on the tibial plateau, not the anterior prominence where the extensor mechanism attaches.\r\n\r\nAnterior intercondylar area is located more centrally within the joint space, where the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) attaches.",

It measures the digestibility and availability of essential amino acids (indispensable amino acids) at the end of the small intestine, providing a precise evaluation of how well a protein source meets human dietary needs. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has endorsed DIASS as a superior method compared to older protein quality indicators. DIASS is particularly important in setting dietary protein recommendations because it reflects both the amino acid composition and true digestibility of proteins in different foods.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) – This method evaluates protein quality based on weight gain in rats per gram of protein consumed. However, it is not ideal for human dietary recommendations because rat growth patterns and amino acid requirements differ from humans.\r\n\r\nB. Biological Value (BV) – BV measures how efficiently absorbed protein is used for tissue synthesis but does not account for digestibility losses. While useful, it does not provide a complete picture of protein utilization.\r\n\r\nD.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) \r\n\r\nIn a 28-year-old postpartum mother with mild depression, the first-line treatment is psychotherapy alone, particularly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT is an evidence-based, non-pharmacological treatment that is highly effective for mild to moderate depression, especially postpartum depression. It helps the patient identify and reframe negative thought patterns, promotes emotional regulation, and improves coping mechanisms—which are especially important during the emotionally and physically challenging postpartum period. \r\n\r\nCBT is preferred initially in breastfeeding mothers with mild symptoms to avoid exposing the infant to medications through breast milk.  \r\n\r\nIncorrect Options: \r\n\r\nB. CBT + Antidepressant  Combination therapy is generally reserved for moderate to severe depression, not mild cases. Using antidepressants early in a breastfeeding mother should be avoided unless the condition is worsening or not responding to therapy alone.  \r\n\r\nC. Antidepressant alone  Medication is not the first line for mild depression, especially in postpartum women due to concerns about drug exposure to the infant through breast milk. Psychological interventions are preferred first.  \r\n\r\nD. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)  ECT is reserved for severe depression, especially with psychotic features, suicidal ideation, or treatment-resistant cases. It is not indicated in mild depressive episodes.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nCulture.\r\n\r\nCulture refers to the learned behaviors, beliefs, customs, values, and norms that are passed down from one generation to another in a society. It is socially acquired, meaning that it is not biologically inherited but learned through interaction with others in a community. Culture includes practices, languages, rituals, and other aspects that define a particular group of people. It shapes how individuals behave and interact within society, and it is learned over time through socialization.\r\n\r\nCulture is the most accurate term for \"learned behavior which is socially acquired,\" as it encompasses the entire spectrum of behaviors and practices that individuals in a society adopt and share. It reflects the way people live, interact, and pass knowledge down through generations.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA (Customs):\r\nCustoms are specific, traditional practices or behaviors that are commonly accepted within a society or culture. While customs are part of culture, they are not the same as culture itself. Customs are a subset of culture, often referring to particular practices, such as holiday traditions or social greetings, but not the broad scope of learned behavior.\r\n\r\nB (Acculturation):\r\nAcculturation refers to the process of cultural exchange and adaptation that occurs when individuals or groups from different cultural backgrounds come into contact. It involves the adoption of certain cultural traits from another culture, but it is not the overall \"learned behavior\" in a society. It is more about the changes or modifications that occur in one culture due to exposure to another.\r\n\r\nC (Standard of living):\r\nStandard of living refers to the material well-being or economic condition of individuals or groups, measured by factors like income, employment, and access to goods and services. It is not related to the learned, socially acquired behaviors that are inherent in culture.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nWarfarin\r\nExplanation:\r\nThe patient likely developed an adverse effect related to warfarin therapy, given the context of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and anticoagulant use. One of the key adverse effects of warfarin is skin necrosis or purple toe syndrome, which is a known complication, particularly in the early days of treatment.\r\n\r\nWarfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and can lead to a hypercoagulable state initially (before the anticoagulant effect fully kicks in). This can cause thrombosis in small vessels, leading to skin necrosis.\r\n\r\nThis adverse effect typically occurs within the first few days of treatment and is more common in patients with protein C or S deficiency, as these proteins are natural anticoagulants, and their inhibition by warfarin can cause an increased risk of clot formation.\r\n\r\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\r\nA. Heparin – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nHeparin is a direct thrombin inhibitor that is commonly used in the hospital setting for DVT treatment. It can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but it does not commonly cause the type of skin necrosis or purple toe syndrome seen with warfarin. HIT can lead to thrombosis, but not the same cutaneous symptoms as warfarin.\r\n\r\nB. Rivaroxaban – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nRivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits Factor Xa. While DOACs have their own risk of bleeding and thrombosis, they are not commonly associated with the same skin necrosis or purple toe syndrome seen with warfarin.\r\n\r\nD. Dabigatran – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nDabigatran is another DOAC, this one inhibiting thrombin (Factor II). While it has anticoagulant effects, it is not associated with skin necrosis or the early hypercoagulable state seen with warfarin. Like rivaroxaban, it does not produce the same complications as warfarin.",

Lactic acid – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nLactic acid is associated with lactic acidosis, a condition in which potassium may actually increase in the extracellular space due to acidosis, not decrease.\r\n\r\nD.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nDrug A is more potent and equally efficacious as drug B\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nPotency refers to the amount of a drug needed to produce a given effect, while efficacy refers to the maximum effect a drug can produce. On a dose-response curve (typically with dose on the x-axis and response on the y-axis), a more potent drug reaches the same effect at a lower dose, meaning it is shifted to the left. Equal efficacy means the drugs reach the same maximum response (plateau) on the y-axis.\r\n\r\nFrom the image:\r\n\r\nDrug A's curve lies to the left of Drug B, meaning Drug A is more potent (requires a lower dose to achieve the same effect).\r\n\r\nBoth Drug A and Drug B reach the same maximal response, indicating they are equally efficacious.\r\nThus, Option D is correct.\r\n\r\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\r\nA. Drug B is less potent but equally efficacious as drug D – Incorrect:\r\nIf Drug D has a higher maximal response than Drug B, it is more efficacious, not equally efficacious. Also, potency comparison must show relative positions on the x-axis, which this option misrepresents.\r\n\r\nB. Drug C is less potent and more efficacious than drug A – Incorrect:\r\nIf Drug C has a lower maximal response than Drug A, it is less efficacious, not more. Additionally, if it is shifted to the right of Drug A, it is less potent, but the efficacy part of the statement is incorrect.\r\n\r\nC. Drug D is more potent and more efficacious than drug B – Incorrect:\r\nIf Drug D is not significantly to the left of Drug B, it may not be more potent. And if its maximal response is not higher, it's also not more efficacious. The statement may be partially true but is not fully correct based on the image.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nExplanation: The figure shows a significant increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, indicating a generalized vasoconstriction. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in heart rate, described as \"Reflex bradycardia.\" This specific combination of effects is characteristic of Norepinephrine (Nor-epinephrine).\r\n\r\nLet's analyze the effects of each option:\r\n\r\nA. Epinephrine (Adrenaline): Epinephrine stimulates both alpha (α) and beta (β) adrenergic receptors. It causes vasoconstriction (α1) leading to increased systolic and mean blood pressure, but it also strongly stimulates β1 receptors in the heart, leading to increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. While it increases pulse pressure, the reflex bradycardia seen in the figure is less typical as its direct β1 effects would counteract it, or the reflex would be masked.\r\n\r\nB. Norepinephrine (Nor-epinephrine): Norepinephrine primarily stimulates α1 receptors (causing potent vasoconstriction) and β1 receptors (in the heart). The strong α1-mediated vasoconstriction leads to a marked increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. This significant rise in blood pressure then triggers a strong baroreceptor reflex. The baroreceptors sense the increased pressure and respond by increasing parasympathetic (vagal) tone to the heart, leading to reflex bradycardia (a decrease in heart rate) despite the direct β1 stimulation of the heart. This perfectly matches the figure.\r\n\r\nC. Isoprenaline (Isoproterenol): Isoprenaline is a non-selective beta agonist, strongly stimulating β1 and β2 receptors. It causes vasodilation (β2), leading to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and often a slight decrease in mean arterial pressure. It strongly increases heart rate and cardiac contractility (β1). This is the opposite of what is shown in the figure for blood pressure and heart rate.\r\n\r\nD. Dopamine: Dopamine's effects are dose-dependent. At low doses, it stimulates D1 receptors causing renal and mesenteric vasodilation. At moderate doses, it stimulates β1 receptors, increasing heart rate and contractility. At high doses, it stimulates α1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction. While it can increase blood pressure at high doses, it usually increases heart rate directly or reflexively, and the combined pattern shown (marked increase in all pressures with reflex bradycardia) is not its primary or most characteristic effect compared to norepinephrine.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) \r\n\r\nRepetitive late decelerations, absent variability \r\n• Fetal heart rates are evaluated, paying attention to baseline rate, variability, accelerations, and decelerations. The baseline rate should be between 110 and 160 bpm. \r\n• Minimal and absent variability are worrisome for hypoxia and acidemia of the fetus, with absent variability being worse than minimal. Three types\r\nof decelerations have been described—early, variable, and late. \r\n• Early decelerations begin and end with contractions and are thought to be a result of fetal head compression. \r\n• Variable decelerations are sharp drops in the fetal heart rate with quick return to baseline and can be either isolated or correlated with contractions; these are believed to result from compression of the umbilical cord. Late decelerations begin after the contraction has begun and end after it has ended. These are usually\r\nshallow and can be quite subtle and difficult to detect. \r\n• Late decelerations are correlated with decreased placental perfusion that can be secondary to inadequate blood flow to",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nPromethazine\r\nExplanation:\r\nPromethazine is an antihistamine that is commonly used to prevent motion sickness. It works by blocking histamine receptors (H? receptors) in the brain, which are involved in the sensation of nausea and vomiting. Promethazine has anticholinergic properties as well, which help to prevent the nausea and dizziness associated with motion sickness.\r\n\r\nPromethazine is effective in preventing and treating motion sickness, and is typically used before travel to minimize symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\r\nB. Cetirizine – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nCetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine, commonly used for allergic reactions (like hay fever, urticaria) due to its non-sedating properties. While it can block histamine, it is not specifically used for motion sickness, as it doesn't have the same sedative or anticholinergic effects needed for preventing nausea.\r\n\r\nC. Loratadine – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nLoratadine is also a second-generation antihistamine, which is non-sedating and typically used for allergic conditions. Like cetirizine, it does not have the necessary properties to prevent motion sickness, as it lacks the anticholinergic effect necessary to address the nausea and dizziness caused by motion.\r\n\r\nD. Fexofenadine – Incorrect:\r\n\r\nFexofenadine is another second-generation antihistamine that is primarily used to treat allergic symptoms, such as rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. Similar to cetirizine and loratadine, it does not have sufficient anticholinergic properties to effectively treat or prevent motion sickness.",
