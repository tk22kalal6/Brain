      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nC is the afferent part of Basal nuclei\r\n\r\n• A is insular cortex (True): The structure labeled A is the insular cortex, also known as the insula. It's a deep-seated cortical region located within the lateral sulcus, which separates the temporal and frontal lobes. The insula plays a crucial role in a wide range of functions, including sensory processing, emotion, and interoception (awareness of the body's internal state).\r\n• B is biggest relay centre (True): The structure labeled B is the thalamus. It is indeed the largest and most significant relay station in the brain. Nearly all sensory and motor information (with the exception of olfaction) passes through the thalamus before being routed to the cerebral cortex for processing.\r\n• C is the afferent part of Basal nuclei (False): The structure labeled C is the caudate nucleus, which is part of the striatum. The striatum (composed of the caudate nucleus and the putamen) is the primary afferent (input) nucleus of the basal ganglia. Therefore, the statement is false because the caudate nucleus itself is only a component of the afferent part, not the entirety of the \"afferent part of the basal nuclei.\" The putamen is another major component of the afferent part.\r\n• D has combination of sensory and motor fibres (True): The structure labeled D is the internal capsule. It is a major white matter pathway composed of a dense collection of ascending and descending nerve fibers. It contains both sensory fibers (e.g., those from the thalamus to the cortex) and motor fibers (e.g., the corticospinal tract, which carries commands for voluntary movement from the cortex to the spinal cord). Due to its crucial location and the concentration of vital pathways, strokes or lesions in the internal capsule can lead to severe motor and sensory deficits.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nD – injury here causes loss of lacrimation\r\n\r\n• A is Post Sup Alveolar Nerve (True): Structure 'A' is the posterior superior alveolar nerve. This nerve branches off the maxillary nerve (V2) in the pterygopalatine fossa. It descends on the posterior surface of the maxilla to supply the maxillary molars, premolars, and the lining of the maxillary sinus.\r\n• B receives Vidian Nerve (True): Structure 'B' is the pterygopalatine ganglion, a major parasympathetic ganglion located in the pterygopalatine fossa. It is a key relay center that receives the Vidian nerve (also known as the nerve of the pterygoid canal). The Vidian nerve is formed by the union of the greater petrosal nerve (carrying preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the facial nerve) and the deep petrosal nerve (carrying postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the internal carotid plexus). These fibers synapse in the ganglion.\r\n• C – injury here causes loss of lacrimation (True): Structure 'C' is the zygomatic nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (V2). It enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure and gives off the zygomaticotemporal and zygomaticofacial branches. The zygomaticotemporal nerve carries postganglionic parasympathetic fibers that originated from the pterygopalatine ganglion (after traveling via the Vidian nerve) and then joins the lacrimal nerve. These fibers are responsible for innervating the lacrimal gland, which produces tears. Therefore, an injury to nerve 'C' (zygomatic nerve) can interrupt the secretomotor pathway to the lacrimal gland, leading to a loss of tear production (loss of lacrimation).\r\n• D – injury here causes loss of lacrimation (False): Structure 'D' is the infraorbital nerve, which is the direct continuation of the maxillary nerve after it exits the pterygopalatine fossa. The infraorbital nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lower eyelid, cheek, upper lip, and side of the nose. It does not contain the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers for the lacrimal gland. The fibers that supply the lacrimal gland are carried by the zygomatic nerve, not the infraorbital nerve. Therefore, an injury to nerve 'D' would primarily result in sensory loss to the regions it supplies, not a loss of lacrimation.\r\n",

Fick lawstates that the net rate of diffusional flux (J) of a substance is proportional to its concentration difference (&Delta;c). Doubling the concentration of protonated short-chain fatty acids outside of the enterocytes from 20 to 40 mg/L causes the concentration difference to increase by threefold from 10 to 30 mg/L. Therefore, the net rate of diffusion would increase from 10 to 30 mg/h. Short-chain fatty acids are released by the action of the colonic microflora on dietary fiber. These short-chain fatty acids promote survival of healthy colonic epithelium while inducing apoptosis in epithelial cells progressing toward malignant transformation.</p>\r\n",

According to the Nernst equation, the electrical gradient for K+ is inward and the concentration gradient is outward. Hyperpolarizing the membrane makes the inside of the cell more negative and therefore makes it more difficult for potassium to flow out of the cell. Answer (a) is incorrect because decreasing the extracellular potassium concentration would increase the flow of potassium out of the cell, as would increasing the permeability of the membrane to potassium (answer d). Decreasing the activity of the sodium&ndash;potassium pump (answer e) has no immediate effect on potassium efflux, but ultimately results in depolarization of the membrane, resulting in an increased flow of potassium out of the cell. Altering the extracellular sodium concentration (answer b) has no immediate effect on the flow of potassium across the membrane. Seizures are paroxysmal disturbances in cerebral function caused by an abnormal synchronous discharge of cortical neurons. The epilepsies are a group of disorders characterized by recurrent seizures. Benign familial neonatal seizures constitute a rare type of idiopathic epilepsy linked to autosomal dominant mutations of voltage-gated K+ channels.</span></span></span></p>\r\n",

(A) Cardiac muscle has automaticity, which allows the muscle to spontaneously contract without any electrical or hormonal stimuli. It also requires extracellular calcium influx through the dihydropyridine receptor (DHP) to open the ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum for substantial cytoplasmic calcium increases (calcium-induced calcium release). Therefore, because the experimental muscle tissue does not contract spontaneously and because it does contract in the absence of calcium, cardiac muscle tissue is excluded. (B, D) Smooth muscle tissue requires phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) for contraction to occur.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n• Defibrillate with 2 J/kg. (Correct): According to the Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines, the definitive treatment for pVT is immediate defibrillation. The recommended initial energy dose for defibrillation in children is 2 joules per kilogram (J/kg). Defibrillation is an unsynchronized electrical shock that aims to depolarize a critical mass of myocardial cells simultaneously, allowing the natural pacemaker of the heart to resume control of the rhythm. Since this is a life-threatening, shockable rhythm, defibrillation must be performed as soon as the equipment is ready.\r\n• Perform synchronized cardioversion with 1 J/kg. (Incorrect): Synchronized cardioversion is used for unstable patients with a pulse who have a tachyarrhythmia, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia with a pulse. The patient in this scenario is pulseless, making synchronized cardioversion ineffective and inappropriate. The initial energy dose for synchronized cardioversion is also different (0.5-1 J/kg) from the defibrillation dose.\r\n• Establish vascular access and administer epinephrine. (Incorrect): While establishing vascular access (intravenous or intraosseous) and administering epinephrine are crucial components of the pediatric cardiac arrest algorithm, they are secondary to defibrillation for shockable rhythms like pVT. The highest priority is to deliver an electrical shock as quickly as possible, as this is the only intervention that can terminate the arrhythmia and restore a perfusing rhythm. Medications like epinephrine are administered after the initial shock and in between subsequent shocks if the rhythm persists.\r\n• Establish vascular access and insert an advanced airway. (Incorrect): Similar to option C, establishing vascular access and an advanced airway (e.g., endotracheal tube) are important steps in advanced life support. However, they should not delay the primary intervention for a shockable rhythm. High-quality chest compressions and early defibrillation take precedence. Interruptions to CPR should be minimized to allow for these procedures.\r\n",

Maternal infection can lead to fetal hydrops, isolated pleural or pericardial effusions in the fetus, intrauterine growth restriction, anemia, and fetal demise. Pregnant women with acute parvovirus B19 infection should be monitored closely; fetal infection is thought to occur in approximately 30% of cases. Fetal deaths have only been described with maternal infections in the first half of pregnancy; they are estimated to occur in 3% to 11% of maternal infections before 20 weeks’ gestation.\r\n\r\nParvovirus B19 infections are often asymptomatic.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nEmticitabine causes palm and sole pigmentation\r\n\r\nZidovudine causes skin and nail pigmentation \r\n\r\n• Zidovudine (Incorrect): While zidovudine is an older antiretroviral drug known to cause hyperpigmentation, it typically affects the nails and oral mucosa more frequently. Although it can cause pigmentation on the skin, including the palms and soles, it is not the most common culprit for this specific pattern of symmetrical palmoplantar hyperpigmentation. The classic \"zidovudine pigmentation\" is often described as a blue-gray discoloration of the nails.\r\n• Emtricitabine (Correct): Emtricitabine (FTC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) commonly used in modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. A well-documented but rare side effect of this drug, particularly in individuals with darker skin tones, is hyperpigmentation of the palms, soles, and sometimes the nails and face. The pigmentation is often diffuse and symmetrical, appearing as a darkening of the skin in the affected areas. This clinical presentation precisely matches the image provided, making Emtricitabine the most likely cause.\r\n• Capecitabine (Incorrect): Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers, not an antiretroviral. While it can cause a similar skin reaction known as hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), this condition is characterized by redness, swelling, blistering, and peeling of the palms and soles, which can be quite painful. It is an inflammatory reaction, not typically a simple hyperpigmentation as shown in the image.\r\n• Nevirapine (Incorrect): Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in HIV treatment. Its most serious and well-known side effects are severe skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and hepatotoxicity (liver damage). While it can cause skin problems, it is not associated with the specific pattern of diffuse hyperpigmentation of the palms and soles.\r\n",

Hydroxycyclophosphamide\r\nmay be oxidized further by aldehyde oxidase, either in liver or in tumor tissue, to inactive metabolites. 4-Hydroxycyclophosphamide and its tautomer, aldophosphamide, travel in the circulation to tumor cells, where aldophosphamide cleaves spontaneously, generating stoichiometric amounts of phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. Phosphoramide mustard is responsible for antitumor effects, while acrolein causes hemorrhagic cystitis often seen during therapy with cyclophosphamide\r\n\r\nCyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent with antitumor and immunosuppressant properties. It is used for many solid tumors. Important side effects are cystitis due to metabolite Acrolein and bladder Carcinoma.",
