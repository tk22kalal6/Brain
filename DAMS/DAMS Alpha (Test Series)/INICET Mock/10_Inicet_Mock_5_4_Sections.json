The resulting accumulation of its substrate, ALA, has been shown to have a neuropathogenic effect, probably by acting as a &gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist in the nervous system.</p>\r\n",

Without blood flow pressures everywhere in the systemic circulation become equal and this equilibrated pressure level is the mean systemic filling pressure. Normal Psf is 7 mm Hg. Psf is the major pressure affecting venous return. The two main determinants of Psf are (i) blood volume, and (ii) sympathetic stimulation. Mean systemic filling pressure will increase with increase in blood volume. Increased sympathetic discharge will cause a decrease in venous compliance and increase the mean systemic filling pressure increasing the venous return. Therefore, a decreased and not an increased venous compliance will increase the mean systemic filling pressure. Parasympathetic stimulation has no effect on mean systemic filling pressure.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D) Facial weakness. Critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy are two separate disorders that frequently coexist. These occur in the setting of a prolonged ICU stay and are present in 50% of patients who have been in the ICU for longer than 2 weeks. These syndromes make it difficult for patients to wean from the ventilator and can prolong their hospital stay. Hyperglycaemia and use of IV steroids are also risk factors for the development of these conditions. There is usually a distal-to proximal gradient of weakness, which can be shown on electromyography and nerve conduction studies. If the patient survives the acute hospital stay, most recover in 3&ndash;6 months. Facial weakness is not seen in either condition and should point toward a different diagnosis, like Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, neuromuscular junction disorders, or possibly a central lesion</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. The EEG and clinical scenario are most consistent with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), formerly known as benign Rolandic epilepsy. In this syndrome, seizures typically start between 5 and 8 years of age and resolve in the early to middle teens. These episodes usually involve paraesthesia of the face followed by clonic movements of the mouth. This can impair the ability to speak, but not usually consciousness. Most seizures arise out of sleep and can secondarily generalize on occasion. The EEG demonstrates bilateral independent centrotemporal spikes with a horizontal dipole during sleep, best seen on a referential montage. Most epileptic spikes have a vertical dipole with the negative surface component and a positive component deeper in the brain. This type of phase reversal is seen in typical montages but not the referential montage. A horizontal dipole has both a positive and negative surface component, which will cause a phase reversal in the referential montage&mdash;a fairly unique feature to BECTS. Juvenile absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have generalized spike and wave discharges, not focal spikes as is present with BECTS. Autosomal-dominant frontal lobe epilepsy has seizures that arise out of sleep, but spikes are seen frontally without a horizontal dipole.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D) Administer hydrocortisone. The examination findings of central obesity, multiple bruises, striae, and round facies are consistent with Cushing syndrome, likely related to chronic prednisone therapy for myasthenia gravis. In this scenario, given that the patient has altered mental status and hypotension, one should think about adrenal insufficiency and administer stress-dose steroids. The onset of adrenal insufficiency in this case was likely prompted by abrupt withdrawal of steroids due to medication noncompliance. Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia, hyperkalaemia, and metabolic acidosis are also consistent with adrenal insufficiency. Plasmapheresis and IVIG are both options to treat a myasthenic crisis, but the patient does not have symptoms of myasthenic crisis. A correction of the electrolyte abnormalities is not the best answer in this case, as these will self-correct with the administration of steroids.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) The patient has a subacute presentation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to exposure to bird droppings and feathers at work. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that has a variety of presentations. Some people develop acute onset of shortness of breath, fevers, chills, and dyspnea within 6&ndash;8 hours of antigen exposure. Others may present subacutely with worsening dyspnea on exertion and dry cough over weeks to months. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis presents with more severe and persistent symptoms along with clubbing. If a specific antigen is suspected, serum precipitins directed toward that antigen may be demonstrated. However, these tests are neither sensitive nor specific for the presence of disease. Chest radiography may be normal or show a diffuse reticulonodular infiltrate. Chest CT is the imaging modality of choice and shows ground-glass infiltrates in the lower lobes. Centrilobular infiltrates are often seen as well. Histopathologically, interstitial alveolar infiltrates predominate, with a variety of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasionally eosinophils and neutrophils seen. Loose, noncaseating granulomas are typical.</p>\r\n",

Fibroblasts require vitamin C to produce collagen. The wound tissue formed in the early part of this phase is called granulation tissue. In the latter part of this phase, there is an increase in the tensile strength of the wound due to increased collagen, which is at first deposited in a random fashion and consists of type Ill collagen. This proliferative phase with its increase of collagen deposition is associated with wound contraction, which can considerably reduce the surface area of a wound over the first 3 weeks of healing.</p>\r\n",

Proximally, the nerve suffers traumatic degeneration as far as the last node of Ranvier. The regenerating nerve fires are attracted to their receptors by neurotrophism, which is mediated by growth factors, hormones and other extracellular matrix trophins. Nerve regeneration is characterised by profuse growth of new nerve fibres which sprout from the cut proximal end. Overgrowth of these, coupled with poor approximation, may lead to neuroma formation.</p>\r\n",

Common causes of obstructive shock include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolus or air embolus. In each case, there is reduced filling of the left and/or right sides of the heart leading to reduced preload and a fall in cardiac output. Cardiogenic shock is due to primary failure of the heart to pump blood to the tissues. Causes of cardiogenic shock include myocardial infarction, cardiac dysrhythmias, valvular heart disease, blunt myocardial injury and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac insufficiency may also be due to myocardial depression caused by endogenous factors (e.g. bacterial and humoral agents released in sepsis) or exogenous factors, such as pharmaceutical agents or drug abuse. Evidence of venous hypertension with pulmonary or systemic edema may coexist with the classical signs of shock.</p>\r\n",

Causes of endocrine shock include hypo and hyperthyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Hypothyroidism causes a shock state similar to that of neurogenic shock due to disordered vascular and cardiac responsiveness to circulating catecholamines. Cardiac output falls due to low inotropy and bradycardia. There may also be an associated cardiomyopathy. Thyrotoxicosis may cause a highoutput cardiac failure.Adrenal insufficiency leads to shock due to hypovolaemia and a poor response to circulating and exogenous catecholamines.

A mixed growth of aerobic and anaerobic organisms is usual. The initiating event causing bacterial proliferation is controversial. Obstruction of the appendix lumen has been widely held to be important, and some form of luminal obstruction, either by a faecolith or a stricture, is found in the majority of cases. Lymphoid hyperplasia narrows the lumen of the appendix, leading to luminal obstruction. Once obstruction occurs, continued mucus secretion and inflammatory exudation increase intraluminal pressure, obstructing lymphatic drainage. edema and mucosal ulceration develop with bacterial translocation to the submucosa. Resolution may occur at this point either spontaneously or in response to antibiotic therapy.</p>\r\n",

Capillary ingrowth then completes the healing process with f fibroblast maturation. Because only tissues that produce granulation will support a graft, it is usually contraindicated to use grafts to cover exposed tendons, cartilage or cortical bone.

If the biopsy is nondiagnostic, a repeat biopsy should be performed under imageguidance, typically with an ultrasound. An open or incisional biopsy should be avoided because of the risk of tumor spillage and cutaneous spread. Also, this approach is fraught with risk to the facial nerve.

On the third or fourth day of life, if the breast of an infant is pressed lightly, a drop of colourless fluid can be expressed; a few days later, there is often a slight milky secretion, which disappears during the third week. This is popularly known as &#39;witch&#39;s milk&#39; and is seen only in full-term infants. It is caused by stimulation of the fetal breast by prolactin in response to the drop in maternal estrogens and is essentially physiological. True mastitis is uncommon and is predominately caused by Staphylococcus aureus.</p>\r\n",

For this reason, FNA, which provides cytologic detail but not tissue architecture, cannot differentiate between benign and malignant follicular lesions. Diagnosis and treatment is therefore, by wide excision, i.e. total lobectomy: The remaining thyroid tissue is normal so that prolonged follow-up is unnecessary.</p>\r\n",

Medullary carcinoma may occur in combination with adrenal phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism (HPT) (usually due to hyperplasia) in the syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN-2A).

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) Disorientation, incoherence of psychic life and some degree of anterograde amnesia are features of all of these acute organic states. In delirium there is a dream-like change in consciousness, so that the patient may also be unable to distinguish between mental images and perceptions, leading to hallucinations and illusions. Usually there is severe anxiety and agitation. When stupor or torpor is established, the patient responds poorly or not at all to stimuli and after recovery has no recollection of events during the episode. In subacute delirium, there is a general lowering of awareness and marked incoherence of psychic activity, so that the patient is bewildered and perplexed. Isolated hallucinations, illusions and delusions may occur and the level of awareness varies but is lower at night-time. The subacute delirious state can be regarded as a transitional state between delirium and organic stupor. In twilight states, consciousness is restricted such that the mind is dominated by a small group of ideas, attitudes and images. These patients may appear to be perplexed but often their behaviour is well ordered and they can carry out complex actions.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) This patient has a long history of heavy, regular alcohol use and likely malnutrition. A common sequela of this is chronic thiamine deficiency, resulting in Korsakoff syndrome. Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by an anterograde amnesia; this memory impairment is often (poorly) compensated for by the patient&rsquo;s confabulation, or filling in the missing memories with false information. Wernicke encephalopathy, also called alcoholic encephalopathy, is an acute neurologic disorder characterized by ataxia (affecting the gait primarily), vestibular dysfunction, confusion, and a variety of ocular motility abnormalities, including horizontal nystagmus, lateral orbital palsy, and gaze palsy. These eye signs are usually bilateral but not necessarily symmetrical. Other eye signs may include a sluggish reaction to light and anisocoria (unequal pupillary size). Wernicke encephalopathy may clear spontaneously in a few days or weeks or may progress to Korsakoff syndrome. Korsakoff syndrome is the chronic amnestic syndrome that can follow Wernicke encephalopathy. The cardinal features of Korsakoff syndrome are impaired mental syndrome (especially recent memory) and anterograde amnesia in an alert and responsive patient. The patient may or may not have the symptom of confabulation.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) A rule of thumb regarding opioid withdrawal symptoms is that the shorter the duration of action of the drug ingested, the more acute and intense the withdrawal symptoms. The longer the duration of action of the drug being used, the more prolonged, but mild, the symptoms are. An exception to this rule occurs when an opioid antagonist (eg, naltrexone) is given to a person who is dependent on a long-acting opioid. In this case, the withdrawal symptoms can be severe. Clonidine can be used to decrease the autonomic and other symptoms of opioid withdrawal, such as hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, cramps, diarrhea, lacrimation, and rhinorrhea. It does not, however, remove the craving for the drug. Blood pressure levels must be monitored carefully if clonidine is used. Its mechanism of action involves binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the locus ceruleus that share potassium channels with opioids, thereby blunting symptoms of withdrawal. Methadone can be used instead of, or in addition to, clonidine. It is given orally, in one daily dose, and is very effective in ameliorating opioid withdrawal syndromes. Unless the patient will subsequently be placed on methadone maintenance, the dose will need to be slowly tapered over several days. Buprenorphine (a mixed opioid agonist-antagonist) can also be used in lieu of methadone. It is administered once daily but in a sublingual form and should be gradually tapered as well.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) &bull; The Na+ channel exists in three states: resting (R). open (O) and inactivated (I). &bull; The Na+ channel is in the resting state initially , but assumes an open state on stimulation , resulting in Na+ influx intracellularly. This triggers the action potential. Subsequently , the channel is closed by assuming an inactivated state. &bull; Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. &bull; Local anesthetic binding to open or inactivated channels, or both, is facilitated by depolarization. &bull; The fraction of Na channels that have bound a local anesthetic increases with frequent depolarization (eg, during trains of impulses). This phenomenon is termed use-dependent block . &bull; Put another way, local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency dependent, and is greater when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with infrequent depolarizations. &bull; Rate dependant block of cardiac Na+ channels in vivo is the reason that hydrophobic Las are more toxic than hydrophillic LAs &bull; It is considered that the uninoized base form of LA crosses the axon membrane and ionizes intracellularly. This cationic form then acts from within the cell to inactivate the Na+ channel.</p>\r\n",

The central finding shown is a <strong>clue cell</strong>, which is an <strong>epithelial cell</strong> densely coated with small bacteria, representing <strong>statement 1</strong>. This is the hallmark diagnostic feature of BV. The primary organisms responsible for BV are an increase in <strong>anaerobic bacteria</strong> and a decrease in protective <em>Lactobacillus</em> species. The associated bacteria, mentioned in <strong>statement 4</strong>, include <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em> (often implicated but not the sole cause), along with other anaerobes like <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> and <em>Bacteroides</em> species, all of which contribute to the shift in the vaginal microflora.</p><p>Diagnosis of BV can be made using <strong>Amsel's clinical criteria</strong> or a microscopic scoring system like the <strong>Nugent score</strong> on a Gram stain, making <strong>statement 2</strong> true. The Nugent score assigns points based on the presence of different bacterial morphotypes (large Gram-positive rods, small Gram-variable/negative rods, and curved Gram-variable rods) to provide a quantitative assessment of the shift in flora.</p><p>Regarding treatment, <strong>Metronidazole</strong> is the drug of choice for BV in all patients, including <strong>pregnant women</strong> (after the first trimester), as it's effective and considered safe for the fetus, confirming <strong>statement 3</strong>.</p>\r\n",

The serum screen is composed of PAPP-A and free &beta;-hCG and has a 60% sensitivity for Down syndrome alone. NT alone has a 70% sensitivity and when added to the serum screen, the two together have an 80% sensitivity. If the NT is increased and there is no aneuploidy, the fetus is at increased risk, in particular, for cardiac anomalies. The sequential screen is a test that combines the first-trimester and second-trimester tests.

Micafungin, caspofungin, and anidulafungin are echinocandin drugs that inhibit the synthesis of &beta;-(1,3)-D-glucan, a component of the fungal cell wall. Posaconazole and other azole drugs inhibit a P450 enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the lanosterol component of the fungal membrane. nystatin and amphotericin B bind to ergosterol and create pores in fungal membranes.
