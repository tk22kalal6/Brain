      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nOphthalmic nerve\r\n\r\nThe ophthalmic nerve (V1), a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), is the division most commonly affected in herpes zoster ophthalmicus. It provides sensory innervation to the cornea, upper eyelid, forehead, and dorsum of the nose. When herpes zoster reactivates in the trigeminal ganglion, involvement of the ophthalmic division results in vesicular eruptions along its cutaneous distribution — including the upper eyelid, forehead, and side of the nose. The characteristic skin lesions described in this patient (vesicles over the upper eyelid, forehead, and nose) are classic for herpes zoster involving the ophthalmic nerve.",

Consequently, its nerve supply is different from the other tongue muscles—it is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus of nerves via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). This sets it apart from the other intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue, which are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) and develop from occipital myotomes.\r\n",

Instead, it is a type of hyaline cartilage. Hyaline cartilage is characterized by its smooth, glassy appearance and is mainly responsible for longitudinal growth of long bones during childhood and adolescence. The presence of chondrocytes in lacunae, a homogeneous matrix, and absence of prominent fibers distinguish hyaline cartilage from fibrocartilage. Since the epiphyseal cartilage plays a crucial role in endochondral ossification and bone lengthening, it belongs to hyaline cartilage, not fibrous cartilage.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nBradykinin\r\n\r\nBradykinin is the most potent algogenic substance (pain-producing agent). It is released during tissue injury, inflammation, or ischemia and directly activates nociceptors (pain-sensitive nerve endings). Bradykinin binds to B2 receptors on sensory nerve endings, leading to depolarization and transmission of pain signals. It also increases vascular permeability and causes vasodilation, further amplifying inflammatory pain. Among all algogenic substances, bradykinin is considered the strongest because it produces intense, prolonged pain and also sensitizes nociceptors to other pain mediators such as prostaglandins.",

According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, the recommended sequence is:\r\n\r\nLight Blue (sodium citrate) – used for coagulation studies (PT, aPTT). Drawing it first avoids contamination with anticoagulants like EDTA or heparin that would alter coagulation results.\r\n\r\nRed (no additive / clot activator) – used for serology, chemistry, and immunology tests. It follows because contamination from anticoagulants would interfere with these assays.\r\n\r\nLavender (EDTA) – used for hematology (CBC, blood smears). Drawing after citrate and plain tubes prevents EDTA contamination, which can chelate calcium and distort coagulation or chemistry results if collected earlier.\r\n\r\nGrey (fluoride/oxalate) – used for glucose testing. It is drawn last because fluoride strongly inhibits glycolysis, and oxalate can interfere with many other assays if contamination occurs.",

One of the endocrine manifestations is hypogonadism. This primarily occurs because iron accumulates in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Specifically, pituitary gonadotroph cells are damaged, reducing secretion of LH and FSH, which in turn decreases stimulation of the testes. This results in secondary hypogonadism (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), and decreased testosterone levels.",

A KOH mount of plucked hairs and scalp scrapings is the quickest, least invasive and most useful initial test — it will show fungal elements (septate hyphae and arthroconidia) and whether the infection is endothrix (fungus inside the hair shaft) or ectothrix (on the hair surface). KOH is a bedside/clinic test (10–20% KOH), gives rapid confirmation of dermatophyte infection, and guides immediate management; fungal culture (Sabouraud) can be sent in parallel for species identification but takes weeks, so KOH is the most helpful first-line diagnostic test.",

It typically arises from the sphenopalatine foramen and extends into the nasopharynx. The clinical triad includes recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction, and a nasopharyngeal mass. Speech changes can occur due to nasal obstruction, but they manifest as rhinolalia clausa (nasal speech due to blockage), not rhinolalia aperta (which occurs due to velopharyngeal incompetence or palatal defects, leading to excessive nasal resonance). Hence, rhinolalia aperta is not seen in nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nMyopic Shift\r\n\r\nWhen deciding on an intraocular lens (IOL) for cataract surgery in a child, it is important to consider the natural growth of the eye. As the child grows, the axial length of the eyeball increases, which leads to a progressive myopic shift. This means that even if the refraction is appropriate immediately after surgery, the child will tend to become more myopic with age. Therefore, surgeons generally under-correct the IOL power (leave the child slightly hypermetropic initially) so that as the eye grows and the myopic shift occurs, the refraction becomes closer to emmetropia. This anticipated myopic shift is the key factor to keep in mind.",

This leads to changes that are localized to that limb, such as increased blood flow, swelling, a palpable thrill (vibration), or even ischemic changes in nearby tissues. Since the clinical signs are restricted to the left upper limb without systemic or widespread effects, a left AV fistula is the most likely cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Left Lung Abscess<br />\r\nA left lung abscess is a localized infection within the lung tissue, typically causing systemic symptoms like fever, productive cough, chest pain, and malaise. Although the abscess is on the left side, it affects the lungs and does not cause isolated signs restricted to the left upper limb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Bronchiectasis<br />\r\nBronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease where the airways become permanently widened. It mainly presents with symptoms such as chronic cough, production of large amounts of sputum, and sometimes hemoptysis (coughing up blood). It affects the respiratory system, not the limbs, and therefore would not cause clinical signs localized to the left upper limb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Right Hemiplegia<br />\r\nRight hemiplegia refers to paralysis of the right side of the body, typically due to a brain lesion like a stroke on the left side of the brain. It affects motor control, but on the right side, not the left upper limb. Therefore, it is not consistent with a finding that is limited to the left upper limb.</p>\r\n",

This happens when left ventricular activation and contraction are delayed, which delays closure of the aortic valve. The most common cause is Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB). In LBBB, depolarization of the left ventricle is delayed, prolonging left ventricular systole and hence delaying A2. During expiration, this produces a reversed split, where A2 follows P2. Hence, in this patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and chest pain, the reversed splitting is most likely due to LBBB.",

Additionally, the x-descent may be absent or blunted because atrial relaxation is impaired. Together, the pattern of absent x-descent and rapid y-descent is highly characteristic of constrictive pericarditis.",

The most common cause of post-operative thyroid storm is poor pre-operative preparation, meaning the patient has not been rendered euthyroid before surgery. If surgery is performed while the patient remains hyperthyroid, the stress of anesthesia and surgical manipulation can precipitate a sudden release of thyroid hormones into circulation.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSuperior pulmonary sulcus tumors, also called Pancoast tumors, arise from the apical pleuropulmonary groove located superior to the first rib. When these tumors involve the surrounding structures such as the brachial plexus, cervical paravertebral sympathetic nervous system, and stellate ganglion, they cause a group of signs and symptoms that are collectively called Pancoast syndrome. This is characterized by ipsilateral shoulder and arm pain, paresthesias, paresis and atrophy of the thenar muscles of the hand, and Horner&#39;s syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis).&nbsp;<br />\r\nPancoast syndrome refers to the collective group of symptoms associated with these tumors, which is secondary to the involvement of brachial plexus and associated chest wall, vertebral, or rib pain. Shoulder or arm pain with associated paresthesias along the medial half of the fourth, fifth fingers and medial side of the hand, arm, and forearm due to C8 through T1 radiculopathy are usually primary symptoms associated. Since they are apically located, pulmonary symptoms of shortness of breath do not develop until later, as the tumor begins to involve more of the lung.<br />\r\nPhysical examination findings include ipsilateral facial flushing and sweating due to the involvement of the sympathetic trunk and cervical ganglion. Horner syndrome with ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis may also develop with the further extent of the tumor.</p>\r\n",

The bacillus blocks the flea’s gut, forcing it to regurgitate infected blood into the bite wound, leading to human infection. Clinically, plague can manifest as bubonic plague, septicemic plague, or pneumonic plague. The presence of fleas and their close association with rodents makes them a key epidemiological factor in the spread of plague outbreaks",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adjustment disorder; provide supportive psychotherapy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) Adjustment disorder; provide supportive psychotherapy: The patient is presenting with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia following a significant life stressor (loss of her job). The symptoms have been present for 3 months, which aligns with the diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder. Adjustment Disorder occurs in response to a stressful event and is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that are disproportionate to the stressor. The first-line treatment for Adjustment Disorder is supportive psychotherapy, which helps the patient cope with the stressor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A) Major depressive disorder; start sertraline: While the patient has symptoms of depression, the context and duration suggest Adjustment Disorder rather than Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD requires at least 2 weeks of depressed mood or anhedonia, along with other symptoms, but without a clear external stressor. Sertraline, an SSRI, is a treatment for MDD but not typically the first- line treatment for Adjustment Disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) Generalized anxiety disorder; start escitalopram: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves excessive, uncontrollable worry about multiple events or activities, lasting at least 6 months. The patient&#39;s symptoms are linked to a specific stressor (job loss), making Adjustment Disorder more likely than GAD. Escitalopram is used for GAD but is not indicated for Adjustment Disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) Adjustment disorder; start sertraline: While SSRIs like sertraline can sometimes be used in more severe cases of Adjustment Disorder, the initial management typically involves supportive psychotherapy rather than medication. Medication might be considered if the symptoms are particularly severe or persistent, but it is not the first-line approach.</p>\r\n",

The anthropoid pelvis allows the fetal head to extend rather than flex, facilitating a face presentation where the occiput is posterior, and the chin is anterior. This configuration explains why face-to-pubis delivery is more frequently seen with an anthropoid pelvis.",

Because the left heart cannot support systemic circulation, surgical intervention is required soon after birth to ensure survival. The Norwood procedure is the first-stage surgery performed in the neonatal period. It involves reconstructing the aorta and connecting it to the right ventricle, while providing a controlled source of pulmonary blood flow. This allows the right ventricle to pump blood to both the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Subsequent staged surgeries (Glenn and Fontan procedures) are done later to optimize circulation",

CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, leading to defective chloride ion transport across epithelial cells. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that works by enhancing the gating function of the CFTR protein, allowing chloride ions to pass more effectively through the defective channels. It is especially effective in patients with gating mutations (like G551D) and improves lung function, reduces sweat chloride, and improves quality of life.",

Congenital or severe acquired hypothyroidism is a classic endocrine cause of epiphyseal dysgenesis. Thyroid hormones are essential for normal endochondral ossification and skeletal maturation. Deficiency of thyroid hormones during growth disrupts the ossification centers of the epiphyses, leading to characteristic radiographic changes such as delayed bone age, widened epiphyseal plates, and irregular ossification.\r\n",

Cyanotic spells (Tet spells) are episodes of acute hypoxia and cyanosis caused by sudden increase in right-to-left shunting due to dynamic infundibular obstruction. During a severe spell, the right ventricular outflow tract becomes so obstructed that pulmonary blood flow decreases drastically, leading to diminished or absent flow across the pulmonary valve. As a result, the characteristic systolic murmur of TOF may disappear temporarily, making absence of an audible murmur a key clinical sign indicating a cyanotic spell. Immediate management is required to relieve obstruction and improve oxygenation.",

In lunate dislocation, the lunate bone loses its normal articulation with both the distal radius and the capitate. Importantly, the lunate bone alone dislocates anteriorly (volarly/palmarly) into the carpal tunnel, while the other carpal bones remain relatively in place. This distinguishes lunate dislocation from perilunate dislocation. Clinically, patients often present with wrist pain, swelling, and possible compression of the median nerve due to the lunate bone impinging into the carpal tunnel. On X-ray, a classic “spilled teacup” sign is described, where the lunate appears tilted or rotated forward.",

In a supine position, blood in the pleural cavity tends to layer posteriorly and can obscure classic signs like a meniscus seen in an upright film. Instead, subtle signs such as increased opacity over the affected hemithorax, blunting of the costophrenic angle, or diffuse haziness are seen. In trauma patients, right-sided hemothorax is common with penetrating injuries to the right thoracic region. The clinical context of a stab injury, combined with the radiographic findings, supports this diagnosis. Early recognition is crucial as hemothorax can lead to hypovolemic shock if large and requires prompt drainage via tube thoracostomy.",

The image demonstrates a sclerotic bone with areas of lytic destruction, cortical irregularity, and possibly a sequestrum or involucrum (as suggested by the yellow arrows). These features are classic for chronic osteomyelitis, which is a persistent bone infection leading to bone necrosis, sclerosis, and periosteal reaction over time. Chronic osteomyelitis often presents with intermittent pain, swelling, and sometimes sinus formation. In young adults, it commonly affects the long bones such as the femur or tibia. The combination of radiologic findings and clinical presentation supports the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nA. Water has Hounsfield number: This statement is True. Water is assigned a Hounsfield Unit (HU) of 0 on the Hounsfield scale. This serves as a reference point for all other tissue densities. Substances denser than water have positive HU values, and those less dense have negative HU values.\r\n\r\nB. Unfiltered x-ray beam is used: This statement is False. In CT scans (and diagnostic radiography generally), filters are used to remove low-energy x-rays from the beam. These low-energy x-rays contribute to patient dose but not significantly to image quality. Filtering \"hardens\" the beam, making it more penetrating and reducing skin dose.\r\n\r\nC. CT head dose is 20 mSv: This statement is False. A typical CT head scan dose is significantly lower than 20 mSv. It's usually in the range of 1-5 mSv. 20 mSv would be an unusually high dose for a single head CT and might be more in the range of a complex body CT or multiple scans.\r\n\r\nD. First investigation for gallstones: This statement is False. The first-line investigation for gallstones is typically ultrasound of the abdomen. Ultrasound is excellent at visualizing gallstones, is non-ionizing, and is often more readily available and less expensive. CT can visualize gallstones, especially calcified ones, but it's not the initial investigation of choice due to radiation exposure and less sensitivity for non-calcified stones compared to ultrasound.",

IL-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), contributing to synovial inflammation, pannus formation, and joint destruction. By inhibiting IL-6 signaling, Sarilumab helps reduce inflammation, pain, and structural damage in patients with moderate to severe RA who have had an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) it is an important biologic therapy for RA management.",

By silencing PCSK9 gene expression in the liver, Inclisiran prevents the degradation of LDL receptors, thereby increasing the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. It is administered subcutaneously and provides a long-lasting effect, allowing dosing only once every 6 months. Inclisiran is particularly useful in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia who require additional LDL reduction beyond statins and ezetimibe.",

It works by blocking the CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, which are involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. By antagonizing these receptors, rimonabant reduces food intake, promotes weight loss, and improves metabolic parameters such as insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. It was primarily used for obesity management, although it was withdrawn in many countries due to psychiatric side effects.",
