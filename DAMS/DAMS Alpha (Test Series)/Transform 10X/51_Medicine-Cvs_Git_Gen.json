This compression results in symptoms such as fainting (syncope), low blood pressure (hypotension), muffled heart sounds (S1 and S2), and an absent Y descent in the jugular venous pulse (JVP). Pericardiocentesis, guided by echocardiography, allows for the drainage of the pericardial fluid, relieving the pressure on the heart and improving hemodynamic stability.</p>\r\n",

Vit B12 is absorbed from the ileum, which points to the site of involvement. The bloating described by the patient in the vignette is likely due to bacterial overgrowth. Diarrhea can be explained by the inability to process bile acids due to damage to the ileum, which is called &lsquo;Bile Acid Diarrhea.&rsquo; All these point towards a diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth syndrome.
