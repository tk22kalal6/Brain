This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and results from homozygous missense mutations in the UGT1A1 gene, leading to a partial deficiency of the enzyme responsible for bilirubin conjugation. The clinical presentation typically involves persistent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that responds to phenobarbital therapy, distinguishing it from more severe forms such as type 1.</p>\r\n",
