A keloid scar is defined as excessive scar tissue that extends beyond the boundaries of the original incision or wound. Its etiology is unknown, but is associated with elevated levels of growth factor, deeply pigmented skin, and inherited tendency and certain areas of the body (triangle whose points are the xiphisternum and each shoulder tip). The histology of keloid scars shows excess collagen with hypervascularity, and there is more type 3 collagen.</p>\r\n",
