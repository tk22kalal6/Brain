A patient who presents with symptomatic carotid disease and stenosis between 70-99% should receive a carotid endarterectomy. It has been found that patients over the age of 70 fare better with a carotid endarterectomy rather than stenting alone. When symptomatic patients present with stenosis between 50-69%, management depends on gender. Women should receive optimal medical management where men should receive a carotid endarterectomy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Patients with chronic kidney disease due to diabetes are prone to subtle volume expansion and low plasma renin activity, leading to hypoaldosteronism. Since aldosterone is the major hormone that promotes potassium excretion, hyperkalemia is the primary electrolyte abnormality. The disorder is typically associated with a mild metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate usually >17 mEq/ L). The other illnesses cause anion gap acidosis.\r\n",
