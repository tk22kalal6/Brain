It should be done within the first three weeks of life (after this period, it is difficult to distinguish between a congenital and an acquired infection). Since not all affected infants are viremic at birth, urine is a more reliable sample than blood.\r\n\r\nMost CMV transmission occurs in the first trimester. The risk of transmission is high in the third trimester. 90% of the infected babies are asymptomatic and have lesser chances of having late sequelae.\r\nThe clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice and microcephaly. Neuroimaging shows intracranial periventricular calcifications. One of the long-term sequelae is sensorineural hearing loss.\r\nThere is no definitive treatment for congenital CMV infection.
