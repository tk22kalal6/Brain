When the blood volume falls below the equilibrium, the renal—body fluid mechanism causes the blood volume returns back to the equilibrium point resulting in zero error and hence the gain of kidney in its ability to regulate blood volume is infinity. The degree of effectiveness with which a regulatory system maintains constant conditions is determined by the gain of the negative feedback system\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) \r\n\r\nGate control theory \r\n\r\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a pain-relief technique that aligns with the gate control theory of pain. It uses surface electrodes to stimulate sensory nerve fibers near the injury, primarily activating Aa and Abeta fibers. According to the gate control theory, non-painful sensory input can modulate pain signals at the spinal cord level. Sensory information from a given dermatome travels to the dorsal horn, where pain signals are transmitted through A-delta and C fibers. In contrast, Abeta fibers convey tactile sensations such as touch and pressure, and A-alpha fibers carry proprioceptive information.\r\nRewritten passage\r\nActivation of large-diameter A-beta and A-alpha fibers can suppress pain signaling in the spinal cord. This suppression is believed to occur through local lateral inhibition of interneurons within the dorsal horn. The gate control theory posits that this modulatory effect takes place at the substantia gelatinosa, a key region in the dorsal horn that acts as a gate to regulate pain transmission.\r\n",
