Fat necrosis results from the release of activated pancreatic lipases into the substance of the pancreas and the peritoneal cavity. These enzymes act on surrounding tissue to release fatty acids, which then combine with calcium to produce grossly visible chalky-white areas (fat saponification).",

Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CGG) in the FMR1 gene, leading to reduced expression of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). This results in neurological and developmental abnormalities, including intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and characteristic facial features. Down syndrome is characterized by trisomy 21 (an extra copy of chromosome 21) and typically presents with intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and other associated features. Turner syndrome is characterized by monosomy X (45,X), leading to features such as short stature and ovarian insufficiency. Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY), leading to features such as tall stature, hypogonadism, and infertility.",
