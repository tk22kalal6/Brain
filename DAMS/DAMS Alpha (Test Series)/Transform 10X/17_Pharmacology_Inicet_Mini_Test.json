      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of action of nitrates in prinzmetal angina is endothelium-independent coronary vasodilatation.\r\nPrinzmetal angina occurs due to vasospasm of the coronary arteries. Nitrates relax the smooth muscles of epicardial coronary arteries and relieve coronary artery spasm.\r\n\r\nIn the case of stable angina, the primary mechanism of action of nitrates is preferential dilatation of veins (by increasing cGMP). Venous dilatation leads to a decrease in the venous return to the heart (preload). This decreases the ventricular end-diastolic volume and thereby a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. The diastolic perfusion pressure (aortic blood pressure in diastole – left ventricular pressure in diastole) is increased.\r\n",

They should not be used in children under 10 years old; apply behind the ears at least 4 hours before travel and replace every 72 hours as needed. Oral scopolamine is also used, with a typical dose of 0.4–0.6 mg about one hour before travel and then titrating as needed (some guidelines suggest TID), though transdermal delivery is generally favored for efficacy. Cinnarizine (about 30 mg) is another option, given 2 hours before travel and 15 mg three times daily as needed, but \r\n\r\nit is not as effective as scopolamine and is only moderately effective. Promethazine can be used as an antiemetic, though it may have more sedative effects. Other drugs with minimal effectiveness include cyclizine, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, meclizine, and, in this context, proton pump inhibitors, ranitidine, or traditional ginger, which are considered ineffective for motion sickness.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe benefit of using noradrenaline in septicemia is that it increases the mean arterial blood pressure. It acts as a powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor and inotrope.\r\n\r\nNoradrenaline causes a rise in both systolic BP and diastolic BP, resulting in a rise in the mean arterial blood pressure. This increases the organ perfusion in patients in septic shock or cardiogenic shock.\r\nAnother advantage of noradrenaline is that it does so without causing tachycardia, which is often a troublesome event with \r\n\r\nother inotropes in critical care.\r\nOptions A and B: The rise in mean arterial pressure causes reflex bradycardia which is not a major contributor to the treatment of septic shock.\r\n\r\nOption C: Low-dose dopamine infusions and furosemide are used to increase urine output in critically ill patients\r\n",

Reduced antithrombin levels can lead to resistance.\r\n\r\nHeparin resistance is defined by the failure to achieve a therapeutic aPTT with daily heparin doses of 35,000 units or more, reflecting an actual blunting of heparin’s anticoagulant effect. The main causes include low antithrombin III (ATIII) levels (the most common), increased levels of heparin-binding plasma proteins (acute phase reactants), and faster heparin clearance (for example, in splenomegaly or liver disease). ATIII deficiency can arise from reduced synthesis (hereditary or hepatic failure), increased consumption (DIC, MAHA, or bypass circuits), or loss (nephrotic syndrome). To achieve therapeutic aPTT, higher heparin doses are often needed, and in cases of severe ATIII deficiency, ATIII concentrate may be required\r\n",
