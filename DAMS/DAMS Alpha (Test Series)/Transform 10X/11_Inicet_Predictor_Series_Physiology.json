      "solution": "Correct Answer (B) \r\n\r\nAccording to the law of Laplace, the DISTENDING pressure required to prevent collapse of an alveolus (P) is directly proportional to surface tension (T) and inversely proportional to alveolar radius (r), as expressed by P = 2T/r. Therefore, a greater pressure difference is required to inflate alveoli to overcome surface forces. Lack of surfactant will increase surface tension. Small alveoli collapse more easily than large alveoli. Lack of surfactant makes pressures different in large and small alveoli. \r\n",
