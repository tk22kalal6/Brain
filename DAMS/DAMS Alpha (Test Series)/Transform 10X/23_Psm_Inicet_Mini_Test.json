It is given to infants as early as 6 weeks following birth. The pertussis component of the vaccine is not recommended beyond 6 years due to the decrease in the severity of pertussis infection with age. 7 years of age onwards, only Td combinations are used.\r\nIt is given in 3 doses with an interval of 4 weeks followed by booster doses at 18-24 months and at 5 years of age. The dosage is 0.5 mL and is given in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh intramuscularly. The immunization can be resumed without repeating the previous dose in case of any delayed or interrupted immunization.\r\n",
