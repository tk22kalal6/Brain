Because somatostatin inhibits pancreatic and biliary secretions, patients with a somatostatinoma present with gallstones due to bile stasis, diabetes due to inhibition of insulin secretion, and steatorrhea due to inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion and bile secretion Most somatostatinomas originate in the proximal pancreas or the pancreatoduodenal groove, with the ampulla and periampullary area as the most common site (60%) The most common presentations are abdominal pain, jaundice, and cholelithiasis. Of tumours, &gt;70% are malignant, with metastasis to the liver or lymph nodes commonly noted at the time of diagnosis. They are rarely associated with MEN1 syndrome but are associated with Von Recklinghausen disease and pheochromocytoma. Diagnosis is confirmed by elevated serum somatostatin levels. Treatment involves complete excision of the tumour and cholecystectomy if there is no metastatic disease.
