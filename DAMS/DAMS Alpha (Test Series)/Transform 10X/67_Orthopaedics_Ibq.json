Multiple enchondromatosis is also known as Ollier disease. It is a tumor in the metaphysis of long bones. There is a failure of bone formation and broadening of unossified cartilage within the bone. This results in shortening and angular deformity of the affected bones with an increased risk of pathological fractures. Enchondromas are also known as Maffucci syndrome if it is associated with overlying soft tissue hemangiomas. 25% of the patients with Ollier&rsquo;s disease will develop sarcomas by 40 years of age.</p>\r\n",

This indicates Chance fracture. Chance fracture is also known as seat-belt injury or the jack- knife injury. This injury is typically located in the upper lumbar spine in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing a lap seat belt without a shoulder harness. The sudden deceleration causes flexion and posterior distraction of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axis anterior to the vertebral column.",
