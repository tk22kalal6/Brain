      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThe clinical scenario describes a patient with post-pregnancy hearing loss. The audiogram shows conductive deafness along with Carhart’s notch (dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz). These findings are highly suggestive of otosclerosis.\r\nOtotoxicity, Meniere’s disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL) and not conductive hearing loss.\r\nOtosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. It presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancy and menopause.\r\n",

The direction of nystagmus can be remembered by the mnemonic, COWS (cold-opposite, warm-same).\r\nThe mechanism for the nystagmus is the creation of a temperature gradient by the cold water, which pulls the cupula away from the utricle, causing nystagmus towards the oppsite side. As the horizontal semicircular canal is closer to the outer ear canal, most of the response comes from it and the nystagmus is horizontal\r\n",
