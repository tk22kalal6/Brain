Grattage test aids in its diagnosis.\r\n\r\nScratching (grattage) scales in psoriasis makes the scale appear more silver in color by introducing air-keratin interfaces. When the scales are completely scraped off, the basement membrane is exposed and is seen as a moist red surface (membrane of Bulkeley) through which dilated capillaries at the tip of elongated dermal papillae are torn, leading to multiple bleeding points. This classical pinpoint bleeding is known as the Auspitz sign.",
