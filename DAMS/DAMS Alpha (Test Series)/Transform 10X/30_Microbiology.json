Shiga toxin is a potent toxin produced by certain strains of Gram-negative bacteria, most commonly Shigella dysenteriae and some serotypes of Escherichia coli. Shiga toxin acts on the 60s ribosome in the host cell, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. This inhibition affects protein production within the host cells, particularly in endothelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, causing severe damage and leading to the characteristic symptoms observed in this patient.",
