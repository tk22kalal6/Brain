      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nThe given clinical situation suggests a cervical spine injury due to trauma. The patient should not be shifted and a portable X-ray machine should be used for radiography after neck stabilization.\r\n\r\nManagement in a trauma patient with a suspected cervical fracture involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Spinal immobilization with a rigid cervical collar and a long spine board is the immediate step in the management of blunt/penetrating cervical trauma cases. Sas\r\n\r\n2. It is followed by a gross assessment of spinal cord function by eliciting extremity movement. Tenderness over the injured vertebrae or the presence of a deformity is indicative of an associated fracture.\r\n\r\n3. Imaging is done by X-ray or CT. Portable X-ray machines are preferred to avoid further injury while mobilizing the patient. They are useful in visualizing thoracic and lumbar vertebrae but not the cervicothoracic junction. Cervical CT has been made the modality of choice in most emergency departments owing to the high quality of images that can be obtained.\r\n",
