Its exact etiology is unknown, and it results from an uncontrolled balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals. Symptoms may be vague but typically involve dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. Its diagnosis can be made by a characteristic distal narrowing on esophagogram, creating the classic “bird’s beak” appearance. Manometry is required to confirm the diagnosis and typically displays aperistalsis with a hypertensive resting LES that fails to relax with deglutition .High-amplitude waves, pressure, and prolonged contraction waves are characteristic of Nutcracker esophagus. These waves result in typically complete propagation and in LES relaxation. Uncoordinated peristalsis is present in diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). The normal resting pressure of the LES is between 15 and 25 mmHg\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nIntractable ulcer disease is defined as that occurring after an adequate duration of antacid therapy, documentation of eradi- cation of H. pylori infection, and elimination of NSAID use. In these patients, malignancy must be ruled out and a serum gastrin level should be drawn to evaluate for a gastrinoma. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is the triad of gastric acid hypersecretion, severe PUD, and non–beta islet cell tumors of the pancreas. Gastrinomas occur most commonly within the gastrinoma triangle as defined by the confluence of the cystic and common bile duct, the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum, and the junction of the neck and body of the pancreas. They are found almost equally within the wall of the duodenum as the head of the pancreas but not in the tail of the pancreas. Endoscopy often reveals prominent rugal folds, which result from the trophic effect of the hypergastrinemia. Fasting serum gastrin levels are usually elevated above 200 pg/mL, but a value greater than 1000 pg/mL is diagnostic. In the setting of equivocal gastrin levels, the most sensitive test is the secretin stimulation test. A rise in gastrin levels of greater than 200 pg/ mL above baseline is specific for gastrinoma. Gastrinomas are associ- ated with MEN I syndrome, not MEN II syndrome. Testing for associ- ated endocrine tumors should be performed.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nPJS is an autosomal dominant familial disease characterized by intestinal polyposis and mucocutaneous hyper- pigmentation. The polyps are hamartomas that are most fre- quently located in the jejunum and ileum, but they can also be found in the stomach, duodenum, colon, and rectum. It is gener- ally believed that their malignant potential is fairly low. PJS can cause intussusception or hemorrhage. Up to one-third of patients initially have abdominal pain and a palpable mass. Symptoms may be self-limited as the intussusception comes and goes. The diagnosis of intestinal polyps may be made with UGI and small bowel follow-through contrast studies, pill endoscopy, or at the time of surgery. Magnetic resonance (MR) enterography may prove to be useful as this modality becomes more refined. Surgery is indicated for persistent obstruction, frequent recur- rences, or bleeding. Surgical treatment is limited to conservative resection of the polyps through enterotomies or limited resec- tion. Only larger or intussuscepting polyps need to be removed. Intraoperative total endoscopy is the most accurate method of polyp identification\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThis patient has gallstone ileus. Gallstone ileus accounts for only 1% of all intestinal obstructions but is widely dis- cussed. It is caused by the passage of a large stone through a biliary– enteric fistula (commonly the duodenum) thus producing a bowel obstruction. Thus the name “gallstone ileus” is a misnomer since it is a true obstruction and not an ileus. The most common site of obstruc- tion in patients with gallstone ileus is the terminal ileum because of the narrow lumen at the ileocecal junction. The most common mani- festations of gallstone ileus are nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. About 50% of patients will have gallbladder-related symptoms. Plain abdominal radiographs can reveal pneumobilia, dilated loops of small bowel, and a calcified stone outside the gallbladder.\r\nGallstone ileus is treated surgically. Obstruction is relieved by milking the stone in a retrograde fashion and removing it through a proximal enterotomy. The segment of bowel at the site of impac- tion should be inspected for evidence of ischemia and necrosis. If an ischemic compromise has occurred, the ischemic bowel should be resected. Takedown of the biliary–enteric fistula and cholecys- tectomy may be done during the initial laparotomy. However, in patients who are not able to tolerate a prolonged operation, this may be deferred. Although many surgeons recommend cholecystectomy and fistula repair at some point, it is not clear that this is absolutely necessary, particularly in elderly or infirm patients\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThis patient’s presentation is most consistent with ulcerative colitis. In ulcerative colitis, the anus is spared, whereas in Crohn’s disease, the anal or perianal disease is the first manifestation in up to 25% of patients. The anal disease ultimately develops in 50%–70% of patients with Crohn’s colitis. Rectal involvement can be seen with both of these inflammatory diseases of the colon but is more common in ulcerative colitis (95% vs. 50%). The small bowel is extensively involved in approximately 50% of patients with Crohn’s disease, whereas “backwash ileitis,” a nonspecific dilation of the terminal ileum, occurs in about 10% of patients with ulcerative colitis and has no prognostic or physiologic implications.\r\nThe clinical features of these two entities are similar: chronic diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and fever. Bloody stools are quite common with ulcerative colitis and are much less frequent with Crohn’s disease. Removing the entire colon and rectum is curative in ulcerative colitis, whereas there is no curative operation for Crohn’s disease since it may involve any part of the intestinal tract. Total proctocolectomy for isolated colonic involvement of Crohn’s disease has the lowest recurrence rate of any operation for that disease, yet recurrence in the small bowel is still seen in more than 25% of patients. Moreover, one-third of patients require addi- tional surgery for such recurrence. Toxic megacolon can be an emergency, life-threatening complication of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, although it is more common in ulcerative colitis. Surgery for ulcerative colitis has two goals: eliminate the disease and provide reasonable GI function. Common surgical options today are total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy or proctocolec- tomy with sphincter preservation and IPAA. Yet, even when clinical and pathological findings confirm ulcerative colitis, recurrence or development of Crohn’s disease in the small bowel and especially in the pouch or anus occurs in about 5% of patients after proctocolectomy\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nERAS programs focus on many aspects of care of the surgical patient with the intent of decreasing pain and narcotic use, decreasing the length of stay, decreasing complication rates, reducing costs, and improving the overall experience. Many ERAS programs have risen in the setting of colorectal surgery. Due to the success of these programs, the concepts are being applied to other surgical specialties. Although there are variations in the details of the programs among institutions, there are well-established princi- ples. The major elements within these enhanced recovery programs include preoperative education, multimodal analgesia (the use of epidural regional anesthesia, maximizing usage of nonopioid anal- gesic options, minimizing narcotic usage), limiting perioperative starvation (preoperative complex carbohydrate drinks, early refeed- ing), limiting intravenous fluids, maintaining normothermia, and early postoperative ambulation. Setting expectations and psycho- logically and emotionally supporting the patients by dedicated per- sonnel helps.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThis patient has focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), which is often found incidentally on imaging or during laparotomy. FNH is a benign liver tumor that predominantly occurs in women in the third to fifth decades of life. It is similar to hepatic adenoma (HA) but with important differentiating clinical and histologic features and therapeutic implications. Both occur most commonly in women of childbearing age; however, HA is associated with the use of oral con- traceptives and anabolic steroids and is also seen in certain glycogen storage diseases. HA is usually symptomatic (80% of cases) and is associated with rupture and bleeding in a substantial proportion of patients, whereas FNH is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally. Furthermore, HA has the potential for malignant transformation, whereas the risk for malignancy in FNH is unlikely but uncertain. Histologically, HA consists of hepatocytes without bile ducts or Kupffer cells. FNH contains Kupffer cells along with a central stellate scar surrounded by fibrous tissue. Scanning for Kupffer cell activity with technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled sulfur colloid is thus useful in differentiating the lesions. Because of the asymptomatic nature of this patient, small size of the lesion, and negligible risk for malignant transformation, observation is appropriate. Surgical resection is reserved for symptomatic patients or when the diagnosis is uncertain\r\n \r\n \r\n ",

Repair at the time is preferable, provided that the surgeon is adequately experienced in performing such a repair so that a successful outcome is likely. Unfortunately, the weight of evidence indicates that most primary repairs by the initial operating surgeon have failed, thus necessitating repeated operations and other interventions. The initial repair of a major duct injury has the best chance for long-term success. A less experienced surgeon should not attempt anastomosis of a small bile duct but seek the help of an experienced colleague if available. Otherwise, drains should be placed and transfer to an experienced hepatobiliary surgeon arranged. If repair at the time is appropriate, the standard reconstruc- tion for this type of injury is a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Duct- to-duct repairs usually fail in this situation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nCholedochal cysts are a rare cause of RUQ pain and jaundice. They are more common in women of Asian descent and are usually diagnosed in infants, but may present in adults as well. They are premalignant lesions, carrying a 10%–30% risk of carcinoma, so observation is not appropriate. The most accepted theory of their pathogenesis is related to an anomalous pancreati- cobiliary junction, which allows pancreatic fluid to reflux up into the biliary tract. This results in chronic inflammation and cystic degeneration of the bile duct. This patient has a type I cyst, which involves fusiform dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tree and is treated by complete excision and hepaticojejunostomy recon- struction. Type II cysts appear as a diverticulum off the CBD and are treated by excision, as well as biliary-enteric drainage if an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction is present. Type III cysts, also known as choledochoceles, appear as intramural CBD cystic dilatation within the duodenal wall. Their pathogenesis is not clear and so treatment is directed at relieving the biliary or duo- denal obstruction (if present). This can be approached via a trans- duodenal excision or endoscopic sphincteroplasty. Type IV disease involves both the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees. Treatment depends on the anatomic pattern of disease. Type V disease, also known as Caroli disease, involves only the intrahe- patic bile ducts. Surgical treatment ranges from liver resection to transplantation depending on the extent of ductal involvement\r\n\r\n \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nLaparoscopic techniques for the repair of inguinal hernias were introduced in the 1990s and have gained mild-to- moderate acceptance, with less than 10% of all inguinal hernia repairs being performed via these approaches. The repairs are usually performed with the patient under general anesthesia, and the cost is considerably higher than that of an open approach with local anesthesia and sedation. Although there is controversy regard- ing its use for unilateral, newly diagnosed hernias, it seems ideally suited for recurrent and bilateral hernias, where the disability and technical difficulty associated with open (conventional) repairs cannot be overlooked. Laparoscopy can be performed totally extra- peritoneally by dissecting within the preperitoneal space or trans- abdominally. In either case, a preperitoneal repair is performed. Mesh fixation devices placed below the iliopubic tract risk injury to the genitofemoral nerve and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Placement of fixation devices is also avoided below the internal inguinal ring in an area known as the “triangle of doom.” This triangle is bordered laterally by the spermatic vessels and medially by the vas deferens. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nPriapism is a prolonged pathologic penile erection in the absence of sexual stimulation. There are two major types: ischemic (“low flow”) and non ischemic (“high flow”). In the ischemic priapism, the patient experiences pain, and blood gas analysis of aspirated corporal blood shows acidosis and hypoxemia. Ischemic priapism requires emergency treatment. Non is- chemic priapism is not usually painful and requires only conservative management and reassurance. Most cases of priapism are idiopathic. Some known causes are sickle cell disease, leukemic infiltration of veins draining the penis, and certain medications, such as anticoagulants and antidepressants. Frequently, simple aspiration of blood from the corpus cavernosum can resolve the tumescence. If this fails, irrigation of the corpus with a dilute solution of epinephrine or norepinephrine may work. This has the dual effect of decompressing the corpus and the venous obstruction that goes with it, as well as diminishing arterial flow. Papaverine is used to treat impotence. It increases penile blood flow by directly relaxing vascular smooth muscle. This is clearly contraindicated in priapism. The glans penis is an extension of the corpus spongiosum and is not usually affected by priapism. Shunts between it and the corpus cavernosa created with biopsy needles or scalpel blades or removal of a portion of the glandular corporal septum may provide a path of egress for blood trapped in the penis. If all else fails, formal spongiosum-to-cavernosum shunts may be created. There is a high incidence of impotence after priapism lasting 24 h or longer. When priapism is secondary to sickle cell anemia, exchange transfusions and other medical therapies, including oxygenation, hydration, and alkalinization, may be indicated\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nTesticular torsion occurs commonly in adolescents. The underlying pathology is secondary to an abnormally narrowed testicular mesentery with tunica vaginalis sur- rounding the testis and epididymis in a “bell-clapper” deformity. As the testis twists, it comes to lie in a higher position within the scrotum. Urinal- ysis is usually negative. Elevation will not provide a decrease in pain (neg- ative Prehn sign); a positive Prehn sign might indicate epididymitis. A 99mTc pertechnetate scan may be helpful in clarifying a confusing case; however, operation should not be delayed beyond 4 h from the time of onset of symptoms in order to maximize testicular salvage. This patient’s presenta- tion warrants immediate operation. The salvage rate for delay greater than 12 h is less than 20%. Both the affected and unaffected testes should undergo orchiopexy. The differential diagnosis between torsion of the testi- cle and epididymitis is sometimes quite difficult. On occasion, one has to explore a patient with epididymitis just to rule out a torsion of the testicle. Epididymitis usually occurs in sexually active males. Urinalysis is usually positive for inflammatory cells, and urethral discharge is often present\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D) \r\n\r\nRandomized clinical trials have demonstrated that breast conservation therapy and mastectomy are equally effective for most women with early-stage breast cancer. Thus, breast conservation therapy is the preferred approach for local therapy for most women. The primary reasons to favor mastectomy include the inability to excise all tumor in the breast (positive margins on re-excision or multifocal breast cancer) or inability to deliver radiotherapy (e.g., during an ongoing pregnancy or after previous mantle radiotherapy for treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma). In this patient, radiation therapy could be safely delayed for several weeks to permit completion of the pregnancy. Because the breast does not fall in the treatment area for radio- therapy for cervical cancer, this patient could safely receive breast radiotherapy. Family history of breast cancer may contribute to breast cancer risk but does not have an impact on selection of therapy for breast cancer once diagnosed. Breast conservation therapy remains an option for women with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, although some patients will opt for bilateral mastectomy. Finally, patient preference should always take precedence after a detailed informed consent discussion has taken place\r\n",
