This is suggestive of APL differentiation syndrome, an adverse effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The management involves glucocorticoids like dexamethasone.\r\nAlong with glucocorticoids, the other management of APL differentiation syndrome includes chemotherapy for cytoreduction and supportive measures. In severe cases, temporary discontinuation of ATRA is necessary.\r\n",
