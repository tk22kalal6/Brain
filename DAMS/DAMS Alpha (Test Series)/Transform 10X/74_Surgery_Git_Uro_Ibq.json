It is characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), thereby causing a functional obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction.\r\n\r\nThe patients present with a triad of dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. The dysphagia initially begins with liquid foods and then progresses to solid foods, halitosis is present due to the accumulation of food.
