      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) \r\n\r\nContinue same diet\r\n\r\nThe first trimester does not require additional calories beyond the usual diet for most pregnant individuals.\r\nAlthough pregnancy overall increases energy needs—roughly 80,000 kcal over the course of gestation—this excess is largely accumulated during the last 20 weeks. To accommodate this demand, a modest daily energy boost of 100–300 kcal is often recommended during pregnancy. Importantly, this extra energy should not be distributed evenly across all trimesters.\r\nThe Institute of Medicine (2006) suggests adding the following amounts to the estimated nonpregnant energy requirements:\r\n- 0 kcal/day in the first trimester\r\n- 340 kcal/day in the second trimester\r\n- 452 kcal/day in the third trimester\r\nIn summary, energy needs rise progressively across pregnancy, with small incremental increases in the second and especially the third trimester\r\n",
