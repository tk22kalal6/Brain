      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal laryngeal nerve is the nerve implicated in the inhibition of the cough reflex in an alcoholic. Alcohol can cause chemical irritation of the nerve and it is also a potent inhibitor of the central nervous system. The cough reflex is a protective mechanism of the larynx to expel irritants and keep the airway clear. Chemical or mechanical irritation of the respiratory mucosa stimulates the afferent internal laryngeal nerve, which is the branch of the superior laryngeal nerve of the vagus nerve.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
