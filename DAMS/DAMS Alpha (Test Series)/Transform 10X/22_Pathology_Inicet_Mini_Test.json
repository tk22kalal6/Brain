      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nIn iron deficiency anemia, transferrin receptor mRNA and synthesis rise. Iron from diet or circulation binds transferrin and is delivered to erythroid cells via transferrin receptors, which enable receptor-mediated endocytosis. Iron is released for heme synthesis; transferrin receptors recycle to the cell surface to return transferrin to circulation. Excess iron binds apoferritin to form ferritin for storage. Senescent red cells are phagocytosed by reticuloendothelial cells; hemoglobin is broken down, amino acids are reused, and iron is exported via ferroportin and taken up by transferrin.\r\n",
