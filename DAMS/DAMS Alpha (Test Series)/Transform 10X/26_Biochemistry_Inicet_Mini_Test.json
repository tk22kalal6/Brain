Phenylbutyrate diverts urea into an alternate pathway and reduces the amount of ammonia. Hence, acting as an ammonia scavenger. Other drugs that can be used to achieve the same outcome (ammonia scavengers) include phenylacetate and benzoate. \r\n",

The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are clustered palindromic sequences found in many bacteria. It is a form of acquired immunity to infection by bacteriophages which complements the system of restriction endonucleases and methylases. CRISPR uses RNA-based targeting to bring the Cas9 endonuclease to foreign (or any complementary) DNA. Within bacteria this CRISPRRNA-Cas9 complex then degrades and inactivates the targeted DNA. \r\n",
