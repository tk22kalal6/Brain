      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brugada Syndrome</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brugada syndrome is a genetic heart condition that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest and is characterized by specific abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. It is often caused by mutations in genes that affect sodium channels in the heart. The condition is more prevalent in males and is often diagnosed in individuals who have experienced unexplained fainting or arrhythmias.Key features of Brugada syndrome include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. ECG Changes: The most notable finding is the appearance of a &quot;coved-type&quot; ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3, which can be transient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Symptoms: Many individuals are asymptomatic, but it can present with syncope (fainting) or palpitations. In severe cases, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Genetic Factors: The condition is often hereditary, linked to mutations in genes such as SCN5A, which encodes a sodium channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Diagnosis: Diagnosis typically involves an ECG, family history assessment, and potential genetic testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Management: Treatment may include lifestyle changes, avoidance of triggers (like certain medications or excessive alcohol), and in some cases, the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for those at high risk of arrhythmias.</p>\r\n",
