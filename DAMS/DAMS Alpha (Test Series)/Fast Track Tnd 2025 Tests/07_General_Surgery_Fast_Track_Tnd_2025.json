This type of fibroadenoma is smaller in size and hard, (b) lntracanalicular fibroadenoma contains more glands which become stretched into elongated spidery shapes and become indented by fibrous tissue. This type of fibroadenoma is larger in size and comparatively soft.<br />\r\nThe pericanalicular fibroadenoma (hard) occurs in young girls between 15 and 30 years, whereas the intracanalicular (soft) variety is seen in middle-aged women between 35 and 50 years. The main symptom is a painless lump in the breast. It is a slow growing tumour and remains more or less same size for quite a long time. This may occur anywhere within the breast substance, though more often seen in the lower half than in the upper half.<br />\r\nOn examination, the swelling is not tender and without any rise in temperature. It is<br />\r\nsmooth, firm and possesses a well-defined margin. This tumour is not fixed to the skin or deeper structure. It is a highly mobile tumour without any tethering inside the breast substance. That is why it is often called a &quot;breast mouse&quot; or a &quot;floating tumour.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the discovery of the ER, all breast cancers were thought to be sensitive to endocrine therapy. Clinical trials and laboratory research established that only cancers containing ER (ER-positive cancers) respond to endocrine treatments. Furthermore, because binding of estrogen to its receptor induces progesterone receptor (PR) expression, the presence of PR correlates with response to endocrine therapy. The presence of both receptors in a tumor is associated with an almost 80% chance of favorably responding to hormone blockade. Recently, the uniqueness of tumors that are ER negative, PR negative, and HER-2 negative has been investigated, and these triple-negative cancers express proteins in common with myoepithelial cells at the base of mammary ducts and therefore are also called basal-like cancers. Women who carry a disease-associated mutation in BRCA1 (but not BRCA2) are much more likely to contract a basal-like cancer than other subtypes. HER-2 (or the erb-B-2/ neu protein) is a product of the erb-B2 gene and is amplified in about 20% of human breast cancers. Trastuzumab is a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the surface receptor and is an effective treatment for HER-2&ndash;positive tumors.</p>\r\n",

Damage leads to weakness of the tongue muscles and is tested by observing wasting and deviation of the tongue to the affected side. ● The lingual nerve (mandibular division of trigeminal nerve) provides sensory innervation to the tongue and also carries fibres of the Chorda tympani (facial nerve) that provide special sense taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears most frequently on sun-exposed areas, with two-thirds occurring on the head or neck; typical locations include exposed portion of the ears, the lower lip at the vermillion border, the paranasal areas, the maxillary skin, and the dorsum of the hands . Risk factors for cutaneous SCC include fair skin; light-colored eyes; prior actinic keratosis; xeroderma pigmentosum; and exposure to nitrates, arsenicals, and hydrocarbons. Other risk factors associated with the disease are chronic excessive sun exposure, immunosuppression, previous trauma, and burns. The aggressiveness of these cancers is related to the underlying cause, location, and size of the lesion. It is increased in lesions arising in areas of previous burns (Marjolin ulcer) or trauma and in lesions of the lips and perineum. Excision of cutaneous SCC, generally with margins of 4 to 5 mm, should be accompanied by frozen section evaluation of the surgical margins. These tumors are radiosensitive. Surgery is preferred for tumors arising in scarred, traumatized, or previously irradiated skin. Large lesions may require adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical excision. Mohs surgery may be used for lesions with clinically indistinct margins. Regional lymph node dissection for SCC is performed for clinically evident (palpable) disease<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If antibiotics are given to prevent infection after surgery or instrumentation, they should be used before bacterial growth becomes established (i.e. within the decisive period &lt; 4hours). Ideally, maximal blood and tissue levels should be present at the time at which the first incision is made and before contamination occurs. Tissue levels of the antibiotic should remain high throughout the operation and antibiotics with a short tissue half life should be avoided. Intravenous administration at induction of anaesthesia is therefore optimal, as unexpected delays in the timing of surgery may occur before then and antibiotic tissue levels may fall off before the surgery starts. In long operations or when there is excessive blood loss, or when unexpected contamination occurs, antibiotics may be repeated at 4-hourly intervals during the surgery, because tissue antibiotic levels often fall faster than serum levels. There is no evidence that further doses of antibiotics after surgery are of any value in prophylaxis against infection and the practice can only encourage the development of antibiotic resistance.<br />\r\nWhen wounds are heavily contaminated or when an incision is made into an abscess, a 5-day course of therapeutic antibiotics may be justified on the assumption that the wound is inevitably infected and so treatment is needed rather than prophylaxis.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two types of diathermy, monopolar and bipolar. The principle is used to coagulate, cut and fulgurate. The most common type is monopolar diathermy where normal electric current is converted into high-frequency alternating current (HFAC). In this, HFAC is passed through the patient&rsquo;s body tissues and returned to the machine by a large surface plate (70 cm2 ) called the indifferent electrode. The surface area of contact of the active electrode is small compared with the indifferent electrode; this concentrated powerful current produces heat at the operation site, thus exercising the desired effect. In bipolar diathermy, the HFAC passes from the diathermy machine down one prong of the forceps through to the tissue being held and returned to the machine via the second prong thus concentrating the desired effect on the small piece of tissue held by the forceps. Therefore, bipolar diathermy is ideal for patients who have a pacemaker because current does not flow through other tissues of the body. Accidental burns is more common in monopolar diathermy for the following reasons: the indifferent electrode may be incorrectly applied with inadequate contact, the patient being earthed by metal contact on the operating table, there may be faulty insulation of the diathermy leads and accidental contact of the active electrode may occur with other metal instruments in use.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-absorbable suture material should not be used in the biliary tract and urinary tract, as they would act as a nidus for a stone. Absorbable sutures should always be used when closing the common bile duct or placing sutures anywhere from the renal pelvis down to the urinary bladder. In closure of the abdominal wall, mass closure technique is the usual method. In this large bites are taken in short steps using nylon or polypropylene (non-absorbable) or polydiaxanone (PDS, slowly absorbable) sutures. The length of suture material used should be at least four times the length of the incision to be closed; this is to minimise the risk of wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. Knot tying, one of the most basic of surgical techniques, should be thoroughly mastered as sutures lose 50% of their strength at the knot. Suture materials are generally classified as synthetic (non-absorbable) and natural (absorbable). Synthetic suture materials produce minimal tissue reaction. Sutures from biological or natural material elicit tissue reaction and hence are unpredictable in their behaviour. The bodies of needles are round, triangular, or flat. Round-bodied needles gradually taper to a point and are designed to separate tissue fibres, as in intestinal and cardiovascular surgery. Triangular needles have cutting edges and are used when tough or dense tissue such as skin and fascia are to be sutured.</p>\r\n",
