Brachytherapy\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n•\tBrachytherapy is a type of internal radiation therapy where radioactive sources are placed close to or inside the tumor.\r\n•\tRemote afterloading is a technique used in brachytherapy to enhance safety. In this process:\r\n1.\tA catheter or applicator is placed at the treatment site.\r\n2.\tThe radioactive source is remotely \"loaded\" into the applicator after the medical staff have left the room, minimizing their exposure to radiation.\r\n3.\tOnce the treatment is complete, the source is retracted remotely.\r\nWhy not the other options?\r\n•\tTeletherapy: This involves external beam radiation (e.g., linear accelerator) and does not use afterloading techniques.\r\n•\tRadioactive iodine therapy: This is a systemic therapy where iodine-131 is ingested or injected to target thyroid tissue, without any applicators or loading mechanisms.\r\n•\tTargeted therapy: This refers to drugs that specifically target molecular pathways in cancer cells and is unrelated to radiation therapy.\r\n",

On MR spectroscopy, a lipid peak is characteristic and represents caseous necrosis within the lesion.

Explanation: &bull; FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is a specialized T2-weighted imaging sequence in which the signal from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is suppressed. This makes it easier to visualize pathological hyperintense signals, such as edema or gliosis, which are otherwise masked by the bright signal of CSF on standard T2-weighted images. Why not the other options? 1. T2-weighted image: o CSF appears bright. o Pathological lesions also appear bright, but without CSF suppression, subtle lesions near the CSF may be less apparent. 2. T1-weighted image: o CSF appears dark, but the overall contrast of tissues is different. o T1-weighted images highlight fat and are used for anatomical detail. 3.

Pulmonary embolism A 35-year-old male with a history of prolonged immobilization (a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, DVT) presents with sudden-onset chest pain and hemoptysis. The ECG shows the classic S1Q3T3 pattern, which is commonly associated with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The CT scan shows findings consistent with PE, such as filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. Supporting features for Pulmonary Embolism: 1. Clinical presentation: o Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis are hallmark symptoms of PE. 2. ECG pattern: o The S1Q3T3 pattern indicates right heart strain. This is commonly seen in pulmonary embolism but is not specific. 3. Imaging: o On CT pulmonary angiography (the shown image), filling defects or thrombi in the pulmonary arteries confirm the diagnosis. Other Options: &bull; A.

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Syndrome: o VHL is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign and malignant tumors, most commonly hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas. o Hemangioblastomas are highly associated with VHL and are typically found in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and retina. 2. Clinical Symptoms: o Severe headaches and difficulty maintaining balance (ataxia) strongly suggest a posterior fossa lesion, such as a cerebellar tumor. o In VHL patients, cerebellar hemangioblastomas are a common finding. 3. MRI Findings: o Hemangioblastomas appear as cystic lesions with an enhancing mural nodule. o The image shows a cerebellar lesion consistent with the characteristic findings of a hemangioblastoma. 4. Differential Diagnosis: o A. Acoustic neuroma: Typically involves the cerebellopontine angle and is associated with hearing loss and tinnitus, not ataxia. o C. Meningioma: Extra-axial tumor, often found near the dura, and less common in VHL. o D.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer - B. Chronic subdural hematoma : 1. Clinical Presentation: o Elderly Patient: At 76 years old, the patient is in a high-risk group for subdural hematomas due to brain atrophy, which stretches the bridging veins. o History of Fall: The minor fall 3 weeks ago is a classic antecedent for chronic subdural hematoma, as it often follows a delayed course. o Confusion: Neurological symptoms like confusion without a focal neurological deficit are typical in chronic subdural hematomas. o Antiplatelet Use: Aspirin use increases the risk of bleeding. 2. Radiological Findings: o The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped, hypodense collection overlying the brain, consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma. Over time, subdural hematomas become hypodense (low attenuation) as the blood ages and liquefies. Why Other Options Are Incorrect: 1. A. Subarachnoid Hematoma: o Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a sudden, severe headache (&quot;thunderclap headache&quot;) and is not associated with a crescent-shaped collection on CT. 2. C. Extradural Hematoma: o Extradural (epidural) hematomas are typically lens-shaped (biconvex) and associated with trauma causing skull fractures. They present with a lucid interval followed by rapid neurological decline, which is not the case here. 3. D. Diffuse Axonal Injury: o Diffuse axonal injury occurs in severe traumatic brain injuries (e.g., high-speed accidents) and is characterized by widespread axonal damage, not a localized crescent-shaped collection.</p>\r\n",

Radiological Findings: o The MRI brain (or CT in this case) shows a lesion with:  Rim enhancement on contrast.  Central hypodensity (necrosis) with surrounding edema.  This pattern is characteristic of a brain abscess. 3. Differential Diagnoses: o Neurocysticercosis:  Multiple cystic lesions with a scolex.  Usually associated with calcifications, which are absent here. o Herpes infection:  Involves temporal lobes.  MRI shows hyperintensity and enhancement in temporal regions, not localized abscesses. o Meningioma:  Extra-axial (outside brain parenchyma) lesion.  Homogeneous enhancement with a dural tail, not a rim-enhancing lesion.</p>\r\n",

Key Clinical Features: o The patient has a history of RTA (Road Traffic Accident) and presents with a low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) of E2M2V3. o Such a presentation is consistent with severe brain injury, often associated with DAI. 3. Why not the other options?: o Post-concussion syndrome (Option B):  This is a clinical diagnosis with symptoms like headache, dizziness, and cognitive impairment without visible CT findings. o Extra-dural hemorrhage (Option C):  This would appear as a biconvex (lens-shaped) hyperdense lesion on CT, typically localized. o Intracranial hemorrhage (Option D):  While it may present with hemorrhages, the pattern in the image (multiple small hemorrhages in white matter) is specific to DAI rather than focal bleeding. 4. Diffuse Axonal Injury Overview: o Cause: Rotational/shearing forces during trauma (e.g., RTA). o Findings on Imaging:  CT Scan: Small hemorrhages in white matter, corpus callosum, or brainstem.  MRI: More sensitive, showing abnormalities in the same regions, often using gradient echo (GRE) or SWI sequences. o Clinical Presentation: Low GCS, loss of consciousness, and poor neurological recovery.</p>\r\n",

Clinical Presentation: o Insidious onset of heart failure in an elderly patient is suggestive of a chronic process. o Symptoms are predominantly related to right-sided heart failure (e.g., peripheral edema, ascites, elevated jugular venous pressure). 2. Imaging Features: o CT findings often show thickened pericardium (&gt;4 mm) and sometimes calcifications. o This distinguishes it from restrictive cardiomyopathy, where the myocardium itself is the primary problem. 3.

Unilateral renal agenesis The MRI image demonstrates a uterus didelphys, characterized by two uterine cavities due to failure of complete fusion of the M&uuml;llerian ducts during embryogenesis. This condition is commonly associated with unilateral renal agenesis because both the urinary and reproductive systems develop from the intermediate mesoderm and share embryological origins. Why unilateral renal agenesis is the likely association: 1. Embryological Basis: o M&uuml;llerian anomalies like uterus didelphys occur due to developmental errors during the formation, fusion, or resorption of the M&uuml;llerian ducts. o Since the Wolffian (mesonephric) ducts are crucial for kidney formation, renal anomalies often accompany M&uuml;llerian anomalies. 2. Most Common Association: o Among all congenital renal anomalies, unilateral renal agenesis is most frequently associated with uterus didelphys.</p>\r\n",

Multiple myeloma. \r\n\r\nThe described findings are characteristic of multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy.\r\n1.\tFocal Osteolytic Lesions:\r\no\tMultiple myeloma commonly presents with widespread focal osteolytic lesions, as it involves the replacement of normal bone by plasma cells, leading to localized bone destruction.\r\n2.\tF-18 FDG PET Positive:\r\no\tPET scans show increased glucose metabolism in active myeloma lesions, which are metabolically hyperactive.\r\n3.\tTc-99m-MDP Bone Scan Negative:\r\no\tBone scans detect osteoblastic activity, which is typically absent in multiple myeloma because the disease is purely osteolytic, not osteoblastic. Hence, Tc-99m-MDP scans may appear normal or negative.\r\nWhy the Other Options are Less Likely:\r\n1.\tA. Metastatic Bronchogenic Carcinoma:\r\no\tBronchogenic carcinoma metastases can be FDG-PET positive but are usually a mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic pattern on imaging, and Tc-99m-MDP bone scans are often positive in metastatic disease.\r\n2.\tB. Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma:\r\no\tProstate cancer typically causes osteoblastic metastases, which are strongly Tc-99m-MDP positive, not negative.\r\n3.\tC.

Small cell lung cancer has a strong tendency to spread to the brain. Although chemotherapy is usually good at controlling the disease (at least for a while), the drugs have difficulty penetrating the blood-brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. Because of this, cancer cells that enter the brain have an opportunity to proliferate. Roughly 10% of people with SCLC have brain metastases at the time of diagnosis, while 50% will develop brain metastases during the course of their disease, according to a 2017 review in Current Oncology.Prophylactic cranial irradiation (\"prophylactic\" meaning preventive) is meant to reduce the odds of brain metastasis proliferation by preventing the growth of cancer cells before there are any signs or indications of metastasis.\r\n",

Achalasia: barium swallow study may be used to confirm oesophageal dilatation, in addition to assessing for mucosal abnormalities. Findings include: 1. bird beak sign or rat tail sign 2. oesophageal dilatation 3. tram track appearance: central longitudinal lucency bounded by barium on both sides 4. incomplete lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation that is not coordinated with oesophageal contraction 5. pooling or stasis of barium in the oesophagus when the oesophagus has become atonic or non-contractile (a late feature in the disease) 6. uncoordinated, non-propulsive, tertiary contractions</p>\r\n",
