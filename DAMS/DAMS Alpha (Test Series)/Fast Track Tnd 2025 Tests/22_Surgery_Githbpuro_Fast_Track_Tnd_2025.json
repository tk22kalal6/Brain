      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)  \r\n\r\nMost common cause of esophageal perforation is Iatrogenic\r\n\r\n•\tBoerhaave syndrome is a spontaneous transmural perforation of the esophagus resulting from a sudden rise in intraluminal pressure caused by an uncoordinated act of forceful vomiting against a closed cricopharyngeal sphincter. \r\n\r\n•\tMore than 90% of these perforations occur in the left posterolateral wall of the lower third of the esophagus. \r\n\r\n•\tThe Mackler triad seen in Boerhaave syndrome comprises of:\r\n\r\n1.\tVomiting\r\n\r\n2.\tLower chest pain\r\n\r\n3.\tSubcutaneous emphysema (50%)\r\n\r\n •\tHamman's sign (Hammond's sign or Hammond's crunch) is a crunching, rasping sound, synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium in spontaneous mediastinal emphysema produced by the heart beating against air-filled tissues. \r\n\r\n• Treatment: Early detection and surgical repair within the first 24 hours results in 80% to 90% survival; after 24 hours, survival decreases to less than 50%.",

Abdominal x-ray is likely to show several loops of dilated small bowel without air-fluid levels; and possibly a soap bubble appearance in the right lower quadrant, the so-called Neuhauser sign. Perforation or giant cystic meconium peritonitis calcifications are often noted. Most babies then undergo barium enema to confirm the diagnosis. \r\n\r\n•\tGastrograffin enemas (GGE) in the treatment of simple MI. All neonates with complicated and those with 2 unsuccessful GGE require operative intervention.\r\n\r\n•\tThe surgical management options of MI are varied and include : \r\n\r\n1) Enterotomy/appendicectomy with irrigation \r\n\r\n2) Enterostomy with/out resection\r\n\r\n3) Resection with primary anastomosis\r\n\r\n•\tTreatment of choice is Bishop-Koop (End-to-distal side ileal anastomosis with a distal end ileostomy which allows post-operative irrigation of the meconium pellets)",

The tumour arise from the argentaffin of Kulchitzky cells which lie deep in the crypts of Lieberk&uuml;hn and are derived from neural crest tissue.

This syndrome is due to the excessive production of a variety of gut hormones - particularly 5-hydroxytryptamine, but also histamine, kinins, catecholamines, and prostaglandins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, patients present with episodic facial flushing, watery diarrhoea, and abdominal cramps (due to serotonin), and may have pellagra-like skin lesions as a result of niacin deficiency.
