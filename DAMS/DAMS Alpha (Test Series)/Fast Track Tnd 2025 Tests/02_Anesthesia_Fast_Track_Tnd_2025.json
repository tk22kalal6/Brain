      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\n•\tDesflurane, especially when rapidly titrated, will stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.\r\n•\tA higher flow rate on the anesthesia machine can lead to an increase in the fraction of inspired volatile, which will yield more rapid titration of anesthetic. This rapid change in end-tidal volatile, rather than a slow titration, can increase HR and BP transiently.\r\n•\tIn this patient with a history of CAD, sympathetic stimulation should be avoided to prevent further ischemia.\r\n•\tWhile desflurane is a malignant hyperthermia triggering agent, it is unlikely given the patient's modest elevation in EtCO2, which is more likely explained by his history of OSA. The elevation in HR and BP are non-specific, and it would be much more likely to malignant hyperthermia with a much more rapid elevation in EtCO2. \r\n•\tThe non-specific nature of isolated tachycardia and hypertension are much more commonly associated with rapid titration of desflurane as opposed to MH in this scenario. \r\n•\tInadequate depth of anesthesia certainly presents as hypertension and tachycardia. However, it is much less likely in this scenario where the patient has no surgical stimulation yet as the prep is ongoing, and it has been 10 minutes since the stimulation of placing the LMA occurred. \r\n•\tIn addition, the patient's MAC is > 1, which is more than adequate given the lack of stimulation at this time. In fact, it is because of the rapid titration of the volatile agent desflurane which likely led to the tachycardia and hypertension. \r\n•\tAllergic or anaphylactic reactions are common with steroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs as well as perioperative antibiotics. \r\n•\tHowever, it is much more commonly associated with hypotension, tachycardia, and increased peak airway pressures. \r\n•\tThe Etiology of this patient's tachycardia and hypertension are much more likely caused by sympathetic stimulation from desflurane. The mechanism by which the sympathetic stimulation occurs is not fully understood, but rapid titration tends to increase the incidence of stimulation.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) AED stands for Automated External Defibrillator &bull; Public access defibrillation, which places AEDs in the hands of trained laypersons, has the potential to be the single greatest advance in the treatment of VF cardiac arrest since the development of CPR. &bull; Time to defibrillation is the most important determinant of survival from cardiac arrest. &bull; Survival rates after VF cardiac arrest decrease approximately 7% to 10% with every minute that defibrillation is delayed &bull; The automated external defibrillator (AED) is an electronic medical device. &bull; An AED can check a person&rsquo;s heart rhythm. It can recognize a rhythm that requires a shock. And it can advise the rescuer when a shock is needed. &bull; The AED uses voice prompts, lights and text messages to tell the rescuer the steps to take. &bull; AEDs are very accurate and easy to use. With training, anyone can learn to operate an AED safely. &bull; Children over age 8 can be treated with a standard AED. &bull; For children ages 1&ndash;8, the AHA recommends the paediatric attenuated pads that are purchased separately. &bull; In infants &lt; 1 years of age a manual defibrillator is preferred. Steps of using an AED: Step 1: POWER ON the AED Step 2: Attach electrode pads &bull; Place the electrode pads on the upper-right sternal border (directly below the clavicle) and lateral to the left nipple, with the top margin of the pad a few inches (approximately 7 cm) below the axilla (Fig). &bull; The correct position of the electrode pads is often illustrated on the pads themselves or another part of the AED. &bull; Stop CPR just before attaching the pads. Step 3: Analyse the rhythm Rhythm analysis requires from 5 to 15 seconds, depending on the brand of AED Step 4: Clear the victim and press the SHOCK button Before pressing the SHOCK button, ensure that no one is touching the victim. Always loudly state a &ldquo;Clear the patient&rdquo; message, such as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m clear, you&rsquo;re clear, everybody clear&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image-20250411142534-6.jpeg\" style=\"height:302px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image-20250411142534-6.jpeg\" alt=\"Solution Image\"></p>",

While most providers prefer to use them for patients who are breathing spontaneously, positive pressure ventilation can be provided with a well seated LMA.\r\n•\tLMA's do not protect against gastric content aspiration. Aspiration of gastric contents can be fatal.\r\n•\tThe difference between a 1st and 2nd generation LMA is in the cuff material and a separate access hole to the esophagus.
