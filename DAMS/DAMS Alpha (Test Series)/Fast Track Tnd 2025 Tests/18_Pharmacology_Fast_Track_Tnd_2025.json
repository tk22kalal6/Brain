Understanding the Clinical Scenario:\r\n\r\n•\tThe patient has atrial fibrillation (AF) with symptoms and an ejection fraction of 25%, indicating significant left ventricular dysfunction (heart failure).\r\n\r\n•\tThe choice of antiarrhythmic agent must be guided by safety in the presence of structural heart disease (e.g., heart failure).\r\n\r\nFlecainide:\r\n\r\n✓\tMechanism: Class IC antiarrhythmic that blocks sodium channels.\r\n\r\n✓\tContraindication: Flecainide is contraindicated in structural heart disease and heart failure due to a high risk of proarrhythmia and sudden death in these patients (CAST trial findings).\r\n\r\nDigoxin:\r\n\r\n✓\tMechanism: Increases vagal tone to slow AV nodal conduction, useful for rate control in AF.\r\n\r\n✓\tLimitation: Digoxin is not effective for rhythm control, making it inappropriate for this patient.\r\n\r\nAmiodarone (Correct Answer):\r\n\r\n✓\tMechanism: Class III antiarrhythmic with broad-spectrum action, safe in structural heart disease.\r\n\r\n✓\tIndication: Preferred for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure due to its low risk of proarrhythmia.\r\n\r\n✓\tAdverse Effects: Requires monitoring for long-term toxicities (pulmonary, thyroid, hepatic).\r\n\r\nSotalol:\r\n\r\n✓\tMechanism: Class III antiarrhythmic with beta-blocking properties.\r\n\r\n✓\tContraindication: Sotalol is not recommended in heart failure due to its risk of QT prolongation and potential worsening of left ventricular function.",

While effective against gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones are associated with adverse effects, including tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in older adults and those on corticosteroids. This specific adverse effect is unique to fluoroquinolones compared to other antimicrobial mechanisms of action, such as protein synthesis inhibitors, folic acid synthesis inhibitors, and cell wall synthesis inhibitors.\r\n",
