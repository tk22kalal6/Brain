      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hemiballismus<br />\r\nExplanation:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Option A (Athetosis) is incorrect: Athetosis is characterized by slow, writhing, involuntary movements, usually affecting the hands and fingers. It is commonly seen in conditions like cerebral palsy due lesion in Globus Pallidus, but it is not sudden in onset and does not present with violent flinging movements.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Option B (Hemiballismus) is correct: Hemiballismus is caused by damage to the contralateral subthalamic nucleus, typically due to a stroke. It presents as sudden, large-amplitude, flinging movements of one side of the body (proximal limbs). This matches the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Option C (Chorea) is incorrect: Chorea consists of random, flowing, dance-like movements that are more continuous and less violent than hemiballismus. It occurs due to lesion in caudate nucleus.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Option D (Dystonia) is incorrect: Dystonia involves sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal postures or repetitive twisting movements, often worsened by voluntary movement.
