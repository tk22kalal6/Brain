Trapping of water within the ear canal, trauma to the skin of the ear canal (from cotton swab abuse or hearing aid use), loss of the natural protection of ear wax, or exposure to contaminated water may also cause otitis externa.\r\n•\tIt is caused most commonly by bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common organism on the skin. This bacterium takes advantage of the chronic wet ear which has a lowered resistance to infection.\r\n•\tAny scratch or irritation will allow this organism to cause an infection.\r\n•\tOther causative organisms include Proteus, staphylococcus, streptococcal species and at times various fungi.\r\n•\tThe acute infection is characterized by severe, deep ear pain. The pain is usually either accompanied or preceded by itching. The external ear is tender to palpation and manipulation. The ear canal becomes red and swollen. There is rarely discharge or hearing loss associated with acute otitis externa.\r\n\r\nMalignant otitis externa\r\n•\tIs a severe, sometimes indolent, necrotizing infection that can become destructive and life-threatening as it erodes through deeper structures.\r\n•\tThe causative agent is usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa although other pathogens have been described.\r\n•\tInitial symptoms include severe pain and swelling of the ear canal and pinna with accompanying purulent drainage.\r\n•\tA mass of granulation tissue can be seen on otoscopic examination in the majority of patients.\r\n•\tFever and leukocytosis are frequently absent.\r\n•\tIf untreated, infection spreads to involve the surrounding structures resulting in osteomyelitis of the temporal bone, progressive cranial neuropathies, meningitis, brain abscesses or dural sinus thromboses\r\n\r\nOtomycosis\r\n•\tThe ear is a warm, wet, dark place. Fungus can readily grow here.\r\n•\tThe ear usually itches, and severe pain may occur.\r\n•\tTe commonest fungi are Aspergillus sp. and Candida sp.\r\n•\tMost commonly develops n chronically inflamed ear canal that has been treated with a variety of\r\n•\tantibiotics .\r\nAspergillosis :- the lumen is filed with large shed sheet of keratin that have a wet tissue paper appearance.\r\nCandida:- usually causes a greater oedema and maceration of the deep ear canal .The lumen may be filled by cured like material.\r\nFuruncle\r\n•\tAlso called as Acute Localised Otitis Externa .\r\n•\tSmall abscess which usually develops in hair follicals.\r\n•\tAppears as exquisitely tender small pimple\r\n•\tPointing with a demarcated pustule.",
