Therefore, the tubular fluid becomes progressively more dilute in these segments compared with plasma. ADH does not influence water reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Bicarbonate diffuses out of the RBCs, whereas the chloride diffuses into the cells to maintain electrical neutrality. The phenomenon, called chloride shift occurs due to a special protein called AE-1 present in the RBC membrane that shuttles the ions in the opposite directions.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Positive feedback usually promotes stability in a system</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Positive feedback in a system generally promotes instability, rather than stability, and in some cases even death. For this reason, positive feedback is often called a &ldquo;vicious cycle.&rdquo; However, in some instances, positive feedback can be useful. One example is the nerve action potential where stimulation of the nerve membrane causes a slight leakage of sodium that causes more opening of sodium channels, more change of potential, and more opening of channels until an explosion of sodium entering the interior of the nerve fiber creates the action potential. Feed-forward control is used to apprise the brain whether a muscle movement is performed correctly. If not, the brain corrects the feed-forward signals that it sends to the muscles the next time the movement is required. This mechanism is often called adaptive control.</p>\r\n",
