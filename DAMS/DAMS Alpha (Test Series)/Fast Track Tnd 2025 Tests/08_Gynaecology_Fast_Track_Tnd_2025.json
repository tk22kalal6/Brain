      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nAndrogen insensitivity\r\n\r\nAndrogen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) is a disorder of sexual development in which individuals have a 46, XY karyotype but develop predominantly female external genitalia due to a mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. In AIS, the testes produce testosterone, but the body cannot respond to androgens, leading to feminization of external genitalia and the absence of male secondary sexual characteristics.\r\n\r\nKey clinical features of AIS include:\r\n\r\n•\tPrimary amenorrhea (no menstruation) due to the absence of a uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina (Müllerian structures are inhibited by anti-Müllerian hormone produced by the testes).\r\n\r\n•\tNormal breast development (due to peripheral conversion of testosterone to estrogen). However, minimal to absent pubic and axillary hair due to androgen insensitivity.\r\n\r\n•\tPresence of intra-abdominal or inguinal testes, which increases the risk of gonadal malignancy (e.g., gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma). This explains why the physician warns the patient about a high probability of gonadal malignancy.\r\n\r\n•\tTanner stage 3 breast development suggests estrogen exposure, which is consistent with AIS, as testosterone is aromatized to estrogen in peripheral tissues.",

This is because early follicular phase (days 2–4) gonadotropin levels provide a more accurate assessment of ovarian reserve and hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function. On day 21, progesterone levels are commonly measured to assess ovulation, as this corresponds to the luteal phase in a typical 28-day cycle. Since gonadotropins are not primarily evaluated on day 21, this pairing is incorrect.",

Brenner tumors are typically benign, though rare malignant forms exist.\r\n\r\n2.\tSignet ring cells → Krukenberg tumor (2d)\r\n\r\no\tKrukenberg tumors are metastatic ovarian tumors, most commonly originating from the stomach (gastric adenocarcinoma). They are characterized by signet ring cells, which are mucin-filled cells that push the nucleus to the periphery, giving them a characteristic \"signet ring\" appearance.\r\n\r\n3.\tSchiller-Duval bodies → Endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumor (3b)\r\n\r\no\tEndodermal sinus tumors (yolk sac tumors) are aggressive germ cell tumors of the ovary that produce α-fetoprotein (AFP). They are histologically characterized by Schiller-Duval bodies, which resemble a glomerulus-like structure with a central blood vessel surrounded by tumor cells.\r\n\r\n4.\tCall-Exner bodies → Granulosa cell tumor (4a)\r\n\r\no\tGranulosa cell tumors are sex cord-stromal tumors that produce estrogen and are associated with endometrial hyperplasia or precocious puberty. The hallmark HPE finding is Call-Exner bodies, which are small, eosinophilic, rosette-like structures formed by granulosa cells around a central space.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\n1, 2, 3 and 4 \r\n\r\n1, 2, 3, and 4, as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) prevent pregnancy through multiple mechanisms. OCPs contain estrogen and progestin (combined OCPs) or only progestin (progestin-only pills), both of which act through different pathways to inhibit conception.\r\n\r\n1.\tThickening of cervical mucus\r\n\r\no\tProgestins in OCPs cause thickening of cervical mucus, making it hostile to sperm penetration, thereby preventing fertilization.\r\n\r\n2.\tMaking the endometrial environment unsuitable for implantation\r\n\r\no\tOCPs, particularly the progestin component, lead to endometrial atrophy and thinning, preventing the proper development of the endometrium. A thinner endometrium is less receptive to implantation, reducing the chances of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n3.\tInterfering with pulsatile FSH/LH surges\r\n\r\no\tEstrogen and progestin provide negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. This, in turn, suppresses FSH and LH release, preventing ovulation. Without an LH surge, the ovary does not release an egg, making fertilization impossible.\r\n\r\n4.\tImpairment of tubal motility\r\n\r\no\tProgestins alter fallopian tube motility, slowing the transport of both sperm and ova. This disruption decreases the chances of fertilization occurring within the fallopian tubes.",

The gonads fail to differentiate into testes, leading to a lack of testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). As a result:\r\n\r\n•\tThe Müllerian structures (uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina) persist, leading to an infantile uterus.\r\n\r\n•\tOvaries fail to develop properly and become dysgenetic gonads (streak gonads), which do not produce estrogen, leading to primary amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual characteristics.\r\n\r\n•\tGonadectomy is required due to the high risk of gonadal malignancy (e.g., gonadoblastoma).\r\n\r\n•\tHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is needed for the development of secondary sexual characteristics.",

Prevalence is highest between 35-45 years (Correct)\r\nUterine leiomyomas are estrogen-dependent benign tumors, and their prevalence is highest in women of reproductive age, particularly between 35-45 years. After menopause, when estrogen and progesterone levels decline, fibroids tend to shrink naturally.\r\n\r\n2. More common in nulliparous women (Correct)\r\nFibroids are more common in nulliparous women compared to those who have had multiple pregnancies. Pregnancy involves prolonged progesterone exposure, which may help regulate myometrial growth and reduce the risk of fibroid formation. Nulliparity, early menarche, and late menopause are known risk factors for fibroid development due to prolonged estrogen exposure.\r\n\r\n3. Display reversible shrinkage after treatment with GnRH (Correct)\r\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists create a hypoestrogenic state, causing temporary shrinkage of fibroids. This effect is reversible, meaning the fibroids may regrow once the medication is discontinued. GnRH analogs are often used preoperatively to reduce fibroid size before surgery but are not a long-term treatment due to side effects like bone loss.\r\n\r\n4. Requires to be treated only if symptomatic (Correct)\r\nMost fibroids are asymptomatic and do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), pelvic pain, pressure symptoms (e.g., urinary frequency), or infertility. Management depends on the severity of symptoms and patient preferences, with options ranging from medical therapy (GnRH analogs, tranexamic acid, hormonal therapy) to surgical interventions (myomectomy, hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization).",
