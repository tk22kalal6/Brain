In this example of “farmer’s lung,” the inhalation of antigens present in moldy hay such as thermophilic actinomyces or Aspergillus species are the causative agents. When exposure to moldy hay is stopped, symptoms and signs of farmer’s lung all tend to abate and complete recovery usually follows. In acute syndromes, the presentation is 4–8 hours after exposure.
