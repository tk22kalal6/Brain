According to Section 86 of MHCA 2017, any person who considers himself/herself to be mentally ill can request for admission in MHE under the section. The MHP may admit such person if he/she feels the illness is severe and the patient will benefit from admission. According to the act, the presence of NR/caregiver is not mandatory during the IP course of an independent patient. If admission lasts more than 30 days, it should be again informed to the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Supported admissions: A person who needs admission, however, has lost the capacity to make mental healthcare or treatment decisions, and hence needs high level of support from the nominated representative, can be admitted&nbsp; as a &lsquo;supported admission&rsquo;. The nominated representative gives consent for admission in this case. The MHRB must be informed within 7 days of a supported admission (3 days in the case of a minor or woman). The admitted person, his/her NR, or an appropriate organization may appeal this decision. If a Section 89 admission has to continue beyond its allowed maximum duration of 30 days and ongoing supported admission is required, this can be done under Section 90. At this stage, the MHRB should be informed, and they must review the admission within 21 days and either permit the admission or order discharge of the individual. These reviews of a supported admission continue at a maximum frequency of 180 days.</p>\r\n",

TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● Tuberculin Skin testing PPD (RT23)is used. The greatest limitation of PPD is its lack of mycobacterial species specificity, a property due to the large number of proteins in this product that are highly conserved in the various species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- It probably measures the response to antigenic stimulation by T cells that reside in the skin rather than the response of re circulating memory T cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-The test is of limited value in the diagnosis of active TB because of its relatively low sensitivity and specificity and its inability to discriminate between LTBI and active disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- False-positive reactions may be caused by infections with non tuberculous mycobacteria and by BCG vaccination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Repeated TST can produce larger reaction sizes due to either boosting or true conversion. The &ldquo;boosting phenomenon&rdquo; is a spurious TST conversion resulting from boosting of reactivity on subsequent TST 1&ndash;5 weeks after the initial test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● IFN-&gamma; Release Assays:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The T-SPOT TB and the QuantiFERON TB Gold are two in vitro assays that measure T cell release of IFN-&gamma; in response to stimulation with the highly TB-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- These tests likely measure the response of recirculating memory T cells to persisting bacilli producing antigenic signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● Potential advantages of IGRAs include</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- More specific than the TST &amp; less cross-reactivity due to BCG vaccination and sensitization by NTM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The need for fewer patient visits to complete testing,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Avoidance of subjective measurements such as skin induration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In view of higher costs and increased technical requirements, the WHO does not recommend the replacement of the TST by IGRAs in low- and middle-income countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Because of the paucity of data on the use of IGRAs in children, the TST is preferred for LTBI testing of children under age 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- IGRAs have only modest predictive value for incident active TB, are not useful in identifying patients with the highest risk of progression toward disease, and cannot be used for diagnosis of active TB.</p>\r\n",

Half of healthy adults with Babesia infection are asymptomatic. When people do develop symptoms, the most common are fever and hemolytic anemia, symptoms that are similar to those of malaria. In more severe cases, symptoms similar to malaria occur, with fevers up to 40.5 &deg;C (105 &deg;F), shaking chills, and severe anemia (hemolytic anemia). Organ failure may follow, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis in people who have had a splenectomy can occur rapidly, consistent with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. Severe cases are also more likely to occur in the very young, very old, and persons with immunodeficiency, such as HIV/AIDS patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The smear shows hemozoin deficient trophozoites and is diagnostic.&nbsp; In mild-to-moderate babesiosis, the treatment of choice is a combination of atovaquone and azithromycin. The standard course is 7 to 10 days, but this is extended to at least 6 weeks in people with relapsing disease. In severe babesiosis, the combination of clindamycin and quinine is preferred. In life-threatening cases, exchange transfusion is performed.</p>\r\n",

In most insulin-sensitive tissues, glucose increases glucose transport by enhancing the facilitated diffusion of glucose down a concentration gradient. In the liver, where glucose freely permeates the cell membrane, glucose uptake is increased because of phosphorylation by glucokinase. Formation of gloucose-6-phosphate reduces the intracellular concentration of free glucose and maintains the concentration gradient favouring movement of glucose into the cell.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The infant in the vignette, with obtundation after prolonged overnight fasting and hypoglycemia with lactic acidosis and ketosis, most likely has a glycogen storage disorder (GSD). Glycogen storage disease type 1a (also known as von Gierke disease) is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase. This type often presents in infancy and results in hepatomegaly, growth failure, and recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia with ketosis. Although some neonates with glycogen storage disease present with severe hypoglycemia, it is more common for infants aged 3 to 4 months to manifest hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, hypoglycemic seizures, or a combination of these. Additional laboratory abnormalities include elevated uric acid levels and hyperlipidemia. The physical findings of chubby cheeks, a short nose, and a relatively small chin are nonspecific but can be found in children with GSD. The diagnosis is made by means of genetic analysis identifying pathologic variants in specific genes, including G6PC, SLC37A4, or both. These genes encode for glucose-6-phosphatase activity and glucose-6-phosphate exchanger SLC37A4 activity, respectively.</p>\r\n",

Trisomy 18 is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation and by congenital cardiac, ocular, and renal anomalies. Dysmorphic features include small jaw, clenched hands with overlapping fingers (index overlapping the third, fifth overlapping the fourth), short sternum, and hypoplastic nails. The majority of pregnancies affected by trisomy 18 result in fetal loss during the first trimester. Infants who make it to term have a high rate of infant mortality, with one-half not surviving 1 week and only 5% to 10% living beyond the first year after birth. Care of neonates with trisomy 18 involves a multidisciplinary approach with emphasis on growth and feeding, development, respiratory requirements, and specialty-specific care according to the congenital anomalies. The most frequent causes of death include central apnea, complications of cardiac malformations, and respiratory failure related to obstruction and aspiration.</p>\r\n",

An elevated IRT is a sensitive but not a specific screen for CF; further diagnostic testing with a sweat chloride test is necessary. It would, therefore, not be appropriate to notify the neonate&rsquo;s parents of a diagnosis at this time. Early identification and treatment of CF has been associated with maximal growth and improved lung function; it would not be appropriate to wait for the 2-month health supervision visit to address this laboratory result. Although false-positive IRT elevations can occur, especially in premature or ill neonates, follow-up testing is necessary before any result can be labeled a false positive. The most appropriate next step is to schedule diagnostic testing with a sweat chloride test.</p>\r\n",
