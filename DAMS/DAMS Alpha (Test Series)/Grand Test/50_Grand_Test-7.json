This patient is exhibiting the classic &quot;gluteus medius gait,&quot; i.e. the hip dips downward when the ipsilateral foot is lifted off of the ground. This gait is observed when there is injury to the superior gluteal nerve or to the gluteus medius muscle itself. The superior gluteal nerve is derived from the L4-S1 ventral rami and leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the level of the piriformis. Injection in the superomedial quadrant of the buttock is likely to injure this nerve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/gt-186(1).jpg\" style=\"height:490px; width:437px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A) \r\n\r\nDelusions of all types can present in bipolar disorder, as they do in schizophrenia. Family history of affective disorders is not uncommon in patients with schizophrenia, invalidating this aspect as a strong feature to differentiate the two major psychoses. Cannabis use and religious hallucinations can also occur in bipolar disorder. Ever since Kraeplinian concept of dementia praecox was introduced, one reasonable, though not always reliable, feature that differentiates these two illnesses is the absence of interepisodic residual symptoms in bipolar disorder. In the majority of patients with schizophrenia signifi cant impairment is noted even between full-blown psychotic episodes. But note that residual cognitive impairment is increasingly noted in euthymic bipolar patients.\r\n",

Phlegmasia alba dolens is caused by massive thrombosis of the iliofemoral veins that obliterates the major deep venous channel of the extremity with sparing of collateral veins. It is char- acterized by pitting edema of the entire lower extremity, tenderness in the inguinal area, and a pale extremity sec- ondary to arterial occlusion (see Fig. 29-8). There is no associated cyanosis.\r\nWhen the thrombosis extends to the collateral veins, massive fluid sequestration and more significant edema ensue, resulting in phlegmasia cerulea dolens. The affected extremity in phlegmasia cerulea dolens is extremely painful, edematous, and cyanotic, and arte- rial insufficiency or compartment syndrome may be present.\r\n",

The zone of stasis refers to the immediately surrounding region and is characterized by constricted vessels and hypoxia. Initially viable, this tissue may convert to coagulation or a full-thickness injury as a result of edema, infection, or shock with decreased perfusion. The zone of stasis may remain viable if adequately perfused. In a patient with a large-TBSA burn, the viability of this zone may be critical in providing donor sites and reducing the total area that requires grafting. The zone of hyperemia surrounding this is characterized by vasodilation as a result of inflammatory mediators and is viable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/image(4163).png\" style=\"height:271px; width:494px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Intestinal ischemia develops when a patent inferior mesenteric artery is ligated in the setting of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or bilateral hypogastric artery occlusion. Ligation of the IMA too far from the aorta can also interfere with the collateral blood supply to the rectosigmoid and lead to ischemia. Abdominal distention, fever, elevation of white blood cell count, and/or bloody diarrhea in the postoperative period should raise suspicion for colon ischemia. The best study to evaluate the sigmoid and rectum is sigmoidoscopy. Barium enema is not as accurate as sigmoidoscopy in determining depth of injury and carries grave risks of contamination by barium and feces if perforation occurs. CT, MRI, and aortography are not useful in evaluating the colon for early ischemia.\r\n",

Thymomas are the most common tumors arising in the anterior mediastinum. They occur in patients of all ages, and approximately one-half of patients are symptomatic because of compression of mediastinal structures (e.g., pain, cough, superior vena cava syndrome) or associated paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplastic syndromes can be identified in up to 70% of patients with thymoma but are uncommon in patients with thymic carcinoma. Myasthenia gravis is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with thymoma, although a wide variety of other syndromes, primarily caused by autoimmune dysregulation, have been reported. Small cell lung cancer typically presents with a central lung mass and bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and nearly all patients have a history of tobacco use. Pericardial cysts occur primarily in the middle mediastinum and, in adults, are usually asymptomatic. NSGCTs occur predominantly in young men, and 80% to 85% are associated with elevations of  -fetoprotein and/or -hCG. \r\n",

However, early-onset diffuse gastric cancers have been described and linked to the E-cadherin/CDH1 locus on 16q and associated with mutations in this gene, which may be the case in this family. This seminal finding has been confirmed in other studies with gastric cancers at a relatively high (67% to 83%) penetrance rate. Thus, E-cadherin mutation testing should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. In fact, prophylactic gastrectomy should be considered strongly in families with germ line E-cadherin mutation even without gross mucosal abnormalities on endoscopic examination of the stomach. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) involves germ line mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes. Gastric adenocarcinoma may be observed in families with HNPCC.  \r\n",

Between 70 and 100% of patients with DH have abnormalities in the jejunal mucosa, but most are asymptomatic.

Radiation.\r\n\r\n3. Embolization.\r\n\r\n4. Combination of the above techniques.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL APPROACHES TO GLOMUS TUMOURS\r\n\r\n1. Transcanal approach. Suited for limited glomus tympanicum tumour where entire circumference of the tumour is visible, only tympanotomy will suffice.\r\n\r\n2. Hypotympanic approach. Suited for tumours limited to promontory with extension to hypotympanum but not into the mastoid. A superiorly based tympanomeatal flap is raised by postauricular approach. Bony inferior tympanic ring is drilled away to see the lower limit of tumour.\r\n\r\n3. Extended facial recess approach. Used for glomus tympanicum extending into mastoid but not into the jugular bulb. If extensive, modified radical operation is done.\r\n\r\n4. Mastoid-neck approach. Used for glomus jugulare tumours not extending to internal carotid artery, posterior cranial fossa or neck.\r\n\r\n5. Infratemporal fossa approach of Fisch. Used for large glomus jugulare tumours.\r\n\r\n6. Transcondylar approach. Used for tumours extending towards foramen magnum. Usually they are recurrent glomus jugulare tumours. It gives approach to craniocervical junction with exposure of occipital condyle and jugular tubercle.\r\n\r\nRadiation treatment does not cure the tumour but may reduce its vascularity and arrest its growth. Radiation is used for inoperable tumours, residual tumours, recurrences after surgery or for older individuals where extensive skull base surgery is not indicated.\r\n\r\nEmbolization is used to reduce the vascularity of tumour before surgery or is the sole treatment in the inoperable patients who have received radiation.",

A low serum iron, low ferritin, and high iron-binding capacity are diagnostic of iron-deficiency anemia. Most iron-deficiency anemia is explained by blood loss. The patient’s symptoms of constipation point to blood loss from the lower GI tract. Colonoscopy would be the highest-yield procedure. Even patients without GI symptoms who have no obvious explanation (such as menstrual blood loss or multiple prior pregnancies in women) for their iron deficiency should be worked up for GI blood loss. Folate deficiency presents as a megaloblastic anemia with macrocytosis (large, oval-shaped red cells) and hypersegmentation of the polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead poisoning can cause a microcytic hypochromic anemia, but this would not be associated with the abnormal iron studies and low ferritin seen in this patient. Basophilic stippling or target cells seen on the peripheral blood smear would be important clues to the presence of lead poisoning. Although a bone marrow examination will prove the diagnosis by the absence of stainable iron in the marrow, the diagnosis of iron deficiency is clear from the serum studies. ",

TTP is an acute life-threatening disorder that is characterized by the pentad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, nonimmune thrombocytopenia, fever, renal insufficiency, and CNS involvement (confusion or multifocal encephalopathy). TTP may be triggered by endothelial damage and is associated with deficiency of a plasma protein (ADAMTS 13) that breaks down multimers of von Willebrand factor. Plasma exchange (with the infusion of fresh frozen plasma to provide the missing ADAMTS 13 protein) can be lifesaving. The hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), often associated with Shiga toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7, is similar but is usually not accompanied by CNS changes. Renal failure is usually more severe in HUS. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with sepsis can resemble TTP, but the coagulation pathway is usually activated in DIC. In TTP the prothrombin time, PTT, and fibrinogen level are normal. Antiplatelet antibodies are associated with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but this patient has multiple abnormalities, not just thrombocytopenia.&nbsp;",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nMR scan with gadolinium contrast\r\n\r\nThis patient’s symptoms and signs are suggestive of multiple sclerosis. The episode of transient blindness was likely a result of optic neuritis, which occurs in 25% to 40% of multiple sclerosis patients (a similar presentation can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, or syphilis). In addition, the patient gives a history of a relapsing-remitting process. There are abnormal signs of cerebellar and upper motor neuron disease; the eye movement abnormalities indicate intranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Signs and symptoms therefore suggest multiple lesions in space and time, making multiple sclerosis the most likely diagnosis. All patients with suspected multiple sclerosis should have MR imaging of the brain. MRI is sensitive in defining demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord; gadolinium infusion is necessary to demonstrate active demyelination. Disease-related changes on MRI are found in more than 95% of patients who have definite evidence for MS. Most patients do not need spinal fluid analysis for diagnosis. Although 70% will have elevated IgG levels and 85% will have oligoclonal bands on CSF analysis, lumbar puncture is reserved for cases where the diagnosis is uncertain. CT scanning is much less sensitive than MRI in detecting demyelinating lesions, especially in the posterior fossa and cervical cord.",

The uncomfortable sensation is relieved by movement. Examination is normal. Although most often idiopathic, RLS can be associated with iron-deficiency or renal insufficiency; iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding capacity and/or ferritin levels) and serum creatinine should be measured. Levodopa-carbidopa is effective but may lead to rebound effects, so direct dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) are now preferred. RLS is a sensory, not a motor, syndrome, so muscle stretching exercises or muscle relaxants rarely provide symptom relief.\r\n",

This is due to loss of innervation to the lower esophageal sphincter, which prevents relaxation of the sphincter. This, in turn, leads to dilation of the distal third of the esophagus as food is unable to enter the stomach. A similar pathologic mechanism accounts for megacolon and megaureter in Chagas disease.\r\n",
