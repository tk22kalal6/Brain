Subacute myopathy, arthralgias, headaches, interstitial nephritis, and skin rashes also have been reported. Chronic treatment with omeprazole decreases the absorption of vitamin B12, but the clinical relevance of this effect is not clear. Chronic use of PPIs has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and with increased susceptibility to certain infections (e.g., hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired Clostridium difficile, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with ascites). Hypergastrinemia is more frequent and more severe with PPIs than with H2 receptor antagonists and associated with this is ECL hyperplasia, fundic gland polyposis, and atrophic gastritis. Recently, there have been associations made between long-term PPI use and increased risk of chronic kidney disease and dementia.\r\n\r\nH2 antagonist- Side effects are minor and include diarrhea, headache, drowsiness, fatigue, muscular pain, and constipation. Less-common side effects include those affecting the CNS (confusion, delirium, hallucinations, slurred speech, and headaches), which occur primarily with intravenous administration of the drugs or in elderly subjects. Several reports have associated H2 receptor antagonists with various blood disorders, including thrombocytopenia. H2 receptor antagonists cross the placenta and are excreted in breast milk. Although no major teratogenic risk has been associated with these agents, caution is warranted when they are used in pregnancy\r\n\r\nThe most common side effect of sucralfate is constipation, The “sticky” nature of the viscous gel produced by sucralfate in the stomach also may be responsible for the development of bezoars in some patients",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nIntellectualization\r\n\r\nPsychological defense mechanisms are unconscious means of responding and adapting to emotional stressors while preserving one's self-image. They serve to decrease anxiety, minimize feelings of shame and vulnerability, provide a sense of security or control, and insulate a person from disappointments. They are classified as immature (including \"primitive\" and \"neurotic\" defense mechanisms) or mature.\r\n\r\nImmature defense mechanisms are more commonly used by children or adolescents and prevent the individual from coping with reality. Certain immature defense mechanisms are fairly common in adults and provide short-term relief, but they often result in long-term complications. Mature defense mechanisms are most often used by well-adjusted adults and allow for \"healthy\" and constructive adaptations to reality. This patient spends hours reviewing his medical records and dwelling on the small details of the workup and treatment. He is employing intellectualization, a defense mechanism that allows him to avoid anxiety by focusing on the technical aspects of his cancer diagnosis while ignoring the personal ramifications of it. Intellectualization is generally considered an immature or neurotic defense mechanism involving repression of the emotional component of a stressor. But in some cases it can lead to more adaptive coping strategies as patients channel their intellectual efforts in productive ways.\r\n\r\n(Choice A) Denial is the failure to accept a disturbing aspect of external reality. An example in this patient would be refusal to acknowledge his diagnosis and insistence that nothing is wrong in the face of all evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\n(Choice C) Isolation of affect involves separating a thought from its emotional components, thereby making it tolerable. An example would be this patient receiving news of his diagnosis and speaking without emotion to his distraught family about his poor prognosis and likely death.\r\n\r\n(Choice D) Rationalization involves attempting to justify or excuse a behavior or decision rather than acknowledge the significance or consequences of it. An example would be this patient justifying not seeking treatment by saying that it would make no difference in his prognosis. This explanation would allow him to exert more control over his situation and not admit that anxiety and fear likely prevented him from seeking help earlier.",
