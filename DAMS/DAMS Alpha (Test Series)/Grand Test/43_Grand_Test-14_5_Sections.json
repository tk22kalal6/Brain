It therefore results in accid paralysis of skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and the secretion of some glands. It is used clinically to either paralyse muscles (that may be overactive) or reduce secretions from glands. There are various types, A to G with types A and B most commonly used in medical practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Frey syndrome: This is caused secondary to parotid surgery whereby eating/ thinking of eating causes sweating and erythema of the skin overlying the parotid gland. This is due to aberrant parasympathetic reinnervation of the skin sweat glands from the dissected parotid gland. Botulinum toxin can be injected into the a ected area to paralyse this a ect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spasmodic dysphonia: This can be for either adduction or abduction spasmodic dysphonia. The type of dysphonia dictates which muscles of the larynx are injected to reduce their activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blepharospasm, torticollis and hemifacial spasm can be treated with botulinum toxin, but are often managed by neurologists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It may also be used to relax the cricopharyngeus muscle in patients with dysphagia due to cricopharyngeal spasm and in post-laryngectomy patients who have pharyngo-oesophageal spasm resulting in failure of tracheo-oesophageal speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sialorrhoea in those with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease or with cerebral palsy can be treated with botulinum toxin as can palatal and stapedial myoclonus.</p>\r\n",

Pulsus paradoxus can be observed in cardiac tamponade and in conditions where intrathoracic pressure swings are exaggerated or the right ventricle is distended, such as severe acute asthma or exacerbations of COPD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Electrical alternans is defined as alternating QRS amplitude that is seen in any or all leads on an electrocardiogram (ECG) with no additional changes to the conduction pathways of the heart. This rhythm is typically associated with pericardial effusion via the &ldquo;swinging heart&rdquo; from the fluid surrounding the heart. However, electrical alternans is also associated with other pathologies including but not limited to ventricular tachycardia, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW), accelerated idioventricular rhythm, and supraventricular tachycardia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In cardiac tamponade there is prominent x descent and absent y descent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Friedreich&rsquo;s sign, originally coined Friedreich&rsquo;s diastolic collapse of the cervical veins, describes a sharp and deep y descent of the jugular venous waveform.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agranulocytosis can occur at any given dose of clozapine. It is not a dose-dependent effect. The risk of agranulocytosis is higher in the fi rst year of clozapine therapy and gradually reduces over the course of treatment. Similarly, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an idiosyncratic reaction which cannot be predicted in an individual patient. The most important clinical implication to remember is the fact that if a patient has an idiosyncratic side-effect, then this can reoccur at even small doses if rechallenged. Stopping the drug rather than lowering its dose is the appropriate management strategy in such cases. Naltrexone produces hepatocellular damage in proportion to the dose administered, especially in patients with pre-existing liver damage.</p>\r\n",

Such patients usually trace their conviction to early childhood, often live as the opposite sex, and seek sex reassignment surgery and endocrine treatment. These patients feel a sense of relief and appropriateness when they are wearing opposite-sex clothing. In contrast, patients with transvestic fetishism are sexually aroused by this behavior, and so typically only seek to wear clothing of the opposite sex during sexual situations. Homosexuality is not a diagnosis in DSM-IV. While some homosexuals cross-dress to seek a same-sex partner, they do not feel that they belong to the opposite sex, nor do they seek sex reassignment surgery.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is thought to occur in 0.5 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the United States, with disproportionately higher rates among African American and Native American populations. The most common features of a neonate with FAS include dysmorphic facies (e.g., short palpebral fissures, thin vermillion border of the upper lip, and a smooth philtrum), microcephaly, and growth restriction. Pregnant women who consume alcohol are at greater risk of having a small for gestational age infant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fetal alcohol exposure has the potential to affect multiple systems, resulting in cardiac (e.g., ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis) and central nervous system abnormalities. The neurodevelopmental impairment has been shown to continue beyond infancy and lead to persistent learning difficulties. There are several hypotheses about the mechanism of teratogenesis of alcohol on the fetal brain, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-An apoptotic effect via blockade of NMDA glutamate receptors and activation of gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Reduction in the fetus&rsquo; ability to respond to free radical damage; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Direct inhibition of Sonic hedgehog gene signaling.</p>\r\n",

It can be a rare complication of cecal perforation. The pathogenesis of small left colon is postulated to result from a functional immaturity of the ganglion cells, primarily affecting the descending and rectosigmoid colon. This functional obstruction leads to abdominal distention and inability to pass meconium. A barium contrast enema study will show a small colon segment with dilated proximal bowel.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TSH Thyroid-stimulating hormone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The placenta is a hormonally active organ, producing estrogens and human chorionic gonadotropin that stimulates triidodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Both maternal T3 and T4 are partially permeable across the placenta. Although the amount of hormones transferred is low, this transfer is critical for the fetus because the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary axis is not well-developed in the first trimester and the fetus is not able to produce thyroid hormone until 18 to 20 weeks&rsquo; gestation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thyroid-releasing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, and iodide all freely cross the placenta. In contrast, thyroid-stimulating hormone does not cross the placenta.</p>\r\n",
