CK exists in tissue-specific isoenzymatic forms: CK-MM (muscle), CK-BB (brain), and \r\nCK-MB (a hybrid of muscle and brain subunits), which can be measured to assess tissue injury. Among these, CK-MB has historically served as a key biomarker for detecting myocardial infarction, due to its relative abundance in cardiac muscle. Although cardiac troponins have largely supplanted CK-MB in routine clinical practice, CK-MB retains diagnostic relevance in certain contexts, such as suspected reinfarction or when troponin assays are not available. \r\n\r\nThe isoenzymes of CK are dimers of either type B or M polypeptide chains. The BB isoenzyme is found in the central nervous system, whereas the MM isoenzyme is a principal component in adult skeletal muscles The myocardium has 15% CK-MB isoenzyme and 85% CK-MM. Skeletal muscles contain about 1% to 3% of CK-MB.\r\n",

Methanol is among the most dangerous toxic alcohols, potentially producing significant morbidity and mortality in heavily exposed individuals who are left untreated.\r\n\r\nMethanol poisoning may be due to accidental or intentional ingestion. Rare accidental epidemic poisonings due to distillation and fermentation errors, as well as beverage contamination, have occurred. Products that contain methanol include windshield wiper fluid, industrial solvents, some types of antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, copy machine fluid, perfumes, and different fuel types, including those used for warming food. Exposures can cause varying degrees of toxicity, with management strategies ranging from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatment is fomepizole, though ethanol may be administered if the former is not an option. Unlike in ethylene glycol toxicity, dialysis is typically recommended\r\n",

Then, iodide is oxidized and incorporated into thyroglobulin via a process called organification. \r\nA defective pendrin will result in defective organification resulting in less thyroid hormone synthesis and consequently increased TSH by negative feedback. \r\n",

This shifts cardiac metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation, which is more oxygen-efficient and reduces myocardial oxygen demand. While effective for refractory angina (Statement D is partially true but incomplete), its use is limited by a narrow therapeutic window and a high risk of serious side effects, including dose-dependent hepatotoxicity and a debilitating peripheral neuropathy. Genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 enzyme, which metabolizes perhexiline, greatly influences patient susceptibility to these toxicities.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n Persistent conductive hearing loss due to ossicular chain removal\r\nSol:\r\n• Radical mastoidectomy is performed in cases of extensive cholesteatoma, particularly when the disease involves the ossicles, semicircular canals, or dura.\r\n• The goal is to create a dry, safe ear by removing the mastoid air cells, posterior canal wall, tympanic membrane, and ossicles, resulting in a mastoid cavity that connects with the external auditory canal.\r\n• Since the ossicular chain is sacrificed, patients develop permanent conductive hearing loss in the operated ear.\r\n• Option A is incorrect because hearing does not improve; it worsens.\r\n• Option C is incorrect because ossiculoplasty is not performed in radical mastoidectomy (only in modified radical mastoidectomy).\r\n• Option D is incorrect because the posterior canal wall is removed, creating a large cavity.\r\nKey Learning Points:\r\nRadical mastoidectomy = safe, dry ear but at the cost of hearing loss\r\n Indicated in extensive cholesteatoma with complications\r\nMiddle ear and ossicles are removed = permanent conductive hearing loss\r\nAlternative: Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM) preserves some middle ear structures for better hearing outcomes\r\n ",

It is based on a main artery of the orbicularis oris, the labial artery. A portion of the uninvolved lip (either upper or lower) is rotated across the mouth and into the defect of the involved lip while maintaining the blood supply from the labial artery. After 10-14 days, the blood supply of the flap has been established to the point where the artery can be divided. The Abbe flap has an excellent cosmetic result when it is used to replace the entire philtrum of the upper lip. The technique can also be used when the defect involves the commissure. This is called an Abbe-Estlander flap. For defects greater than half the central lip, an Abbe flap will give the best result, however, the remainder of the central lip should be excised.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\n• Suxamethonium resembles acetylcholine (ACh) and acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). \r\n• However, its action at the receptor is prolonged compared to ACh, leading to prolonged depolarization of the muscle – seen clinically as fasciculations.\r\n• One reason for its prolonged action is its delayed metabolism when compared to ACh, which occurs via plasma butyrlcholinestrase (pseudocholinesterase), rather than via acetylcholinesterase in the NMJ.\r\n• As may be deduced from its structure, the action of suxamethonium is not limited to nicotinic receptors. Muscarinic actions include inducing bradycardia via action at the SA node. \r\n• In the presence of large, repeated or infusion doses, the initial (phase 1) block may proceed to a phase 2 block. The exact mechanism for this is unclear. However, it is characterized by an inability for ACh to cause a new depolarization, even when the resting membrane potential has been restored. \r\n• This resistance to ACh then presents like an NDMR, i.e. fade on train-of-four stimulation and an ability to overcome the block with anticholinesterases.\r\n• Administration of suxamethonium is associated with a transient rise in plasma potassium levels due to widespread passage of potassium out of cells, down its concentration gradient, into the ECF, via open ACh receptor channels. \r\n• In certain conditions, there is increased expression of extrajunctional ACh receptors, resulting in an exaggerated hyperkalaemic effect. \r\n• This phenomenon is seen following burns and denervation injuries.\r\n• In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, increased potassium release may also occur following suxamethonium administration due to excess muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. \r\n• There have been cases of suxamethonium-induced cardiac arrest in these patients.\r\n",

Mood swings are common. Patients can be argumentative at one moment, depressed the next, and later complain of having no feelings. Patients can have short-lived psychotic episodes (so-called micropsychotic episodes) rather than full-blown psychotic breaks, and the psychotic symptoms of these patients are almost always circumscribed, fleeting, or doubtful. The behavior of patients with borderline personality disorder is highly unpredictable, and their achievements are rarely at the level of their abilities. The painful nature of their lives is reflected in repetitive self-destructive acts. Such patients may slash their wrists and perform other self-mutilations to elicit help from others, to express anger, or to numb themselves to overwhelming affect.\r\n\r\nBecause they feel both dependent and hostile, persons with this disorder have tumultuous interpersonal relationships. They can be dependent on those with whom they are close and, when frustrated, can express enormous anger toward their intimate friends. Patients with borderline personality disorder cannot tolerate being alone, and they prefer a frantic search for companionship, no matter how unsatisfactory, to their own company. To assuage loneliness, if only for brief periods, they accept a stranger as a friend or behave promiscuously. They often complain about chronic feelings of emptiness and boredom and the lack of a consistent sense of identity (identity diffusion); when pressed, they often complain about how depressed they usually feel, despite the flurry of other affects.

Medications that can cause catatonia include corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antipsychotic (i.e., neuroleptic) agents. Catatonic symptoms may be seen in extreme forms of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare, potentially life threatening disorder associated with fever, autonomic instability, impaired consciousness, and rigidity.(LETHAL CATATONIA). Benzodiazepines can provide temporary improvement in symptoms, and their use may improve patients’ ability to communicate and to care for themselves. ECT is appropriate for catatonia due to a general medical condition, especially if the catatonia is life threatening (e.g., inability to eat) or has developed into lethal (malignant) catatonia. The mechanism behind the efficacy of ECT is unknown.\r\n",
