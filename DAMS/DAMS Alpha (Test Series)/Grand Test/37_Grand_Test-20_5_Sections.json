      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nIn fasting or diabetes, lipolysis predominates in adipocytes because of the inability of these cells to obtain glucose, which is normally used as a source of glycerol-3-phosphate. Glycerol-3-phosphate is necessary for the esterification of fatty acids into triacylglycerides. Circulating fatty acids become the predominant fuel source, and beta-oxidation in the liver becomes substantially elevated. This leads to an increased production of acetyl-CoA. Although gluconeogenesis is increased (choice d) in the liver as a result of the persistent elevation of glucagon levels, this pathway does not supply acetyl-CoA for the production of ketone bodies. The increased gluconeogenesis predisposes oxaloacetate and reduces (not increases, choice B) the flow of acetyl-CoA through the citric acid cycle. As a consequence, acetyl-CoA is diverted to the formation of ketone bodies. The persistently elevated levels of glucagon also increase the levels of cAMP in responsive tissues, such as adipocytes (choice C). This effect in adipocytes leads to persistently increased release of fatty acids to the circulation.",

The dog harbors the ribbon stage in the small intestine, tapeworm eggs are passed in the excrement and contaminate pasture, the sheep inadvertently eats the egg, and the juvenile or metacestode stage (hydatid cyst) develops in the liver or lungs of the sheep. \r\n\r\n•   Echinococcus or the development of the hydatid cyst also can occur in humans.\r\n\r\n•   Dipylidiasis is a dog flea tapeworm that has minor medical importance; diphyllobothriasis is transmitted to people via raw fish; cysticercosis occurs with the pork tapeworm; and, taeniasis refers to intestinal infections with the tapeworms Taenia solium and T. saginatus.",

Because of the shape, the cysticercus is sometimes referred to as bladderworm (a type of metacestode) and is the stage responsible for the pathogenesis of neurocysticercosis. To minimize the possibility of an autoinfection, it is critical that the infection be aggressively managed. Ascaris is a geohelminth and must first embryonate in soil to be infective, Cyclospora and Toxoplasma produce protozoan infections, and raw beef is the vehicle for transmission of another tapeworm that is not believed to be associated with neurocysticercosis.",

So stage 1 hypertension is the appropriate term.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nCardiogenic shock occurs when the heart fails to generate adequate cardiac output to maintain tissue perfusion. \r\n\r\n• Intrinsic causes such as myocardial dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease, or extrinsic causes such as pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and pericardial tamponade, may produce cardiogenic shock.\r\n\r\n• Principles of treatment of cardiogenic shock are aimed at optimizing preload, cardiac contractility, and afterload. \r\n\r\n• Preload is usually adequate or high in cardiogenic shock. \r\n\r\n• Dobutamine is a useful inotropic agent, particularly when filling pressures are high, because of its mild vasodilatory effect, as well as its effect to enhance cardiac contractility. \r\n\r\n• Afterload-reducing agents, such as sodium nitroprusside, may be beneficial in cardiogenic shock in the setting of elevated filling pressures, low cardiac output, and elevated systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac output may improve with use of afterload-reducing agents by decreasing myocardial wall tension and optimizing the myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio. \r\n\r\n• The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), by providing diastolic augmentation, reducing left ventricular afterload, and reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, is sometimes useful in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. The IABP is especially useful in low–cardiac output postcardiotomy patients, in patients awaiting revascularization, and in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by mitral insufficiency or ventricular septal defect. \r\n\r\n• The pneumatic antishock garment (PASG), which causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance, is contraindicated in cardiogenic shock.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\n•\tSuxamethonium resembles acetylcholine (ACh) and acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). \r\n\r\n•\tHowever, its action at the receptor is prolonged compared to ACh, leading to prolonged depolarization of the muscle – seen clinically as fasciculations.\r\n\r\n•\tOne reason for its prolonged action is its delayed metabolism when compared to ACh, which occurs via plasma butyrlcholinestrase (pseudocholinesterase), rather than via acetylcholinesterase in the NMJ.\r\n\r\n•\tAs may be deduced from its structure, the action of suxamethonium is not limited to nicotinic receptors. Muscarinic actions include inducing bradycardia via action at the SA node. \r\n\r\n•\tIn the presence of large, repeated or infusion doses, the initial (phase 1) block may proceed to a phase 2 block. The exact mechanism for this is unclear. However, it is characterized by an inability for ACh to cause a new depolarization, even when the resting membrane potential has been restored. \r\n\r\n•\tThis resistance to ACh then presents like an NDMR, i.e. fade on train-of-four stimulation and an ability to overcome the block with anticholinesterases.\r\n\r\n•\tAdministration of suxamethonium is associated with a transient rise in plasma potassium levels due to widespread passage of potassium out of cells, down its concentration gradient, into the ECF, via open ACh receptor channels. \r\n\r\n•\tIn certain conditions, there is increased expression of extrajunctional ACh receptors, resulting in an exaggerated hyperkalaemic effect. \r\n\r\n•\tThis phenomenon is seen following burns and denervation injuries.\r\n\r\n•\tIn Duchenne muscular dystrophy, increased potassium release may also occur following suxamethonium administration due to excess muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. \r\n\r\n•\tThere have been cases of suxamethonium-induced cardiac arrest in these patients.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nAcute infection (Ref : Kaplan)\r\n\r\n“Alcohol withdrawal delirium is a medical emergency that can result in significant morbidity and mortality.  Untreated, DTs has a mortality rate of 20 percent, usually as a result of an intercurrent medical illness such as pneumonia, renal disease, hepatic insufficiency, or heart failure. The essential feature of the syndrome is delirium occurring within 1 week after a person stops drinking or reduces the intake of alcohol. In addition to the symptoms of delirium, the features of alcohol intoxication delirium include autonomic hyperactivity such as tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever, anxiety, insomnia, and hypertension; perceptual distortions, most frequently visual or tactile hallucinations; and fluctuating levels of psychomotor activity, ranging from hyperexcitability to lethargy. About 5 percent of persons with alcohol-related disorders who are hospitalized have DTs. Because the syndrome usually develops on the third hospital day, a patient admitted for an unrelated condition may unexpectedly have an episode of delirium, the first sign of a previously undiagnosed alcohol-related disorder. Episodes of DTs usually begin in a patient’s 30s or 40s after 5 to 15 years of heavy drinking, typically of the binge type. Physical illness (e.g., hepatitis or pancreatitis) predisposes to the syndrome; a person in good physical health rarely has DTs during alcohol withdrawal.”",
