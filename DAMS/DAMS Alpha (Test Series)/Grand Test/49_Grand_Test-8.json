      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d-Transposition of the great arteries is a medical emergency. Cyanosis and tachypnea are most often recognized within the 1st hours or days of life. If it is not treated, the vast majority of these infants would not survive the neonatal period. Hypoxemia is usually moderate to severe, depending on the degree of atrial level shunting and whether the ductus is partially open or totally closed. Infants who remain severely hypoxic or acidotic despite prostaglandin infusion should undergo Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy. A successful Rashkind atrial septostomy should result in a rise in PaO2 to 35-50 mm Hg and elimination of any pressure gradient across the atrial septum. Some patients with TGA and VSD may require balloon atrial septostomy because of poor mixing, even though the VSD is large. If the VSD associated with d-TGA is small, the clinical lit manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment are similar to those described previously for transposition with an intact ventricular septum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the VSD is large and not restrictive to ventricular ejection, significant mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood usually occurs and clinical manifestations of cardiac&nbsp; failure are seen. The degree of cyanosis may be subtle and sometimes may not be recognized until an oxygen saturation measurement is performed. The physiology of I- TGA is quite different from that of d-TGA. The double inversion of the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial relationships result in desaturated right atrial blood appropriately flowing to the lungs and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood appropriately flowing to the aorta. The circulation is thus physiologically &ldquo;corrected.&rdquo; Without other defects, the hemodynamics would be nearly normal.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vignette describes an infant with a ductal-dependent cyanotic congenital heart lesion. In this example, the child had pulmonary atresia without a corresponding VSD; another example would have been transposition of the great vessels without a septal defect to allow mixing of oxygenated and non-oxygenated blood. Cyanotic infants who do not improve then- saturations with supplemental oxygen should be evaluated carefully for structural heart disease. The ductus arteriosis&nbsp; typically closes in the first few hours of life; thus, these children will develop their cyanosis in the same time frame. Prostaglandin E1 will help keep the ductus patent until a surgical procedure can be performed. PGE1 does have the tendency to cause hypoventilation, so arrangements must be made for a potential artificial airway if necessary. Indomethacin closes a patent ductus arteriosis. Adenosine is used for supraventricular tachycardia.</p>\r\n",

Thus, it is unusual for patients to manifest signs of adrenal insufficiency such as hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Approximately 65% of patients become hypertensive, although this can take several years to develop. Hypertension is probably a consequence of elevated levels of deoxycorticosterone,, which has mineralocorticoid activity. Infants may transiently develop signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency after treatment with hydrocortisone is instituted. This is presumably from sudden suppression of deoxycorticosterone secretion in a patient with atrophy of the zona glomerulosa caused by chronic suppression of rennin activity. All signs and symptoms of androgen excess that are found in 21- hydroxylase deficiency may also occur in 11&beta;-hydroxylase deficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The oculomotor nerve originates in the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain, emerges from the anterior midbrain, and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The patient also has loss of the corneal reflex on the left side. The sensory limb of the corneal reflex is mediated by the nasociliary branch of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V,). The motor component of the corneal reflex is carried primarily by the temporal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). Like the oculomotor nerve, the nasociliary nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Thus, a lesion involving the superior orbital fissure would cause the described deficits</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI), and superior ophthalmic vein also enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure.</p>\r\n",

Most cases are iatrogenic, following transplant of infected corneas or use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments. Familial forms, following an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance,represent 5% to 15% of cases. Patients show a very rapid cognitive deterioration, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, and ataxia. Death follows within a year. An intermittent periodic burst pattern (periodic complexes) is the characteristic EEG finding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Epilepsy causes spike and wave patterns on EEG, and may cause postseizure memory loss and disorientation (in generalized, tonic-clonic seizures) or a depersonalization syndrome (in temporal lobe epilepsy or other focal seizure disorder), but would not be expected to cause dementia, continuous myoclonic jerks on examination, or an EEG that shows periodic bursts of electrical activity superimposed on a slow background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pseudodementia is the term used for patients with major depression, who exhibit impaired attention, perception, problem solving, or memory.

Risk is greatest in those with long-term domestic exposure to the Triatomine bug, which nests in thatched roofing and the cracks of adobe or unfinished brick.

Patients subsequently develop a prolonged asymptomatic phase (&quot;indeterminate form&quot;), whereby serology is positive for T.cruzi, but there are no symptoms, signs, detectable parasitemia, or indications of end-organ damage.

The CT scan is obtained in the late arterial to nephrographic phase of the examination (the aorta is\r\nstill opacified with contrast agent), before the excretion of the contrast agent. Thus option b is incorrect. There are multiple calculi in the right kidney, which is small and atrophic, indicating a chronic process (thus option a is incorrect). There is thickening of the perinephric fascia, and gas bubbles are seen in the posterior paranephric space, extending to the right flank. In addition, there are fluid collections in the posterior paranephric space and in the soft tissues of the right flank, making option d the most likely diagnosis. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with staghorn calculi. The affected kidney is usually enlarged rather than shrunken, as is the case here.",

If prophylactic mastectomy is not performed, intensive surveillance for breast cancer with biannual clinical examinations and annual mammograms starting at age 30 is recommended.

BRCA2 breast cancers are more likely to be estrogen receptor-positive. Approximately 10% of women under the age of 40 who develop breast cancer have a mutation in BRCA1 or 2.

Unlike other forms of chronic pancreatitis, however, marked dilation of the dorsal duct is unusual. As such, surgical decompressive procedures are not successful. For patients with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, the best option is sphincterotomy of the minor papilla because the duct of Santorini is providing the primary drainage to the pancreas. A decreased rate of acute pancreatitis in 24 patients after minor papilla sphincterotomy and dorsal duct stenting is seen. The complication rate was lower with sphincterotomy than with stent insertion. Major papilla sphincterotomy would not likely be helpful because it drains a minority of the pancreas in pancreatic divisum.",

In children, growth retardation is another indication. Because patients with Crohn disease will often require repeat operations, it is important to avoid unnecessary resection of small bowel because this puts the patient at risk of short bowel syndrome. As such, several principles of surgical management should be followed. Surgical resection should be limited to the segment of bowel that is causing the complication. Other areas of active disease should be left alone provided they are not causing obvious complications. Resection margins of 2 cm beyond grossly visible disease are recommended . Resection margins have not been shown to affect recurrence. The presence of microscopic disease in the resection margin also does not adversely affect outcome or recurrence. Thus, frozen section is unnecessary</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the indication for surgery is SBO, strictureplasty has been shown to be equally effective as resection for jejunal and ileal disease while sparing bowel length. Two types of strictureplasty are recommended: the Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty (for strictures &lt;12 cm in length) and the Finney pyloroplasty (for strictures &le;25 cm in length) . A potential drawback of these techniques is that they may potentially leave an undetected malignancy behind. Thus, during the course of a strictureplasty, biopsy specimens of any intraluminal ulcerations should be taken. Duodenal Crohn disease is much less common, and thus guidelines are less clear. However, current recommendations are to perform a bypass of duodenal strictures, such as with a gastrojejunostomy and duodenojejunostomy, depending on the location. Duodenal resection is not recommended . Duodenal strictureplasty has been rarely reported. For colon disease, resection is recommended, again limiting resection to the diseased segment causing symptoms. In a metaanalysis, 90% of recurrences occurred at nonstrictureplasty sites.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increasingly, colon injuries are being treated with either primary repair, if feasible, or resection with a primary anastomosis . This approach applies to both right- and left-sided colon injuries. Primary repair is used when less than 50% of the circumference of the bowel is involved, whereas resection is recommended for larger wounds. Once a resection is performed, a decision must be made as to whether to perform a primary reanastomosis or a colostomy. The primary&nbsp;contraindication to attempting a primary reanastomosis is hemodynamic instability. In these situations, damage control surgery should be performed and the decision to reanastamose or create a colostomy can be made at a subsequent operation when the patient has stabilized and been fully resuscitated. Factors associated with intra-abdominal complications in patients with severe colon injuries undergoing resection include severe fecal contamination, transfusion of 4 or more units of blood in the first 24 hours, and administration of single-agent antibiotics. The use of vasopressors at the time of repair may also be associated with anastomotic leaks, whereas the method of performing the anastomosis (handsewn versus stapled) has not been shown to effect leak rates. Another important consideration is obesity. Morbid obesity makes the creation of a stoma difficult, predisposes the stoma to the development of ischemia, and, if this occurs, increases the risk of the development of a necrotizing soft-tissue infection. It also makes the subsequent colostomy takedown more challenging. As such, strong consideration should be given in obese patients to a primary reanastomosis.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThe first step in analysing an acid-base disturbance is simply to look at the pH. This patient has an acidosis. Then look at the HCO3 and the Pco2 to determine the primary disturbance; that is, is it a metabolic acidosis or a respiratory acidosis? The serum HCO3 has decreased from 24 to 5 mEq/L, so this must be a metabolic acidosis. The Pco2 is below the normal value of 40 mm, so this cannot be a respiratory acidosis (the Pco2 would be above 40 in a respiratory acidosis). The first two steps are straightforward and unambiguous. The third (and most difficult) step is to assess the compensatory response. This patient has a metabolic acidosis, so you need to assess the respiratory compensation. That is to say, has the Pco2 decreased appropriately to compensate for the metabolic acidosis? The normal compensatory response in metabolic acidosis is for the Pco2 to decrease by 1.25 mm Hg for each 1-mEq decrease in HCO3 . This patient’s 19 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate is matched by a 25-mm drop in the Pco2 . Hence, this is a compensated metabolic acidosis. Another method of assessing compensation in a metabolic acidosis is to use the Winters formula, which says that the appropriate Pco2 equals 1.5 (HCO3 ) + 8. This would give an appropriate Pco2 of 15.5, very close to the measured Pco2 . Again, the compensatory response is appropriate for the degree of acidosis; the patient does not have a respiratory acid-base disorder. The fourth step is to calculate the anion gap. The normal anion gap (Na- [Cl + HCO3 ]) is 8 to 10 mEq/L; in this case the value is 29 mEq/L. Therefore, this is a wide anion-gap metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation. ",

Examination of the peripheral blood smear is the first step in evaluation of hemolytic anemia.

Cardiac output is unchanged or decreased, and total peripheral resistance is raised. Compensatory vagal reflex activity slows the heart producing bradycardia , overcoming a direct cardioaccelerator action, and stroke volume is increased. The peripheral vascular resistance increases in most vascular beds, and renal blood flow is reduced. NE constricts mesenteric vessels and reduces splanchnic and hepatic blood flow. Coronary flow usually is increased, probably owing both to indirectly induced coronary dilation, as with EPI, and to elevated blood pressure. Although generally a poor β2 receptor agonist, NE may increase coronary blood flow directly by stimulating β2 receptors on coronary ves- sels. Patients with Prinzmetal variant angina may be supersensitive to the α adrenergic vasoconstrictor effects of NE. ",

Thus, not only sensory but also motor impulses are interrupted when a LA is applied to a mixed nerve, resulting in muscular paralysis and loss of autonomic control as well.",

Intermittent intense sun exposure, as identified by prior sunburns; radiation therapy; a positive family history of BCC; immunosuppression; a fair complexion, especially red hair; easy sunburning (skin types I or II); are risk factors for the development of BCC. The classic or nodular BCC comprises 50–80% of all BCCs. Nodular BCC is composed of one or a few small, waxy, semitranslucent nodules, forming around a central depression that may or may not be ulcerated, crusted, and bleeding. The edge of larger lesions has a characteristic rolled border. Telangiectases course through the lesion. Bleeding on slight injury is a common sign.",
