      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>This patient with recurrent boils and skin abscesses is likely colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive cocci that grows in clusters.</li>\r\n\t<li>Methicillin-resistant strains are able to grow in the presence of oxacillin due to the acquisition of a mobile genetic element that contains the mecA gene, which encodes for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a.</li>\r\n\t<li>PBPs catalyze peptidoglycan cross-linking during cell wall synthesis; they are the target of beta-lactam medications, which bind to and irreversibly destroy the enzyme. Unlike other PBPs.</li>\r\n\t<li>PBP 2a has a low affinity for beta-lactams and continues to cross-link peptidoglycan in the presence of oxacillin, methiciliin, cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin), and other betalactam medications.</li>\r\n\t<li>Therefore, treatment of methicillin&mdash;resistant S aureus (MRSA) generally requires the use of a non&mdash;betalactam drug. Common medications for MRSA include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (inhibits 2 steps in folate synthesis), clindamycin (inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit), doxycycline (inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit), or vancomycin (inhibits integration of peptidoglycan subunits)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

In other words, it causes the user to erroneously not reject the false null hypothesis because the test lacks the statistical power to detect sufficient evidence for the alternative hypothesis. The type II error is also known as a false negative.</li>\r\n\t<li>The type II error has an inverse relationship with the power of a statistical test. This means that the higher power of a statistical test, the lower the probability of committing a type II error. The rate of a type II error (i.e., the probability of a type II error) is measured by beta (&beta;) while the statistical power is measured by 1- &beta;.</li>\r\n\t<li>The statistical power of a study is the power, or ability, of a study to detect a difference if a difference really exists.&nbsp;&nbsp; It depends on two things:&nbsp; the sample size (number of subjects), and the effect size (e.g. the difference in outcomes between two groups). &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>One of the simplest methods to increase the power of the test is to increase the sample size used in a test.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABPA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an eosinophilic pulmonary disorder that occurs in response to allergic sensitization to antigens from Aspergillus species fungi. The predominant clinical presentation of ABPA is an asthmatic phenotype，often accompanied by cough with production of brownish plugs of mucus. ABPA has also been well described as a complication of cystic fibrosis. ABPA is a distinct diagnosis from simple asthma， characterized by prominent peripheral eosinophilia and elevated circulating levels of IgE (&gt;417 IU/mL). Establishing a diagnosis of ABPA also requires establishing sensitivity to Aspergillus antigens by skin test reactivity, positive serum precipitins for Aspergillus and/or direct measurement of circulating specific IgG and IgE to Aspergillus. Central bronchiectasis is described as a classic finding on chest imaging in ABPA but is not necessary for making a diagnosis. Other possible findings on chest imaging include patchy infiltrates and evidence of mucus impaction. Systemic glucocorticoids may be used in the treatment of ABPA that is persistently symptomatic despite the use of inhaled therapies for asthma. Monoclonal antibody against IgE (Omalizumab) can be used in treating severe ABPA, particularly in individuals with ABPA as a complication of cystic fibrosis.</p>\r\n",

Hypersecretion of growth hormone underlies this syndrome in patients with pituitary masses, although ectopic production of growth hormone, particularly by tumors, has been reported. Because growth hormone is secreted in a highly pulsatile fashion, obtaining random serum levels is not reliable. Thus, the downstream mediator of systemic effects of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), is measured to screen for growth hormone excess. IGF-1 is made by the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation. An oral glucose tolerance test with growth hormone obtained at 0, 30, and 60 minutes may also be used to screen for acromegaly because normal persons should suppress growth hormone to this challenge. Serum prolactin level is useful to screen for prolactinomas, and 24-hour urinary free cortisol and ACTH assay are useful screens for Cushing disease.</p>\r\n",

It most commonly affects middle aged females and is poorly related to exertion. It typically occurs in sleep between 12-5am.&nbsp; 30% cases maybe associated with other vasospastic disorders like migraine and Raynaud&rsquo;s phenomenon. Attacks are usually precipitated by emotional stress/smoking/cocaine and amphetamine. ECG can show transient ST-T changes (elevation) suggesting Myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography may reveal normal arteries. However, 50-60% may harbour significant coronary stenosis. Hence, provocative testing with ergonovine/intra-coronary acetylcholine is mandatory during angiography to demonstrate vasospasm. The treatment consists of Nitrates and CCB. Beta-blockers are best avoided because they may precipitate vasospasm by facilitating un-opposed alpha-action. Prognosis is excellent with &lt;1% mortality.</p>\r\n",

Direct toxicity, cortical edema, and inhibition of mitochondrial activity, as evidenced by decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity, are possible mechanisms of crystal damage. Since calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals are transported intracellularly by kidney cells, the renal toxicity of ethylene glycol may result from inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory function in proximal tubular cells by calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals</p>\r\n",

The manuscript by Wikstr&ouml;m et al is a major step forward in understanding this protective effect2. Using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register in a large epidemiological study of more than 600,000 Nordic women, the authors conclude that use of Swedish snuff, a smokeless tobacco, did not reduce the risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, but that tobacco when smoked did. They infer that combustion products of tobacco such as carbon monoxide protect against preeclampsia, but that constituents of tobacco such as nicotine do not.</p>\r\n",

These mechanisms include distorted pelvic anatomy, endocrine and ovulatory abnormalities, altered peritoneal function, and altered hormonal and cell-mediated functions in the endometrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on common observations in laparoscopy, pelvic anatomy distortion, the so-called &ldquo;pelvic factor&rdquo;, can more readily explain infertility in patients with severe forms of endometriosis. Major pelvic adhesions or peritubal adhesions that disturb the tubo-ovarian liaison and tube patency can impair oocyte release from the ovary, inhibit ovum pickup, or impede ovum transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women with endometriosis may have endocrine and ovulatory disorders, including luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome, impaired folliculogenesis, luteal phase defect, and premature or multiple luteinizing hormone (LH) surges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A complex network of humoral and cellular immunity factors modulates the growth and inflammatory behavior of ectopic endometrial implants and affects embryo implantation. Women with endometriosis have an increased volume of peritoneal fluid with a high concentration of activated macrophages, prostaglandins, IL-1, TNF, and proteases. These alterations may have adverse effects on the function of the oocyte, sperm, embryo, or fallopian tube. Moreover, an ovum capture inhibitor (OCI) in endometriosis peritoneal fluid is thought to be responsible for fimbrial failure of ovum capture. Elevated levels of IgG and IgA antibodies (autoantibodies to endometrial antigens) and lymphocytes may be found in the endometrium of women with endometriosis. These abnormalities may alter endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation.</p>\r\n",
