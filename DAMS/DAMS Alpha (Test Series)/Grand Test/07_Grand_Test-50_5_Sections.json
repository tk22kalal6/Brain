It&#39;s a grid-like structure that helps organize factors influencing an event, including pre-event, event, and post-event phases, alongside host, agent/vehicle, physical environment, and social environment factors.&nbsp;<br />\r\nKey Components of the Haddon Matrix:&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Phases of an Event:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pre-Event: Factors leading up to the event, such as risk factors or interventions to prevent the event from occurring.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Event: Factors during the event, such as the type of energy transfer or the severity of the impact.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Event: Factors after the event, such as emergency response or medical care.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Factors Influencing the Event:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Host: The individual involved (e.g., pedestrian, driver).&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Agent/Vehicle: The object or energy source (e.g., car, bicycle, water).&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Physical Environment: The surrounding physical setting (e.g., road, building, water).&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Social Environment: Societal norms and laws influencing behaviour (e.g., seatbelt laws, drinking and driving policies).&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Haddon Matrix helps to:&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify Risk Factors: By analysing each cell of the matrix, you can identify factors contributing to an injury or accident.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop Prevention Strategies: The matrix provides a framework for developing interventions tailored to specific phases and factors.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assess Interventions: You can evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies by considering how they address different phases and factors.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Collect Data: The matrix can guide data collection efforts by focusing on relevant factors and phases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variant Angina is the other term for Prinz metal&rsquo;s angina which is a result of coronary vasospasm. It most commonly affects middle aged females and is poorly related to exertion. It typically occurs in sleep between 12-5am. &nbsp;30% cases maybe associated with other vasospastic disorders like migraine and Raynaud&rsquo;s phenomenon. Attacks are usually precipitated by emotional stress/smoking/cocaine and amphetamine. ECG can show transient ST-T changes (elevation) suggesting Myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography may reveal normal arteries. However, 50-60% may harbour significant coronary stenosis. Hence, provocative testing with ergonovine/intra-coronary acetylcholine is mandatory during angiography to demonstrate vasospasm. The treatment consists of Nitrates and CCB. Beta-blockers are best avoided because they may precipitate vasospasm by facilitating un-opposed alpha-action. Prognosis is excellent with &lt;1% mortality.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salvage esophagectomy is the nomenclature applied to esophagectomy performed after failure of definitive radiation and chemotherapy. The most frequent scenario is one in which distant disease (bone, lung, brain, or wide LN metastases) renders the patient nonoperable at initial presentation. Then, systemic chemotherapy, usually with radiation of the primary tumor, destroys all foci of metastasis, as demonstrated by CT and CT-PET, but the primary remains present and symptomatic. Following a period of observation, to make sure no new disease will become evident, salvage esophagectomy is performed, usually with an open two-field approach. Surprisingly, the cure rate of salvage esophagectomy is not inconsequential. One in four patients undergoing this operation will be disease free 5 years later, despite the presence of residual cancer in the operative specimen. Because of the dense scarring created by radiation treatment, this procedure is the most technically challenging of all esophagectomy techniques</p>\r\n",

The elevation in HR and BP are non-specific, and it would be much more likely to malignant hyperthermia with a much more rapid elevation in EtCO2.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The non-specific nature of isolated tachycardia and hypertension are much more commonly associated with rapid titration of desflurane as opposed to MH in this scenario.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inadequate depth of anesthesia certainly presents as hypertension and tachycardia. However, it is much less likely in this scenario where the patient has no surgical stimulation yet as the prep is ongoing, and it has been 10 minutes since the stimulation of placing the LMA occurred.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, the patient&#39;s MAC is &gt; 1, which is more than adequate given the lack of stimulation at this time. In fact, it is because of the rapid titration of the volatile agent desflurane which likely led to the tachycardia and hypertension.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allergic or anaphylactic reactions are common with steroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs as well as perioperative antibiotics.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However, it is much more commonly associated with hypotension, tachycardia, and increased peak airway pressures.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Etiology of this patient&#39;s tachycardia and hypertension are much more likely caused by sympathetic stimulation from desflurane.

Patients with dementia also exhibit a reduced ability to apply what Kurt Goldstein called the &ldquo;abstract attitude.&rdquo; Patients have difficulty generalizing from a single instance, forming concepts, and grasping similarities and differences among concepts. Furthermore, the ability to solve problems, to reason logically, and to make sound judgments is compromised. Goldstein also described a catastrophic reaction marked by agitation secondary to the subjective awareness of intellectual deficits under stressful circumstances. Persons usually attempt to compensate for defects by using strategies to avoid demonstrating failures in intellectual performance; they may change the subject, make jokes, or otherwise divert the interviewer. Lack of judgment and poor impulse control appear commonly, particularly in dementias that primarily affect the frontal lobes. Examples of these impairments include coarse language, inappropriate jokes, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, and a general disregard for the conventional rules of social conduct.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Most clinicians categorize biliary atresia into two types&mdash; the acquired form and the embryonic form. The acquired form is more common (~85%) and is associated with a significant inflammatory response involving the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in replacement of the ducts with fibrous scar tissue and eventual obliteration of the bile duct lumen.<br />\r\nAffected infants with this form typically appear healthy with a normal growth pattern and present in the first few weeks of life with jaundice, acholic stool, and dark urine. The embryonic form is less common (~15%) and is associated with other congenital malformations, such as heterotaxy syndrome and polysplenia.
