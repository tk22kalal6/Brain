      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (E)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The correct answer is &quot;E:&#39; The point is that the evaluation of a dehydrated patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) likely will require more vigilance than that of an average dehydrated patient, but do not ever call your patients &quot;average;&#39; at least not to their parents. You will recall that the screening test for CF is the sweat chloride test; high amounts of chloride in the sample are consistent with a diagnosis of CF. Therefore it stands to reason that CF patients lose more chloride (and more sodium) in their sweat, making them more prone to hypochloremia and hyponatremia, especially when they have been exercising in a warm environment. They may even be chronically hyponatremic, which leads to increased aldosterone secretion and further disturbances such as hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, otherwise known as hyperbicarbonatemia. Dehydration acutely worsens the chronic stresses on their electrolyte metabolism<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

There is no other bothersome history: No fever, no rash, no exposure to ill persons, no concerning information. The urgent care physician is worried when she sees the neonate and sends her to the emergency department (ED) for treatment. In the ED she appears tired but not truly lethargic in the medical sense; an IV line is placed, blood is obtained for laboratory studies, and she is given a 20 mL/kg normal saline bolus. After obtaining the history, the ED physician decides that the neonate would be best served by admission, and you, as the pediatrician on call, agree to take over her care. She improves following fluid administration in the ED, but when you arrive shortly thereafter, you are told that her serum sodium is 165 mEq/L. She appears well and her vital signs are within normal limits; the only other exam finding of note is mild jaundice. Her mother tells you that her birthweight was 3.5 kg, and you notice that her weight in triage was 3.0 kg.

Hepatitis B is a DNA virus that is relatively hardy. It can survive for several days in the environment before losing its infectivity. Transmission can occur by means of infected blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and open wounds) . Common modes of transmission include sexual activity, IV drug use, and vertical transmission from mother to child. Transmission through transfusion is rare in the United States due to extensive screening of blood products. Transmission between close home contacts has been documented, likely in the setting of open skin wounds such as eczema, or sharing of razors or toothbrushes. Percutaneous needle injury can transmit infection up to 62% of the time if the source is hepatitis B positive. Disease transmission can be prevented by preexposure vaccination as well as postexposure prophylaxis and vaccination, depending on the situation. A child who has been potentially exposed to hepatitis B should be assessed for immunization history and response to vaccination. A child with an up-to-date vaccination record who has regular access to medical care should have received the hepatitis B series as an infant. A hepatitis B surface antibody measurement should be obtained to determine immunity because results usually are rapid and can inform care. A level of antibody that is 10 miU/mL or greater indicates immunity and no further therapy is needed. If the source is known to be hepatitis B positive, exposed nonimmunized patients or patients who did not respond to initial vaccine series should be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and a dose of hepatitis B vaccine. If hepatitis B status of the source is unknown but is high risk, vaccine nonresponders should be treated with HBIG and vaccine.</p>\r\n",

These antibodies are nearly universally found in the serum of women whose fetuses are diagnosed in utero with congenital heart block. One of the most devastating fetal/neonatal consequences of this passively acquired autoimmune disorder is involvement of the cardiac conducting system with subsequent rhythm<br />\r\nabnormalities such as congenital heart block. This abnormal cardiac rhythm is typically diagnosed between 16 and 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation and is associated with a 20% mortality rate in the fetus/newborn. Complete congenital heart block is generally irreversible and surviving children typically require pacing. Fewer than one-third of mothers of affected infants have a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and many women are asymptomatic.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
