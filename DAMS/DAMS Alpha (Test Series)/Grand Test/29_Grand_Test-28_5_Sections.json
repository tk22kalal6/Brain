The ear bleeding is a feature of longitudinal fracture. This fracture is due to fall on the side. Battle sign is ecchymosis around the mastoid tip area which is seen in temporal bone fractures. This fracture causes ossicular dislocation and hence conductive hearing loss. Transverse fractures lead to cochlear injury and hence cause SNHL. CSF otorrhoea is more common with longitudinal fractures\r\n\r\n•\tIn temporal bone fractures, the facial palsy is either of immediate (Transverse fractures) or delayed onset  ( Longitudinal fractures)\r\n\r\n•\tImmediate onset need immediate surgery which is facial nerve decompression and if need be end to end anastomosis or nerve grafting\r\n\r\n•\tDelayed onset should be managed with 3 weeks of steroid therapy as the cause is oedema in this case. If there is no recovery after 3 weeks of steroid therapy, electrophysiological nerve testing should be done (Electroneuronography). If there is significant facial nerve degeneration, patient should be taken for surgery (facial nerve decompression) should be done.",

It differs from a closed pneumothorax, during which air enters the pleural cavity from the lungs themselves. An open pneumothorax can occur as a result of direct trauma or could be iatrogenic.<br />\r\nAn open pneumothorax is treated by applying a three-way dressing to the wound, which involves taping the dressing on only three of the edges. The intent is to prevent the individual from breathing in air through the opening in the chest wall while allowing them to exhale air from their lungs. An inserted chest tube will further assist the individual in breathing. If the dressing is not properly applied, and it allows air into the chest space without allowing it to escape, a tension pneumothorax may develop.</p>\r\n",
