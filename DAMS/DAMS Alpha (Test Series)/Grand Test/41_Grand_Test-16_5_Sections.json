The oculomotor nerve originates in the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain, emerges from the anterior midbrain, and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The patient also has loss of the corneal reflex on the left side. The sensory limb of the corneal reflex is mediated by the nasociliary branch of the first division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V,). The motor component of the corneal reflex is carried primarily by the temporal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). Like the oculomotor nerve, the nasociliary nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Thus, a lesion involving the superior orbital fissure would cause the described deficits</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major adverse effect associated with statin use is myopathy. Myopathy refers to a broad spectrum of muscle complaints, ranging from mild muscle soreness or weakness (myalgia) to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. The risk of muscle adverse effects increases in proportion to statin dose and plasma concentrations. . Measurements of creatinine kinase are not routinely necessary unless the patient also is taking a drug that enhances the risk of myopathy. Concomitant use of drugs that diminish statin catabolism or interfere with hepatic uptake is associated with increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. The most common statin interactions occur with fibrates, especially gemfibrozil (38%), and with cyclosporine (4%), digoxin (5%), warfarin (4%), macrolide antibiotics (3%), and azole antifungals (1%). Other drugs that increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy include niacin (rare), HIV protease inhibitors, amiodarone, and nefazodone.</p>\r\n",

Undifferentiated nonkeratinizing NPC is the most common type of NPC and is strongly associated with the Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV) in practically 100% of cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most common site of origin for NPC is the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, especially the fossa of Rosenm&uuml;ller, followed by the superior posterior wall. Nearly half of patients complain of nasal symptoms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Symptoms related to Eustachian tube obstruction, such as serous otitis media, also commonly occur. Headache and cranial nerve involvement are features of more advanced stages. A direct lateral spread of NPC involves the third division of the trigeminal nerve (V3). The perineural spread of the V3 is one of the most common and important routes in the intracranial paracavernous extension of NPC [3].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gadolinium-enhanced, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted MR imaging is very useful in detecting perineural tumor invasion and extracranial lesions</p>\r\n",

During the arterial sample collection from the radial artery, there is a small risk of thrombosis.
