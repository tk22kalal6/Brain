Levodopa-carbidopa is effective but may lead to rebound effects, so direct dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole) are now preferred.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D) ROUTINE AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Routine airway management associated with general anesthesia consists of: &bull; Airway assessment &bull; Preparation and equipment check &bull; Patient positioning &bull; Preoxygenation &bull; Induction agent &bull; Bag and mask ventilation (BMV) &bull; Muscle relaxant &bull; Intubation (if indicated) &bull; Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement &bull; Intraoperative management and troubleshooting &bull; Extubation AIRWAY ASSESSMENT Airway assessment is the first step in successful airway management. Important points are: &bull; Mouth opening: an incisor distance of 3 cm or greater is desirable in an adult. &bull; Mallampati classification: a frequently performed test that examines the size of the tongue in relation to the oral cavity. The greater the tongue obstructs the view of the pharyngeal structures, the more difficult intubation may be ■ Class I: the entire palatal arch, including the bilateral faucial pillars, are visible down to their bases. ■ Class II: the upper part of the faucial pillars and most of the uvula are visible. ■ Class III: only the soft and hard palates are visible. ■ Class IV: only the hard palate is visible. &bull; Thyromental distance: the distance between the mentum and the superior thyroid notch. A distance greater than 3 fingerbreadths is desirable. &bull; Neck circumference: a neck circumference of greater than 27 in is suggestive of difficulties in visualization of the glottic opening. EQUIPMENT Preparation is mandatory for all airway management scenarios. The following equipment is routinely needed in airway management situations: &bull; An oxygen source &bull; BMV capability &bull; Laryngoscopes (direct and video) &bull; Several endotracheal tubes of different sizes &bull; Other (not endotracheal tube) airway devices (eg, oral, nasal airways) &bull; Suction &bull; Oximetry and CO2 detection &bull; Stethoscope &bull; Tape &bull; Blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) monitors &bull; Intravenous access POSITIONING &bull; When manipulating the airway, correct patient positioning is required. &bull; Relative alignment of the oral and pharyngeal axes is achieved by having the patient in the &ldquo;sniffing&rdquo; position. &bull; When cervical spine pathology is suspected, the head must be kept in a neutral position during all airway manipulations. &bull; In-line stabilization of the neck must be maintained during airway management in these patients &bull; Patients with morbid obesity should be positioned on a 30&deg; upward ramp, as the functional residual capacity (FRC) of obese patients deteriorates in the supine position, leading to more rapid deoxygenation should ventilation be impaired. PREOXYGENATION &bull; When possible, preoxygenation with face mask oxygen should precede all airway management interventions. &bull; Oxygen is delivered by mask for several minutes prior to anesthetic induction. In this way, the functional residual capacity, the patient&rsquo;s oxygen reserve, is purged of nitrogen. BAG AND MASK VENTILATION &bull; Bag and mask ventilation (BMV) is the first step in airway management in most situations, with the exception of patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation. &bull; BMV precedes attempts at intubation to oxygenate the patient ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION &bull; Endotracheal intubation is employed both for the conduct of general anesthesia and to facilitate the ventilator management of the critically ill. &bull; Most common intubation is oro tracheal intubation by performing direct laryngoscopy using a curved blade laryngoscope ( macintosh blade) &bull; The laryngoscope is held in left hand and inserted from right angle of mouth and the tip of the blade is inserted till the vallecula and then lifted from the base of epiglottis to visualize the vocal cords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Capture(14).PNG\" style=\"height:180px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n",

It  is  found  in  some  people  with  no  psychiatric disorder.  For  example,  those  who  are  very  soft-hearted  may  be  easily  moved to  tears.  Those  with  personality  disorder  of  the  borderline  type  may  also exhibit  lability  of  affect.  However,  it  is  most common in mixed affective states (dysphoric  mania)  and  in  mania  where  short  bursts  of  weeping  are  present.

In addition, a significant increase is seen in the anion gap, which is 30 mEq/L. Of the answer choices, the ingestion most likely to cause an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis is ethanol. Ethanol is the main form of alcohol in grain alcohol, which is used in common libations such as beer, wine, vodka, gin, moonshine, and other spirits. Although the ingestion of ethanol itself does not necessarily generate a metabolic acidosis, ethanol can cause an increase in both lactic acid and ketoacids production and thus produce an anion gap acidosis as a result of the byproducts of metabolism. Ethanol also causes reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreased insulin secretion, increased lipolysis, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and subsequent ketogenesis, leading to an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis.\r\n",

Anaphylaxis is the sudden, life-threatening, IgE-mediated, systemic reaction to an allergen, which may be known or unknown. Anaphylaxis has been defined as an acute reaction that involves 2 or more organ systems (e.g., skin, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory) after exposure to an allergen. The definition has been expanded to include the isolated finding of hypotension after exposure to an allergen. Symptoms of anaphylaxis may include rash, flushing, pruritus, rhinorrhea, stridor, cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, and hypotension. Approximately 10% of children with anaphylaxis do not have cutaneous involvement.\r\nFirst-line treatment of anaphylaxis is the immediate administration of 0.01 mg/kg of 1:1,000 concentration of intramuscular epinephrine. Intramuscular administration is preferred over subcutaneous due to more efficient absorption, Delayed administration of epinephrine has been associated with fatal outcomes.\r\n",
