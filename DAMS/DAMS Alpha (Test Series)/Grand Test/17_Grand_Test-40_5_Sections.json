Net flux is inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane and the size (specifically, the square root of the gram molecular weight) of the molecule. During acute renal failure, dialysis is often used to support renal function until renal recovery occurs. Hemodialysis relies on the effectiveness of solute diffusion across a semipermeable membrane.

They deliver nutrients and oxygen to the juxtamedullary nephrons and help to maintain the corticopapillary gradient. Vasa recta carry blood at a very slow (not fast) rate to avoid washout of the interstitial corticopapillary osmotic gradient.  Vasa recta are a series of straight capillaries in the medulla that lie parallel to the loop of Henle of juxtamedullary nephrons, not cortical nephrons.  These are blood vessels, not renal tubules, so they do not transport filtrate. These vessels transport blood from the efferent arterioles to the medulla of\r\nthe kidney, not to the afferent arterioles.",

These outpouchings tend to expand progressively, but in most cases they remain asymptomatic. Hypertension facilitates development and rupture of berry aneurysm.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nABPA\r\n\r\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an eosinophilic pulmonary disorder that occurs in response to allergic sensitization to antigens from Aspergillus species fungi. The predominant clinical presentation of ABPA is an asthmatic phenotype，often accompanied by cough with production of brownish plugs of mucus. ABPA has also been well described as a complication of cystic fibrosis. ABPA is a distinct diagnosis from simple asthma， characterized by prominent peripheral eosinophilia and elevated circulating levels of IgE (>417 IU/mL). Establishing a diagnosis of ABPA also requires establishing sensitivity to Aspergillus antigens by skin test reactivity, positive serum precipitins for Aspergillus and/or direct measurement of circulating specific IgG and IgE to Aspergillus. Central bronchiectasis is described as a classic finding on chest imaging in ABPA but is not necessary for making a diagnosis. Other possible findings on chest imaging include patchy infiltrates and evidence of mucus impaction. Systemic glucocorticoids may be used in the treatment of ABPA that is persistently symptomatic despite the use of inhaled therapies for asthma. Monoclonal antibody against IgE (Omalizumab) can be used in treating severe ABPA, particularly in individuals with ABPA as a complication of cystic fibrosis.\r\n",

Attacks are usually precipitated by emotional stress/smoking/cocaine and amphetamine. ECG can show transient ST-T changes (elevation) suggesting Myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography may reveal normal arteries. However, 50-60% may harbour significant coronary stenosis. Hence, provocative testing with ergonovine/intra-coronary acetylcholine is mandatory during angiography to demonstrate vasospasm. The treatment consists of Nitrates and CCB. Beta-blockers are best avoided because they may precipitate vasospasm by facilitating un-opposed alpha-action. Prognosis is excellent with <1% mortality.\r\n",

The dysregulation arises due to the lack of sympathetic tone and an unopposed parasympathetic response.\r\nCharacteristic vital signs of neurogenic shock include hypotension accompanied by bradycardia. This differs from the presentation in patients with non-spinal cord injuries and experiencing hypovolemic shock, where hypotension is associated with tachycardia. Patients with neurogenic shock may exhibit warm and pink skin, contrasting with cool and pallid skin often observed in patients with hypovolemic shock.\r\n",

Overexpression of Her2/neu is a poor prognostic factor.\r\n•\tOther negative markers include those tumors that do not express any tumor biomarkers (“triple negative”), the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and other indicators of a high proliferative rate (>5% of cells in the S phase; >20% Ki-67).\r\n",

Ego defenses are divided into two categories - immature (more primitive) and mature (less primitive). Splitting is an immature ego defense such that one believes that all people are either all good or all bad. This is commonly seen in people with borderline personalitydisorder.\r\n\r\nIn the context of childhood abuse, children use splitting to help them compartmentalize and sequester those negative events in their life. Otherwise, if they did not do so, some slight traumatic experience could cause them to relive those painful memories all over again.\r\n\r\nA review of the ego defenses amongst children that are abused, neglected, and non-maltreated, found that children who were abused and neglected as compared to non-abused/neglected children scored higher for ego defenses for regression, denial, splitting, and projection.\r\n\r\nA: Acting out is an immature ego defense such that one uses actions to express unacceptable feelings and thoughts.\r\n\r\nB Denial is an immature ego defense such that one exhibits avoidance of awareness of some painful reality.\r\n\r\nC Projection is an immature ego defense such that one attributes unacceptable internal feelings to an external source.",
