Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or to result in death. Option D. Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a common low-grade (unlikely to metastasize or invade) rapidly-growing skin tumour that is believed to originate from the hair follicle (pilosebaceous unit) and can resemble squamous cell carcinoma. The defining characteristic of a keratoacanthoma is that it is dome-shaped, symmetrical, surrounded by a smooth wall of inflamed skin, and capped with keratin scales and debris. It grows rapidly, reaching a large size within days or weeks, and if untreated for months will almost always starve itself of nourishment, necrose (die), slough, and heal with scarring</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trousseau sign of latent tetany is a medical sign observed in patients with low calcium. From 1 to 4 percent of normal patients will test positive for Trousseau&#39;s sign of latent tetany. This sign may be positive before other manifestations of hypocalcemia such as hyperreflexia and tetany, as such it is generally believed to be more sensitive (94%) than the Chvostek sign (29%) for hypocalcemia. To elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 minutes. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient&#39;s hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the f ingers adduct. Option B. The Chvostek sign is a clinical sign of existing nerve hyperexcitability (tetany) seen in hypocalcemia. It refers to an abnormal reaction to the stimulation of the facial nerve. When the facial nerve is tapped in front of tragus the facial muscles on the same side of the face will contract momentarily (typically a twitch of the nose or lips) because of hypocalcemia (i.e. from hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypovitaminosis D) with resultant hyperexcitability of nerves. Option C. Troisier&rsquo;s sign is enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node seen in intra abdominal malignancies Option D. Trousseau Syndrome is migratory thrombophlebitis seen in patients with intra abdominal malignancies. Most commonly associated with pancreatic Ca.</p>\r\n",

A large atraumatic hemostat is used to clamp the hepatoduodenal ligament (free border of the lesser omentum) interrupting the flow of blood through the hepatic artery and the portal vein and thus helping to control bleeding from the liver. More commonly, in the absence of soft clamp, manual compression of the hepatoduodenal ligament is performed. Should bleeding continue, it is likely that the inferior vena cava or the hepatic vein were also traumatised. If bleeding continues, a variation in arterial blood flow may be present.</p>\r\n",

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice, but pentamidine is used for those with sulfa allergy. Levofloxacin does not cover PCP. However, if there are infiltrates, it can be added for possible bacterial pneumonia. Adjunctive corticosteroids can decrease the inflammatory response associated with PCP. Also, they can reduce the decline of oxygenation and reduce the incidence of respiratory failure.</p>\r\n",
