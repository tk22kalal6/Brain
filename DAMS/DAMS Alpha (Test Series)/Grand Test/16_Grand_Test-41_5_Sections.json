It inserts aquaporin channel into the collecting duct to increase water resorption from urine. In this runner, rapid ingestion of a large volume of free water can lead to hyponatremia. If the change in plasma osmolarity is rapid, it can cause a potentially fatal cerebral edema when fluid moves from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid compartment. To maintain plasma osmolarity, ADH release is inhibited, causing fewer aquaporin channels to be inserted in the collecting duct and resulting in less water resorption from urine, reduced urine osmolarity, and increased urine volume. \r\n",

Since resistance is also inversely proportional to the radius raised to the fourth power, this patient will have a 93.75% decrease in LAD flow. This relationship is dictated by Pouiseuille&#39;s equation = (pi*pressure difference*radius^4)/(8*viscosity*length)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flow through a vessel can be calculated by dividing the pressure gradient (P1 &ndash; P2) by the resistance exerted by the walls of the vessel. Furthermore, resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. Clinically, this means that small stenoses in blood vessels can lead to dramatic decreases in the amount of blood that reaches a tissue. In this patient, the radius of her LAD is decreased by &frac12; so the flow through the LAD will be decreased to 1/16 of baseline. This can also be expressed by saying that flow is diminished by 93.75%.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

On questioning, the patient indicates she had trouble walking for 5 days last month and also that she has experienced pain and prickly sensations that come and go, as well as occasional muscle weakness. Vital Signs: T 36.5°C, P 70/min, R 15/min, BP 124/80 mm Hg, BMI 27. Muscle strength testing: Normal. Deep tendon reflexes: Normal. When asked to walk, the patient had difficulty in balancing and maintaining a normal gait. Patellar tendon reflexes were normal. The muscles, however, were weak. LABORATORY STUDIES- MRI indicated Gd-enhancing brain lesions, as well as one infratentorial lesion and three periventricular lesions in the brain. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed an oligoclonal IgG band. During the initial stages of this disease, how would the velocity of action potential transmission be altered within the central nervous system?  ",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myelinated axons would show a decreased conduction velocity, and unmyelinated axons would show no change in conduction velocity.<br />\r\nMultiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that leads to loss of myelin from central nervous system axons. The lost myelin is replaced by scar tissue called sclerosis. The central nervous system damage results in multiple lesions that are visible on magnetic resonance imaging. Demyelinating diseases diminish the speed of axonal transmission. Consequently, this negatively impacts the coordinated and sequential activation of motor neurons necessary for walking. The difficulty in walking is likely due to damage to the myelinated axons of the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Deep tendon reflexes are normal because the neuromuscular transmission is working normally in the early stage of the disease. Similarly, muscle weakness may not be apparent. However, over time, the degeneration of the nerves will lead to muscle atrophy and weakness.</p>\r\n",

It reduces surface tension by disrupting the intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) between molecules of water. This prevents small alveoli from collapsing and increases compliance.

This is a case of foreign body aspiration.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An inhaled foreign body is a medical emergency which can affect anyone and can occur when least expected. Any medical practitioner should be confident in the &nbsp;basic emergency treatment of a choking patient.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a case which would benefit from the Heimlich manoeuvre, which should be continued until the patient either recovers or becomes unconscious.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves giving two breaths and 30 chest compressions. This is of no use in this case, as the patient&rsquo;s airway is blocked and no breaths will reach his lungs. Performing chest compressions will only continue to pump increasingly deoxygenated blood to the brain. The Heimlich manoeuvre is required here. This involves standing behind the patient with the patient leaning slightly forward. The physician&rsquo;s arms should be placed around the patient, so that the hands are clasped just below the patient&rsquo;s costal margin in the midline. A sudden, strong, inward and upward thrust must be made using the hands to replicate the patient&rsquo;s natural cough mechanism and help to clear the airway.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Obstruction of the larynx must be cleared within a few minutes, otherwise the resulting laryngospasm will most certainly kill the patient. On the other hand, if a foreign body is obstructing one of the two bronchi, the other bronchus may still allow oxygenation of blood for a short time before the signs of hyperinflation and subsequent pneumothorax become apparent.</p>\r\n",

This leads to a state of Pseudo-Hyperaldosteronism. This causes Urinary Na+ and water reabsorption even in absence of a measurable Renin levels leading to increase in Plasma volume. This leads to development of Hypertension which is often diagnosed incidentally. &nbsp;Treatment is available in form of Amiloride (which blocks the eNa+ channels) and offers potential cure.<br />\r\nBarrter&rsquo;s and Gitelman&rsquo;s syndrome are inhibitory defects of Na-K-2Cl ATPase pump and Na-Cl transporter respectively leading to defect in Na+ and water reabsorption. Hence, both syndromes are associated with dehydration.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Interruption of the cervical sympathetic trunk leads to miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis, the triad of signs that constitutes Horner syndrome. Involvement of the nerve roots causes pain along the corresponding dermatomes.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dexamethasone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effectiveness of oral corticosteroids in viral croup is well established. Corticosteroids decrease the edema in the laryngeal mucosa through their anti-inflammatory action. Oral steroids are beneficial, even in mild croup, as measured by reduced hospitalization, shorter duration of hospitalization, and reduced need for subsequent interventions such as epinephrine administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most studies that demonstrated the efficacy of oral dexamethasone used a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg; a dose as low as 0.15 mg/ kg may be just as effective. Intramuscular dexamethasone and nebulized budesonide have an equivalent clinical effect; oral dosing of dexamethasone is as effective as intramuscular administration. A single dose of oral prednisolone is less effective. There are no controlled studies examining the effectiveness of multiple doses of corticosteroids</p>\r\n",
