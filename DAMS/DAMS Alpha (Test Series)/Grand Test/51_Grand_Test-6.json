This part of the gut tube becomes the cloaca.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>The allantoic duct extends into the umbilical cord and, in lower species, serves as a pathway for waste. In humans, it does not serve this function and is vestigial.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>The anterior protion of the cloaca forms the urinary bladder, and the allantoic duct passes from the bladder into the umbilical cord.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Normally, this duct becomes a fibrous cord called the urachus and persists in the adult as the median umbilical ligament.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>If it remains patent as a duct, urine may-pass from the urinary bladder through the duct to the umbilicus. This is called a urachal fistula.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nFractional excretion of sodium of 3% \r\n\r\nIodinated contrast media is toxic to renal tubular cells. In patients with underlying risk factors such as diabetes, or age and heart failure, contrast media containing more than 100g of iodide can induce acute tubular necrosis. There is an immediate vasoconstriction and reduction in renal blood flow after administering a contrast agent. This results in damage and death of the tubular epithelial cells and impairment of renal function. The contrast media exert regional effects within the kidney, which results in the elimination of selective transport processes. The integrity of the epithelial cell tight junctions is disrupted, and the dead epithelial cells are sloughed into the lumen where they can occlude the lumen and disrupt the flow of filtrate. Epithelial cells from the later tubular segments will pass through the tubule and be excreted as “casts” and debris. Impaired renal function leads to an increase in plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Creatinine and BUN remain elevated but begin to return toward normal as tubular function is reestablished. Normally, greater than 99% of the filtered sodium load is reabsorbed in the tubular segments. This means that the normal fractional excretion of sodium is less than 1%. Fractional excretion of greater than 2% of the filtered sodium load is characteristic of epithelial cell damage, as is the inability to produce a urine that has a higher osmolality than plasma. In addition, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are commonly encountered.",

Disruption of negative feedback is characteristic of many endocrine tumors, including the parathyroid adenoma. Hyperparathyroidism disrupts calcium regulation. Excessive stimulation of bone reabsorption causes depletion of hydroxyapatite crystals, weakening the bone. The persistent elevation in plasma calcium facilitates the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones. In severe cases, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting may occur, as can depression. The constellation of potential hyperparathyroid symptoms is summarized as &ldquo;bones, stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osteoporosis is a significant concern for postmenopausal women and can contribute to bone weakness.

These reasons may include anencephaly, twins, wrong gestational age of the fetus, or fetal demise. The approximately 20 patients with no obvious cause for their elevations should then be offered counselling and amniocentesis. Of patients without a benign explanation, about 5% have an elevated amniotic fluid &alpha;-fetoprotein (AFP) and positive acetylcholinesterase. Such patients will have a greater than 99% chance of having a baby with an open neural tube defect or other serious malformations, such as a ventral wall defect. Amniography is an outmoded procedure in which radiopaque dye is injected into the amniotic cavity for the purpose of taking x-rays. Under no circumstances whatsoever should termination of pregnancy be recommended on the basis of MSAFP testing alone.

There is no consensus on whether antepartum fetal tesƟng is necessary in women with well-controlled gestational diabetes. Antepartum fetal testing is recommended for women with preexisting diabetes mellitus and those who require insulin therapy. There is no good evidence to support routine delivery before 40 weeks when glucose control is good and no other complications supervene. Caesarean delivery may be considered in women with gestational diabetes if the estimated fetal weight is 4500 g or more. Insulin therapy is indicated if diet cannot keep fasting glucose below 95 and 2-hour values below 120</p>\r\n",

Although the donor placenta is usually pale and somewhat atrophied, that of the recipient is congested and enlarged. Hydramnios can develop in either twin, but is more frequent in the recipient because of circulatory overload. When hydramnios occurs in the donor, it is owing to congestive heart failure caused by severe anemia</p>\r\n",

Estimates of its incidence range from 1 in 7000 to 1 in 15,000 pregnancies. This disorder is usually fatal for both mother and baby. Recently, it has been suggested that recessively inherited mitochondrial abnormalities of fatty acid oxidation predispose a woman to fatty liver in pregnancy. This disorder usually manifests itself late in pregnancy and is more common in nulliparous women. Typically, a patient will present with a several-day or -week history of general malaise, anorexia, nausea, emesis, and jaundice. Liver enzymes are usually not elevated above 500. Indications of liver failure are present, manifested by elevated PT/PTT, bilirubin, and ammonia levels. In addition, there is marked hypoglycemia. Low fibrinogen and platelet levels occur secondary to a consumptive coagulopathy</p>\r\n",

The inlet is digitally measured by the diagonal conjugate which is typically 1.5 cm greater than the inlet, therefore a pelvic inlet contraction is defined as a diagonal conjugate less than 11.5 cm. The midpelvis extends from the inferior margin of the symphysis to the is chial spines bilaterally to the sacrum near the junction of the fourth and fifthh vertebrae. The average mid-pelvis measurements include: interischial spinous 10.5 cm, anteroposterior from symphysis to sacrum 11.5 cm and posterior sagittal from midpoint of interspinous line to sacrum 5 cm. But there is no precise manual measurement of the midpelvis but contraction is suggested if the spines are prominent, the pelvic sidewalls converge or if the sacrosciatic notch is narrow. The contracted outlet is defined as a intertuberous diameter of 8 cm or less. Outlet contraction without concomitant midpelvis contraction is rare. A generally contracted pelvis is caused by combinations of contractions in the inlet, midpelvis, and outlet.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nDysmenorrhea is considered secondary if associated with pelvic disease such as endometriosis, uterine myomas, or pelvic inflammatory disease. Primary dysmenorrhea is associated with a normal pelvic examination and with ovulatory cycles. The pain of dysmenorrhea is usually accompanied by other symptoms (nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and headache), which may be related to excess of prostaglandin F2α . The two major drug therapies effective in dysmenorrhea are oral contraceptives and antiprostaglandins. GnRH analogues are used in several gynecologic conditions, but would not be first-line therapy for primary dysmenorrhea. Danazol is used for the treatment of endometriosis and ergot derivatives for hyperprolactinemia. Analgesics such as codeine or narcotics would generally be employed only in very severe cases when no other treatment provides adequate relief. Treatment will reduce the number of women incapacitated by menstrual symptoms to about 10% of those treated. Contrary to past beliefs, psychological factors play only a minor role in dysmenorrhea.",

Individuals with Kallmann’s syndrome may have either anosmia or hyposmia. This may, however, not be obvious to the individual until more formally tested. A similar biochemical pattern is seen in men in the context of central obesity, but testicular volumes are not reduced to the extent seen here. Testicular trauma would be associated with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Klinefelter’s syndrome due to XXY karyotype results in small under-developed testes with resultant elevation in gonadotrophins.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThe ECG reveals shortened PR interval and a delta wave causing widening of the QRS. The delta wave is a “slurring” of the upstroke of the R wave caused by the early depolarization of ventricular myocardium. This is consistent with an accessory conduction pathway or WPW. The aberrant conduction tissue bypasses the normal AV node (hence the PR interval of\r\n<0.12 seconds); it leads the electrical impulse directly to the ventricle (bypassing the His-Purkinje fibers and widening the QRS complex)leading loud S1 and early A2 causing wide S2 split. Patients with HOCM usually have voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, prominent ST/T-wave changes, and may even have large Q waves owing to hypertrophy of the septum. Rheumatic mitral stenosis would cause left atrial enlargement and perhaps atrial fibrillation, not the changes seen on this ECG.\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This patient has typical ECG abnormalities of an acute myocardial infarction&nbsp;of the inferior wall (ST segment elevation in II, III, and aVF) with reciprocal ST depression in I and aVL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right coronary artery supplies blood to the right ventricle, the SA node, the inferior portions of&nbsp;the left ventricle. Infarctions involving the SA node may produce sinus dysrhythmias, including bradycardia and sinus arrest; atropine is the first choice for the inappropriate bradycardia. Inferior infarction can be associated with right ventricular infarction, which is characterized by hypotension and elevated right sided filling pressures. Even though right-sided pressures are elevated, hypotension in RV infarction often responds to saline bolus. Then, since this patient is having an acute ST-elevation MI, she should receive prompt percutaneous intervention or thrombolytics, with the goal of opening the culprit artery within 90 minutes of arrival. The use of verapamil or beta-blockers can further worsen the sinus node dysfunction and result in hypotension or shock. The use of nitroglycerin drip also can precipitate profound hypotension, as these patients are preload dependent. The use of ACE inhibitor at this time is not appropriate since patient is hemodynamically unstable.</p>\r\n",

The American College of Rheumatology has established diagnostic criteria for the disease, which include a history of widespread pain in association with 11 of 18 specific tender point sites. In this patient with very characteristic signs and symptoms, including the identification of 11 specific trigger points, the diagnosis is evident. Patients with fibromyalgia have an increased lifetime incidence of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and panic disorder. However, there is convincing evidence that fibromyalgia is a disease of abnormal central nervous pain processing associated with amplification of nociceptive stimuli. This suggests that lower thresholds for noxious stimuli are caused by a CNS abnormality of as yet undetermined etiology. Tricyclic\r\nantidepressants can provide some relief in some patients but are not the single most effective medication. ",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThis woman presents with coma and requires rapid and careful evaluation. The most common causes of coma are central nervous system infections (meningitis and encephalitis), structural central nervous system lesions, which produce compression of the brainstem, metabolic abnormalities, and drug overdose. The neurologic examination is very helpful in the evaluation of comatose patients, and should focus on specific manoeuvres: (1) testing for nuchal rigidity, (2) pupillary response to light, (3) response to painful stimulus (typically by applying firm pressure to the sternum or orbital rim), and (4) the oculocephalic reflex (doll’s eye maneuver). Neck stiffness and fever in the comatose patient would suggest meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Pupillary response to light is preserved in metabolic derangements, drug overdose, and early in space- occupying lesions. Preserved pupillary light reflex in the absence of an oculocephalic reflex is seen almost exclusively in drug overdose. In space-occupying lesions with early brainstem compression (the so-called diencephalic stage) the pupillary response to light and the oculocephalic reflex are preserved. As brainstem compression progresses to midbrain and then pons compression, pupillary response to light and the oculocephalic reflex are lost. When unilateral arm flexion with painful stimulation occurs in the comatose patient, this suggests a hemispheric mass with mild brainstem compression. As brainstem compression progresses to involve the midbrain, the comatose patient will respond to painful stimulation with arm flexion and leg extension (decorticate posturing). When brainstem compression progresses further to involve the pons, painful stimulation results in extension of both arms and legs (decerebrate posturing). This comatose patient has preserved pupillary and oculocephalic reflexes, and right arm flexion with painful stimulation. This suggests a left hemispheric space-occupying lesion with early brainstem compression. The widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and irregular breathing (Cushing reflex) also suggest increased intracranial pressure. In this patient on warfarin, these findings are likely due to an acute subdural hematoma, which may occur spontaneously or with trauma (such as falling). Emergency non-contrast CT of the head will almost always show the hematoma. Hypoglycemia is uncommon with metformin. Neither hypoglycaemia nor drug overdose would cause unilateral arm flexion with painful stimulation. In the absence of fever and neck stiffness, meningitis is unlikely. A lacunar infarct will cause focal findings (such as pure motor or pure sensory stroke) but not global brain dysfunction (coma).",

Toxins or drugs such as primaquine, sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin cause hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Since the G6PD gene is carried on the X chromosome, almost all affected patients are males. The drugs that cause hemolysis in G6PD deficiency are oxidizing agents. Oxidant stress on red blood cells is normally counteracted by reduced glutathione. NADPH (which is required to regenerate reduced glutathione after it has been oxidized) is produced by the hexose mono-phosphate shunt. G6PD is the first enzyme in this metabolic pathway. If this enzyme is less active, the cell cannot replace reduced glutathione and succumbs to oxidizing stress. Clinically this can range from mild to life-threatening hemolysis. It is usually necessary to wait several weeks or months after the hemolytic episode to measure G6PD levels. In mild cases, no treatment is necessary; once the offending drug is eliminated, the hemolysis resolves. Splenectomy is sometimes required in chronic hemolytic anaemias such as hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but not in G6PD deficiency. Methylene blue is used to treat methemoglobinemia. Vitamin E has no beneficial effect in G6PD deficiency.",

These ﬁndings are consistent with congenital toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Nonspeciﬁc neonatal ﬁndings of jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly are often present; diffuse intracranial calciﬁcations are the classic ﬁnding on imaging.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Parasitic spread of Toxoplasma begins via infected cats (host), which excrete oocysts that contaminate soil and water. Humans typically acquire the infection due to either of the following: a. &nbsp;Incidental ingestion of oocysts from cat feces (eg, handling kitty litter, consuming unwashed produce), b. Consumption of undercooked meat from farm animals that ingested oocysts and developed tissue infection. Ingestion of contaminated meat is the most common method of spread in pregnancy. Therefore, although &nbsp;maternal infection is often asymptomatic, pregnant women are advised to avoid raw, cured, and undercooked meat to reduce the risk of infection and transplacental transmission to the fetus.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

It is the most prevalent extrauterine indication for laparotomy in pregnancy. The duration of gestation does not influence the severity of the disease, but the diagnosis does become more difficult as the pregnancy progresses. By the twentieth week of gestation, the appendix often lies at the level of the umbilicus and more lateral than usual. Pregnancy should not delay surgery if appendicitis is suspected; appendiceal perforation greatly increases the chance of premature labor and foetal mortality. After appendicitis, biliary tract disease (biliary colic, cholecystitis) is the second most common non-obstetric surgical disease of the abdomen during pregnancy. Pancreatitis, intestinal obstruction, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are all less common general surgical conditions encountered during pregnancy",

As with virtually all tumour surgery the aim is to achieve clear resection margins. Therefore the operation is planned tore move the tumour and all mesenteric lymph tissue draining that area. The choice of operation in this case is either an extended right hemicolectomyor left hemicolectomy; left hemicolectomy is associated with the technical difficulty of forming a large bowel to large bowel anastomosis and the preferred technique for tumours located in the transverse colon is therefore an extended right hemicolectomy. This allows a primary anastomosis between the ileum and descending colon, which avoids the end-to-end anastomosis implicit in left hemicolectomy. A right hemicolectomy would not excise the area in question and neither would a sigmoid colectomy or an anterior resection. A total colectomyin this patient would be equally inappropriate, as the removal of the entire colon is not necessary to achieve cure.</p>\r\n",

If patients have lymph node metasta- ses in the lateral neck, concomitant modified radical neck dissection should be performed with total thyroidectomy. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes, but distant metastasis is uncommon. Overall, survival at 10 years is greater than 95%. Several scoring systems for determining prognosis have been developed; one of the more common systems takes into account age, grade, extrathy- roidal invasion and metastases, and size (AGES). The surgical management of small papillary thyroid cancers is controversial, as there is a high rate of contralateral disease (thus strengthening the argument for total thyroid- ectomy), although it is unlikely that these small contralateral tumors will ever become clinically significant (thus the argument for lobectomy alone). Medullary, but not papillary, thyroid carcinoma is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Frozen section is not useful in the evalua- tion of thyroid nodules, as extracapsular and vascular invasion is not reli- ably detected on frozen section. Radioactive iodine ablation is used after a total thyroidectomy, not a lobectomy.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nThe Stanford classification divides aortic dissections into those that involve the ascending aorta and those that do not. Aortic dissections can either be acute or chronic (greater or less than 2-week duration). Acute Stanford class A dissections, representing 60% of all dissections, are considered surgical emergencies. Stanford class B dissections are further divided into complicated (which may require intervention) and uncomplicated (asymptomatic, which can be treated with aggressive medical management) dissections. The DeBakey classification is determined by proximal and distal extent of dissection. Type I involves the ascending and descending aorta, type II only the ascending aorta, and type III only distal to the left subclavian artery takeoff. Therefore Stanford class A dissections include DeBakey type I and II dissections.",

Evidence from large prospective studies suggests that the combination of intraoperative gamma probe detection of radioactive colloid and intraoperative visualization of blue dye (isosulfan blue dye or methylene blue) is more accurate for identification of SLNs than the use of either agent alone. Some surgeons use preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, although it is not required for identification of the SLNs. On the day before surgery, or the day of surgery, the radioactive colloid is injected either in the breast parenchyma around the primary tumor or prior biopsy site, into the subareolar region, or subdermally in proximity to the primary tumor site. With a 25-gauge needle, 0.5 mCi of 0.2-μm technetium 99m–labeled sulfur colloid is injected for same-day surgery, or a higher dose of 2.5 mCi of technetium-labeled sulfur colloid is administered when the isotope is to be injected on the day before surgery.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Widening of the carotid bifurcation by a well-defined tumor blush (lyre sign) on CT is considered a pathognomonic finding for a carotid body tumor. Patients typically present in the fourth or fifth decade with a slow-growing rounded neck mass. It is usually located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid near the angle of the mandible. Carotid body tumors can only be moved side to side but not up or down because of their location within the carotid sheath (Fontaine sign).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment of carotid body tumors is surgical. One dangerous pitfall in excising these tumors is that, in an effort to excise completely, the dissection is carried too close to the artery. In so doing, part of the adventitia of the carotid artery may inadvertently be removed. Since the adventitia is the strongest layer, the artery may weaken and blow out postoperatively. Thus, excision should be done in a periadventitial plane. If a subadventitial plane is inadvertently entered, this increases the risk of hemorrhage and arterial injury. Because of their vascular nature, biopsy is contraindicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Routine preoperative embolization is not necessary but should be considered in large tumors (&gt;4cm) (A). Radiation therapy may be considered for long-term tumor control in patients that are not candidates for surgery (e.g., inaccessible site) (B). Chemotherapy has no role in the management of these tumors (C). Excising the carotid bifurcation should be avoided</p>\r\n",

It occurs 50 to 100 times more often in critically illpatients. It can occur after transfusion of any component of bloodbut is most associated with fresh-frozen plasma and red blood cells.Several hypotheses exist regarding its pathogenesis, includinghuman leukocyte antigen–specific antibody in the donor directedagainst an antigen in the recipient, resulting in an inflammatoryresponse causing damage to the endothelial lining of the lungs.Criteria for diagnosis include acute onset, usually within 6 h oftransfusion, hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300, andbilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray in a patient with no alternativerisk for lung injury. Symptoms include dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. Treatment is supportive, withapproximately 70%–90% of patients requiring ventilator support.Being diagnosed with TRALI does not affect the ability to receiveblood transfusions in the future. However, risk reduction maneuversincluding restrictive transfusion policies and washing of storedblood products should be employed with future transfusions.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nSialolithiasis (salivary ductal stones) can increase the risk of developing a tumor of the gland. Lemon drops will stimulate saliva production and help facilitate passage of the stone. Pleomorphic adenoma is benign and considered the most common neo- plasm of the parotid gland. In general, the risk of nerve injury is greatest in patients with reoperation of the neck (e.g., incomplete parotidectomy requiring re-excision). Total parotidectomy or excision involving the deep lobe of the parotid glands leads to a higher rate of cranial neuropathy, compared to superficial parotidectomy. In most cases, the neuropathy is transient and improves within a month. The most common nerve injured during parotidectomy is the facial nerve, most commonly the marginal mandibular branch, and will present with facial droop (A). However, other nerves are also at risk. The greater auricular nerve is a branch of the cervical plexus (C2–C3) and provides cutaneous sensation to the lower portion of the ear, including the earlobe. Injury to the trigeminal nerve can cause widespread numbness in the face (C). How- ever, this type of injury occurs rarely because of the deep location, immediate branch- ing, and redundancy of these nerves. An injured spinal accessory nerve will present with partial paralysis of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles (D). The auricu- lar branch of the vagus nerve provides cutaneous sensation to the ear canal, not the earlobe",
