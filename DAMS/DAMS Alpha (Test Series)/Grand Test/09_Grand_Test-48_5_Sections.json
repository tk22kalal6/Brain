Even though the stab wound is at the left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space, the heart is oriented in the thorax such that the right ventricle forms the majority of the anterior surface of the heart, lying just behind the sternum.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like Acetazolamide block the reabsorption of HCO3- and Na+, resulting in diuresis. Because almost all of the filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed in the PCT, inhibiting carbonic anhydrase has little effect on bicarbonate reabsorption from other segments.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAcetazolamide taken a few days prior to ascent to high altitude prevents the symptoms of mountain sickness due to the following: (i) prevention of fluid retention via diuresis (ii) production of metabolic acidosis from decreased bicarbonate reabsorption which offsets respiratory alkalosis in high altitude, and (iii) inhibition of pulmonary vasoconstriction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The campaign, titled Healthy beginnings, hopeful futures, will urge governments and the health community to ramp up efforts to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths, and to prioritize women&rsquo;s longer-term health and well-being.<br />\r\nWHO and partners will also share useful information to support healthy pregnancies and births, and better postnatal health.<br />\r\nHelping every woman and baby survive and thrive<br />\r\nThis task is critical. Tragically, close to 300 000 women lose their life due to pregnancy or childbirth each year, while over 2 million babies die in their first month of life and millions more are stillborn. That&rsquo;s roughly 1 preventable death every 7 seconds.<br />\r\nBased on current trends, a staggering 4 out of 5 countries are off track to meet global targets for improving maternal survival by 2030.<br />\r\nListening to women and supporting families<br />\r\nWomen and families everywhere need high quality care that supports them physically and emotionally, before, during and after birth.<br />\r\nHealth systems must evolve to manage the many health issues that impact maternal and newborn health. These not only include direct obstetric complications but also mental health conditions, noncommunicable diseases and family planning.<br />\r\nAdditionally, women and families should be supported by laws and policies that safeguard their health and rights.<br />\r\nCampaign goals<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To raise awareness about gaps in maternal and newborn survival and the need to prioritize women&rsquo;s longer-term well-being.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To advocate for effective investments that improve the health of women and babies. <br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To encourage collective action to support parents as well as health professionals who provide critical care.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To provide useful health information relating to pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most probable diagnosis is Psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by well-demarcated erythematous plaques with silvery-white scales, commonly found on extensor surfaces like the elbows and knees. A hallmark clinical feature of psoriasis is the Auspitz sign, where pinpoint bleeding occurs upon removal of the scales &mdash; exactly what is described in the question. Psoriasis most often affects adults in their 20s to 40s and typically presents with symmetrical lesions on extensor areas, scalp, and lower back. The presence of silvery scales and bleeding on removal is very specific and points strongly toward psoriasis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect Options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Pityriasis rosea: This condition usually begins with a single herald patch followed by multiple smaller lesions in a Christmas tree pattern on the trunk. The scales are typically fine and not silvery, and bleeding on scale removal (Auspitz sign) is not a feature. It is not localized to elbows or knees, and hence does not match the described presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Pityriasis versicolor: Caused by Malassezia furfur, this is a fungal infection that presents with hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules mostly on the upper trunk, neck, and upper arms. The lesions are usually non-scaly or have very fine scaling, and there is no Auspitz sign. It does not typically involve the elbows and knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Lichen Planus (LP): LP is characterized by violaceous, polygonal, flat-topped, itchy papules, often involving the wrists, ankles, and mucosal surfaces. The scales, if present, are not silvery, and bleeding on removal is not a typical feature. Moreover, the classical distribution of LP is different from the extensor pattern seen in psoriasis.</p>\r\n",

Control of the serum phosphate levels with a low-phosphate diet and phosphate-binding agents is essential.&nbsp;<br />\r\nPatients with dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure require calcitriol, oral calcium supplementation, calcium in the dialysate, aluminum-free phosphate binders, and cinacalcet to maintain levels of serum calcium and phosphate within normal ranges.

This young woman has also developed a fear of leaving the house (agoraphobia) which occurs in some patients with panic disorder. While the most effective immediate treatment for this patient is a benzodiazepine because it works quickly, the most effective long-term (maintenance) management is an antidepressant, particularly a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as paroxetine (Paxil).

Progesterone is known to increase the viscosity of cervical mucus and hence ascending infection risk is reduced so the risk of PID is reduced. Combined OC pills increase the risk of adenocarcinoma of endocervix slightly. Combined oc pills reduce the risk of osteoporosis and hence femur fractures are not increased because of COC pills. Combined OC pills lead to suppression of LH and FSH and hence ovarian function is suppressed. Hence combined oc pills are known to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It happens during pregnancy. The most common fibroid type is intramural fibroid. Any patient with submucosal pedunculated fibroid which is also called FIGO-0 fibroid must be treated by hysteroscopic myomectomy if the fibroid is symptomatic. Endometrial ablation therapy is done only if patient doesn&rsquo;t want to conceive in future because this therapy will burn out the endometrium, making the patient infertile. This is the treatment for menorrhagia due to fibroid uterus. It is done only if her childbearing function is over.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The reason for this is that after childbirth, the body is still undergoing significant changes, and there are some factors to consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technical difficulty</strong>: In the immediate postpartum period, especially if performed shortly after delivery, there may be anatomical changes that make the procedure more difficult or risky, such as uterine enlargement or increased blood flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; &nbsp;&nbsp;Increased risk of complications</strong>: Performing the procedure too soon after delivery could increase the risk of complications like infection or bleeding. It&#39;s generally advised to wait a few weeks to a few months post-delivery (typically 6 weeks) to allow for recovery before proceeding with sterilization.</p>\r\n",
