      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\nEthmoid  Sinus\r\nSol:\r\nWhen the mucosal lining (sinus mucosa) of the ethmoid sinuses develops inflammation, it results in swelling (edema) of the mucosa. Considering that ostia (conduit that drains ethmoid sinuses into the nose) is very small in diameter to start with, inflammation/swelling of the mucosa causes the blockage of the ostia. Reduction in the flow of the mucociliary drainage causes the mucus content to accumulate within the ethmoid sinuses. Build up of mucosal secretions within the sinuses eventually results in an infection -a condition known as Ethmoid Sinusitis or Ethmoiditis.\r\nSymptoms of ethmoid sinusitis often includes:\r\n•\tHeadache in the temples,\r\n•\tPain in the lower forehead,\r\n•\tStuffy/Runny nose, \r\n•\tBreathing difficulties,\r\n•\tSinus pain and/or sinus pressure around the inner corners of the eyes,\r\n•\tWorsening of the symptoms while lying on the back and improvement of the same while the head in upright position.\r\n",

The umbilical vein has the highest oxygen saturation of the fetus (70%). The superior vein cava has the lowest oxygen content of the fetus because of high oxygen extraction by the brain (estimated oxygen saturation=40%). Blood from the umbilical vein, inferior vein cava, and superior vein cava returns to the right atrium and right ventricle leading to a combined oxygen saturation of approximately 55%. Blood in the left atrium is a mixture of blood entering from the umbilical vein and crossing the right atrium through the foramen ovale (70% oxygen saturation), as well as a small amount of blood returning from the fetal pulmonary circulation (55% oxygen saturation). Thus, the oxygen saturations on the left side of the heart tend to be higher than the right-sided chambers. The estimated intrauterine oxygen saturations in humans\r\n",

Half of healthy adults with Babesia infection are asymptomatic. When people do develop symptoms, the most common are fever and hemolyticanemia, symptoms that are similar to those of malaria. In more severe cases, symptoms similar to malaria occur, with fevers up to 40.5 °C (105 °F), shaking chills, and severe anemia (hemolyticanemia). Organ failure may follow, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis in people who have had a splenectomy can occur rapidly, consistent with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. Severe cases are also more likely to occur in the very young, very old, and persons with immunodeficiency, such as HIV/AIDS patients.\r\nThe smear shows hemozoin deficient trophozoites and is diagnostic.  In mild-to-moderate babesiosis, the treatment of choice is a combination of atovaquone and azithromycin. The standard course is 7 to 10 days, but this is extended to at least 6 weeks in people with relapsing disease. In severe babesiosis, the combination of clindamycin and quinine is preferred. In life-threatening cases, exchange transfusion is performed.\r\n",

The blunt force typically also produces an underlying pulmonary contusion. To confirm the diagnosis the chest wall can be observed for paradoxical motion of a chest wall segment. On inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall is displaced inwards and therefore less air moves into the lungs. On expiration, the segment moves outwards (paradoxical respiration). Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) and physiotherapy. If a chest tube is in situ, topical intrapleural local analgesia introduced via the tube, can also be used. Ventilation(IPPV)is reserved for cases developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen.",

More than 900 drugs have been implicated in causing liver injury, but propylthiouracil, isoniazid, halo- thane, valproate, and certain antipyretics (acetaminophen, diclofenac, and indomethacin) are among the drugs most frequently involved in acute hepatocellular toxicity. Prop- ylthiouracil-induced toxic hepatitis occurs in about 1% of treated patients, is always severe, and can be lethal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has added a black box warn- ing to the label of propylthiouracil. \r\nA Methimazole-induced liver injury is extremely rare. In addition, propylthiouracil is preferred over methimazole in the first trimester of pregnancy because it crosses the pla- centa much less than methimazole. \r\nB, D,  Liver injury with these drugs is negligible. \r\n",

It is important that the patient’s skin be prepared(preferably clippers) immediately before operation; preferably in the operating suite after anesthetization.\r\nThis eliminates discomfort to the patient, affords relaxation of the operative site, and is a bacteriologically sound technique. There should be as short a time lapse as possible between skin preparation and incision, thus preventing contamination of the site by a regrowth of organisms or the possibility of a nick or scratch presenting a source of infection. The skin is held taut to present an even, smooth surface as the hair is removed with power-driven disposable clippers. The use of sharp razors to remove hair is discouraged\r\n",

However, these drugs cause hypokalemia, which increases the risk of adverse effects with cardiac glycosides. In fact, a decrease in serum K+ concentration increases the binding of cardiac glycosides to Na+/K+ ATPase. The con- current administration of potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone will prevent furosemide-induced hypo- kalemia. \r\nB Potassium-sparing diuretics have low diuretic efficacy and therefore are not suitable for treating a patient with car- diac failure. \r\nC, D Mannitol is absolutely contraindicated in heart failure because the resulting extracellular volume expansion can cause a dangerous circulatory overload. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nNorepinephrine usually causes a reflex bradycardia in pa- tients with intact innervation of the heart for the following reason: the increase in blood pressure due to activation of α1 receptors activates baroreceptors located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch (baroreceptors are stretch receptors). This increases the firing rate to the nucleus of the tractus soli- tarius in the medulla, which in turn increases its firing to the vagal motor neurons (dorsal motor neuron and nucleus am- biguus). When this vagal excitation is strong enough, it can overcome the norepinephrine-induced tachycardia due to ac- tivation of cardiac β receptors; therefore, bradycardia ensues. \r\nA, B These actions would cause an increase, not a decrease, in heart rate. \r\nE Decreased firing rate of carotid chemoreceptors occurs only in severe pathologic conditions and would cause an in- crease, not a decrease, in heart rate. \r\n",

He had a medical history of angina and hypertension presently treated with isosorbide mononitrate, losartan, and hydrochlorothiazide. Physical ex- amination showed a person with decreased skin turgor and disorientation to time and place without focal neurologic deficits. Blood pressure was 110/65 mm Hg on standing and 140/88 mm Hg on lying. Pertinent blood tests on admission were Na+ 116 mEq/L (normal 136−145 mEq/L); K+ 3.1 mEq/L (normal 3.5−5.0 mEq/L); uric acid 10.2 mg/dL (normal 3.0− 8.2 mg/dL); creatinine 3.1 mg/dL (normal 0.6−1.2 mg/dL).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nThe patient’s signs and symptoms suggest the diagnosis of hypovolemic hyponatremia, which is a rare but sometimes fatal adverse effect of thiazide diuretics. These drugs affect the diluting ability of the kidney while increasing Na+ excre- tion. Once volume depletion occurs, the release of antidiuretic hormone causes water retention and worsens hyponatre- mia. This effect of thiazides may last 1 to 2 weeks after ces- sation of the therapy. Elderly patients are especially prone to thiazide-induced hyponatremia, particularly if preexisting renal insufficiency exists, as in this case (see the high creati- nine level). \r\nA, B, D These disorders do not cause the signs and symp- toms shown by the patient. \r\n",

Serum osmolality is followed closely when mannitol is being given, and the drug is withheld if serum osmolality exceeds 320 mOsm/kg. \r\nElevating head of bed to improve venous drainage. Oxygenation and ventilation to keep PaO2 >100, PaCO2 30-35, use lowest possible AW pressures to not impede venous drainage, and keep MAP at pre-intubation level. Mannitol decreases blood viscosity, CBF unchanged while CBV and ICP decrease. Mannitol also reduces ICP by reducing cerebral parenchymal cell water, total effect takes 20-30min. Eventually Mannitol enters CSF and increases ICP. 3% Saline has similar osmotic effect as Mannitol. Other benefits include enhancement of cardiac output, reduction of inflammation, restoration of normal cellular resting membrane potential and cell volume, and stimulation of the release of atrial natriuretic peptide. NMB reduces ICP by avoiding coughing. Lidocaine can also blunt airway response and avoid increasing ICP w/ intubation. Sedation decreases anxiety, fear, and response to pain, all of which increase ICP. Steroids can reduce edema, especially in traumatic brain injury – steroids are harmful in the setting of TBI but may be exceedingly helpful in patients with intracranial tumors.\r\n",

Affected infants have herniation of their intestines (as well as possibly stomach, spleen and liver) through the diaphragm as a result of failure of the closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal at approximately 8 weeks' gestation Clinically, affected infants have respiratory distress, a scaphoid abdomen, absence of breath sounds on the affected side or bowel sounds on the affected side, and shifted heart sounds that may be heard best on the opposite side of the herniated contents. The respiratory management of infants with CDH involves a gentle ventilation approach, which has been shown to improve survival. Inflation pressures should be minimized with tolerance of hypercapnia and relative post-ductal hypoxemia. \r\nThe insertion of a chest tube to evacuate air from the pleural space is the management of an infant with a pnetunothorax.

Succinyl- choline and mivacurium are neuromuscular blocking drugs that are primarily metabolized by plasma cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase). Because of this extensive and rapid metabolism, the action of these drugs is brief. The neuro- muscular blockade by these drugs may be exceedingly pro- longed in patients who have a genetically abnormal variant of cholinesterase. Also, because this variant is much less effi- cient than the normal enzyme, it can take 2 to 3 hours for the paralysis to disappear. In this case, the anesthesiologist must continue the general anesthesia and artificial respira- tion until cessation of the drug effect. ",

Attacks are often precipitated by minor trauma (eg, dental procedure) or emotional stress and are not associated with itching, tenderness, rash,or classic medication triggers (eg, ACE inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\r\n•\tInitial evaluation of hereditary angioedema is with complement testing. Low C4 is characteristic because, in the absence of C1 inhibitor, unregulated activation of C1 leads to excess activated C1 and, in turn unchecked cleavage of C4. Diagnosis is confirmed by a decrease in functional C1 inhibitor level.\r\n",

Hyptonic infants often present with respiratory insufficiency and/or feeding difficulty. A prenatal history of decreased fetal movement, polyhydramnios, and breech presentation is common, and some disorders, such as trisomy 21, have recognizable physical examination findings. The infant in this vignette has physical and clinical characteristics consistent with a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Profound hypotonia, excessive sleepiness, and poor sucking ability with consequent feeding difficulty and poor weight gain describe the classic infantile phase of PWS. Physical examination findings in the neonate may include dolichocephaly, bitemporal narrowing, \"almond-shaped\" palpebral fissures, and a narrow nasal bridge. Muscle size may appear diminished, and the hands and feet may be small.\r\n Individuals with Angelman syndrome have hypotonia. severe mental deficiency, ataxia and jerky movements similar to a puppet, and are at increased risk for seizures.

Maximal surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy, but complete resections are difficult to achieve.\r\nAdjuvant RT is commonly employed, although it has been difficult to administer adequately high doses of radiation with older techniques. \r\nConventional two- or three-dimensional RT techniques using photons have a significant risk of damaging the brainstem and cranial nerves, and the lower doses historically used with these techniques have been associated with a high rate of local recurrence and treatment failure. \r\nHigh-dose focused radiation delivery techniques with particles (primarily protons) or photons (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS], stereotactic radiation therapy [SRT], and intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) have allowed for higher doses of RT to be delivered to the tumor while sparing surrounding structures. \r\nProton beam RT is the most widely used charged ion technique. This approach appears to be more effective than earlier use of conventional photon RT with lower doses of radiation. \r\nProton therapy demonstrates Bragg’s peak effect.\r\n",

      "text": "A 5-year-old boy is admitted with fever and breathlessness. He was hospitalized many times for pyogenic infections. Pediatrician evaluated him for recurrent infections and failure to thrive. In the past one year, he has been hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia twice and has had 5 episodes of otitis media, requiring placement of tympanostomy tubes. The patient also has a history of prolonged diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum. Physical examination shows large tonsils, palpable lymph nodes, and hepatosplenomegaly. His HIV status is negative. Pediatrician ordered investigations for further evaluation. It shows that the patient has defective signaling between activated CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes. Which of the following immunoglobulins likely has the highest serum concentration in this patient?",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nIgM\r\n\r\n• This patients recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections: failure to thrive: and evidence of defective signalling between CD4+ T cells and B cells is consistent with hyperimmunoglobulin M (hyper-lgM) syndrome. \r\n• Hyper-IgM syndrome results from a defect in class switching in B lymphocytes. \r\n• Class switching allows B cells to modify production of immunoglobulins from one isotype to another (eg. from lgM to lgA).\r\n• This occurs by splicing out DNA coding for different types of the heavy chain constant region until the desired isotype is reached. The variable region, and therefore the antigenic specificity ofthe antibody: stays the same.\r\n",
