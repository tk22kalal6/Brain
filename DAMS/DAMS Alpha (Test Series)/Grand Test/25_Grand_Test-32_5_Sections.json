      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nMalignant hyperthermia is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle in which ryanodine receptors respond to certain halogenated anesthetics (as well as the muscle relaxant succinylcholine) by opening their associated calcium channels within the muscle fiber and thus causing an increase in sarcoplasmic calcium. This increase in sarcoplasmic calcium concentration causes continual contraction of the skeletal muscles everywhere in the body. The results are increased body temperature, increased anaerobic metabolism, increased CO2 production, and increased O2 usage by all skeletal muscles. Calsequestrin is a protein molecule that binds calcium within the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fiber. Because calcium is continually leaking from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the binding of calcium to calsequestrin is decreased during an episode of malignant hyperthermia.",

TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION\r\n\r\n● Tuberculin Skin testing PPD (RT23)is used. The greatest limitation of PPD is its lack of mycobacterial species specificity, a property due to the large number of proteins in this product that are highly conserved in the various species.\r\n\r\n- It probably measures the response to antigenic stimulation by T cells that reside in the skin rather than the response of re circulating memory T cells. \r\n\r\n-The test is of limited value in the diagnosis of active TB because of its relatively low sensitivity and specificity and its inability to discriminate between LTBI and active disease. \r\n\r\n- False-positive reactions may be caused by infections with non tuberculous mycobacteria and by BCG vaccination. \r\n\r\n-Repeated TST can produce larger reaction sizes due to either boosting or true conversion. The “boosting phenomenon” is a spurious TST conversion resulting from boosting of reactivity on\r\nsubsequent TST 1–5 weeks after the initial test.\r\n\r\n●IFN-γ Release Assays: \r\n\r\n-  The T-SPOT TB and the QuantiFERON TB Gold are two in vitro assays that measure T cell release of IFN-γ in response to stimulation with the highly TB-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10\r\n\r\n-  These tests likely measure the response of recirculating memory T cells to persisting bacilli producing antigenic signals.\r\n\r\n●Potential advantages of IGRAs include\r\n\r\n- More specific than the TST & less cross-reactivity due to BCG vaccination and sensitization by NTM.\r\n\r\n-  The need for fewer patient visits to complete testing, \r\n\r\n-  Avoidance of subjective measurements such as skin induration. \r\n\r\n-  In view of higher costs and increased technical requirements, the WHO does not recommend the replacement of the TST by IGRAs in low- and middle-income countries.\r\n\r\n-  Because of the paucity of data on the use of IGRAs in children, the TST is preferred for LTBI testing of children under age 5. \r\n\r\n-  IGRAs have only modest predictive value for incident active TB, are not useful in identifying patients with the highest risk of progression toward disease, and cannot be used for diagnosis of active TB.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nBabesiosis\r\n\r\nBabesiosis is a malaria-like parasitic disease transmitted by tick bites (most commonly) or after receiving blood products from an infected donor. Half of healthy adults with Babesia infection are asymptomatic. When people do develop symptoms, the most common are fever and hemolytic anemia, symptoms that are similar to those of malaria. In more severe cases, symptoms similar to malaria occur, with fevers up to 40.5 °C (105 °F), shaking chills, and severe anemia (hemolytic anemia). Organ failure may follow, including adult respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis in people who have had a splenectomy can occur rapidly, consistent with overwhelming post-splenectomy infection. Severe cases are also more likely to occur in the very young, very old, and persons with immunodeficiency, such as HIV/AIDS patients.\r\n\r\nThe smear shows hemozoin deficient trophozoites and is diagnostic.  In mild-to-moderate babesiosis, the treatment of choice is a combination of atovaquone and azithromycin. The standard course is 7 to 10 days, but this is extended to at least 6 weeks in people with relapsing disease. In severe babesiosis, the combination of clindamycin and quinine is preferred. In life-threatening cases, exchange transfusion is performed.",

Carotid arteriography remains the “gold standard” when quantifying the degree of carotid stenosis, but it is usually performed after noninvasive testing suggests significant stenosis. Spiral CT angiography is a noninvasive modality that has been used to evaluate many segments of the vascular tree and is patients with 50% or more stenosis of the carotid artery and history of ipsilateral stroke or TIA are recommended to have carotid endarterectomy.  Symptoms of TIA can include amaurosis fugax, a painless temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes often described as a \"curtain falling down\" over the visual field, hemiparesis, facial weakness, and speech loss.",

Most cancers occur after exposure to 1500 rads or less to the neck, but an increase in thyroid cancer has been noted after as little as 6 rads. Salivary gland tumors and possibly parathyroid adenomas are also associated with radiation. The latent period for these tumors is 30 years or longer. Of all patients who have low-dose radiation, about 9% have been found to have thyroid cancer, usually of the papillary type. Treatment consists of a near-total thyroidectomy because there is a high incidence of bilaterality and because there is a greater incidence of complications if a second operation is necessary",

Other causes include spontaneous bleeding during anticoagulation, gallstones, parasitic infections/abscesses, and neoplastic lesions. Angiography and endoscopy are useful diagnostic studies and intrahepatic bleeding can be controlled by angiographic embolization in up to 95% of cases.

Volume status would be best assessed by floating a Swan-Ganz catheter to measure the preload pressures in the left atrium (by inference from the pulmonary capillary wedge pressures). Patients who have had a leaking aneurysm and then a long, usually difficult operation with large surgical fields that collect “third-space” fluids may be intravascularly depleted despite large volumes of intravenous fluid and blood replacement. The proper management usually involves titrating the cardiac output by providing as much fluid as necessary to keep the wedge pressures near 15 mm Hg. \r\n\r\nThe other studies listed might become useful if urinary flow remains depressed after optimal cardiac output has been achieved, but in view of the probability of hypovolemia, they are not indicated as a first diagnostic study\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B) Gastric ulcers have been classified as type I (incisura or most inferior portion of lesser curvature), type II (gastric and duodenal), type III (pyloric and prepyloric), and type IV (juxtacardial). Indications for surgery are intractability, perforation, obstruction, and bleeding. A patient with an intractable type I ulcer can be treated with an antrectomy alone or with a proximal gastric vagotomy. If done properly, antrectomy offers slightly lower recurrence rates and a higher incidence of postoperative sequelae as compared with proximal gastric vagotomy. However, significant scarring along the lesser curvature makes a proximal gastric vagotomy technically unfeasible. Gastric outlet obstruction and severe inflammation around the pylorus and duodenum make resection a difficult and dangerous option. Similarly, pyloroplasty is often not adequate in the setting of gastric outlet obstruction to provide adequate drainage. Vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy although associated with the highest recurrence rate, offers the best choice in the described setting. In an elderly patient with a bleeding duodenal ulcer, recurrence rates are less of a consideration and thus the simplest and most expedient operation offers the best surgical outcome. Vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the ulcer is the best choice in this setting. Finally, in a young patient with intractable type III ulcers, antrectomy with vagotomy offers the best long-term outcome. Recurrence rates following this procedure are about 2&ndash;3%, as compared with 7.4% for vagotomy and drainage and 10&ndash;31% in patients receiving a proximal gastric vagotomy only</p>\r\n",

One-year cardiac allograft survival approaches 90% and is equivalent to 1-year renal allograft survival. Cardiac allografts have a cold ischemia preservation time of 4–5 h and therefore tissue typing is not practical. Cardiac donors are matched to recipients only by size and ABO blood type.

When that is not possible, the first step is to ask why such a severe and relatively uncommon withdrawal syndrome has occurred.\r\n\r\nThe answer often relates to a severe concomitant medical problem that needs immediate treatment. Once a delirium appears, the treatment remains similar to that for the standard withdrawal but with higher doses. Example regimens are 50 to 100 mg of chlordiazepoxide given every 4 hours orally, or lorazepam, given intravenously (IV) if oral medication is not possible. A high-calorie, high-carbohydrate diet supplemented by multivitamins is also essential.\r\n\r\nPhysically restraining patients with the DTs is risky; they may fight against the restraints to a dangerous level of exhaustion. When patients are disorderly and uncontrollable, it may be preferable to use a seclusion room. Adjunctive antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, are sometimes used to control severe agitation and hallucinations. However, antipsychotic medications may reduce the seizure threshold in patients. Dehydration, often exacerbated by diaphoresis and fever, can be corrected with fluids given by mouth or IV. Anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea often occur during withdrawal. The emergence of focal neurologic symptoms, lateralizing seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or evidence of skull fractures or other indications of CNS pathology should prompt clinicians to examine a patient for neurologic disease.",

Aldosterone deficiency because patients cannot convert progesterone to deoxycorticosterone\r\n\r\n2. Cortisol deficiency because patients cannot convert 17-OH progesterone to 11-\r\ndeoxycortisol\r\n\r\n3. Increased testosterone production because of increased precursors of 17-OH progesterone\r\n\r\nApproximately 50% to 75% of affected infants present with salt-wasting usually in the 2nd week of life with vomiting, dehydration, hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Symptoms may progress to hypotension and shock. Thus, the infant in this vignette will most likely have a low serum sodium concentration, elevated serum potassium concentration, and low serum chloride concentration.",
