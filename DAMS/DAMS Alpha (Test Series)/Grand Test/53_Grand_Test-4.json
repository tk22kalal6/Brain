      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nTeriparatide is a recombinant analogue of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with physiological actions equal to those of the natural hormone. PTH exerts both catabolic and anabolic effects on bone. Catabolic effects prevail with chronically elevated PTH; there is a net increase in bone resorption. An- abolic effects prevail with intermittent low doses of PTH; there is a net increase in bone formation (by increasing osteoblast number and activity) without stimulating bone resorption. This has led to the approval of teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis. The drug is reserved for advanced osteoporosis when bisphosphonate therapy has failed, ex- treme bone loss has already occurred, and/or fracture has already occurred, as in this case. Teriparatide is the only cur- rently available therapy that results in net bone deposition. \r\nB Estrogens are used for prevention, not for treatment, of osteoporosis only in postmenopausal women who need estrogen treatment for the management of menopausal symptoms. \r\nC Because alendronate was not effective, the use of an- other bisphosphonate would be irrational. Bisphosphonates are considered antiresorptive agents as opposed to bone anabolic agents. \r\nD Calcitonin does not consistently decrease hip fracture risk and does not increase bone density.",

It is most commonly caused by defective CD40L on helper T cells which prevents class switching. It often presents with severe pyogenic infections and recurrent sinopulmonary infections early in life. It should be noted though that this is a non-specific finding that is associated with numerous other causes such as viral infection. Immunoglobulin levels reveal increased IgM and decreased IgG, IgA, and IgE. The treatment is administration of IVIG. \r\n• Increased IgM and decreased IgG, IgA, and IgE is characteristic of hyper-IgM syndrome, which causes severe pyogenic infections in the first months of life.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nComplement C3b\r\n• Opsonization occurs when host proteins such as immunoglobulins or complement bind to the surface of foreign cells (eg. bacteria) to promote phagocytosls.\r\n•  The most important opsonins (coating proteins) are immunoglobulin (lg) G and complement C3b. but mannose-binding lectin and C-reactive protein can also opsonize cells. After opsonins are bound to the cell surface. they act as a handle for receptors on phagocytes (eg, Fc receptors, C3b receptors) to grasp. allowing the phagocytes to more easily engulf the foreign cell.\r\n• The importance of C3 is demonstrated by the fact that all 3 complement pathways (lectin, classical and alternative) converge on it. resulting in cleavage into C3a and C3b. C3a helps recruit phagocytic cells and induce inﬂammation. C3b in addition to acting as an opsonin, can bind to C3b convertase and form C5 convertase, ultimately triggering the membrane attack complex.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nIcosahedral capsid\r\n• As the results of the Gram stain and other laboratory findings suggest the diagnosis of meningitis caused by echovirus 11. This virus is associated with outbreaks of meningitis in children and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and possibly via aerosols. \r\n• Like other picornaviruses, echoviruses have a virion capsid that is impervious to the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and to drying. Echoviruses and other picornaviruses do not have an envelope. \r\n• Enveloped viruses that may cause meningitis include mumps virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus. HIV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and some togaviruses and Flaviviruses. \r\n• Echoviruses do not have hemagglutinin. Hemagglutinins are the attachment proteins for orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. \r\n• Echoviruses also do not have NA. NA removes the binding structure (sialic acid) from the virus receptor and is present in orthomyxoviruses and some paramyxoviruses.\r\n• Echoviruses and other picornaviruses are capsid viruses that have a valley into which the cellular virus receptor inserts.\r\n• Enveloped viruses have glycoproteins, but picornaviruses do not.\r\n",

After the transplant procedure, he was immediately placed on immunosuppressive treatment; however, for unknown reasons he stopped taking the prophylactically prescribed voriconazole. Upon presentation to the emergency room. the patient was hypoxemic. Imaging revealed pulmonary nodules, which prompted a transbronchial biopsy for further evaluation. The results were negative for acute organ rejection, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and acid-fast bacilli. Slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) revealed the pathogen. The specimen was sent to the microbiology laboratory for fungal culture, which resulted in the growth of a fuzzy mold on Sabouraud agar at 250C. A Lactophenol cotton blue preparation revealed the organism shown in the image.

No known colonization state exists for this fungus. \r\n• Although the morphology of Coccidioides may vary substantially in the tissues. large thick-walled round structures [spherules] packed with endospores are the  classical presentation, which may be identiﬁed using H&E, GMS, PAS, Papanicoulou, and calcoﬂuor stains.  A granulomatous reaction around the spherules is often an accompanying ﬁnding. \r\n• The fungus can also grow like mold on solid media, revealing thin hyphae and speciﬁc barrel-  shaped arthroconidia on a lactophenol cotton blue preparation.

These worms are endemic to Africa, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Asia. \r\n• Schistosomes are parasites that inhabit freshwater snails. \r\n• Different types of snails act as hosts of the genus Schistosoma. \r\n• Complications arise due to immunologic reactions toward trapped eggs of schistosomes in various tissues. \r\n• The eggs reach the skin. brain, muscles, adrenal glands, and eyes.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPseudomonas aeruginosa \r\nSol:\r\n\r\n• External otitis, or infection of the external ear canal, can be caused by a variety of organisms, notably including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus. There is, however, a severe subtype of external otitis, malignant external otitis, of which you should be aware. This form is specifically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tends to affect elderly diabetics and AIDS patients, causing the findings illustrated in the question stem. It is particularly worrisome both because the Pseudomonas organism is so tissue destructive and because it is often highly resistant to most intravenous antibiotics. (Consult your local microbiology or pharmacology departments for advice about local sensitivities if you encounter the condition.) Complications can be devastating, including deafness, facial nerve paralysis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis. \r\n• Escherichia coli can cause both external otitis and acute otitis media, but does not usually cause malignant external otitis. \r\n• Haemophilus influenza is an important cause of acute otitis media. \r\nProteus vulgaris can cause external otitis, but does not usually cause the malignant form.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma\r\nRef: Read the text below\r\nSol.\r\n• Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a relatively uncommon cancer with an incidence of 0.29 per 100,000 people per year in Japan. \r\n• However, there are certain populations in whom the incidence is considerably higher, including native and foreign-born Chinese, Southeast Asians, North Africans, and native people of the Arctic region.\r\n• Classification of the World Health Organization divides NPC on a pathological basis into three histological subtypes: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma; nonkeratinizing carcinoma, which can be further divided into differentiated and undifferentiated subtypes; and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Undifferentiated nonkeratinizing NPC is the most common type of NPC and is strongly associated with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in practically 100% of cases. \r\n• The most common site of origin for NPC is the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, especially the fossa of Rosenmüller, followed by the superior posterior wall. Nearly half of patients complain of nasal symptoms. \r\n• Symptoms related to Eustachian tube obstruction, such as serous otitis media, also commonly occur. Headache and cranial nerve involvement are features of more advanced stages. A direct lateral spread of NPC involves the third division of the trigeminal nerve (V3). The perineural spread of the V3 is one of the most common and important routes in the intracranial paracavernous extension of NPC [3].\r\n• Gadolinium-enhanced, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted MR imaging is very useful in detecting perineural tumor invasion and extracranial lesions\r\n",

Patient is likely experiencing TUR syndrome; thus rapid\r\ntermination is needed. The height of the irrigating fluid above the patient should be carefully chosen. Investigators have demonstrated that the ideal height of the fluid was 60 cm above the patient. This appears to be the minimal height to maintain good vision but also not lead to excessive systemic fluid absorption. Increasing the height 10 cm above this leads to increased pressure in the prostatic fossa and a greater than twofold increase in systemic fluid absorption. Diagnosis of this condition is made by assessment of neurologic status and comparison to laboratory values. Serum sodium should be obtained in long, large resections postoperatively (or intraoperatively if concern exists). A serum sodium of less than 120 mEq/L indicates a significant dilution and may lead to coma or seizures. Transient visual disturbances or blindness indicate central\r\nnervous system (CNS) toxicity and are obviously very distressing to all the parties involved. If profound central nervous symptoms are noted, judicious administration of hypertonic saline should be instituted and formulas exist to help guide this resuscitation as overly rapid correction of hyponatremia may lead to a demyelinating lesion of the brain (central pontine myelinolysis).\r\n",

In some case series, about 20% to 40% of patients sustained an acute, prolonged, and profound drop in serum albumin after elective surgery\r\nThe laws of physiology suggest that hypoalbuminemia reflects some combination of decreased albumin production, increased losses, acute dilution or shifts from the vascular space.5 Low production is easy to hypothesize in a patient with anorexia. However, the half-life of albumin is about 3 weeks.6 Hence, total starvation with zero production would not explain rapid-onset hypoalbuminemia. Acute dilution could be rapid, yet it seems implausible in patients who have a normal hemoglobin and uric acid level after surgery.\r\nOne popular explanation relates to displacement into an extravascular space\r\nCapillary leak is defined as an excessive loss of fluid and protein into the interstitial space as a result of endothelial cell dysfunction. This is one of the most widely studied and clinically apparent consequences of ischemia-reperfusion vessel injury and other acute inflammatory reactions. Both apoptosis and necrosis of endothelial cells may contribute to capillary leak, as well as the inflammatory mediators released from activated neutrophils such as tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin beta\r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThis patient has an acute gastric volvulus in the setting of a paraesophageal hernia. The triad of retching without vomiting, acute epigastric pain, and inability to pass a nasogastric tube (called Borchardt’s triad) implies acute and complete obstruction of the stomach from volvulus. This is a surgical emergency because ischemia and death may result. Nonoperative mortality is up to 80% in this setting. Endoscopic decompression will not fix the underlying problem sufficiently, and recurrent volvulus is likely. It may occur in organoaxial or mesenteroaxial orientations. Organoaxial rotation indicates twisting along the long axis of the stomach across a line connecting the gastroesophageal junction and the pylorus. This is the most common form of gastric volvulus, and carries a worse prognosis. Less commonly, the stomach folds along its short axis across a line connecting the greater and lesser curvatures. This is generally less severe than acute organoaxial volvulus. Risk factors for volvulus include age greater than 50 years, para esophageal hernias (as in this case), and laxity or anatomic abnormalities of supporting ligaments.\r\n\r\n",

The PTEN mutation is identified in 80% of probands with Cowden’s syndrome. Cowden’s is characterized by hamartomatous tumors throughout the GI tract. It is unknown whether Cowden’s increases the risk of colon cancer. However, the disorder is associated with an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial neoplasia. The breast cancer may be bilateral, and the thyroid involvement is typically papillary cancer. Mucocutaneous lesions are found in\r\n90% of patients, most notably trichilemmomas—the “bumps” on the face, hands, and feet in this vignette. The mucosal lesions can coalesce in the buccal mucosa and lead to a cobblestone-like pattern in 40% of patients. Because the risk of colorectal cancer remains unclear, there are no explicit guidelines on whether or how to perform surveillance colonoscopy. Currently, these patients should receive age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening. Surveillance for other neoplasms (ie, breast, thyroid, endometrial) must occur in all patients with Cowden’s.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThis is acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, also known as Ogilvie’s syndrome. Ogilvie’s syndrome is characterized by marked dilation of the cecum and ascending colon in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Similar to ileus, colonic pseudo-obstruction generally occurs in critically ill patients with sepsis, recent surgery, electrolyte abnormalities, and trauma,\r\namong other conditions. The diagnosis rests on radiographic evaluation of the cecum, where a diameter of > 10 to 12 cm predicts bowel perforation, and should serve as a critical threshold to track in patients with suspected pseudo-obstruction.\r\nThe clinical presentation of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is typical of other obstructive processes, with the patient usually suffering marked abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. If left untreated, colonic pseudo-obstruction can lead to ischemia, perforation (in around 3% of cases), peritonitis, and death. Thus, the clinician must keep a high index of\r\nsuspicion for colonic pseudo-obstruction in patients with risk factors, as the consequences of late diagnosis can be grave.\r\nFortunately, conservative measures are sufficient in most cases of colonic psuedo-obstruction, and the cecal dilation resolves spontaneously. Conservative measures consist of ceasing oral intake, frequent repositioning of the patient, and treating potential underlying causes of dysmotility (as with ileus). Although nasogastric tubes are often employed in colonic pseudo-obstruction, there are no data from randomized controlled studies to support its effectiveness in reducing clinically\r\nsignificant endpoints. In contrast, case series do support the effectiveness of colonoscopic decompression, which reduces the cecal diameter in upward of 70% of patients. Unfortunately, colonic decompression alone is often short-lived, and recurrent distension occurs in nearly half of patients. Thus, colonic decompression is usually accompanied by placement of a rectal tube that is fed into the ascending colon (a maneuver that is easier said than done). Although colonoscopic decompression and rectal tube placement is conceptually attractive, it is in practice a very difficult procedure to perform because it must be conducted in an unprepared bowel (since bowel preparation is contraindicated in the setting of pseudo-obstruction) without the benefit of air insufflation (which could lead to perforation). \r\n\r\nIn patients failing to respond to conservative measures after 24 to 48 hours, including correction of electrolyte abnormalities, intravenous hydration, correction of underlying medical etiologies, and minimization of culprit medications, pharmacologic therapy is generally warranted. Moreover, if at any time the cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm, or if there is evidence of worsening\r\nclinical status, then aggressive treatment should be immediately pursued. Indeed, colonic pseudo-obstruction is a true GI emergency that warrants the involvement of a GI specialist regardlessof the time of day. Given the shortcomings of colonic decompression, coupled with data that neostigmine appears highly effective in colonic pseudo-obstruction, the currently accepted first-line therapy is intravenous neostigmine at a dosage of 2 mg intravenously times one infusion, followed\r\nby an additional 2-mg infusion 3 hours later if there is no initial response or adverse event.\r\n\r\nBecause neostigmine is an anticholinesterase inhibitor, it is associated with typical cholinergic side effects, including bronchoconstriction, abdominal cramping, hypersalivation, diaphoresis, and bradycardia. Because cardiovascular collapse is possible (although generally transient and rarely life threatening), neostigmine must be administered in a monitored setting. It is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, active bronchospasm, and mechanical bowel obstruction.\r\n\r\nIn the rare situation of failure to respond to conservative measures, neostigmine, and colonic decompression, surgery is a last resort. However, surgery is highly morbid, and may lead to poor outcomes in patients who are already critically ill to begin with. Indeed, case series indicate that one-quarter of patients with colonic pseudo-obstruction die in the perioperative period, even in the absence of bowel perforation. Given these poor outcomes, it is unclear whether surgical\r\n124 Chapter 3 treatment is warranted, especially since the risk of perforation in colonic pseudo-obstruction is\r\nthought to be around 3%.

Unlike hepatic adenomas, it is probably not caused by oral contraceptives, although this theory is sometimes floated. In reality, nobody knows exactly what causes FNH. it’s thought to result from a hyperplastic tissue response to abnormalities in vascular flow. Congenital arterial malformations have been implicated.\r\n\r\nThe FNH lesion is characterized by hyperplastic regenerative nodules separated by fibrous septae. They classically have a central stellate scar with fibrous bands radiating circumferentially in a spoke-like pattern. Patients with FNH are usually asymptomatic, but some have low-grade abdominal discomfort. The characteristic scar can be seen on triphasic\r\nCT scanning. On CT, the lesion is hypodense in the noncontrast phase, but lights up upon arterial enhancement due to its vascular nature, as seen in Figure . Of note, the central scar does not light up with arterial enhancement, and remains hypodense, as seen in Figure  as well. A classic feature of this lesion is its affinity for sulfur-colloid uptake\r\nupon nuclear imaging. The lesion is benign, and surgery is not indicated unless symptomatic.\r\n",

Retroflexion implies a sharp angle between the cervix and the fundus of the uterus, which is bent posteriorly. \r\n•\tThis is a less common position of the uterus, which can also, more commonly, be midposition or anteflexed. \r\n•\tThese are all normal positions of the uterus. It is important to recognize which way the uterine body is flexed so that you do not perforate the lower uterine segment while sounding the uterus or dilating the cervix. \r\n•\tThe uterus is normally mobile and if it is not, adhesions or tumor may be present. The cervix is normally palpated anterior to the rectum on rectal examination. \r\n\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPlacental abruption\r\nRef: Read the text below\r\nSol:\r\n•\tThe classic signs of placental abruption include the sudden onset of painful contraction and vaginal bleeding. \r\n•\tThe uterus is typically firm and tender, and the irritation from the placental separation will often initiate regular contractions. Placental abruption can be more common in the setting of hypertension, abdominal trauma, and the use of cocaine or methamphetamines.\r\n•\tThus, a good history of domestic violence and drug use is important, and a urine toxin screen should be sent. \r\n•\tThe diagnosis can be made with evidence of a fetal-maternal bleed by sending a Kleihauer-Betke test. Rarely, the retroplacental bleed can be seen on ultrasound, but generally placental abruption is a clinical diagnosis. \r\n•\tEven though the patient is having regular contractions, no cervical change is described; therefore, a diagnosis of labor cannot be made. Given the normal ultrasound, a placenta previa is unlikely. \r\n•\tWhile placenta accreta can occur outside of the setting of a placenta previa, bleeding associated with this form of abnormal placentation occurs after delivery when the placenta does not separate entirely from the uterine wall. The most common presentation of rupture of membranes is a gush of clear fluid rather than blood.\r\n",

Three types of decelerations have been described—early, variable, and late.\r\n•\tEarly decelerations begin and end with contractions and are thought to be a result of fetal head compression.\r\n•\tVariable decelerations are sharp drops in the fetal heart rate with quick return to baseline and can be either isolated or correlated with contractions; these are believed to result from compression of the umbilical cord. Late decelerations begin after the contraction has begun and end after it has ended. These are usually shallow and can be quite subtle and difficult to detect.\r\n•\tLate decelerations are correlated with decreased placental perfusion that can be secondary to inadequate blood flow to the uterus or increased vascular resistance of the placenta (aka uteroplacental insufficiency).\r\n",

Other bacterial causes include Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S aureus), group A Streptococcus anginosus. In chronic mastoiditis, infection is often polymicrobial; common bacterial pathogens include S aureus, anaerobes\r\n(eg, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, and Bacteroides), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae. The incidence and frequency of AOM caused by S pneumoniae has declined since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PCV-7 and PCV-13.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThe infant in the vignette is demonstrating the clinical findings of septic shock, including hypotension, and would benefit from the initiation of dopamine for cardiovascular support. Septic shock in the neonatal population is often associated with increased capillary leak and vasodilation, which lead to relative hypovolemia and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Cardiovascular support with volume replacement and vasopressor drug administration may be required to prevent circulatory collapse. Dopamine is a catecholamine that stimulates dopaminergic, α-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, and serotonin receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Systemic blood pressure is improved by the effect of dopamine on peripheral vascular resistance and myocardial contractility. \r\n\r\nHypotension in the neonatal population has been loosely defined as any value that falls below the fifth to tenth percentile for gestational age. The most commonly used guide for hypotension in the neonatal period is that the mean blood pressure should be equal to or greater than the gestational age of the infant. Treatment of hypotension, as presently Defined, has not been demonstrated to improve long-term outcome. Therefore some experts suggest that hypotension should be defined as the blood pressure at which cerebral blood flow regulation fails and brain tissue hypoperfusion occurs. No simple technique to assess this presently exists, but near-infrared spectroscopy imaging may allow estimation of cerebral blood flow and could be used as a surrogate measurement in the future. The mean blood pressure of 29 mm Hg for the 35-week gestation infant in the vignette supports the diagnosis of hypotension (Item C10). \r\n\r\nThe role of volume replacement in septic shock remains unclear in the immediate neonatal period. It is required in hypovolemic shock, with the preferred agents being packed red blood cells, normal saline, or lactated Ringers solution. Although albumin is as effective as normal saline in the immediate period of administration, it is not recommended in the 2010 American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association Guidelines for Neonatal Resuscitation because of its increased cost and theoretical risks such as increased fluid retention. Volume replacement should be avoided in infants weighing less than 1,500 g in the first week after birth because of the potentially increased risks of intraventricular hemorrhage and chronic lung disease, unless there is evidence of blood loss from events such as maternal abruption, maternal-fetal transfusion, or subgaleal hemorrhage.\r\n",

The Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report in 2011 outlining screening and management strategies for hypoglycemia in the late-preterm and full-term infant. Early feeding, within the first hour after birth, with a screening glucose value obtained 30 minutes after the first feeding, is the first step in the management of the asymptomatic infant described in this vignette. Glucose concentrations normally decline in the first 1 to 2 hours after birth following the discontinuation of maternal glucose influx with umbilical cord clamping. Plasma glucose values as low as 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) may be seen transiently during this period. The plasma glucose concentrations then routinely increase above 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) by 12 hours after birth. Infants at risk for neonatal hypoglycemia, including late-preterm, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and IDM, should be monitored closely during this period for clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia. These signs include jitteriness, tremors, high-pitched cry, irritability, lethargy, floppiness, poor suck, apnea, cyanosis, exaggerated Moro reflex, and seizure activity. Screening glucose values should be obtained in infants with symptoms and intravenous glucose initiated if the value is less than 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L).",

Breaks in the epithelium and spillage of follicular contents into the dermis lead to the lesions. They are not necessarily confined to the usual sites of acne vulgaris, often have a sudden onset, are monomorphous, and usually occur on upper chest and back. It is usually secondary to a drug e.g. testosterone, cyclosporine, antiepileptic medications, lithium, ATT and systemic corticosteroids. When medium or high doses of corticosteroids are taken for as short a time as 3–5 days, a distinctive eruption may occur, known as steroid acne. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nCreeping eruption is a term applied to twisting, winding linear skin lesions produced by the burrowing of larvae. People who go barefoot on the beach, children playing in sandboxes, carpenters and plumbers working under homes, and gardeners are often victims. The most common areas involved are the feet, buttocks, genitals, and hands. Slight local itching and the appearance of papules at the sites of infection characterize the onset. Intermittent stinging pain occurs, and thin, red, tortuous lines are formed in the skin. The larval migrations begin 4 days after inoculation and progress at the rate of about 2 cm/day. Loeffler syndrome, consisting of a patchy infiltrate of the lungs and eosinophilia as high as 50% in the blood and 90% in the sputum, may complicate creeping eruption. Ivermectin, 200 µg/kg, generally given as a single 12 mg dose and repeated the next day, or albendazole, 400 mg/day for 3 days, is an effective treatment. Topical thiabendazole, compounded as a 10% suspension or a 15% cream used four times a day, will result in marked relief from pruritus in 3 days, and the tracts become inactive in 1 week. Topical metronidazole has also been reported to be effective. ",

This occurs due to decreased peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 as well as altered circulating levels and binding of thyroid hormone to thyroxine-binding globulin, with resultant altered feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis. During recovery from the systemic illness, the TSH may increase to levels associated with hypothyroidism. Over time these will, however, normalise; hence, unless there is clinical evidence of concomitant thyroidal disease, repeated measurements and monitoring is advised.\r\n",

Diagnosis is mainly clinical; improvement of symptoms throughout the day and an absence of joint findings on physical examination provide clues to the diagnosis. Most patients have a markedly elevated ESR. PMR overlaps with giant cell (temporal) arteritis, so it is worthwhile to ask about symptoms of headache or jaw claudication. In the absence of symptoms or signs of temporal arteritis, no additional testing is indicated, and the diagnosis is presumptively confirmed by prompt response to moderate dose steroids (10-20 mg prednisone per day).\r\nA graded exercise regimen (answer b) would be an appropriate treatment option for fibromyalgia, but fibromyalgia rarely begins at age 72 and does not cause elevation of the ESR. MRI of the upper torso may show inflammation of the bursa and shoulder joint synovium, but this patient does not have localized tenderness in these structures.\r\nTemporal artery biopsy should be performed in patients suspected of having giant cell arteritis.

Chylothorax occurs when chyle accumulates in the pleural space due to disruption of the thoracic duct. This is most often due to traumatic or surgical injury to the thoracic duct. In this patient without trauma or recent surgery, a mediastinal tumor (such as lymphoma) would be most likely. Chylous pleural effusions are usually exudative.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nAsbestos exposure\r\nExposure to asbestos in demolition, automobile servicing, or ship building industries is suggestive of asbestos-related disease; bilateral pleural thickening (often calcified, a finding especially evident on CT scan) indicates prior asbestos exposure. Occasionally, the pleural involvement is associated with a pleural effusion (often with an elevated red cell count) called benign asbestos pleural effusion (BAPE). “Benign” distinguishes this syndrome from malignant effusions due to lung cancer or mesothelioma, both of which occur with increased frequency in asbestosis. \r\nMedications, especially nitrofurantoin and cancer chemotherapeutic agents, can cause interstitial lung disease, but amlodipine has not been reported to do so. Tuberculosis occurs with increased frequency in silicosis, not in asbestosis. Although TB can cause a bloody pleural effusion, this patient does not have the systemic symptoms that usually accompany TB. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an important cause of occupational lung disease, but it is caused by exposure to organic materials such as thermophilic actinomycetes (farmer’s lung). In addition, hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually causes acute symptoms (including fever) at time of exposure. Occupational asthma is an important category, since continued exposure can lead to irreversible changes. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and occupational asthma do not cause pleural disease.\r\n\r\n",

Given the constellation of symptoms, anaemia , low ferritin and low folate in a patient of this age, coeliac disease(proximal small intestine is affected which leads to deficiency of iron and folic acid) should be considered initially and therefore coeliac serology is the next best investigation.\r\n\r\n",
