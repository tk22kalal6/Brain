Label C points to podocytes, which form slits covered by slit diaphragms that further prevent the filtration of medium-sized proteins such as albumin.

It is an immune-mediated synovitis, so the synovial fluid shows an elevated leukocyte count despite the absence of infection. Gonococcal arthritis is important to exclude in a young person presenting with acute monoarticular arthritis. Shigella sp. is the most commonly associated enteric organism associated with this syndrome, other causes include Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica.Amoebic intestinal infections are not associated with reactive arthritis. People who develop this syndrome have a higher prevalence of HLA-B27 antigen, not HLADQ2, which is associated with celiac disease. This syndrome is more common in men and classically is associated with the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nOsteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by a reduction in bone mass with normal bone mineralization. It typically does not involve any major disturbance in calcium or phosphate metabolism. The serum calcium remains normal due to homeostatic regulation by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a marker of bone formation, also remains within normal limits because osteoporosis involves low bone turnover without increased osteoblastic activity. Therefore, both serum calcium and ALP are usually normal in osteoporosis, making option B the correct answer.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Calcium normal and ALP increase\r\nThis option is incorrect because an elevated ALP is typically seen in conditions involving high bone turnover, such as Paget’s disease, osteomalacia, or healing fractures, but not in osteoporosis. In osteoporosis, there is no significant increase in bone-forming activity, so ALP remains normal.\r\n\r\nC. Calcium decreased and ALP normal\r\nThis combination suggests vitamin D deficiency or osteomalacia, where calcium absorption is impaired, leading to hypocalcemia. However, ALP is usually elevated in those cases due to increased osteoblastic activity attempting to compensate. Since calcium is normal in osteoporosis, this option is incorrect.\r\n\r\nD. Calcium increased, ALP increased\r\nThis pattern is typically seen in primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy-associated bone disease, where there is excessive bone resorption. In osteoporosis, calcium homeostasis is preserved and there is no excessive bone formation or resorption that would raise ALP, so this option does not fit the typical biochemical profile of osteoporosis.",

Serotonergic dysfunction is quite evident in panic disorder, and various studies with mixed serotonin agonist&ndash;antagonist drugs have demonstrated increased rates of anxiety. Such responses may be caused by postsynaptic serotonin hypersensitivity in panic disorder. Preclinical evidence suggests that attenuation of local inhibitory GABAergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala, midbrain, and hypothalamus can elicit anxiety-like physiological responses. The biological data have led to a focus on the brainstem (particularly the noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus and the serotonergic neurons of the median raphe nucleus), the limbic system (possibly responsible for the generation of anticipatory anxiety), and the prefrontal cortex (possibly responsible for the generation of phobic avoidance). Among the various neurotransmitters involved, the noradrenergic system has also attracted much attention, with the presynaptic &alpha;2-adrenergic receptors, particularly, playing a significant role. Patients with panic disorder are sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of yohimbine in addition to having exaggerated MHPG, cortisol, and cardiovascular responses.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
