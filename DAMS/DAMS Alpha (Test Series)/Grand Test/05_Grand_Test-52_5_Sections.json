Normally, estrogen exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, suppressing:<br>o GnRH (from hypothalamus)<br>o FSH & LH (from anterior pituitary)<br>2. Clomiphene blocks estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus:<br>o This disrupts negative feedback, making the brain \"think\" estrogen is low.<br>o Leads to increased GnRH release.<br>3. Increased GnRH → ↑ FSH & LH, which:<br>o Stimulate follicular development.<br>o Trigger ovulation.<br> Clinical Use:<br>• First-line drug for anovulatory infertility, especially in:<br>o Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)<br>o Luteal phase defect<br><img src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/32010491.png\"></p>",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nExplanation-\r\nIdentify the drug\r\n• In acute angle-closure glaucoma, the diuretic used to rapidly lower intraocular pressure (IOP) is Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic.\r\n Mechanism of Mannitol\r\n• Mannitol is freely filtered in the glomerulus and not reabsorbed → pulls water into the renal tubule → promotes osmotic diuresis.\r\n• But before it is excreted by the kidney, it expands extracellular fluid volume by pulling water out of cells into the intravascular space.\r\nAdverse effect\r\n• This sudden ECF expansion can:\r\no Increase preload.\r\no Raise blood volume → higher cardiac filling pressures.\r\no If the patient has poor cardiac reserve (like LV dysfunction), the heart can’t handle the sudden increase in intravascular volume → pulmonary venous congestion → pulmonary edema.\r\nWhy other options are less likely\r\nChronic liver disease:\r\no Hypoalbuminemia can worsen edema in general, but the immediate mechanism here is volume overload, which is directly handled by the heart. Liver disease alone wouldn’t explain acute pulmonary edema with Mannitol.\r\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism:\r\no Leads to sodium and water retention, but again, the acute issue is cardiac reserve. Hyperaldosteronism can cause hypertension but not the inability to handle sudden volume expansion.\r\nImpending renal disease:\r\no Mannitol is contraindicated in anuria or severe renal failure because if it can’t be excreted, it stays in the ECF and worsens volume overload. However, in that case, you’d see worsening generalized edema, not specifically pulmonary edema due to failing LV function.\r\nUncontrolled HTN with LV dysfunction:\r\n Best choice — the patient’s left ventricle is already impaired → can’t manage the sudden increase in preload → pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure rises → fluid leaks into alveoli → dyspnea and crackles → classic pulmonary edema.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nGram Panchayat\r\nExplanation\r\nThe administrative system in Indian villages is primarily structured around the Panchayati Raj system, a form of local self-governance. It's a three-tiered structure, with the Gram Panchayat at the village level being the foundational unit. This system ensures that villagers have a direct say in their local governance and development. \r\nA. Gram Panchayat:\r\n• This is the basic unit of local administration in rural India, often referred to as a village council or village panchayat. \r\n• It's responsible for the governance and administration of a village or a group of villages. \r\n• Members are directly elected by the villagers, ensuring democratic representation. \r\n• The Gram Panchayat handles local issues like sanitation, water supply, roads, and basic infrastructure. \r\nB. Panchayat Samiti (Block Panchayat):\r\n• Located at the block level, this acts as an intermediate tier in the Panchayati Raj system.\r\n• It coordinates and oversees the activities of the Gram Panchayats within its jurisdiction.\r\n• Members are indirectly elected from the Gram Panchayats. \r\nC. Zila Parishad (District Panchayat):\r\n• This is the highest tier of the Panchayati Raj system, functioning at the district level.\r\n• It provides overall guidance and supervision to the Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats.\r\n• Like the Panchayat Samiti, its members are indirectly elected. \r\nThe Gram Sabha is the general assembly of all adults registered to vote in a village, while the Gram Panchayat is a smaller, elected body that acts as the executive arm for village development. Essentially, the Gram Sabha is the larger body that oversees and approves the work of the Gram Panchayat. \r\n",

Rhinoscleroma is a result of infection by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis also called as the Friesch bacillus.\r\n• The occurrence of familial disease suggests that genetic control of the host response to K rhinoscleromatis may be an important factor in endemic areas.\r\n• A positive result with culturing in MacConkey agar is diagnostic of rhinoscleroma. However, culture results are positive in only 50-60% of patients.\r\n• Bronchoscopy has a role in the initial treatment of symptoms. \r\n• Treatment should also include long-term antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention in patients with symptoms of obstruction.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nMetastatic lymph node from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r\nRef: Read the text below    \r\nSol:\r\n• Nasopharynx cancer or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common cancer originating in the nasopharynx, the uppermost region of the pharynx (\"throat\"), behind the nose where the nasal passages and auditory tubes join the remainder of the upper respiratory tract. NPC occurs in children and adults.\r\n• NPC differs significantly from other cancers of the head and neck in its occurrence, causes, clinical behavior, and treatment. \r\n• It is vastly more common in certain regions of East Asia and Africa than elsewhere, with viral, dietary and genetic factors implicated in its causation. It is most common in males. It is a squamous cell carcinoma or an undifferentiated type. \r\n• Squamous cells are a flat type of cell found in the skin and the membranes that line some body cavities. Differentiation means how different the cancer cells are from normal cells. \r\n• Undifferentiated is a word used to describe cells that do not have their mature features or functions.\r\n• Cervical lymphadenopathy (disease or swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck) is the initial presentation in many patients, and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph node biopsy. Symptoms related to the primary tumor include trismus, pain, otitis media, nasal regurgitation due to paresis (loss of or impaired movement) of the soft palate, hearing loss and cranial nerve palsies (paralysis). \r\n• Larger growths may produce nasal obstruction or bleeding and a \"nasal twang\". Metastatic spread may result in bone pain or organ dysfunction. Rarely, a paraneoplastic syndrome of osteoarthropathy (diseases of joints and bones) may occur with widespread disease.\r\n\r\n",

Approximately 25 % of patients will have adrenocortical hormone (ACTH) deficiency and TSH deficiency. Vasopressin deficiency (diabetes insipidus) is reported in approximately 20% of patients.\r\n• It can also compress the optic chiasm and/or optic nerves and cause different degrees and types of visual disturbances, from blurry vision to blindness.\r\n• Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor, and sometimes radiation therapy is used to treat any remaining tumor cells. The most common surgical approaches are endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal (EET) or transcranial\r\n",

The spectrum of disorders caused by HEXA deficiency includes acute infantile, subacute juvenile, and late-onset TSD. Clinical features expressed depend on the amount of enzyme present. The child in the vignette is seen with acute infantile TSD.\r\nClinical features of acute infantile TSD include:\r\n• Early-onset hypotonia and gross motor delay\r\n• Sustained ankle clonus, hyperreflexia, increased or exaggerated startle response\r\n• Regression of motor skills at 6 to 9 months\r\n• Decreased attention\r\n• Cherry-red spot of the fovea centralis of the macula of the retina\r\n• Seizure onset at around 1 year of age\r\n• No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly\r\n• Brain magnetic resonance imaging: ventricular enlargement starting at 18 months of age\r\n",

This benign tumor arises from remnants of Rathke’s pouch and typically occurs in the suprasellar area. It often presents as a mixed cystic and solid mass with characteristic calcifications visible on imaging. These calcifications are a hallmark feature, helping to differentiate craniopharyngioma from other lesions. The cystic component often contains a thick, oily fluid, contributing to its appearance on MRI.\r\n",
