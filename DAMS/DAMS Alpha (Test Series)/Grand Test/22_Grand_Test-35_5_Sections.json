      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A. cGMP (Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate): Nitric oxide (NO) induces smooth muscle relaxation primarily through the cGMP pathway. NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle cells, leading to increased levels of cGMP. Elevated cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates target proteins that result in decreased intracellular calcium levels and desensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium, culminating in muscle relaxation.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>B. cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate): While cAMP is another second messenger involved in smooth muscle relaxation, it operates through a different pathway. Agents like epinephrine increase cAMP levels via activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which also results in reduced intracellular calcium levels and muscle relaxation. However, this pathway is distinct from the NO-mediated mechanism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>C. Ca<sup>2+</sup>&nbsp;(Calcium Ions): Calcium ions play a central role in muscle contraction. An increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>&nbsp;concentration leads to muscle contraction, while a decrease promotes relaxation. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself is not a second messenger for NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation; rather, NO leads to a reduction in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through the cGMP pathway. ​</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>D. Magnesium: Magnesium ions influence muscle function by acting as natural calcium antagonists, helping to relax muscles. Nonetheless, magnesium is not considered a second messenger in the NO-mediated relaxation pathway.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

Lisinopril accumulates in those with subnormal renal function, and the steadily increasing lisinopril levels lead to higher Li+ levels, Lisinopril should never be used with Li+; any other ACEI can be used with dosing adjustment based on levels.\r\nDistal collecting tubule diuretics cause Na+ wasting and thereby increase reabsorption of Li+ proximally. Among the commonly used agents in this class, the thiazides present the greatest risk and must be avoided. Amiloride causes less Na+ wasting and can be used to manage Li+-related polyuria.  Loop diuretics such as furosemide decrease Li+ clearance only approximately 20% in healthy younger individuals and are the diuretics of choice for most patients on Li+.\r\nThrough alteration of renal perfusion, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents can facilitate renal proximal tubular resorption of Li+ and thereby increase serum concentrations. This interaction appears to be particularly prominent with indomethacin, but also may occur with ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam, ketorolac, and COX-2 inhibitors, and less so with sulindac and aspirin.\r\n",

This tract usually penetrates the hyoid bone. There is no sex predilection, and although these cysts are more frequently detected in children, up to 25% do not become symptomatic until adulthood. The most common presentation is a painless swelling in the midline of the neck that moves with protrusion of the tongue or swallowing. The cysts are prone to infection and progressive enlargement. Although rare (less than 1%), epidermoid or papillary carcinomas do occur within thyroglossal duct cysts. Surgical resection is the standard therapy. The Sistrunk procedure, which involves local resection of the cyst and the central portion of the hyoid bone, is the operation of choice. Simple excision of the cyst results in an unacceptably high recurrence rate.\r\n",

Ninety percent of epidural hematomas are associated with linear skull fractures, usually in the temporal region. Only 2% of patients admitted with craniocerebral trauma suffer epidural hematomas. The lesion appears as a hyperdense biconvex mass between the skull and brain on CT scan. Clinical presentation is highly variable and outcome largely depends on promptness of diagnosis and surgical evacuation. The typical history is one of head trauma followed by a momentary alteration in consciousness and then a lucid interval lasting for up to a few hours. This is followed by a loss of consciousness, dilation of the pupil on the side of the epidural hematoma, and then compromise of the brainstem and death. Treatment consists of temporal craniectomy, evaluation of the hemorrhage, and control of the bleeding vessel. The mortality of epidural hematoma is approximately 50%.\r\n",

It is less effective in the diagnosis of diaphragmatic or bowel injuries.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The presence of free intraperitoneal fluid on an abdominal CT scan, without evidence of a solid organ injury, raises concern of a hollow organ injury. In this group of patients, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be useful.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DPL involves making a small midline incision below the umbilicus and using a needle and small catheter to aspirate intraperitoneal fluid to assess for blood or bile.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the aspirate (DPA) is found to contain 10 mL of gross blood or bile, an exploratory laparotomy is indicated. In the absence of gross blood or bile, DPL requires 1 litre of fluid to be infused into the peritoneum and then drained. The effluent should be sent to the laboratory and evaluated. Laboratory criteria for a positive DPL are:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;100,000 red blood cells/mm^3<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;500 white blood cells/mm^3<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Presence of bacteria, bile, or food particles.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DPL in stable patients has limited utility. If a follow-up abdominal CT scan is performed, the additional fluid in the abdomen secondary to DPL can confuse the picture. In stable patients, DPL is an excellent adjunctive study when in an obtunded patient who has free fluid on abdominal CT scanning with no solid organ injury identified.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A patient with blunt abdominal trauma haemodynamically stable but have evidence of some intra-abdominal solid organ bleeding on abdominal CT should be followed as inpatients, with serial abdominal examinations and Hct levels to observe for continued bleeding.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If there is a steady decline in the Hct level, blood transfusion or intervention to control the bleeding may be required.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluation of haemodynamically unstable blunt abdominal trauma<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In haemodynamically unstable patients with blunt abdominal trauma, evaluation and resuscitation occur concurrently.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The goal of evaluation is to determine the site of bleeding and at the same time initiate appropriate therapy for control of the bleeding.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Radiographs performed in the trauma suite are useful to rule out a haemothorax or pelvic fracture. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination is useful to quickly diagnose intra-abdominal haemorrhage.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The FAST examination uses a bedside ultrasound to provide images of the RUQ, LUQ, and pelvis to assess for intra-abdominal haemorrhage.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A systematic review found that the presence of intraperitoneal fluid or organ injury on ultrasound is more accurate than any history and physical examination findings in the diagnostic evaluation for intra-abdominal injuries after blunt abdominal trauma. If a FAST examination is unavailable or unreliable, a DPL may be performed to assess for intraperitoneal bleeding.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Patients found to have significant free intra-abdominal fluid according to FAST examination (or DPL) and haemodynamic instability are recommended to undergo urgent surgery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluation of penetrating abdominal trauma<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The majority of cases of penetrating abdominal trauma are related to gunshot wounds (GSWs) and stab wounds.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Patients presenting with signs of peritonitis, or haemodynamic instability, require an urgent laparotomy.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Those with stab wounds to the abdominal wall require local wound exploration under Local anaesthesia to evaluate for perforation of the abdominal wall fascia.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the anterior fascia has not been violated, it is safe to assume that the intra-abdominal organs have not been injured.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Patients with wounds that penetrate the abdominal fascia require further evaluation and close observation with serial abdominal examinations, laparoscopy to rule out intra-abdominal organ injury, or immediate laparotomy. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stab wounds to the flank or back require a CT scan to rule out to colonic, splenic, or kidney.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gunshot wounds to the abdomen are typically managed operatively regardless of the clinical status of the patient.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plain films of the chest and abdomen with metallic markers (e.g., paper clip) over entrance and exit wounds (if present) should be urgently ordered to determine the trajectory of the bullet.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is important to rule out chest injuries prior to surgical exploration of the abdomen.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nA. Cinema Sign is clinically seen in these patients: This statement is True. \"Cinema Sign\" (or theater sign) refers to the experience of anterior knee pain and stiffness after prolonged sitting with knees bent, a common symptom in patients with Chondromalacia Patellae.\r\n\r\nB. There is no Osteochondral fragment seen initially: This statement is generally True. Chondromalacia Patellae primarily involves softening and degeneration of the articular cartilage on the undersurface of the patella. It does not typically involve the initial formation or presence of osteochondral (bone and cartilage) fragments. Fragments are more common in osteochondritis dissecans or advanced degenerative changes.\r\n\r\nC. It is Chondromalacia Patellae which needs surgical management in most of the cases: This statement is False. Chondromalacia Patellae is often managed conservatively with physical therapy, pain management, activity modification, and bracing. Surgical intervention (like arthroscopic debridement or realignment procedures) is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to extensive conservative treatment, and thus, it is not required in most cases.\r\n\r\nD. Arthroscopic Biopsy is a must for diagnosis: This statement is False. The diagnosis of Chondromalacia Patellae is primarily clinical, based on symptoms (anterior knee pain, crepitus, pain with specific activities like squatting or climbing stairs) and physical examination findings. Imaging like X-rays (to rule out other bone issues) or MRI (to assess cartilage status) can support the diagnosis. Arthroscopy is an invasive procedure and a biopsy is generally not a must for diagnosis; it's typically performed for treatment (e.g., debridement) or if the diagnosis remains unclear after non-invasive methods.",

A CBC reveals a platelet count of 13 x 103/mm and the platelets appear small in size on blood smear evaluation. Family history reveals that the patient has two brothers, ages 6 and 2 years; the older brother has eczema, frequent nose bleeds, bruises easily, and has been admitted to the hospital several times with bacterial pneumonia, while the other brother is healthy. The patient's mother has no chronic illness; her older brother died as a teenager from prolonged bleeding following a motorcycle accident.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is \"C:' This patient presents with congenital microthrombocytopenia and an X-linked inheritance pattern with family history of atopic disease and immunodeficiency, all consistent with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) . WAS is caused by a defective WAS protein, which participates in cytoskeletal connections that are essential for platelet and leukocyte function. The classic diagnostic triad for WAS is thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and eczema. The platelets in WAS are small in size. Neonates with WAS are at increased risk of significant hemorrhage and merit support with platelet transfusion. Because of the substantial risk of life-threatening bleeding or infection, long-term management includes hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) if a suitable donor is available.\r\n",
