      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe presentation of failure to thrive, refractory megaloblastic anemia, crystalluria, and a normal blood ammonia level is suggestive of defective UMP synthase in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway resulting in orotic aciduria.\r\n\r\nOrotic aciduria is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a defect in the bifunctional enzyme UMP synthase (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase) that prevents the conversion of orotic acid to uridine monophosphate (UMP). This inability to produce UMP prevents the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine bases; therefore, there is a lack of pyrimidine bases and DNA cannot replicate. In ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency, there is also a build up of orotic acid, but OTC deficiency also presents with hyperammonemia, which is missing in orotic aciduria.\r\n\r\nFigure A shows a blood smear with macrocytosis and the characteristic hypersegmented neutrophils with up to 8 lobes versus the normal 3 to 4. Illustration A demonstrates a normal blood smear with a normally segmented neutrophil with 3 to 4 lobes.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Answers: \r\nAnswer 1: Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) is involved in the urea cycle catalyzing the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to form citrulline. Patients with OTC deficiency present with a decreased BUN, elevated orotic acid levels in the blood and urine with symptoms of hyperammonemia.\r\n\r\nAnswer 2: Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is involved in the conversion of adenosine to inosine. Patients with a deficiency in ADA present with a decrease in lymphocytes and have severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID).\r\n\r\nAnswer 3: Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is involved in the purine salvage pathway converting guanine to guanylic acid and hypoxanthine to inosinic acid. Patients with a deficiency in HGPRT present with an increase in uric acid in the blood and urine and display symptoms of gout, aggression, retardation, and self-mutilation.\r\n\r\nAnswer 4: Xanthine oxidase is involved in the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and finally to uric acid. Although a very rare condition, patients with a deficiency in xanthine oxidase have high levels of xanthine in the blood and urine and can present with xanthine kidney stones and renal failure.",

She has also noticed that she has been having fatty, foul smelling stools. Past history is significant for cholecystectomy a year ago to treat a long history of symptomatic gallstones. Based on clinical suspicion a coagulation panel was obtained showing a prothrombin time (PT) of 18 seconds (normal range 9-11 seconds), a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 45 seconds (normal 20-35 seconds), with a normal ristocetin cofactor assay (modern equivalent of bleeding time).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nVitamin K deficiency\r\n\r\nThe most likely diagnosis in this case is vitamin K deficiency secondary to fat malabsorption following cholecystectomy.\r\n\r\nVitamin K is used as a cofactor for gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on factors of the coagulation cascade. These factors are II, VII, IX, and X. Deficiency of vitamin K can therefore cause improper processing of many coagulation factors leading to a combined direct and indirect pathway defect. This is manifested as an increased PT and increased PTT. The most common causes of vitamin K deficiency are lack of absorption in the GI tract or lack of activation in liver insufficiency.\r\n\r\nThe way to approach a question on bleeding is to first establish whether the problem affects the coagulation cascade, platelet aggregation, or both mechanisms. Coagulation disorders typically lead to deep bleeding, while platelet disorders typically lead to petechiae and purpura. The corresponding tests are PT (measuring extrinsic pathway), PTT (measuring intrinsic pathway) and ristocetin cofactor analysis / bleeding time measuring platelets. In this case there is a combined intrinsic/extrinsic pathway disorder, which can be due to a common pathway disorder, anticoagulant overdose, or carboxylation defects. The history of fat malabsorption and subacute onset lead towards the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Answers:\r\n\r\nAnswer 1: Hemophilia is caused by a deficiency in intrinsic pathway coagulation factors and therefore would lead to an isolated prolongation of PTT without affecting PT.\r\n\r\nAnswer 2: ITP is an isolated platelet deficiency and would have an abnormal ristocetin cofactor with a normal PT/PTT.\r\nAnswer 3: Rat poison is actually warfarin, an inhibitor of gamma carboxylation and so it can present with this exact pattern of findings; however, the onset of poisoning would be acute bleeding rather than this pattern of a slow 6 month onset. The surrounding clinical details of cholecystectomy and malabsorption is also suggestive of another diagnosis\r\nAnswer 5: von Willebrand Factor is important for both platelet aggregation and for coagulation due to its binding of factor VIII. It would therefore lead to a prolonged PTT and bleeding time with no effect on PT.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes of vitamin K deficiency can be divided into malabsorptive syndromes, poor diet, or pharmacologic vitamin K chelators and inhibitors. Malabsorption can be due to bacterial overgrowth, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or short-gut syndrome. The most common drug that binds vitamin K and prevents its processing is cholestyramine. (1)\r\n",

If the end diastolic volume is 160, then 0.32 of that value will represent the stroke volume (SV), and subtracting the SV from EDV will result in the end systolic volume, which is exactly 108.8 ml (approximately 109 ml). \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nZila panchayat\r\nExplanation\r\nThe administrative system in Indian villages is primarily structured around the Panchayati Raj system, a form of local self-governance. It's a three-tiered structure, with the Gram Panchayat at the village level being the foundational unit. This system ensures that villagers have a direct say in their local governance and development. \r\nA. Gram Panchayat:\r\n• This is the basic unit of local administration in rural India, often referred to as a village council or village panchayat. \r\n• It's responsible for the governance and administration of a village or a group of villages. \r\n• Members are directly elected by the villagers, ensuring democratic representation. \r\n• The Gram Panchayat handles local issues like sanitation, water supply, roads, and basic infrastructure. \r\nB. Panchayat Samiti (Block Panchayat):\r\n• Located at the block level, this acts as an intermediate tier in the Panchayati Raj system.\r\n• It coordinates and oversees the activities of the Gram Panchayats within its jurisdiction.\r\n• Members are indirectly elected from the Gram Panchayats. \r\nC. Zila Parishad (District Panchayat):\r\n• This is the highest tier of the Panchayati Raj system, functioning at the district level.\r\n• It provides overall guidance and supervision to the Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats.\r\n• Like the Panchayat Samiti, its members are indirectly elected. \r\nThe Gram Sabha is the general assembly of all adults registered to vote in a village, while the Gram Panchayat is a smaller, elected body that acts as the executive arm for village development. Essentially, the Gram Sabha is the larger body that oversees and approves the work of the Gram Panchayat. \r\nA Nyaya Panchayat is a village-level dispute resolution body in India's Panchayati Raj system, focused on providing accessible and affordable justice for minor civil and criminal cases. They act as an alternative to formal courts, aiming for speedy and local resolution through conciliation and compromise. \r\n",

Acidosis is a critical condition in trauma care characterized by a blood pH level of less than 7.35. \r\nThe causes of trauma-induced coagulopathy include tissue trauma, shock, and inflammation. These factors initiate a cascade of events leading to coagulation impairment. Trauma-induced coagulopathy is often exacerbated by iatrogenic factors, including fluid administration, hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, and dilutional coagulopathy, any of which may be the result of resuscitation efforts.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n• Intra-arterial injection of drugs is, thankfully, very rare. \r\n• Where it occurs, it is because of inadvertent injection into an arterial line, or injection into a venous line that is inadvertently in an artery. \r\n• It is more likely to occur in the hypotensive, cold, peripherally shut-down patient, such as the one in the question.\r\n• An early symptom is pain and discomfort on injection of an irritant drug. Patients with distracting injuries, sedation, anaesthesia, or depressed consciousness are at risk. \r\n• The drug will fail to have its desired effect, and limb pain, paraesthesia, pallor, hyperaemia, and cyanosis can occur. \r\n• Damage is thought to occur due to arterial spasm, direct tissue destruction by the drug, subsequent chemical arteritis causing endothelial destruction, release of thromboxane, and drug precipitation and crystallization.\r\n• Management strategies aim to maintain perfusion distal to the injection. Elevation improves venous drainage, anticoagulation prevents thrombosis, and analgesia is imperative. \r\n• Stellate ganglion block interrupts the sympathetic supply to the limb, producing arterial and venous vasodilation, and analgesia. \\\r\n• Intra-arterial lignocaine may prevent reflex vasospasm but can cause damage itself. \r\n• Methylprednisolone and papaverine reverse tissue ischaemia, but do not immediately provide analgesia. \r\n• Interscalene brachial plexus block will provide analgesia, but not sympathetic blockade.\r\n",

Metoclopramide, droperidol, and prochlorperazine all act as dopamine anatagonists, and can therefore worsen the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.\r\n• Dexamethasone is used as an antiemetic agent, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. \r\n• However, in this case, using a steroid as an antiemetic may cause derangement of the blood glucose, and impair glycaemic control in the post-operative period.

Guilt is the consequence of transgressing the superego’s prohibitions. Preconscious and conscious functions are dimensions of the ego.\r\n\r\n",
