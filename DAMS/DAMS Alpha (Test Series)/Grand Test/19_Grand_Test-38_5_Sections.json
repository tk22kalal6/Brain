A pelvic binder is recommended for open book pelvic fractures. Pelvic fractures are often compounded by the loss of the natural tamponade effect within the pelvis as a result of pelvic ring instability and disruption of the pelvic floor increasing the mortality to as high as 60%. Pelvic binder help in tamponading the bleed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/6(153).png\" style=\"height:334px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nCompartment syndromes occur whenever tissue pressure within a confined anatomic space becomes sufficiently elevated to impair venous return. It can be due to bleeding within a compartment or to reperfusion edema. There is no absolute pressure above which the syndrome invariably occurs, but nutrient blood flow in the muscle ceases between 30 and 40 mmHg. In addition, a difference between the diastolic blood pressure and intercompartmental pressure greater than 30 mmHg is indicative of impaired blood flow. At minimum, such elevated pressures mandate close follow-up neurovascular examinations in reliable patients. Successful treatment is based on early, accurate diagnosis. Prolonged ischemia is associated with compartment syndrome due to the reperfusion injury and release of free radicals. Diminished or absent pulses are a late finding; by the time this is appreciated, irreversible neurologic damage may have occurred. Compartmental syndromes are best diagnosed by having a high index of suspicion. A tense compartment alone in the absence of elevated pressures or physical findings is not an absolute indication for fasciotomy. Traumatic injury to the popliteal artery is not an absolute indication for fasciotomy unless the repair/revascularization occurred more than 4 to 6 h from the time of injury.",

More than 3 ng/ml is a marker of ovulatory cycle. LH kit is used in mid cycle from day 11 onwards. Folliculometry is also done in mid cycle on alternate days and cervical mucus is a marker of estrogenic activity. If it is present on day 22 then it means cycle is anovulatory.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E)\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is \"E:' This infant likely has BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (BWS). Children with BWS are often large, with macroglossia and have distinctive earlobe creases. Hemihypertrophy of a limb, omphalocele, and diastasis recti are common. Neonatal hypoglycemia can occur but is usually transient. Children with BWS or isolated hemihypertrophy are at increased for developing embryonal tumors such as Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma. The outcomes for children with the tumors are improved through early detection. Therefore, all children with BWS should have abdominal ultrasounds performed every 3 to 6 months until age 8 years, and serum AFP levels every 3 months until age 4 years.\r\n",
