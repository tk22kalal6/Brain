While generally well-tolerated, serious cardiac events, including severe bradycardia, have been reported when sofosbuvir is co-administered with amiodarone.\r\nMechanism:\r\n• The exact mechanism is unclear but may involve synergistic effects on sinoatrial or atrioventricular node conduction.\r\n• This interaction has led to reports of life-threatening bradycardia and cardiac arrest, particularly in patients with pre-existing heart disease or those on beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\r\nOther Options:\r\n• Ribavirin: Associated mainly with hemolytic anemia, not cardiotoxicity.\r\n• Fosaprevir: A protease inhibitor, not widely used or available globally; not strongly linked to cardiotoxicity.\r\n• Velpatasvir: NS5A inhibitor, typically combined with sofosbuvir; not cardiotoxic alone, but may compound the effect when co-administered with sofosbuvir in patients on amiodarone.\r\n",

Nerve agents interfere with the normal functioning of the nervous system. \r\nEYE EXPOSURE\r\n• Contracted or pinpoint pupils (miosis), redness of the membranes (conjunctiva), pain in and around the eye, dim and/or blurred vision, sensation of pressure with heaviness, and reflex nausea and vomiting (emesis).\r\n• Effects are usually local, occuring from direct contact with nerve agent vapor, aerosol, or liquid; but exposure by other routes can also affect the eyes.\r\nINHALATION EXPOSURE\r\n• Mild to moderate: Contracted or pinpoint pupils (miosis), runny nose (rhinorrhea), narrowing of the large airways (bronchoconstriction), fluid accumulation within the airways of the lungs, and slight to moderate difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (dyspnea).\r\n• Severe: In addition to the symptoms described above, there can be loss of consciousness; seizures; muscular twitching (fasciculations); floppy (flaccid) paralysis; increased fluid accumulation within the airways and within the digestive tract, resulting in secretions from the nose and mouth; cessation of breathing (apnea); and death.\r\nSKIN EXPOSURE\r\n• Mild to moderate: Health effects may be immediate or may be delayed up to 18 hours. Profuse sweating (diaphoresis) and muscular twitching (fasciculations) at the site of contact, nausea, vomiting (emesis), diarrhea, and weakness (malaise).\r\n• Severe: Health effects may appear quickly; 2 to 30 minutes post-exposure. In addition to the above, there can be loss of consciousness, seizures, muscular twitching (fasciculations), floppy (flaccid) paralysis, increased fluid accumulation within the airways and within the digestive tract resulting in secretions from the nose and mouth, cessation of breathing (apnea), and death\r\n",

The most common route of spread is direct extension from the palatine tonsils or peritonsillar space.\r\nWhy is option A correct?\r\n• The palatine tonsils are in close proximity to the parapharyngeal space.\r\n• Infections such as tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) can directly extend into the parapharyngeal space.\r\n• Other direct sources include infections from dental, sinus, or mastoid regions.\r\nWhy not the other options?\r\n• B) Hematogenous spread:\r\no While hematogenous spread can occur in septicemia, parapharyngeal abscesses typically arise from local infections rather than bloodstream seeding.\r\n• C) Lymphatic spread from the prevertebral space:\r\no The prevertebral space is posterior to the pharynx and is less commonly involved in direct lymphatic drainage to the parapharyngeal space.\r\no Infections from the prevertebral space are more likely to spread inferiorly into the mediastinum rather than the parapharyngeal space.\r\n• D) Venous spread from the retropharyngeal space:\r\nThe retropharyngeal space can communicate with the parapharyngeal space, but infections more commonly spread from the parapharyngeal space to the\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nConfabulation, apathy, passivity are often prominent symptoms\r\n\r\n (Ref : Kaplan Psychiatry Pg 720) Korsakoff’s syndrome is an amnestic syndrome caused by thiamine deficiency, most commonly associated with the poor nutritional habits of people with chronic alcohol abuse. Other causes of poor nutrition (e.g., starvation), gastric carcinoma, hemodialysis, hyperemesis gravidarum, prolonged IV hyperalimentation, and gastric plication can also result in thiamine deficiency. Korsakoff’s syndrome is often associated with Wernicke’s encephalopathy, which is the associated syndrome of confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Patients with Korsakoff’s syndrome typically demonstrate a change in personality as well, such that they display a lack of initiative, diminished spontaneity, and a lack of interest or concern. These changes appear frontal lobe–like, similar to the personality change ascribed to patients with frontal lobe lesions or degeneration. Indeed, such patients often demonstrate executive function deficits on neuropsychological tasks involving attention, planning, set shifting, and inferential reasoning consistent with frontal pattern injuries. For this reason, Korsakoff’s syndrome is not a pure memory disorder, although it certainly is a good paradigm of the more common clinical presentations for the amnestic syndrome. The onset of Korsakoff’s syndrome can be gradual. Recent memory tends to be affected more than is remote memory, but this feature is variable. Confabulation, apathy, and passivity are often prominent symptoms in the syndrome. With treatment, patients may remain amnestic for up to 3 months and then gradually improve over the ensuing year. Administration of thiamine may prevent the development of additional amnestic symptoms, but the treatment seldom reverses severe amnestic symptoms when they are present. Approximately onethird to one-fourth of all patients recover completely, and approximately one-fourth of all patients have no improvement of their symptoms.\r\n",

Although cortisol is not synthesized efficiently, aldosterone synthetic capacity is normal, and some corticosterone is synthesized from progesterone by the intact aldosterone synthase enzyme. Thus, it is unusual for patients to manifest signs of adrenal insufficiency such   as hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Approximately 65% of patients become hypertensive, although this can take several years to develop. Hypertension is probably a consequence of elevated levels of deoxycorticosterone, which has mineralocorticoid activity. Infants may transiently develop signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency after treatment with hydrocortisone is instituted. This is presumably due to sudden suppression of  deoxycorticosterone secretion in a patient with atrophy of the zona glomerulosa caused by chronic suppression of renin activity. All signs and symptoms of  androgen excess that are found in 21- hydroxylase deficiency may also occur in 11-hydroxylase deficiency. Plasma levels of 11-deoxycortisol and  deoxycorticosterone are elevated\r\n",

Fevers, dysphagia or dysphonia, arthritis, muscle tenderness, and fatigue are also commonly reported at diagnosis. Rash develops as the 1st symptom in 50% of cases and appears concomitant with weakness only 25% of the time. Children often exhibit extreme photosensitivity to ultraviolet light exposure with generalized erythema in sun-exposed areas. The characteristic heliotrope rash is a blue-violet discoloration of the eyelids that may be associated with periorbital edema. Weakness associated with JDM is often insidious and difficult to differentiate from fatigue at onset. It is typically symmetric, affecting proximal muscles such as the neck flexors, shoulder girdle, and hip flexors. Parents may report difficulty climbing stairs, combing hair, and getting out of bed. Examination reveals inability to perform a sit-up, head lag in a child after infancy, and Gower sign (use of hands on thighs to stand from a sitting position.) Patients with JDM may roll to the side rather than sit straight up from lying to compensate for truncal weakness. Approximately half of children exhibit muscle tenderness as a result of muscle inflammation. Diagnosis of dermatomyositis requires the presence of characteristic rash as well as at least three signs of muscle inflammation and weakness.\r\n\r\n",

They typically arise when an infant becomes agitated or in older, uncorrected children after vigorous exercise.\r\nManagement of hypercyanotic \"tet\" spells requires a rapid and aggressive stepwise approach:\r\n●Place the patient in a knee-chest position.\r\n●Administer oxygen.\r\n●If these fail, administer an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus (normal saline 10 to 20 mL/kg) and a dose of narcotic. We typically use IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg per dose) for this purpose; intranasal fentanyl or midazolam have also been described as successful interventions in patients with difficult IV access\r\n●If the above measures fail, administer an IV beta blocker (eg, propranolol 0.1 mg/kg per dose or esmolol 0.1 mg/kg per dose). If single doses are ineffective, a continuous IV infusion of esmolol (50 to 75 mcg/kg/min) can be provided.\r\n●If beta blocker therapy is insufficient, administer IV phenylephrine (bolus dose of 5 to 20 mcg/kg per dose, followed by continuous infusion).\r\n●If all of these measures fail, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO), emergency complete surgical repair, or an emergency aorticopulmonary shunt is necessary.\r\n\r\n",
