In an attempt to restore blood pressure, the parasympathetic outflow to the heart is decreased and sympathetic outflow is increased. As a result, heart rate and contractility will be increased. Mean systemic pressure will increase because of increased sympathetic tone of the veins (and a shift of blood to the arteries).\r\n",

Thus, when allopurinol is used concomitantly with oral mercaptopurine or azathioprine, dosage of the antineoplastic agent must be reduced \r\n\r\nThe plasma t1/2 of allopurinol is approximately 1 to 2 h, and that of oxypurinol is approximately 18 to 30 h\r\nThere was a higher rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients taking febuxostat compared to allopurinol\r\nAllopurinol and its active metabolite oxypurinol are distributed in total tissue water, with the exception of brain",

Stridor may be inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic depending on its timing in the respiratory cycle.\r\n\r\n•    Inspiratory stridor suggests an extrathoracic lesion (eg, laryngeal, nasal, pharyngeal).\r\n\r\n•    Expiratory stridor implies an intrathoracic lesion (eg, tracheal, bronchial). Biphasic stridor suggests a subglottic or glottic anomaly.Inspiratory stridor is the hallmark of upper airway obstruction.\r\n\r\n•    Among the disorders that can involve the upper airway and cause stridor are epiglottitis, infectious laryngotracheitis,angioneurotic edema, and foreign- body aspiration. In contrast, acute bronchospasm prolongs the expiratory phase of respiration and causes predominantly expiratory wheezing rather than inspiratory stridor.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nChildren with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF-1) have about a 15% to 20% risk of developing low-grade gliomas (LGG), most commonly in the optic pathway. They also have a variety of other abnormalities such as axillary freckling and café-au-lait spots. Li Fraumeni syndrome is associated with p53 mutations and high-grade tumors, like high-grade gliomas and sarcomas. The characteristic brain tumor in tuberous sclerosis is a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). Patients with cystic fibrosis are not at increased risk of CNS tumors. LGGs in patients with NF1 are often indolent and do not necessitate any therapy at all. However, most would agree that when visual acuity is affected by the tumor, treatment is indicated to prevent further vision decline and possibly improve vision in some patients. The best known current therapy is LGG chemotherapy. Common first-line LGG chemotherapies are combinations of carboplatin/vincristine, vinblastine alone, or a combination of thioguanine, procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU), and vincristine (TPCV). TPCV often is avoided for patients with NF-1 because of the risks of secondary malignancy with alkylator use. Radiotherapy is avoided for children with NF-1 because of the high risk of secondary malignancy.",

With this presentation, other pediatric renal tumors remain in the differential, including diffuse anaplastic Wilms’ tumor, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, or malignant rhabdoid tumor. The National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)/Children’s Oncology Group (COG) recommends upfront nephrectomy over biopsy for all patients (except bilateral or bilaterally predisposed) when feasible. Although the patient has pulmonary metastases, and her disease is therefore designated as overall stage IV, the local stage (kidney) may still be stage I or II. There is no evidence of tumor thrombus (extending to above the level of the hepatic veins), and the tumor is below the size at which risk of intraoperative rupture is increased (12-14 cm). If the diagnosis of this patient is FHWT, with upfront nephrectomy, depending upon intraoperative findings and lymph node status, this patient may be spared flank radiation if stage I or II for nephrectomy. Option A is incorrect. Although option A can be an appropriate approach in some presentations of renal tumors, following the NWTS/COG approach, upfront biopsy is not recommended when nephrectomy is possible. Option C approach could be appropriate according to treatment guidelines of The International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP), which would recommend initiation of chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin, and doxorubicin; however, these drugs would only be appropriate if the diagnosis is FHWT. This is not the recommended NWTS/COG approach. Option D is incorrect because this management approach is not recommended from either group.",

The inflammatory phase is characterized by a rapid influx of neutrophils, followed in about 2 days by an influx of mononuclear cells. These monocytes act not only by phagocytosing debris and bacteria, but also by secreting numerous growth factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor, which are essential to normal wound healing. Angiogenesis and collagen formation take place during the proliferative phase of wound healing. Fibroblasts, which enter the wound at about day 3, continue to proliferate with increasing collagen deposition. Throughout the proliferative phase, type III collagen predominates. Collagen content is maximum at 2–3 week, at which time the remodelling phase begins. Type III collagen, which is elastic fibrils, is gradually replaced by rigid fibrils, or type I collagen, at this time. During remodelling, collagen deposition and degradation reach a steady state, which may continue for up to 1 year.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe treatment of electrical injury should be modified from that of thermal burns because tissue damage is much deeper than is apparent at first inspection. The heat generated is proportional to the resistance to the flow of current. Bone, fat, and tendons offer the greatest resistance. Therefore, the tissue deep within the center of an extremity may be injured while more superficial tissues are spared. For this reason, the quantification of fluid requirements cannot be based on the percentage of body surface area involved, as in the Parkland, Brooke, or Baxter formulas, which are used to calculate fluid replacement after thermal burns. Massive fluid replacement is usually essential. A brisk urine output is desirable because of the likelihood of myonecrosis with consequent myoglobinuria and renal damage. As with deep thermal burns, debridement, skin grafting, and amputation of extremities may be required following electrical injury. However, fasciotomy is more frequently required than escharotomy with electrical injury because deep myonecrosis results in increased intracompartmental pressures and compromised Trauma and Shock. In addition, distant fractures may result owing to vigorous muscle contraction during the accident or if subsequent falls occur. Cardiac or respiratory arrest may occur if the pathway of the current includes the heart or brain. An electrical current can also damage the pulmonary alveoli and capillaries and lead to respiratory infections, a major cause of death in these victims. Owing to the deep myonecrosis that often accompanies high-voltage injury, prophylaxis for clostridia with high-dose penicillin may be considered. Mafenide acetate is preferred over other topical antimicrobials because of its deeper penetration of eschar.",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) is a disorder involving the bone which is resulted from excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to parathyroid gland hyperactivity. Bone changes are a late presentation of hyperparathyroidism. PTH induces osteoclast activity which results in a bone break down. Hyperparathyroidism (PHP) might be due to parathyroid adenoma (up to 85% of cases), parathyroid hyperplasia, parathyroid carcinoma, renal osteodystrophy, and hereditary factors. Up to 5% of PHP cases develop OFC which can indicate a prolonged or more severe disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osteitis fibrosa cystica presents as bone pain and characteristic radiologic findings including subperiosteal bone resorption in middle phalanges and distal radius, thinning of distal clavicle, bone cyst formation, &ldquo;salt and pepper&rdquo; pattern of the skull, brown tumor involving long bones and generalized osteopenia (up to 5% of cases). Brown tumors are caused by bone demineralization due to osteoclast activation, microfractures, and microhemorrhages. Its name comes from characteristic color resulting from hemosiderin deposition. OFC and its radiologic findings are more common in cases with parathyroid carcinoma compared to benign causes of PHP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On histopathologic examination, there is osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity with hemosiderin-laden macrophages and cyst formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>x-rays of both hands (A).

Intrahepatic cystic dilation can coexist (Caroli’s disease), but it represents a distinct problem and is managed differently. Patients may present with symptoms at any age, but the classic triad of epigastric pain, abdominal mass, and jaundice is not frequently seen. Rather, most patients present with other conditions such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Ultrasonography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is helpful in demonstrating cysts. Nonsurgical treatment of these cysts results in high morbidity and mortality, and therefore surgery is advised in all cases. The present recommendation is for complete resection of the cyst and Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. Since malignant changes in choledochal cysts have been frequently described, complete resection rather than the performance of an internal drainage procedure is preferred whenever the resection can be done safe.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nThis radiograph of a child with a scaphoid abdomen and respiratory disease is characteristic of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. These defects are posterolateral and occur from failure of the embryologic diaphragm to fuse between the eighth and twelfth weeks of intrauterine life. The size of the defect does not correlate with the symptoms. Even a large diaphragmatic hernia can be missed on prenatal sonogram if the abdominal contents have slipped back into the abdomen at the time of the study. Hernias of Morgagni are anteromedial and do not present as emergencies at birth. Any abdominal organ— pancreas, kidney, small and large intestine, stomach, liver, or spleen—can herniate into the chest. The abdominal organ acts as a space-occupying lesion and retards growth of the lung, which results in pulmonary hypoplasia. Respiratory problems at birth stem from primary pulmonary hypertension, the consequence of hypoplasia, rather than from compression of the lung by abdominal contents. Most experts recommend stabilizing the pulmonary hypertensive crisis medically or with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) prior to attempting repair.",

Pericardial/Subxiphoid view: To rule our pericardial effusion\r\n\r\n2. Right upper quadrant view/Perihepatic view/Morison pouch view: To rule out fluid in the hepatorenal interface (Morrison pouch) due to hepatorenal trauma\r\n\r\n3. Left upper quadrant/Perisplenic view: To rule out fluid in perisplenic space due to spleen trauma\r\n\r\n4. Pelvic/Suprapubic view: This space (pouch of Douglas) is most dependent peritoneal space.

Most affected children can eventually sit, but rarely do they learn to walk. In the first several years, unusual motor movements manifest, including dystonia, choreoathetosis, and opisthotonos. Spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar reflexes that mimic cerebral palsy also become apparent. Behavioral disturbances and cognitive decline emerge between 2 and 3 years of age.

The immediate concern would be for differential perfusion between the upper and lower extremities. Based on the 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for use of pulse oximetry to screen for critical congenital heart disease , the most appropriate next step is to repeat pulse oximetry in the right extremities in 1 and 2 hours before investigating any further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/8_1(15).png\" style=\"height:562px; width:547px\" /></p>\r\n",
