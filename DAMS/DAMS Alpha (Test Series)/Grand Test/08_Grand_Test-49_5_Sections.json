      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This patient is most likely suffering from congenital 11 &beta;-hydroxylase deficiency. 11- &beta;- hydroxylase deficiency leads to the inability to synthesize aldosterone with a buildup of the mineralocorticoid 11-deoxycorticosterone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11- &beta; hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The enzyme responsible for converting 11-deoxycorticosterone into aldosterone and 11-deoxycortisol into cortisol. A deficiency results in low levels of cortisol and high levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone which has mineralocorticoid activity and is responsible for the hypertension seen in this patient. Furthermore, sex hormones such as testosterone become elevated as cortisol precursors are diverted toward the androgen synthesis pathway. Male patients with 11-hydroxylase deficiency consequently have normal genitalia at birth, while females have ambiguous genitalia.<br />\r\nIncorrect answers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer A: 17-hydroxylase deficiency presents in a male with ambiguous genitalia due to decreased production of testosterone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer B: 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with low levels of serum mineralocorticoids and low blood pressure. Testosterone would also be elevated in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answer C: This patient is suffering from a deficiency of 11-hydroxylase and, thus, we would not expect 11-hydroxylase to be elevated.</p>\r\n",

This type of fracture can occur in the skull, limbs, or other areas and involves a crack that runs straight along the bone. It is a common injury in accidents due to the forceful impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Hinge fracture<br />\r\nA hinge fracture refers to a specific type of fracture around the elbow joint, where the bone typically breaks in such a way that it behaves like a hinge, but it&#39;s not typically associated with road traffic accidents. It is less common in such incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. Depressed fracture<br />\r\nA depressed fracture typically involves the skull, where a section of the skull is pushed inward. While this can occur in some severe accidents, it&#39;s not as common as linear fractures, especially in less severe collisions or in cases involving only limb injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Gutter fracture<br />\r\nA gutter fracture is a type of bone injury where the fracture runs along the surface, resembling a gutter or channel. It&#39;s typically seen in specific areas like the skull but is less common compared to linear fractures in RTAs.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small left colon syndrome<br />\r\nThe fetal structural anomalies associated with women with diabetes mellitus typically occur prior to 2 months&rsquo; gestation, at the time of organogenesis. Most of these anomalies involve the cardiac and neurological systems and include:<br />\r\n&bull; Cardiac: transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta<br />\r\n&bull; Neurologic: meningomyelocele, encephalocele, anencephaly.&nbsp;<br />\r\nInfants are also at risk for caudal regression syndrome, which consists of spinal abnormalities and syringomyelia. Renal anomalies (hydronephrosis, renal agenesis, cystic kidneys) and intestinal atresias can also occur.&nbsp;<br />\r\nSmall left colon syndrome usually occurs during the second half of gestation, after organogenesis is complete. In this syndrome, the diameter of the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum are smaller than normal. The cause is thought to be related to large changes in maternal and fetal serum glucose concentrations. Affected infants often present with signs of intestinal obstruction, such as bilious emesis and abdominal distention.</p>\r\n",
