This form of spasticity is typical of an upper motor neuron lesion. &bull; Potential sites for upper motor neuron lesions include the corticospinal tracts of the spinal cord; the medulla, pons and midbrain; the internal capsule; or the precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex). Of these, the internal capsule is the only structure labeled above (Choice B). &bull; In general, upper motor neuron lesions cause spastic paresis, hyperreflexia, and a positive Babinski sign. The clasp knife phenomenon is a form of spasticity that results from a lack of upper motor neuron inhibitory control on the spinal muscle stretch reflex arc.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D) Efflux of K+ through slow voltage-gated K+ channels bring the action potential to an end and cause closure of their gates through a positive feedback process. Entry of Na+ during the depolarization phase causes opening of more voltage-gated Na+ channels and further depolarization, setting up a positive feedback loop. During the rapid upstroke phase the membrane potential moves toward the equilibrium potential for Na+ (+60 mV) but does not reach it during the action potential primarily because the increase in Na+ conductance is short-lived. The Na+ channels rapidly enter a closed state called the inactivated state and remain in this state for a few milliseconds before returning to the resting state, when they again can be activated. The opening of voltage-gated K+ channels is slower and more prolonged than the opening of the Na+ channels, and consequently, the increase in K+ conductance comes after the increase in Na+ conductance. The net movement of positive charge out of the cell due to K+ efflux at this time helps complete the process of repolarization. The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state also explains the afterhyperpolarization, followed by a return to the resting membrane potential. Thus, efflux of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels bring the action potential to an end and cause closure of their gates through a negative feedback process.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nii and v \r\n\r\nSol:-\r\n\r\n•\tNOE or MOE is an infection of the EAC and temporal bone. The infection begins as an external otitis that can progress into an osteomyelitis of the skull base. Spread of the disease outside the EAC occurs through the fissures of Santorini and the osseocartilaginous junction, leading to involvement of the stylomastoid and jugular foramina.\r\n\r\n•\tGallium citrate Ga-67 scan is sensitive but not specific. Gallium binds to actively dividing cells, including inflammatory cells, tumor cells, and osteoblasts, and can be used to monitor response to treatment. Improvement of a positive test result correlates with therapeutic response.\r\n\r\n•\tComplete resolution of NOE may take several months; antibiotics, aural toilet, and glucose control in diabetic patients are the cornerstones of treatment.\r\n\r\n•\tThe role of surgery in NOE is largely confined to tissue biopsy and abscess drainage.\r\n\r\n•\tRemoval of diseased bone and surgical resection is not recommended because of the spread of infection through vascular and fascial planes.\r\n\r\n•\tFacial nerve palsy is not an independent indicator for surgical intervention, and facial nerve decompression is not indicated for patients with facial paralysis.",

Serum phosphate is usually low in hyperparathyroidism. Serum alkaline phosphatase, an index of osteoblastic activity, may be raised depending on the degree of involvement of bone. Osteomalacia will have normal or low serum calcium. Pseudohypoparathyroidism has low serum calcium.</p>\r\n",

Occasionally patients will have one limb that will slowly rise and “have a mind of its own,” known as alien limb syndrome.Alpha-synuclein deposits are commonly associated with multiple system atrophy (MSA), idiopathic PD, and dementia with Lewy bodies, but not with CBGD. Typically, autonomic dysfunction is found in MSA",

Contributing factors - Moral/ religious views on sex and masturbation; previous negative sexual experiences (may undermine sexual confidence and increase &lsquo;performance anxiety&rsquo;); secondary to other sexual dysfunction (e.g. premature ejaculation); use of alcohol and drugs; stress and fatigue. Management &ndash; Physical assessment to exclude organic causes (disease or surgery affecting the blood supply of the penis, side effects of drugs or medication) especially in older men; refer to an expert on sexual problems if primary, total, long- standing (years), or not associated with obvious triggers. General&mdash; education (about physical and psychological factors that may contribute to erectile failure) and self- help exercises (better if partner involved). Physical&mdash; phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor drug [e.g. sildenafil , tadalafil ; training in self- administration of papaverine or prostaglandin E1 into the penis prior to intercourse; use of a vacuum constriction device; surgical implantation of semi- rigid or inflatable penile prostheses.</p>\r\n",

Cardiovascular features which are the most common cause of morbidity and modality, include aortic dilatation with risk for tear and rupture, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, aortic valve insufficiency, tricuspid valve prolapse, and enlargement of the proximal pulmonary artery. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not a clinical feature of Marfan syndrome. Skeletal features include a reduced upper-to-lower body segment ratio, increased arm span to-height ratio, scoliosis, rib-cage asymmetry with pectus carinatum and/or excavatum, and joint laxity. Ocular features include progressive high myopia, and ectopia lentis associated with an increased risk of glaucoma, retinal detachment, and early cataracts.</p>\r\n",

This autoimmune condition occurs in 1% to 2% of infants with transplacental passage of maternal anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies due to rheumatologic conditions, such as Sj&ouml;gren disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, half of all infants with NSLE are born to mothers with no identified autoimmune condition. The most common cardiac conduction abnormality in infants with NSLE is complete congenital heart block (CHB) or third-degree atrioventricular block. This is due to SSA and SSB antibody-mediated injury to fetal and neonatal cardiac conduction</p>\r\n",

Characteristics of an include that multiple family members in multiple generations are affected, males and females are equally affected, and the recurrence risk is 50% with every pregnancy. Penetrance refers to the percentage of individuals who express clinical features of the condition and carry a disease-causing change in the associated gene.</p>\r\n",
