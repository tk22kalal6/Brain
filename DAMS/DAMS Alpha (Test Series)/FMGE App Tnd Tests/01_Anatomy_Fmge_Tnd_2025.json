      "subjects_id": [],
      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) \r\n\r\nHas branches that anastomose freely within the spleen)\r\nExplanation: This statement is false because the arterial supply within the spleen is generally considered to be via end arteries or functional end arteries. This means that the branches of the splenic artery that enter the spleen have very limited or no significant anastomotic (connecting) pathways with each other. If one of these branches is occluded, the specific region of the spleen it supplies will likely undergo ischemia and infarction (tissue death due to lack of blood supply), as there are insufficient alternative blood supply routes.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nOption (A. Has a tortuous course)\r\nExplanation: This statement is true. The splenic artery is well-known for its characteristic winding and twisting, or tortuous, path as it travels along the superior border of the pancreas toward the hilum of the spleen. This anatomical feature is often highlighted in textbooks and imaging.\r\n\r\nOption (B. Is a branch of the celiac trunk)\r\nExplanation: This statement is true. The celiac trunk is a major, unpaired artery branching from the abdominal aorta. It typically trifurcates (divides into three main branches) almost immediately after its origin. These three branches are the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery, and the splenic artery.\r\n\r\nOption (D. Supplies the greater curvature of stomach)\r\nExplanation: This statement is true. The splenic artery gives rise to important branches that supply parts of the stomach, particularly along the greater curvature. These branches include the short gastric arteries (which supply the fundus and upper part of the greater curvature) and the left gastro-omental (gastroepiploic) artery (which runs along the greater curvature and supplies it, often anastomosing with the right gastro-omental artery).",
