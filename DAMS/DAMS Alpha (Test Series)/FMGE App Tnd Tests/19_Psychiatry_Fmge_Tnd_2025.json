The patient is having a conversation and gesticulating to someone who is not in the room. Delusion (choice A) refers to false belief (not perception) that is not amenable to reason. In obsessive-compulsive behaviour (choice C), the patient recognizes the irrationality of the compulsion, but not engaging in it causes extreme anxiety. In panic states, the patient experiences extreme anxiety, usually immobilizing or forcing him/her to escape from the situation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Mood swings are common. Patients can be argumentative at one moment, depressed the next, and later complain of having no feelings. Patients can have short-lived psychotic episodes (so-called micropsychotic episodes) rather than full-blown psychotic breaks, and the psychotic symptoms of these patients are almost always circumscribed, fleeting, or doubtful. The behavior of patients with borderline personality disorder is highly unpredictable, and their achievements are rarely at the level of their abilities. The painful nature of their lives is reflected in repetitive self-destructive acts. Such patients may slash their wrists and perform other self-mutilations to elicit help from others, to express anger, or to numb themselves to overwhelming affect. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
