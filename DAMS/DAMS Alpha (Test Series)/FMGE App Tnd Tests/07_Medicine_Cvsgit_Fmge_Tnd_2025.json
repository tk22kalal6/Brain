The elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels in Gilbert syndrome are typically less than 5 mg/dL and are often exacerbated by fasting, illness, or stress. Patients with Gilbert syndrome are otherwise healthy and do not have evidence of liver disease or hemolysis. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin, leading to the accumulation of conjugated bilirubin in hepatocytes and subsequent jaundice. \r\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severely impaired or absent activity of UGT1A1, leading to markedly elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels and the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.
