      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nneurotransmitter is a ligand, so when a neurotransmitter binds to its receptor on an ion channel, causing the channel to open, the channel is said to be ligand gated; voltage-gated channels open and close in response to changes in electrical potential across the cell membrane. The mechanism of transport through all water-filled channels is diffusion. Secondary active transport and primary active transport require special transport proteins rather than water-filled channels in the membrane.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nThe velocity of an action potential is a function of the physical characteristics of the axon (e.g., myelination, axon diameter). A given axon will always conduct any action potential at the same velocity under normal conditions. Therefore, stimulation of the axon with a 25-millivolt pulse or\r\n100 millivolts will produce an action potential with the same velocity, which is why action potentials are said to be “all or none.” However, the level of stimulation must be sufficient to achieve a critical threshold level of potential before an action potential can be initiated in an axon.\r\n",

The renal clearance of PAH at low concentration is very high. At low concentration, clearance of PAH is equal to the renal plasma flow. But as the plasma concentration of PAH increases there is an incomplete secretion of PAH, decreasing its clearance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This increases the force that drives plasma from the capillary into the capsule and increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Constricting the afferent arteriole or dilating the efferent arteriole decreases PGC and thus decreases GFR. Increasing the glomerular capillary colloid oncotic pressure will draw fluid from Bowman&rsquo;s capsule into the capillary, hence decrease GFR. Increasing hydrostatic pressure in Bowman&rsquo;s space, such as seen in postrenal failure, opposes filtration and decreases GFR.</p>\r\n",

Pure water is hypotonic to blood and therefore reduces the plasma osmolality, making it hypoosmotic compared to normal. In this state, water will diffuse into the red blood cells until NaCl concentration is equal inside and outside of the cells. This will cause the cells to swell and possibly lyse.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Bicarbonate diffuses out of the RBCs, whereas the chloride diffuses into the cells to maintain electrical neutrality. The phenomenon, called chloride shift occurs due to a special protein called AE-1 present in the RBC membrane that shuttles the ions in the opposite directions.

Proximal muscles of the lower extremities are primarily affected, producing a waddling gait and difficulty in raising arms. &bull; Repetitive stimulation of the motor nerve facilitates accumulation of calcium in the nerve terminal and increases acetylcholine release, leading to increase in muscle strength.
