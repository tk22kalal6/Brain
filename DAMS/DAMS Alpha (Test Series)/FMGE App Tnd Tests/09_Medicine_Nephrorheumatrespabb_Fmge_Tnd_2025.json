      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. EPO deficiency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys are unable to produce adequate amounts of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone responsible for stimulating the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. This deficiency in EPO leads to anemia, which is very common in CKD patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B. Malaena</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: Malaena refers to the passage of black, tarry stools, often due to gastrointestinal bleeding. While GI bleeding can contribute to anemia, it is not the most common cause of anemia in CKD patients. EPO deficiency is a more direct and prevalent cause of anemia in CKD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. Occult sepsis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: Occult sepsis can lead to anemia, but it typically causes anemia through chronic inflammation, which can suppress bone marrow function. However, EPO deficiency is still the more direct and common cause of anemia in CKD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. Coagulopathy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation: Coagulopathy refers to a disorder where the blood doesn&#39;t clot properly. While CKD can increase the risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction, coagulopathy does not directly cause anemia. It might contribute to blood loss, but EPO deficiency remains the primary cause of anemia in CKD.</p>\r\n",
