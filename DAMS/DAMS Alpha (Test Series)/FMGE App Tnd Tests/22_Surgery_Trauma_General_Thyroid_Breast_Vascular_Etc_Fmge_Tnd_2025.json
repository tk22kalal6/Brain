It is less effective in the diagnosis of diaphragmatic or bowel injuries. \r\n\r\n•\tThe presence of free intraperitoneal fluid on an abdominal CT scan, without evidence of a solid organ injury, raises concern of a hollow organ injury. In this group of patients, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be useful.\r\n\r\n•\tDPL involves making a small midline incision below the umbilicus and using a needle and small catheter to aspirate intraperitoneal fluid to assess for blood or bile. \r\n\r\n•\tIf the aspirate (DPA) is found to contain 10 mL of gross blood or bile, an exploratory laparotomy is indicated",

This lesion needs to be fixed immediately. With continuing negative pressure in the chest, each breath sucks more of the abdominal contents into the chest and increases the likelihood of vascular compromise of the herniated viscera. While the diaphragm is easily fixed from the left chest, this injury should be approached from the abdomen. The possibility of injury below the diaphragm after sufficient blunt injury to rupture the diaphragm mandates examination of the intraabdominal solid and hollow viscera; adequate exposure of the diaphragm to allow secure repair is possible from this approach.",

When these tumors involve the surrounding structures such as the brachial plexus, cervical paravertebral sympathetic nervous system, and stellate ganglion, they cause a group of signs and symptoms that are collectively called Pancoast syndrome. This is characterized by ipsilateral shoulder and arm pain, paresthesias, paresis and atrophy of the thenar muscles of the hand, and Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis). \r\nPancoast syndrome refers to the collective group of symptoms associated with these tumors, which is secondary to the involvement of brachial plexus and associated chest wall, vertebral, or rib pain. Shoulder or arm pain with associated paresthesias along the medial half of the fourth, fifth fingers and medial side of the hand, arm, and forearm due to C8 through T1 radiculopathy are usually primary symptoms associated. Since they are apically located, pulmonary symptoms of shortness of breath do not develop until later, as the tumor begins to involve more of the lung.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nPrimary Raynaud phenomena\r\n\r\nRaynaud phenomenon characterized is by three changes in color.\r\n\r\n1. White -both capillary and venous spasms seen. \r\n\r\n2. Blue- capillary are still in spasm but veins opened. \r\n\r\n3. Crimson red- arteries and venues opened up.\r\n\r\nRaynaud’s disease This idiopathic condition usually occurs in young women and affects the hands more than the feet.  There is abnormal sensitivity in the arteriolar response to cold. These vessels constrict and the digits (usually the fingers) turn white and become incapable of fine movements. The capillaries then dilate and fill with slowly flowing deoxygenated blood, resulting in the digits becoming swollen and dusky. As the attack passes off, the arterioles relax, oxygenated blood returns into the dilated capillaries and the digits become red.  Thus, the condition is recognized by the characteristic sequence of blanching, dusky cyanosis, and red engorgement, often accompanied by pain. Superficial necrosis is very uncommon. This condition must be distinguished from Raynaud,s syndrome, which has similar features. Treatment of Raynaud’s disease consists of protection from cold and avoidance of pulp and nail bed infection. Calcium antagonists, such as nifedipine, may also have a role to play and electrically heated gloves can be useful in winter. Sympathectomy has been used in the past but it is either ineffective or its effects are short-lived.",
