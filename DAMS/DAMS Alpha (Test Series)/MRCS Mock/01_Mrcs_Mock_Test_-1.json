However, when the sample size is small, the Chi squared test is not suitable and in these situations the Fishers exact test is used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics is a topic that generally strikes fear and dread into most surgeons hearts. The MRCS is not an examination designed to test mathematical skill but the examiners do expect you to have working knowledge of commonly used tests so that you can appraise the literature properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analysing data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having ascribed the data it is then possible to begin the process of analysis. Nominal data is often tabulated into categories because of the nature of the underlying data sets. Continuous data may be displayed graphically often as individual data points. When the sample size is large enough, continuous data can be analysed to determine the distribution of the data points. Often, but not always these will be in the form of a gaussian distribution. Determining whether data is normally distributed or not is key to making sense of the subsequent statistical tests. Parametric tests are used to test normally distributed data, the T Test is one of the best examples. Data which is not normally distributed cannot be analysed in this way and a non parametric test must be used. Examples of such tests include Chi Squared and Mann Whitney U tests. Chi squared tests often appear in the medical literature. There are some assumptions that are made in relation to Chi squared tests; these include the need to use 2 degrees of freedom (usually) and the minimum sample size. Where the sample size is small then a different test is appropriate and the Fishers exact test is often used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In situations where data is normally distributed and paired samples are taken from the same individuals (such as following an intervention) then the paired T Test may be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple testing and post hoc analysis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ideal world statistical analysis is conducted on data that is collected prospectively according to pre set power calculations and defined end points. Occasionally, data does not produce an expected outcome or a certain type of patient appears to have a different result. Subsequent analysis of such groups is termed a post hoc analysis. This can be perfectly legitimate, alternatively it can represent the last ditch attempt of a researcher to try and find any aspect of the data that is worthwhile. This can lead to errors and false rejection of a null hypothesis. A statistically significant result is more likely to occur if the same dataset is subjected to multiple analyses. To counteract this problem some researchers will apply a Bonferroni correction, this adjusts the analysis to allow for multiple testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nData types<br />\r\nBefore selecting a method of statistical analysis it is imperative that the type of data to be analysed is correctly categorised. Commonly used terms include nominal, ordinal, interval and continuous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/13(289).png\" style=\"height:105px; width:350px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A weeping, crusty lesion such as this is most likely to represent Pagets disease of the nipple (especially since the areolar region is spared). Although no mass lesion is palpable, a proportion of patients will still have an underlying invasive malignancy (hence the lymphadenopathy).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPagets disease of the nipple</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pagets disease of the breast is rare, accounting for 13% of all breast malignancies but is often missed in the early stages after being wrongly diagnosed as simple dermatitis. Importantly Pagets disease of the breast does not infer definite underlying malignancy but DCIS or invasive cancer is associated in around 90% of cases. In comparison to invasive ductal cancer with no associated Pagets disease there is larger tumour size, higher grade, less ER/PR receptor positivity and higher rates of HER2 positivity,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i.e all poor prognostic indicators. There is no evidence to suggest that Pagets is more commonly associated with DCIS or invasive disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pathogenesis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two theories predominate 1. Epidermatropic wherein adenocarcinoma spreads from the primary site through the ducts to the nipples itself. 2. Transformation wherein keratinocytes transform into Pagets cells independent of the underlying cancer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investigation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suspected cases require bilateral mammograms (although these can show no abnormalities in 50% of cases). Diagnosis is made by punch biopsies of the affected area. Histologically large pale paget cells would be seen in the epidermis and IHC for CEA would likely be positive. Only half are ER/PR positive and over 90% are HER2 positive inferring poor prognosis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically this would have always been a simple mastectomy. This was due to the fact that the underlying disease is often multifocal and can lie far from the nipple. However MRI can now very accurately map disease and in selected patients wide local excision of the disease along with the nipple areolar complex (which must be excised) and adjuvant radiotherapy can be sufficient. Where invasive disease is the underlying driver sentinel lymph node biopsy must be carried out, and as always where mastectomy for DCIS is carried out SLNB must also be performed due to the possibility of upgrade to invasive disease on final pathology. It is worth noting that disease associated with Pagets has a worse prognosis due to more extensive lymph node involvement and distant metastases and tumours that were higher in grade, more advanced in stage, larger in size and had higher levels of HER2 expression compared to those with IDC. As a result, it has been reported in a recent study comparing patients with IDC to Pagets with associated IDC reported that patients with Pagets had a significantly lower survival (10-year OS 49%) than patients with IDC only (64%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pagets disease of the nipple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/25_1(33).png\" style=\"height:273px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

However, they are a very popular topic for surgical physiology in the MRCS&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B exam.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nElectrical properties</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Intrinsic myogenic rhythm within cardiac myocytes means that even the denervated heart is capable of contraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the normal situation the cardiac impulse is generated in the sino atrial node in the right atrium and conveyed to the ventricles via the atrioventricular node.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sino atrial node is also capable of spontaneous discharge and in the absence of background vagal tone will typically discharge around 100x per minute. Hence the higher resting heart rate found in cardiac transplant cases. In the SA and AV nodes the resting membrane potential is lower than in surrounding cardiac cells and will slowly depolarise from -70mV to around -50mV at which point an action potential is generated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Differences in the depolarisation slopes between SA and AV nodes help to explain why the SA node will depolarise first. The cells have a refractory period during which they cannot be re-stimulated and this period allows for adequate ventricular filling. In pathological tachycardic states this time period is overridden and inadequate ventricular filling may then occur, cardiac output falls and syncope may ensue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parasympathetic fibres project to the heart via the vagus and will release acetylcholine. Sympathetic fibres release nor adrenaline and circulating adrenaline comes from the adrenal medulla. Noradrenaline binds to &beta; 1 receptors in the SA node and increases the rate of pacemaker potential depolarisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mid diastole: AV valves open. Ventricles hold 80% of final volume. Outflow valves shut. Aortic pressure is high.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Late diastole: Atria contract. Ventricles receive 20% to complete filling. Typical end diastolic volume 130-160ml.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Early systole: AV valves shut. Ventricular pressure rises. Isovolumetric ventricular contraction. AV Valves bulge into atria (c-wave). Aortic and pulmonary pressure exceeded- blood is ejected. Shortening of ventricles pulls atria downwards and drops intra atrial pressure (x-descent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Late systole: Ventricular muscles relax and ventricular pressures drop. Although ventricular pressure drops the aortic pressure remains constant owing to peripheral vascular resistance and elastic property of the aorta. Brief period of retrograde flow that occurs in aortic recoil shuts the aortic valve. Ventricles will contain 60ml end systolic volume. The average stroke volume is 70ml (i.e. Volume ejected).<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Early diastole: All valves are closed. Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation occurs. Pressure wave associated with closure of the aortic valve increases aortic pressure. The pressure dip before this rise can be seen on arterial waveforms and is called the incisura. During systole the atrial pressure increases such that it is now above zero (v- wave). Eventually atrial pressure exceed ventricular pressure and AV valves open - atria empty passively into ventricles and atrial pressure falls (y -descent )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The negative atrial pressures are of clinical importance as they can allow air embolization to occur if the neck veins are exposed to air.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E)\r\n\r\nOveractive bladder syndrome is very common and first line management includes the use of anticholinergics and bladder drill whereby voiding is deferred.\r\n \r\nRefractory cases can be treated with SNS or botulinum toxin injections. A Burch Colposuspension is used to treat stress urinary incontinence.\r\nUrinary incontinence\r\n\r\nInvoluntary passage of urine. Most cases are female (80%). It has a prevalence of 11% in those aged greater than 65 years. The commonest variants include:\r\n\r\n•\tStress urinary incontinence (50%)\r\n\r\n•\tUrge incontinence (15%)\r\n\r\n•\tMixed (35%)\r\n\r\nMales\r\nMales may also suffer from incontinence although it is a much rarer condition in men. A number of anatomical factors contribute to this. Males have 2 powerful sphincters; one at the bladder neck and the other in the urethra. Damage to the bladder neck mechanism is a factor in causing retrograde ejaculation following prostatectomy. The short segment of urethra passing through the urogenital diaphragm consists of striated muscle fibres (the external urethral sphincter) and smooth muscle capable of more sustained contraction. It is the latter mechanism that maintains continence following prostatectomy.\r\n\r\nFemales\r\nThe sphincter complex at the level of bladder neck is poorly developed in females. As a result the external sphincter complex is functionally more important, its composition being similar to that of males. Innervation is via the pudendal nerve and the neuropathy that may accompany obstetric events may compromise this and lead to stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nInnervation\r\nSomatic innervation to the bladder is via the pudendal, hypogastric and pelvic nerves. Autonomic nerves travel in these nerve fibres too. Bladder filling leads to detrusor relaxation (sympathetic) coupled with sphincter contraction. The parasympathetic system causes detrusor contraction and sphincter relaxation. Overall control of micturition is centrally mediated via centres in the Pons.\r\n\r\nStress urinary incontinence\r\n\r\n•\t50% of cases, especially in females.\r\n\r\n•\tDamage (often obstetric) to the supporting structures surrounding the bladder may lead to urethral hypermobility.\r\n\r\n•\tOther cases due to sphincter dysfunction, usually from neurological disorders (e.g. Pudendal neuropathy, multiple sclerosis).\r\n \r\nUrethral mobility:\r\nPressure not transmitted appropriately to the urethra resulting in involuntary passage of urine during episodes of raised intra-abdominal pressure.\r\n\r\nSphincter dysfunction:\r\nSphincter fails to adapt to compress urethra resulting in involuntary passage of urine. When the sphincter completely fails there is often to continuous passage of urine.\r\n\r\nUrge incontinence\r\nIn these patients there is sense of urgency followed by incontinence. The detrusor muscle in these patients is unstable and urodynamic investigation will demonstrate overactivity of the detrusor muscle at inappropriate times (e.g. Bladder filling). Urgency may be seen in patients with overt neurological disorders and those without. The pathophysiology is not well understood but poor central and peripheral co-ordination of the events surrounding bladder filling are the main processes.\r\n\r\nAssessment\r\nCareful history and examination including vaginal examination for cystocele. Bladder diary for at least 3 days\r\nConsider flow cystometry if unclear symptomatology or surgery considered and diagnosis is unclear.\r\nExclusion of other organic disease (e.g. Stones, UTI, Cancer)\r\n\r\nManagement\r\nConservative measures should be tried first; Stress urinary incontinence or mixed symptoms should undergo 3 months of pelvic floor exercise. Over active bladder should have 6 weeks of bladder retraining.\r\nDrug therapy for women with overactive bladder should be offered oxybutynin (or solifenacin if elderly) if conservative measures fail.\r\nIn women with detrusor instability who fail non operative therapy a trial of sacral neuromodulation may be considered, with conversion to permanent implant if good response. Augmentation cystoplasty is an alternative but will involve long term intermittent self catheterisation.\r\nIn women with stress urinary incontinence a urethral sling type procedure may be undertaken. Where cystocele is present in association with incontinence it should be repaired particularly if it lies at the introitus.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines\r\n\r\n•\tInitial assessment urinary incontinence should be classified as stress/urge/mixed.\r\n\r\n•\tAt least 3/7 bladder diary if unable to classify easily.\r\n \r\n•\tStart conservative treatment before urodynamic studies if a diagnosis is obvious from the history\r\n\r\n•\tUrodynamic studies if plans for surgery.\r\n\r\n•\tStress incontinence: Pelvic floor exercises 3/12, if fails consider surgery.\r\n\r\n•\tUrge incontinence: Bladder training >6/52, if fails for oxybutynin (antimuscarinic drugs) then sacral nerve stimulation.\r\n\r\n•\tPelvic floor exercises offered to all women in their 1st pregnancy",

CRP is a protein synthesised in the liver and binds to phosphocholine in bacterial cells and on those cells undergoing apoptosis. In binding to these cells it is then able to activate the complement system. CRP levels are known to rise in patients following surgery. However, levels of greater than 150 at 48 hours post operatively are suggestive of evolving complications.",

In children aged 6 months to 4 years, Kigella is the most likely infecting organism.\r\n\r\nDiscitis in children\r\n\r\nIn children, infectious discitis (D) and infectious spondylodiscitis (SD) are rare diseases that can cause significant clinical problems, including spinal deformities and segmental instabilities. Moreover, when the infection spreads into the spinal channel, D and SD can cause devastating neurologic complications. Early diagnosis and treatment may reduce these risks. Several different bacterial pathogens can cause D and SD, and, in some cases, particularly those due to Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., the appropriate choice of drug is critical to achieve cure. In most cases the infections spreads to the site haematogenously from a separate site. Less commonly, it arises as a result of direct inoculation.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe reticuloendothelial cells are concerned with the immune functions of the spleen and these are therefore concentrated in the white pulp.\r\nSpleen- function\r\n \r\nThe spleen is a reticuloendothelial organ, it develops in the dorsal mesogastrium at around 5 weeks gestation. At this stage it has an irregular surface and migrates to the left upper quadrant over the following weeks. In most cases the irregular hillocks on the spleen surface unify, when they fail to do so, accessory spleens may develop and are found in around 20% of people. The spleen is composed of both red and white pulp. In the red pulp, blood filled venous sinuses are found. In the white pulp, reticuloendothelial cords and white lymphoid follicles are present. Blood flows into the spleen at a rate of 150ml per minute. As blood passes through the spleen, the erythrocytes have to pass through fine endothelial fenestrations, older and less deformable erythrocytes are trapped during this process and destroyed. Red cell inclusion bodies such as parasites or residual nuclear components are split off during this process which is termed pitting.\r\n\r\nBecause of these important functions, the spleen is seldom removed. Indications for splenectomy include major trauma and uncontrollable haemorrhage and the treatment of haemolytic anaemia.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a spleen has minimal long term effects on the haematologic profile. In the immediate post operative period, both leucocytosis and thrombocytosis are seen. In the longer term, the main manifestations are visible on the blood film and include visible nuclear remnants (Howell Jolly bodies), denatured haemoglobin (Heinz bodies), basophilic stippling and occasional nucleated erythrocytes.\r\n\r\nThe main risk following splenectomy is overwhelming sepsis with encapsulated organisms. Patients should receive the pneumococcal vaccine and long term antibiotic prophylaxis.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E)\r\n\r\nPotassium depletion occurs either through the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney. Chronic vomiting in itself is less prone to induce potassium loss than diarrhoea as gastric secretions contain less potassium than those in the lower GI tract. If vomiting produces a metabolic\r\n \r\nalkalosis then renal potassium wasting may occur as potassium is excreted in preference to hydrogen ions. The converse may occur in potassium depletion resulting in acid urine.\r\n\r\nHypokalemia is very commonly associated with metabolic alkalosis. This is due to 2 factors:\r\n\r\n1)\tthe common causes of metabolic alkalosis (vomiting, diuretics) directly induce H+ and K loss (via aldosterone) and thus also cause hypokalemia and 2) hypokalemia is a very important cause of metabolic alkalosis by three mechanisms. The initial effect is by causing a transcellular shift in which K leaves and H+ enters the cells, thereby raising the extracellular pH. The second effect is by causing a transcellular shift in the cells of the proximal tubules resulting in an intracellular acidosis, which promotes ammonium production and excretion. Thirdly, in the presence of hypokalemia, hydrogen secretion in the proximal and distal tubules increases. This leads to further reabsorption of HCO3-. The net effect is an increase in the net acid excretion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypokalaemia\r\nPotassium and hydrogen can be thought of as competitors. Hyperkalaemia tends to be associated with acidosis because as potassium levels rise fewer hydrogen ions can enter the cells\r\n\r\nHypokalaemia with alkalosis\r\n\r\n•\tVomiting\r\n•\tDiuretics\r\n•\tCushing's syndrome\r\n•\tConn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) Hypokalaemia with acidosis\r\n•\tDiarrhoea\r\n•\tRenal tubular acidosis\r\n•\tAcetazolamide\r\n•\tPartially treated diabetic ketoacidosis",

The absorptive function of the small bowel is such that by the time a formed stool is created, it will contain, on average 200ml water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The common secretions together with their approximate volumes are demonstrated below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regulation of these secretions is dependent upon location. In the salivary glands a complex interaction of flow rate governed by the autonomic nervous system. The exact composition of sodium and potassium is regulated by aldosterone. In the stomach hormones such as gastrin play a role and feedback is both endocrine and neurologically mediated (vagus). In the duodenum CCK is released in response to duodenal distension and this causes contraction of the gallbladder and release of bile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pancreatic secretions are affected by somatostatin. The secretions in the small bowel are affected by the osmolality of the lumenal contents. This is in part due to the tightness of cellular junctions and in this regard the jejunum is more permeable than the ileum. The practical implication of this is that if an individual has an extensive intestinal resection and a high output, proximally sited stoma then administration of hypotonic rather than isotonic solutions will result in worsening of electrolyte disturbances as electrolyte rich secretions will enter the jejunum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some individuals a colectomy or similar procedure results in formation of an end or loop ileostomy. Ileostomies typically lose between 500 and 1000ml over a 24 hour period and patients with high output ileostomies can rapidly become dehydrated.<br />\r\nIleostomy effluent typically contains 126mmol/L of sodium and 22mmol/L of potassium. Knowledge of this fluid composition should guide fluid prescribing in replacing losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/63_1(13).png\" style=\"height:95px; width:350px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In those who are admitted to intensive care mortality ranges from 6% with no organ failure to 65% in those with 4 organ failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sepsis is defined as an infection that triggers a particular Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). In 2016, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) created a task force that proposed Sepsis-3, a new definition for sepsis. The new definition excluded the establishment of SIRS criteria to define sepsis and made it more nonspecific as any life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the dysregulated host response to infection. The task force claimed that sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) has a better predictive validity for sepsis than SIRS criteria. It has better prognostic accuracy and the ability to predict in-hospital mortality. To reduce the complexity of calculating the SOFA, they introduced q SOFA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q SOFA<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n3 component assessment system with:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Systolic blood pressure below 100 mm Hg<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Highest respiratory rate exceeding 21<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lowest Glasgow coma score is under 15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the validity of q SOFA is limited in an ICU setting, it has consistently outperformed SIRS criteria in predicting organ dysfunction in a non-ICU and ER setting. The use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and aggressive therapeutic interventions in ICU limit the efficacy of q SOFA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the septic process there is marked activation of the immune system with extensive cytokine release. This may be coupled with or triggered by systemic circulation of bacterial toxins. These all cause endothelial cell damage and neutrophil adhesion. The overall hallmarks are thus those of excessive inflammation, coagulation and fibrinolytic suppression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main management issues with severe infections resulting in organ dysfunction are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prompt administration of antibiotics to cover all likely pathogens coupled with a rigorous search for the source of infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Haemodynamic stabilisation. Many patients are hypovolaemic and require aggressive<br />\r\nfluid administration. Aim for CVP 8-12 cm H2O, MAP &gt;65mmHg.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modulation of the septic response. This includes manoeuvres to counteract the changes and includes measures such as tight glycaemic control. The routine use of steroids is not advised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIn surgical patients, the main groups with septic shock include those with anastomotic leaks, abscesses and extensive superficial infections such as necrotising fasciitis. When performing surgery the aim should be to undertake the minimum necessary to restore physiology. These patients do not fare well with prolonged surgery. Definitive surgery can be more safely undertaken when physiology is restored and clotting in particular has been normalised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haemorrhagic shock<br />\r\nThe average adult blood volume comprises 7% of body weight. Thus in the 70 Kg adult this will equate to 5 litres. This changes in children (8-9% body weight) and is slightly lower in the elderly.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe table below outlines the 4 major classes of haemorrhagic shock and their associated physiological sequelae:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/67_1(12).png\" style=\"height:835px; width:350px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Whereas tumours in the speech and visual areas will typically produce early symptoms.\r\nMost paediatric CNS tumours are infratentorial Most adult CNS tumours are supratentorial\r\nDiagnosis\r\nMRI Scanning provides the best resolution.\r\nTreatment\r\nUsually surgery, even if tumour cannot be completely resected conditions such as rising ICP can be addressed  with  tumour  debulking  and  survival  and  quality  of  life  prolonged. Curative surgery can usually be undertaken with lesions such as meningiomas. Gliomas have a marked propensity to invade normal brain and resection of these lesions is nearly always incomplete.\r\n\r\n",

Its rare for EBV infections to cause massive splenomegaly.\r\nDisorders affecting the spleen\r\nOne of the commonest conditions to affect the spleen is traumatic rupture and this is addressed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSplenomegaly\r\nEnlargement of the spleen can commonly accompany a variety of haematological disorders. Of these, chronic conditions such as haemolytic anaemia and chronic leukaemia are often associated with splenomegaly. More acute haematological conditions tend not to cause massive splenic enlargement. Infections with parasites (such as malaria) and viruses such as Epstein Barr virus can cause splenomegaly and this one condition that is associated with sudden spontaneous splenic rupture. Portal hypertension can result in splenomegaly and the finding of an enlarged spleen on abdominal examination should prompt a search for the other stigmata of chronic liver disease.\r\nSplenic atrophy\r\nThis typically occurs as a result of conditions that impair the blood flow to the spleen. Division of some of the major vessels can cause shrinkage of the spleen and this is commonly seen when splenic artery aneurysms are coiled for example.\r\n",

The palmar fascia is thin over the thenar and hypothenar eminences. In contrast the palmar fascia is relatively thick. The palmar aponeurosis covers the soft tissues and overlies the flexor tendons. The apex of the palmar aponeurosis is continuous with the flexor retinaculum and the palmaris longus tendon. Distally, it forms four longitudinal digital bands that attach to the bases of the proximal phalanges, blending with the fibrous digital sheaths. A medial fibrous septum extends deeply from the medial border of the palmar aponeurosis to the 5th metacarpal. Lying medial to this are the hypothenar muscles. In a similar fashion, a lateral fibrous septum extends deeply from the lateral border of the palmar aponeurosis to the 3rd metacarpal. The thenar compartment lies lateral to this area.<br />\r\nLying between the thenar and hypothenar compartments is the central compartment.

The FDP tendons are attached to the margins of the anterior aspect of the base of the distal phalanx.<br />\r\nThe fibrous digital sheaths contain the flexor tendons and their synovial sheaths.

Although rare in the UK, chronic bladder inflammation arising from Schistosomiasis infection remains a common cause of squamous cell carcinomas, in those countries where the disease is endemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benign tumours<br />\r\nBenign tumours of the bladder including inverted urothelial papilloma and nephrogenic adenoma are uncommon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bladder malignancies<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Transitional cell carcinoma (&gt;90% of cases)<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Squamous cell carcinoma ( 1-7% -except in regions affected by schistosomiasis)<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adenocarcinoma (2%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitional cell carcinomas may arise as solitary lesions, or may be multifocal, owing to the effect of &#39;field change&#39; within the urothelium. Up to 70% of TCC&#39;s will have a papillary growth pattern. These tumours are usually superficial in location and accordingly have a better prognosis. The remaining tumours show either mixed papillary and solid growth or pure solid growths. These tumours are typically more prone to local invasion and may be of higher grade, the prognosis is therefore worse. Those with T3 disease or worse have a 30% (or higher) risk of regional or distant lymph node metastasis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TNM Staging</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/97_1(6).png\" style=\"height:497px; width:350px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A) &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is associated with transfusion of unirradiated blood in immunosuppressed patients. Transfusion associated GVHD can occur 4-30 days after a transfusion and follows a sub acute pathway. Patients may also have diarrhoea and abnormal liver function tests. Management involves steroid therapy.<br />\r\n&nbsp;Blood transfusion reactions</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAcute transfusion reactions present as adverse signs or symptoms during or within 24 hours of a blood transfusion. The most frequent reactions are fever, chills, pruritus, or urticaria, which typically resolve promptly without specific treatment or complications. Other signs occurring in temporal relationship with a blood transfusion, such as severe dyspnoea, pyrexia, or loss of consciousness may be the first indication of a more severe potentially fatal reaction.<br />\r\nThe causes of adverse reactions are multi-factorial. Immune mediated reactions, some of the most feared, occur as a result of component mismatch, the commonest cause of which is clerical error. More common, non immune mediated, complications may occur as a result of product contamination, this may be bacterial or viral.<br />\r\nTransfusion related lung injury is well recognised and there are two proposed mechanisms which underpin this. One involves the sequestration of primed neutrophils within the recipient pulmonary capillary bed. The other proposed mechanism suggests that HLA mismatches between donor neutrophils and recipient lung tissue is to blame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/99_1(8).png\" style=\"height:191px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nWater absorption in the gastrointestinal tract predominantly occurs in the small bowel (jejunum and ileum). The colon is an important site of water absorption, however, its overall contribution is relatively small. The importance of the colonic component to water absorption may increase following extensive small bowel resections.\r\n\r\nWater absorption\r\n\r\nDuring a 24 hours period the average person will ingest up to 2000ml of liquid orally. In addition a further 8000ml of fluid will enter the small bowel as gastrointestinal secretions. Intestinal water absorption is a passive process and is related to solute load. In the jejunum the active absorption of glucose and amino acids will create a concentration gradient that water will flow across. In the ileum most water is absorbed by a process of facilitated\tdiffusion\t(with\tsodium). Approximately 150ml of water enters the colon daily, most is absorbed, the colon can adapt to, and increase this amount following resection.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nHypercapnia will tend to produce cerebral vasodilation. This is of considerable importance in patients with cranial trauma as it may increase intracranial pressure.\r\n \r\nApplied neurophysiology\r\n•\tPressure within the cranium is governed by the Monroe-Kelly doctrine. This considers the skull as a closed box. Increases in mass can be accommodated by loss of CSF. Once a critical point is reached (usually 100- 120ml of CSF lost) there can be no further compensation and ICP rises sharply. The next step is that pressure will begin to equate with MAP and neuronal death will occur. Herniation will also accompany this process.\r\n•\tThe CNS can autoregulate its own blood supply. Vaso constriction and dilatation of the cerebral blood vessels is the primary method by which this occurs. Extremes of blood pressure can exceed this capacity resulting in risk of stroke. Other metabolic factors such as hypercapnia will also cause vasodilation, which is of importance in ventilating head injured patients.\r\n•\tThe brain can only metabolise glucose, when glucose levels fall, consciousness will be impaired.\r\n",

The former uses sodium- glucose co-transporters (SGLTs) in the proximal convoluted tubule. The latter achieved through facilitated and passive process through GLUT transporters.\r\n•\tUp to two thirds of filtered water is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules.\r\n•\tThis will lead to increase in urea concentration in the distal tubule allowing for its increased diffusion.\r\n•\tSubstances to be secreted into the tubules are taken up from the peritubular blood by tubular cells.\r\n•\tSolutes such as paraaminohippuric acid are cleared with a single passage through the kidneys and this is why it is used to measure renal plasma flow. Ions such as calcium and phosphate will have a tubular reabsorption that is influenced by plasma PTH levels.\r\n•\tPotassium may be both secreted and re-absorbed and is co-exchanged with sodium.\r\n\r\nLoop of Henle\r\n•\tApproximately 60 litres of water containing 9000mmol sodium enters the descending limb of the loop of Henle in 24 hours.\r\n•\tLoops from the juxtamedullary nephrons run deep into the medulla.\r\n•\tThe osmolarity of fluid changes and is greatest at the tip of the papilla.\r\n•\tThe thick ascending limb is impermeable to water, but highly permeable to sodium and chloride ions.\r\n•\tThis loss means that at the beginning of the thick ascending limb the fluid is hypo osmotic compared with adjacent interstitial fluid.\r\n \r\n•\tIn the thick ascending limb the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions occurs by both facilitated and passive diffusion pathways.\r\n•\tThe loops of Henle are co-located with vasa recta, these will have similar solute compositions to the surrounding extracellular fluid so preventing the diffusion and subsequent removal of this hypertonic fluid.\r\n•\tThe energy dependent reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the thick ascending limb helps to maintain this osmotic gradient.\r\n",

The distribution of the disease in western countries is changing towards a more proximal location (perhaps due to rising obesity).<br />\r\nPathology<br />\r\nThere is some evidence of support a stepwise progression of the disease through intestinal metaplasia progressing to atrophic gastritis and subsequent dysplasia, through to cancer.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)  \r\n\r\nHepatocellular carcinoma is commonly diagnosed with imaging and an elevated alpha fetoprotein. Biopsy may seed the tumour and should be avoided. Up to 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma arise in cirrhotic livers.\r\n Liver tumours\r\nPrimary liver tumours\r\nThe most common primary tumours are cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall metastatic disease accounts for 95% of all liver malignancies making the primary liver tumours comparatively rare.\r\nPrimary liver tumours include:\r\n•\tCholangiocarcinoma\r\n•\tHepatocellular carcinoma\r\n•\tHepatoblastoma\r\n•\tSarcomas (Rare)\r\n•\tLymphomas\r\n•\tCarcinoids (most often secondary although primary may occur)\r\n\r\nHepatocellular carcinoma\r\nThese account for the bulk of primary liver tumours (75% cases). Its worldwide incidence reflects its propensity to occur on a background of chronic inflammatory activity. Most cases arise in cirrhotic livers or those with chronic hepatitis B infection, especially where viral replication is actively occurring. In the UK it accounts for less than 5% of all cancers, although in parts of Asia its incidence is 100 per 100,000.\r\nThe majority of patients (80%) present with existing liver cirrhosis, with a mass discovered on screening\tultrasound.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\n•\tCT/ MRI (usually both) are the imaging modalities of choice\r\n•\ta-fetoprotein is elevated in almost all cases\r\n•\tBiopsy should be avoided as it seeds tumours cells through a resection plane.\r\n•\tIn cases of diagnostic doubt serial CT and αFP measurements are the preferred strategy.\r\n \r\nTreatment\r\n•\tPatients should be staged with liver MRI and chest, abdomen and pelvic CT scan.\r\n•\tThe testis should be examined in males (testicular tumours may cause raised AFP). PET CT may be used to identify occult nodal disease.\r\n•\tSurgical resection is the mainstay of treatment in operable cases. In patients with a small primary tumour in a cirrhotic liver whose primary disease process is controlled, consideration may be given to primary whole liver resection and transplantation.\r\n•\tLiver resections are an option but since most cases occur in an already diseased liver the operative risks and post-operative hepatic dysfunction are far greater than is seen following metastectomy.\r\n•\tThese tumours are not particularly chemo or radiosensitive however, both may be used in a palliative setting. Tumour ablation is a more popular strategy.\r\n\r\nSurvival\r\nPoor, overall survival is 15% at 5 years.\r\nCholangiocarcinoma\r\nThis is the second most common type of primary liver malignancy. As its name suggests these tumours arise in the bile ducts. Up to 80% of tumours arise in the extra hepatic biliary tree. Most patients present with jaundice and by this stage the majority will have disease that is not resectable. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the main risk factor. In deprived countries typhoid and liver flukes are also major risk factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\n•\tPatients will typically have an obstructive picture on liver function tests.\r\n•\tCA 19-9, CEA and CA 125 are often elevated\r\n•\tCT/ MRI and MRCP are the imaging methods of choice.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n•\tSurgical resection offers the best chance of cure. Local invasion of peri hilar tumours is a particular problem and this coupled with lobar atrophy will often contra indicate surgical resection.\r\n•\tPalliation of jaundice is important, although metallic stents should be avoided in those considered for resection.\r\n\r\nSurvival\r\nIs poor, approximately 5-10% 5 year survival.\r\n",

The ventral arises close to, or in common with, the hepatic diverticulum, and the larger, dorsal outgrowth arises slightly cranial to the ventral and extends into the mesoduodenum and dorsal mesogastrium. As a result of the differential growth in the duodenal wall, the point of attachment of the ventral outgrowth with the undivided stem of the hepatic diverticulum and the ventral mesentery are displaced around the right hand side of the duodenum to a dorsal position. As a result, the two pancreatic remnants eventually lie together and then become fused.

During a midline laparotomy it is desirable to divide the aponeurosis. This will leave the rectus sheath intact above the arcuate line and the muscles intact below it. Straying off the midline will often lead to damage to the rectus muscles, particularly below the arcuate line where they may often be in close proximity to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/149_1.png\" style=\"height:312px; width:350px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)  \r\n\r\nThe auriculotemporal nerve is closely related to the middle meningeal artery and may be damaged in this scenario. The nerve supplies sensation to the external ear and outermost part of the tympanic membrane. The angle of the jaw is innervated by C2,3 roots and would not be affected. The posterior third of the tongue is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve.\r\n\r\nMiddle meningeal artery\r\n• Middle meningeal artery is typically the third branch of the first part of the maxillary artery, one of the two terminal branches of the external carotid artery. After branching off the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa, it runs through the foramen spinosum to supply the dura mater (the outermost meninges) .\r\n• The middle meningeal artery is the largest of the three (paired) arteries which supply the meninges, the others being the anterior meningeal artery and the posterior meningeal artery.\r\n• The middle meningeal artery runs beneath the pterion. It is vulnerable to injury at this point, where the skull is thin. Rupture of the artery may give rise to an extra dural hematoma.\r\n• In the dry cranium, the middle meningeal, which runs within the dura mater surrounding the brain, makes a deep indention in the calvarium.\r\n• The middle meningeal artery is intimately associated with the auriculotemporal nerve which wraps around the artery making the two easily identifiable in the dissection of human cadavers and also easily damaged in surgery.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPneumoparotid is a very rare condition of parotid gland, often complicating with a subcutaneous emphysema, causing swelling of the parotid lodge. This pathology usually occurred due to physiological stagnation of air in parotid parenchyma. Pneumoparotid is usually associated with a retrograde insufflation of air and saliva via Stensens duct into the secondary ducts and glandular acini. Hypotonia of the buccinator muscle, hypertrophy of the masseter muscle or temporary obstruction of the Stensens duct by mucous are described as possible risk factors. The opening of the Stensens duct lies near to the second upper molar tooth bilaterally. The normal anatomy of duct preventing the reflux of air and saliva into the parotid gland are three fold:\r\nThe diameter of the duct orifice is smaller than that of the duct itself; The duct opening is covered by redundant mucosal layer, covering the duct orifice when there is increased intraoral pressure. The Stensens duct is compressed in its lateral course along the masseter muscle and its passage through the buccinator muscle with an increase in oral pressure. The buccinator is the muscle of interest here. Motor innervation is from the buccal branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). Sensory innervation is supplied by the buccal branch (one of the muscular branches) of the mandibular part of the trigeminal (cranial nerve V). Facial nerve\r\nThe facial nerve is the main nerve supplying the structures of the second embryonic branchial arch. It is predominantly an efferent nerve to the muscles of facial expression, digastric muscle and also to many glandular structures.

However, distal bypasses are at greater risk and if vein cannot be used as a conduit then the distal end of the PTFE should anastomosed to a vein cuff to minimise the risk of neo-intimal hyperplasia.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In modern venous surgery, decision making is based on venous imaging to determine which treatment modality is best. Few surgeons would proceed straight to surgery and excision without this test. A venous doppler would show incompetence of the valve but not more than that.<br />\r\n&nbsp;Vascular investigations<br />\r\nVenous disease Venous Doppler<br />\r\nThe simplest investigation for assessment of venous junctional incompetence is a Doppler assessment. This involves the patient standing and manual compression of the limb distal to the junction of interest. Flow should normally occur in one direction only. Where junctional incompetence is present reverse flow will occur and is relatively easy to identify.<br />\r\nVenograms and duplex scans<br />\r\nStructural venous information is historically obtained using a venogram. This is an invasive test and rarely required in modern clinical practice. The most helpful test is a venous duplex scan which will provide information relating to flow and vessel characteristics. Duplex is also useful in providing vein maps for bypass surgery.<br />\r\nArterial disease<br />\r\nAnkle-brachial pressure<br />\r\nThe ankle brachial pressure index measurement is an important investigation as it will allow classification of the severity of the flow compromise present. False readings may occur in those with calcified vessels such as diabetics and results in such settings should be interpreted with caution. When auscultating the vessel note should be made of the character of the signal. Monophasic signals are associated with a proximal stenosis and reduction in flow. Triphasic signals provide reassurance of a healthy vessel.<br />\r\nArterial Duplex<br />\r\nAs with the vein the duplex scan can provide a substantial amount of information about arterial patency and flow patterns. In skilled hands they can provide insight as to the state of proximal vessels that are anatomically inaccessible to duplex (e.g. Iliacs). Through assessment of distal flow patterns. It is an operator dependent test.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nConventional angiogram<br />\r\nVessel puncture and catheter angiography is the gold standard method of assessing arteries. High quality information can usually be obtained. Limitations of the technique include the risk of contrast toxicity and risks of vessel damage. Severely calcified vessels may be difficult to puncture and in this situation a remote access site (e.g. brachial) may be used. This technique is particularly useful in providing a distal arterial roadmap prior to femoro-distal bypass.<br />\r\nCT angiography<br />\r\nThese tests provide a considerable amount of structural and flow information. They require contrast and thus carry the risks associated with this. They are particularly useful in the setting of GI bleeding as they are rapidly available and can be performed by a non vascular radiologist. However, they lack the facility for endovascular intervention. In general they do not provide high enough resolution for distal arterial surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnetic resonance angiography<br />\r\nThis has the advantage of being non-invasive and not using nephrotoxic contrast. Movement artifact remains a problem in some sites and distal arterial resolution is imperfect.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It may often present as knee pain which is usually referred from the ipsilateral hip. The knee itself is normal. The hip often limits internal rotation. The diagnosis is easily missed. X-rays will show displacement of the femoral epiphysis and the degree of its displacement may be calculated using the Southwick angle. Treatment is directed at preventing further slippage which may result in avascular necrosis of the femoral head.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Bankart lesion is an injury of the anterior (inferior) glenoid labrum of the shoulder due to anterior shoulder dislocation. When this happens, a pocket at the front of the glenoid forms that allows the humeral head to dislocate into it.<br />\r\nAnterior dislocations are the most common. When recurrent, a Bankart lesion is the most common underlying abnormality. This is usually visualised by CT and MRI scanning and often repaired arthroscopically.<br />\r\n&nbsp;Shoulder disorders<br />\r\nShoulder fractures and dislocations Fractures<br />\r\nProximal humerus<br />\r\nBackground<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third most common fragility fracture in the elderly.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Results from low energy fall in predominantly elderly females, or from high energy trauma in young males.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can be associated with nerve injury (commonly axillary), and fracture-dislocation of the humeral head. Detailed neurological assessment is essential for all upper limb injuries.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnatomy Osteology<br />\r\nConsists of articular head, greater tuberosity, lesser tuberosity, metaphysis and diaphysis. Between the articular head and the tuberosities is the anatomical neck (previous physis). Between the tuberosities and the metaphysis is the surgical neck.<br />\r\nThe supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles attach to the greater tuberosity. The subscapularis muscle attaches to the lesser tuberosity.<br />\r\nVascular Supply<br />\r\nHumeral head is supplied by the anterior and posterior humeral circumflex arteries. Anatomical neck fractures are at greatest risk of osteonecrosis.<br />\r\nImaging<br />\r\nImaging aims to both delineate the fracture pattern, and confirm/exlude the presence of an associated dislocation.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Radiographs - True anteroposterior (AP), axillary lateral and/or scapula Y view.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;CT - indicated to better define intra-articular involvement and to aid pre-operative planning. MRI is not useful for fracture imaging.<br />\r\nClassification<br />\r\nDescription of the fracture is often more useful than classification. Particular attention should be paid to humeral alignment, fracture displacement, and greater tuberosity position (rotator cuff will pull the GT supero-posterioly, which can cause impingement problems with malunion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neer Classification: Most commonly used. Describes fracture as 2,3,or 4 part depending upon the number main fragments. Also comments on the degree of displacement. Fragments:<br />\r\n-greater tuberosity<br />\r\n-lesser tuberosity<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;articular surface<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shaft<br />\r\nDisplacement: &gt;1cm or angulation &gt;45 degrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment<br />\r\nThe vast majority of proximal humeral fractures are minimally displaced, and therefore can be managed conservatively. This involves immobilisation in a polysling, and progressive mobilisation. Pendular exercise can commence at 14 days, and active abduction from 4-6 weeks.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIrreducible fracture dislocation is an indication for operative management. Other indications include large displacement, younger patient, head splitting (intra-articular fractures). However, the recent PROFHER trial (1) has suggested no benefit to operative intervention on patient outcome (it must be applied cautiously as majority of patients were elderly with extraarticular fractures). Options available for surgical management include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nORIF&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most commonly used. Plate and screw fixation. Can reconstruct complex fractures.<br />\r\nIntramedullary nail&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suitable for extra-articular configuration, predominantly surgical neck +/- GT fractures.<br />\r\nHemiarthroplasty&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Used for un-reconstructable fractures in the older patient who has good glenoid quality.<br />\r\nTotal shoulder arthroplasty&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unconstructable fractures where high functioning shoulder is required (hemiarthroplasty will cause glenoid erosion)<br />\r\nReverse&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shoulder arthroplasty&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Total shoulder arthroplasty that provides better functional outcome than conventional total shoulder replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scapula Background<br />\r\nUncommon fractures usually associated with high energy trauma. Most commonly involve scapula body or spine (50%), glenoid fossa and glenoid neck. Important to exclude associated life threatening injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imaging<br />\r\nPlain radiographs should include true anteroposterior (AP), axillary lateral and/or scapula Y view. CT scanning is useful for defining intra-articular involvement, displacement and for three dimensional reconstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Classification<br />\r\nBased on the location of the fracture (coracoid, acromion, glenoid neck, glenoid fossa, scapula body). Beware of ipsilateral glenoid neck and clavicle fracture -floating shoulder - where limb is effectively dissociated from axial skeleton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment<br />\r\nThe vast majority of scapula fractures are amenable to conservative management, consisting of sling immobilisation for two weeks followed by early rehabilitation. Floating shoulder will usually require fixation, and consideration of surgery should also be given to intra-articular and displaced/angulated glenoid fractures.<br />\r\nDislocations<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nTypes<br />\r\nDislocations around the shoulder joint include glenohumeral dislocation, acromioclavicular joint disruption and sternoclavicular dislocation. Only glenohumeral dislocation will be covered here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glenohumeral dislocation<br />\r\nDiagnosis, classification and management are covered here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Background<br />\r\nShoulder dislocation is commonly seen in A&amp;E. It has a high recurrence rate that is as high as 80% in teenagers. Initial management requires emergent reduction to prevent lasting chondral damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early assessment and management<br />\r\nUsually a traumatic cause (multi-directional instability in frequent dislocations requires discussion with orthopaedics and is not covered here). Careful history, examination and documentation of neurovascular status of the limb, in particular the axillary nerve (regimental badge sensation). This should be re-assessed post manipulation. Early radiographs to confirm direction of dislocation.<br />\r\nInitial management consists of emergent closed reduction under under entanox and analgesia, but often requires conscious sedation. Arm should then be immobilised in a polysling, and XR to confirm relocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imaging - True anteroposterior (AP), axillary lateral and/or scapula Y view.

More common in high energy trauma and elderly. Should be discussed with orthopaedics prior to any attempted reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rotator Cuff Disease<br />\r\nRotator cuff disease is a spectrum of conditions that ranges from subacromial impingement to rotator cuff tears and eventually to rotator cuff arthropathy (arthritis).<br />\r\nAnatomy<br />\r\nThe rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that are important in shoulder movements, and maintenance of glenohumeral stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muscle&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scapular attachment&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Humeral attachment&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Action&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Innervation<br />\r\nSupraspinatus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Supraspinatus fossa&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Superior&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;facet&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;greater tuberosity&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Initiation of abduction of humerus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suprascapular nerve<br />\r\nInfraspinatus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Infraspinatus fossa&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Posterior&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;facet&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;greater tuberosity&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;External rotation of humerus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suprascapular nerve<br />\r\nTeres Minor&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lateral border&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inferior&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;facet&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;greater tuberosity&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;External rotation of humerus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Axillary Nerve<br />\r\nSubscapularis&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Subscapular fossa&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lesser tuberosity&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Internal rotation of humerus&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upper and lower subscapular nerve</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The inferior rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) balance the superior pull of the deltoid. Injury/tear results in upward migration of the humeral head on the glenoid (can be seen on AP radiograph).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Likewise, the anterior muscles (subscapularis) are balanced with the posterior muscles (infraspinatus, teres minor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subacromial Impingement<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most common cause of shoulder pain, which results from impingement of the superior cuff on the undersurface of the acromion, and an inflammatory bursitis.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Associated with certain types of acromial morphology (Bigliani classification).<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Presents as insidious pain which is exacerbated by overhead activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rotator Cuff Tear<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Often presents as an acute event on the background of chronic subacromial impingement in the older patient, but can present as an avulsion injury in younger patients.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Majority of tears are to the superior cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor), though a tear to subscapularis is associated with subcoracoid impingement.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tears present as pain and weakness when using the muscles in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rotator Cuff Arthropathy<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Defined as shoulder arthritis in the setting of rotator cuff dysfunction. Results from superior migration due to the loss of rotator cuff function and integrity. Unopposed deltoid pulls the humeral head superiorly.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Associated with massive chronic cuff tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nImaging</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plain radiographs<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AP of the shoulder may show superior migration of the humerus with a cuff tear, and features of arthritis with arthropathy. Other causes of pain may also be identified (e.g. calcific tendonitis/fracture)<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Outlet view is useful for defining the acromial morphology</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USS<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allows dynamic imaging of the cuff, and is inexpensive. However, it is very user dependent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MRI<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Best imaging modality for cuff pathology.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also allows imaging of the rest of the shoulder. When intra-articular pathology is suspected, can be combined with an arthrogram for improved sensitivity and specificity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment<br />\r\nSubacromial impingement<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Physiotherapy, oral anti-inflammatory medication<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Subacromial steroid injection can settle inflammation<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arthroscopic subacromial decompression by shaving away the undersurface of the acromion, more space is created for the rotator cuff. Cuff integrity is assessed also at time of surgery, and can be repaired if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rotator cuff tear<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When considering repair of a cuff tear, the age and activity of the patient, the nature of the tear (degenerative vs. acute traumatic), and the size and retraction of the tear should be considered when making a surgical plan.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mild tears or tears in the elderly can be managed conservatively, as outlined above.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moderate tears can be repaired arthroscopically. Massive or retracted tears will often require an open repair (occasionally with a tendon transfer). Subacromial decompression is performed at the same time to reduce impingement, symptoms and recurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calcific tendonitis<br />\r\nCalcific tendonitis involves calcific deposits within tendons anywhere in the body, but most commonly in the rotator cuff (specifically the supraspinatus tendon). When present in the shoulder, it is associated with subacromial impingement and pain.<br />\r\nPathology<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More common in women aged 30-60 years.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Association with diabetes and hypothyroidism There are three stages of calcification<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Formative phase characterized by calcific deposits<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resting phase deposit is stable, but presents with impingement problems<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resorptive phase phagocytic resorption. Most painful stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presentation<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Similar in presentation to subacromial impingement, with pain especially with over head activities. Atraumatic in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imaging<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plain radiographs show calcification of the rotator cuff, usually within 1.5cm of its insertion on the humerus. Supraspinatus outlet views can show level of impingment. Further imaging is rarely needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Non-operative NSAIDS, steroid injection (controversial, but practiced) and physiotherapy. Approximately 75% will resolve by 6 months with conservative management.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultrasound guided or surgical needle barbotage can break down deposits and resolve symptoms.

The fact that callus is present suggests that immobilisation is unlikely to be beneficial. Freibergs disease is an anterior metatarsalgia affecting the head of the second metarsal, it typically occurs in the pubertal growth spurt. The initial injury was thought to be due to stress microfractures at the growth plate. The key feature in the history which distinguishes the injury as being stress fracture is the radiology. In Freibergs disease the x-ray changes include; joint space widening, formation of bony spurs, sclerosis and flattening of the metatarsal head.</p>\r\n",

Mitral stenosis is becoming less common in the UK population, however should be considered in women from countries where there is a higher incidence of rheumatic heart disease. Mitral stenosis causes a mid diastolic murmur which may be difficult to auscultate unless the patient is placed into the left lateral position. These patients are at risk of atrial fibrillation (up to 40%), which can also contribute to rapid decompensation such as pulmonary oedema (hence cxr &#39;whiteout&#39; of lungs).
