Uraemia is a condition in which there is a buildup of urea and other nitrogenous wastes in the blood, leading to the production of acidic metabolites. Paraldehyde is a medication used to treat alcohol withdrawal, but it can cause metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a complication of diabetes in which there is an accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood, leading to metabolic acidosis. Ethylene glycol, which is found in antifreeze, can be metabolized into acidic metabolites that can cause metabolic acidosis. Acetazolamide, on the other hand, is a medication that works by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that is involved in the production of bicarbonate in the body. As a result, acetazolamide can cause a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate, but it does not cause an increased anion gap acidosis.",

It is also involved in the transport and stabilization of factor VIII\r\n\r\n• There are 7 subtypes of von Willebrand disease. The commonest is type I (autosomal dominant) which accounts for 80% of cases, type 2vWD (autosomal dominant or recessive) accounts for 15% of cases\r\n\r\n• There is a significant spectrum of severity ranging from spontaneous bleeding and epistaxis through to troublesome excessive bleeding following minor procedures\r\n\r\n• The test that is most commonly used are von willebrand factor assays\r\n\r\n• Treatments include administration of tranexamic acid for minor cases undergoing minor procedures. More significant bleeding or more significant procedures respond well to DDAVP. This is most effective in type I, less effective in type 2 and contraindicated in type 2B. Patients with type 3 disease do not respond to DDAVP as they lack the ability to secrete vWF\r\n\r\n• Individuals who cannot have DDAVP or in whom it is contra indicated usually receive factor VIII concentrates containing vWF",

Vasopressin is less likely to be disease specific and at most would have a vasoconstrictor approach which is likely to be of brief duration.\r\nvon Willebrands disease\r\n\r\n- Most common inherited bleeding disorder\r\n\r\n• All vWD is caused by mutations in the gene for von Willebrand factor. von Willebrand factor is an adhesive glycoprotein that is secreted by endothelium and megakaryocytes\r\n\r\n• von Willebrand factor promotes platelet adhesion to damaged endothelium and other platelets. It is also involved in the transport and stabilization of factor VIII\r\n\r\n• There are 7 subtypes of von Willebrand disease. The commonest is type I (autosomal dominant) which accounts for 80% of cases, type 2vWD (autosomal dominant or recessive) accounts for 15% of cases\r\n\r\n• There is a significant spectrum of severity ranging from spontaneous bleeding and epistaxis through to troublesome excessive bleeding following minor procedures\r\n\r\n• The test that is most commonly used are von willebrand factor assays\r\n\r\n• Treatments include administration of tranexamic acid for minor cases undergoing minor procedures. More significant bleeding or more significant procedures respond well to DDAVP. This is most effective in type I, less effective in type 2 and contraindicated in type 2B. Patients with type 3 disease do not respond to DDAVP as they lack the ability to secrete vWF\r\n\r\n• Individuals who cannot have DDAVP or in whom it is contra indicated usually receive factor VIII concentrates containing vWF",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nThe necrosis of a tumour may be suggestive of a high grade tumour which has out grown its blood supply. However, the grading of breast cancer which classically follows the Bloom -Richardson grading model will tend to favor nuclear appearances (which include mitoses, coarse chromatin and pleomorphism). Tubule formation is an important marker of the degree of differentiation with formation of tubular structures being associated with well differentiated tumours.\r\n\r\nTumour grading\r\nTumours may be graded according to their degree of differentiation, mitotic activity and other features. Grade 1 tumours are the most differentiated and grade 3 or 4 the least. The assessment is subjective, in most cases high grade equates to poor prognosis, or at least rapid growth.\r\nTumours of glandular epithelium will tend to arrange themselves into acinar type structures containing a central lumen. Well differentiated tumours may show excellent acinar formation and poorly differentiated tumours simply clumps of cells around a desmoplastic stroma. Sometimes tumours demonstrate mucous production without evidence of acinar formation. Since mucous production is evidence of a glandular function such tumours are often termed mucinous adenocarcinoma.\r\n\r\nSquamous cell tumours will typically produce structures resembling epithelial cell components. Well differentiated tumours may also produce keratin (depending upon tissue of origin).",

However, the ventral pancreas rotates to eventually fuse with the dorsal. Sometimes this can result in an annular pancreas and some patients can develop obstruction as a result.\r\n\r\nPancreatic embryology\r\nThe pancreas develops from a ventral and dorsal entodermal outgrowth from the duodenum. The ventral arises close to, or in common with, the hepatic diverticulum, and the larger, dorsal outgrowth arises slightly cranial to the ventral and extends into the mesoduodenum and dorsal mesogastrium. As a result of the differential growth in the duodenal wall, the point of attachment of the ventral outgrowth with the undivided stem of the hepatic diverticulum and the ventral mesentery are displaced around the right hand side of the duodenum to a dorsal position. As a result, the two pancreatic remnants eventually lie together and then become fused. In this process the ventral rudiment forms the uncinate process and the adjacent region of the head, while the dorsal forms the anterior part of the head, the body and the tail of the pancreas.\r\n\r\nAt the time of fusion, the ducts become joined. This occurs in a manner that results in the dorsal remnant being drained by the duct of the ventral remnant, this composite duct being named the pancreatic duct.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\n5 alpha reductase inhibitors reduce the risk of urinary retention.\r\n\r\nIn the PLESS study, data show a reduction in the risk of urinary retention although the absolute risk reduction was small.\r\n\r\nFinasteride is a medication used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by reducing the size of the prostate gland. It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is a hormone that contributes to the growth of the prostate gland. Alfuzosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin are medications that belong to a class of drugs called alpha-blockers. These medications work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate gland and bladder neck, which can improve urine flow and decrease urinary symptoms. While alpha-blockers are effective in improving urinary symptoms associated with BPH, they do not reduce the size of the prostate gland and are not associated with a reduction in the risk of urinary retention. Prazosin is an alpha-blocker that is used to treat high blood pressure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is not typically used to treat urinary symptoms associated with BPH\r\n",

The lesion relatively short and reasonable distal vessel runoff. Longer lesions may be amenable to sub-intimal angioplasty.\r\nSurgery\r\nSurgery will be undertaken where attempts at angioplasty have either failed or are unsuitable. Bypass essentially involves bypassing the affected arterial segment by utilising a graft to run from above the disease to below the disease. As with angioplasty good runoff improves the outcome.\r\n \r\nSome key concepts with bypass surgery\r\nSuperficial femoral artery occlusion to the above knee popliteal\r\nIn the ideal scenario, vein (either in situ or reversed LSV) would be used as a conduit. However, prosthetic material has reasonable 5 year patency rates and some would advocate using this in preference to vein so that vein can be used for other procedures in the future. In general terms either technique is usually associated with an excellent outcome (if run off satisfactory).\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n• Artery dissected out, IV heparin 3,000 units given and then the vessels are cross clamped\r\n• Longitudinal arteriotomy\r\n• Graft cut to size and tunneled to arteriotomy sites\r\n• Anastomosis to femoral artery usually with 5/0 'double ended' Prolene suture\r\n• Distal anastomosis usually using 6/0 'double ended' Prolene\r\n\r\nDistal disease\r\n• Femoro-distal bypass surgery takes longer to perform, is more technically challenging and has higher failure rates.\r\n• In elderly diabetic patients with poor runoff a primary amputation may well be a safer and more effective option. There is no point in embarking on this type of surgery in patients who are wheelchair bound.\r\n• In femorodistal bypasses vein gives superior outcomes to PTFE.\r\n\r\nRules\r\n• Vein mapping 1st to see whether there is suitable vein (the preferred conduit). Sub intimal hyperplasia occurs early when PTFE is used for the distal anastomosis and will lead to early graft occlusion and failure.\r\n• Essential operative procedure as for above knee fem-pop.\r\n• If there is insufficient vein for the entire conduit then vein can be attached to the end of the PTFE graft and then used for the distal anastomosis. This type of 'vein boot' is technically referred to as a Miller Cuff and is associated with better patency rates than PTFE alone.\r\n• Remember the more distal the arterial anastomosis the lower the success rate\r\n",

Electricity can flow from the tip of the device into the patient. The earth electrode is located some distance away. The relatively narrow tip of the diathermy device produces local heat and this can be used to vaporise and fulgurate tissues. The current can be adjusted in terms of frequency so that different actions can be effected. In cutting mode sufficient power is applied to the tissues to vaporise their water content. In coagulation mode the power level is reduced so that a coagulum is formed instead. Some diathermy machines can utilise a setting known as blend that alternates cutting and coagulation functions, these tend to be used during procedures such as colonoscopic polypectomy.\r\n\r\nBipolar\r\nThe electric current flows from one electrode to another however, both electrodes are usually contained within the same device e.g. a pair of forceps. The result is that heating is localised to the area between the two electrodes and surrounding tissue damage is minimised.\r\n\r\nUltrasound based devices\r\nThese include CUSA and Harmonic scalpel. They generate high frequency oscillations that seal and coagulate tissues. They have different energy settings that allow them to dissect and simultaneously seal vessels if required. The CUSA device leaves vessels intact that may then be divided.\r\n \r\nLigasure device\r\nDelivers tailored energy levels to allow simultaneous haemostasis and dissection. The device senses the impedance of the tissues and tailors energy levels accordingly.\r\nHazards of diathermy\r\n• Inadvertent patient burn. This may result of careless handling of the device or in the case of monopolar devices forgetting to apply a return electrode plate, In this situation patients may develop a contact burn when electricity flows to earth\r\n• Explosion or fire. This may occur when volatile anaesthetic gases or skin preparation fluid have been used\r\n",
