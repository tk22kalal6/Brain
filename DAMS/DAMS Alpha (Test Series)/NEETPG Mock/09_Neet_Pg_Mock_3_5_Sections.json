There are several studies (although relatively low grade) suggesting that fuoride treatment may slow the progression of sensorineural hearing loss, although the dosage and treatment duration is very heterogenous in these studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More recently, bisphosphonates, particularly third-generation bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate or risedronate, have been suggested to be useful in stabilising hearing as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing rehabilitation options always include standard hearing aids.

One possibility is the occurrence of a re-entry loop of depolarization within the AV node (AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia). In this instance, a wave of depolarization originating in the atria is split within the node and a portion flows retrogradely in the node until it encounters tissue outside its refractory period. The circuit then becomes self-propagating. Because the electrical impulse arises within the AV node it spreads through the ventricles following the normal conducting pathway. Consequently, the QRS complexes appear normal. In contrast, the tachycardia of ventricular origin would be due to an ectopic pacemaker developing within the ventricles and likely be characterized by an abnormally wide QRS complex. The origin of the electrical impulse within the AV node, rather than the SA node, alters the relationship between the P wave and the QRS complex. For this patient, the ventricles have completely depolarized before the wave of depolarization retrogradely excites the atria. Consequently, the QRS complex precedes the P wave in the electrocardiogram.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area of carotid arteries near the bifurcation is massaged, stimulating the stretch receptors in the carotid sinus. The increase in vagal activity slows the conduction in the atrioventricular node, breaking the abnormal conduction circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In addition, CO2 drive in the central nervous system is also attenuated by HCO3 transport into the cerebrospinal fluid. These compensations blunt or completely remove the CO2 stimulation of ventilation. As the disease progresses, arterial Po2 levels fall below 60 mm Hg. Hypoxia, sensed by the arterial chemoreceptors- aortic and carotid body chemoreceptors but not the central chemoreceptors, become the primary ventilatory drive.

When fetal vessels cross the internal os (vasa previa), rupture of membranes may be accompanied by rupture of a fetal vessel leading to fetal exsanguination. Vasa previa does not increase the risk for placenta accreta or amniotic fluid embolism. With velamentous insertion of the cord, the umbilical vessels separate in the membranes at a distance from the placental margin which they reach surrounded only by amnion. Such insertion occurs in about 1% of singleton gestations but is quite common in multiple pregnancies. Fetal malformations are more common with velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord. An increased risk of premature rupture of membranes and of torsion of the umbilical cord has not been described in association with velamentous insertion of the cord.",

The prevalence of lymph node disease correlates with the stage of malignancy. Primary node groups involved in the spread of cervical cancer include the paracervical, parametrial, obturator, hypogastric, external iliac, and sacral nodes, essentially in that order. Less commonly, there is involvement in the common iliac, inguinal, and para-aortic nodes. In stage I, the pelvic nodes are positive in approximately 15% of cases and the para-aortic nodes in 6%. In stage II, pelvic nodes are positive in 28% of cases and para-aortic nodes in 16%. In stage III, pelvic nodes are positive in 47% of cases and para-aortic nodes in 28%.",

The Pap smear is a cytological screening test for cervical neoplasm. In patients with an HGSIL Pap, there is no indication for repeating the smear or ordering HPV testing as the cytological test suggests the presence of cervical neoplasia. Repeating a Pap could produce a false-negative result, which can lead to a delay in treatment of the patient. Random cervical biopsies are not indicated because the actual abnormal tissue may be missed. The indications for a cone biopsy would be (1) unsatisfactory colpos copic examination (ie, the entire transformation zone cannot be seen); (2) a colpos copically directed cervical biopsy that indicates the possibility of invasive disease; (3) neoplasm in the endocervix; or (4) cells seen on cervical biopsy that do not adequately explain the cells seen on cytologic examination (ie, the Pap).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nBacterial vaginosis is a condition in which there is an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina, displacing the normal lactobacillus. Women with this type of vaginitis complain of an unpleasant vaginal odor that is described as musky or fishy and a thin, gray-white vaginal dis charge. Vulvar irritation and pruritus are rarely present. To confirm the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a wet smear is done. To perform a wet smear, saline is mixed with the vaginal discharge and clue cells are identified. Clue cells are vaginal epithelial cells with clusters of bacteria adherent to their surfaces. In addition, a whiff test can be performed by mixing potassium hydroxide with the vaginal dis charge. In cases of bacterial vaginosis, an amine-like (ie, fishlike) odor will be detected. The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis is metronidazole (Flagyl) 500 mg given twice daily for 7 days. Pregnant women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) should be treated the same way as nonpregnant women with BV. In cases of a normal or physiologic discharge, vaginal secretions are white and odorless. In addition, normal vaginal secretions do not adhere to the vaginal side walls.",

Women should record their BBT for evidence of ovulation. In addition, serial serum progesterone levels may be helpful to confirm ovulation. Serum progesterone values should be obtained 7 days after ovulation, around day 21, and may also be helpful in evaluating inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy may also provide valuable information regarding the status of the luteal phase.

Therefore, augmentation with Pitocin is not indicated. The patient’s diagnosis is secondary arrest of labor, which requires cesarean section. In the active phase of labor, a multiparous patient should undergo dilation of the cervix at a rate of at least 1.5 cm/h if uterine contractions are adequate. There is no indication for the use of vacuum or forceps in this patient because the patient’s cervix is not completely dilated and the head is unengaged. Assisted vaginal delivery with vacuum or forceps is indicated when the patient is completely dilated, to augment maternal pushing when maternal expulsive efforts are insufficient to deliver the fetus.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refeeding syndrome is a condition in which there are severe electrolyte and fluid shifts associated with metabolic abnormalities in malnourished patients undergoing refeeding, weather orally, enterally, or parenterally. It is thought to arise as a result of rapid hormonal changes which occur in response to a regime rich in carbohydrate and amino acids and as a consequence of depletion of the substrates required for glucose metabolism. The cardinal features include hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, fluid shifts, and change in glucose, fat, and protein metabolism. Patients with refeeding syndrome may present with symptoms such as ataxia paralysis, coma, cardiac dysrhythmias, anaemia, respiratory and cardiac failure, acute tubular necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, ileus and confusion. Therefore, it is important to identify susceptible patients early, monitor electrolytes daily, and correct deficiencies by oral or parenteral routes.</p>\r\n",

Patient is likely experiencing TUR syndrome; thus rapid termination is needed. The height of the irrigating fluid above the patient should be carefully chosen. Investigators have demonstrated that the ideal height of the fluid was 60 cm above the patient. This appears to be the minimal height to maintain good vision but also not lead to excessive systemic fluid absorption. Increasing the height 10 cm above this leads to increased pressure in the prostatic fossa and a greater than twofold increase in systemic fluid absorption. Diagnosis of this condition is made by assessment of neurologic status and comparison to laboratory values. Serum sodium should be obtained in long, large resections postoperatively (or intraoperatively if concern exists). A serum sodium of less than 120 mEq/L indicates a significant dilution and may lead to coma or seizures. Transient visual disturbances or blindness indicate central nervous system (CNS) toxicity and are obviously very distressing to all the parties involved. If profound central nervous symptoms are noted, judicious administration of hypertonic saline should be started and formulas exist to help guide this resuscitation as overly rapid correction of hyponatremia may lead to a demyelinating lesion of the brain (central pontine myelinolysis).</p>\r\n",

However, these findings can overlap with reflux disease. In many instances, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy resolves eosinophilia on histopathology, and improves symptoms. Up to 50 percent of EoE patients will have normalization of biopsies on PPI. Endoscopy is repeated after eight weeks of bid proton pump inhibitor therapy to evaluate for persisting eosinophilia; if present, swallowed budesonide or fluticasone, or an elimination diet are options.&nbsp; Cromolyn sodium and montelukast have not been demonstrated to consistently improve esophageal eosinophilia or esophageal symptoms. Empiric esophageal dilation is not recommended in eosinophilic esophagitis, but dominant esophageal strictures with persisting dysphagia may benefit from targeted dilation.</p>\r\n",

The classic appearance consists of doll-like facies with chubby cheeks, thin extremities, distended abdomen, and short stature. In addition to hypoglycemia, children with GSDI have lactic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperuricemia. The 2 subtypes, GSDIb and GSDIa, are clinically difficult to distinguish. Untreated GSDIb patients have recurrent bacterial infections and mucosal ulcerations of the intestinal and oral regions caused by impaired monocyte and neutrophil function. Untreated children with either subtype will experience poor growth, pubertal delays, gout, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, hepatic adenomas, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, and polycystic ovaries. Children who are treated are likely to have normal growth, and most will survive into adulthood.</p>\r\n",

Because of the patient&#39;s severe dehydration, urgent fluid resuscitation is indicated prior to the availability of serum chemistry results. Fluid management in patients with ARF is aimed at maintaining tissue perfusion (as evaluated by heart rate, blood pressure, and capillary refill time) and preventing volume overload (strict monitoring of input and output, respiratory rate, and edema).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintenance of effective circulatory volume is one of the most important steps in the treatment and prevention of ARF. Fluid management in children with ARF is guided by the patient&#39;s underlying volume status and the type of renal failure (oliguric or nonoliguric). Fluid resuscitation includes both bolus and maintenance intravenous (IV) fluids. The history of volume loss and clinical features of hypovolemic shock in the patient in this vignette require immediate improvement in circulating volume. Rapid IV fluid bolus with 0.9% normal saline at 20 mL/kg (440 mL for the 22-kg patient in this vignette) within 30 minutes is indicated for fluid resuscitation to improve perfusion. A 5% albumin bolus is appropriate resuscitation fluid in patients with severe hypoalbuminemia and hypovolemic shock. In patients with suspected renal failure and absence of hypovolemic shock, a smaller fluid bolus of 5 to 10 mL/kg could be administered, followed by reassessment of clinical features for repeat infusions.</p>\r\n",

A properly collected urine specimen for analysis and culture prior to starting antibiotics is paramount to diagnosing and treating UTI. A urine specimen should be collected by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) and sent for urinalysis and culture before an antibiotic is started in a febrile infant or young child with no apparent source of infection. Urine specimens collected for culture by catheterization have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99% for diagnosing UTI. Suprapubic aspiration has limited risks, but it requires expertise and experience; the successful collection rates range from 23% to 90%. Ultrasonographic guidance increases the successful collection rates of SPA. In boys with severe phimosis or girls with tight labial adhesions, SPA is preferred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urine culture of specimens collected by a bag applied to the perineum have an unacceptably high false-positive rate (88%) and provide clinically relevant information only when they yield negative results. For bagged urine specimens from febrile boys, the rate of false-positive results is 95% in uncircumcised boys and 99% for circumcised boys. In view of the extremely high false-positive rate, antimicrobial therapy should not be initiated based on positive urinalysis results from bagged urine specimens.</p>\r\n",

The vaccine indicated for this patient, who is fully vaccinated and is at risk of invasive pneumococcal infection, is 1 dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are over 90 serotypes of puenmococcus. Available vaccines target the serotypes most likely to cause invasive infections in humans. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) includes 13 serotypes whereas the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) includes 23 pneumococcal serotypes (12 serotypes included in PCV 13 plus an additional 11 serotypes).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conjugated pneumococcal vaccines are indicated in healthy infants and children between the ages of 2 and 59 months as part of a 4-dose series that is typically administered at 2, 4. 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. For children with chronic medical conditions that place them at risk of pneumococcal infection, catch-up immunization is recommended through 71 months of age. For at-risk individuals who are 6 to 18 years of age and have not previously received PCV13, one dose of PCV13 is recommended, followed by PPSV23.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration licensed PPSV23 for use in children who are 2 years of age or older, and PPSV23 is indicated for individuals at high risk of invasive pneumococcal infections. Individuals who are at risk but otherwise immunocompetent include individuals with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and cochlear implants. It is recommended that the at-risk inununocompetent group receives 1 lifetime dose of PPSV23. Individuals who have asplenia or other inununocompromising conditions including HIV should receive 2 doses of PPSV23. The interval between doses is 5&#39; years, except for individuals with sickle cell anemia for whom the interval is 3 years. For at-risk individuals who are 6 to 18 years of age and have not previously received pneumococcal vaccination, PPSV23 should be administered 8 weeks after PCV13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the patient in this vignette is up-to-date on vaccinations at 24 months of age, lie has completed the 4-dose series of conjugated pneumococcal vaccine and does not require any further doses. For individuals at risk of invasive pneumococcal infections who are otherwise immunocompetent, only 1 dose of polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is recommended.</p>\r\n",

These amino acids, termed nonessential, include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine. The amino acids that must be supplied in the diet are termed essential; these include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Phenylalanine undergoes hydroxylation to tyrosine, catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is noteworthy that tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in individuals lacking this enzyme. The hyper phenylalaninemias, which include phenylketonuria, result from impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and are also associated with mental retardation. This condition is associated with increased phenylalanine in blood and increased phenylalanine and its by-products (e.g., phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate, and  phenyllactate) in urine.",
