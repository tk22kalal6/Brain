This volume of air represents the point at which the outward recoil of the chest wall is in equilibrium with the inward elastic recoil of the lungs. In emphysema due to air trapping and damage to elastic fibres the elastic recoil of the lungs is reduced so the FRC will be higher. All of the other conditions can cause restrictive defect which would lead to a reduction in the FRC.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morphology of extradural haematomas is best understood by reviewing their relationship to the bone and dura. An extradural haematoma is actually a subperiosteal haematoma located on the inside of the skull, between inner table of the skull and parietal layer of the dura mater (which is the periosteum). As a result, EDHs are usually limited in their extent by the cranial sutures, as the periosteum crosses through the suture continuous with the outer periosteal layer. This is, therefore, helpful in distinguishing EDHs from subdural haematomas, which are not limited by sutures.</p>\r\n",

It is more severe in upper lung zones of patients on pentamidine aerosol prophylaxis. Patients may have pneumatoceles that typically develop in the periphery of upper lobes. Curiously, pneumatoceles are only seen in those with HIV infection.Pneumocystic pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic fungal infection that often affects individuals with T-cell immunodeficiency. The causative organism has been renamed Pneumocystis jiroveci. The most common imaging manifestation is ground-glass opacities that are perihilar or diffuse. If untreated, PCP evolves into a consolidative appearance. Appropriately treated PCP (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or intravenous pentamidine) carries a very good prognosis with a 90% survival rate.</p>\r\n",

In contrast, tiotropium shows some selectivity for M1 and M3 receptors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oxybutynin, the oldest of the antimuscarinics currently used to treat overactive bladder disorders, is associated with a high incidence of antimuscarinic side effects, particularly xerostomia. In an attempt to increase patient acceptance, oxybutynin is marketed as a transdermal system that is associated with a lower incidence of side effects than the oral immediate- and extended-release formulations; a topical gel formulation of oxybutynin also appears to offer a more favorable side-effect profile. Because of the extensive metabolism of oral oxybutynin by enteric and hepatic CYP3A4, higher doses are used in oral than transdermal administration; the dose may need to be reduced in patients taking drugs that inhibit CYP3A4.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diagnostic evaluation of an infertile couple should be thorough and completed as rapidly as possible. The primary diagnostic steps in the workup of the infertile couple include (1) documentation of ovulation by measurement of basal body temperature (BBT) or mid&ndash;luteal phase serum progesterone; (2) semen analysis; (3) postcoital test; (4) hysterosalpingogram; and (5) endometrial biopsy. Women should record their BBT for evidence of ovulation. In addition, serial serum progesterone levels may be helpful to confirm ovulation. Serum progesterone values should be obtained 7 days after ovulation and may also be helpful in evaluating inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy may also provide valuable information regarding the status of the luteal phase. The biopsy is obtained 12 days after the thermogenic shift, or 2 to 3 days before the expected onset of menses, on about day 26 of a 28-day cycle. A postcoital test is an in vivo test that evaluates the interaction of sperm and cervical mucus. It is performed during the periovulatory period up to 12 h after coitus. The cervical mucus is obtained, and its quantity and quality as well as its interaction with the sperm are evaluated. The hysterosalpingogram is performed in the midfollicular phase in order to evaluate the fallopian tubes and the contour of the uterine cavity; it should not be done while the patient is menstruating or after ovulation has occurred. Although gonadotropin levels are not routinely evaluated, they should be obtained in the early follicular phase when testing is indicated, e.g., in cases where there is a history of oligoovulation.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several available tests for the assessment of ovarian reserve. Traditionally, the CCCT was used to assess ovarian reserve. This involves administration of 100 mg of Clomid on days 5 to 9 of the cycle. The FSH level is then measured at days 3 and 10. The CCCT is still a valid test but has largely been replaced by direct measurement of AMH, day 3 FSH, and day 3 estradiol. Measurement of a day 3 FSH level is based on the notion that women with good ovarian reserve will make enough ovarian hormones early in the menstrual cycle to provide inhibition of FSH, thus keeping it at a low level. In general, a day 3 FSH value greater than 20 mIU/mL is indicative of poor ovarian reserve. Measurement of the day 3 estradiol level assesses ovarian reserve by looking for elevated basal rates of estradiol caused by premature follicle recruitment in women with poor ovarian reserve. Thus, a higher day 3 estradiol level measurement of AMH reflects the size of primordial follicle pool, and &gt;80 pg/mL is suggestive of diminished reserve. As women age and the pool declines, a lower amount of AMH is found. A level of less than 0.15 ng/mL is suggestive of a reduced follicle pool and is associated with decreased pregnancy rates. Days 21 to 23 progesterone levels are used to assess ovulation for a given cycle, not ovarian reserve.</p>\r\n",

The prevalence of lymph node disease correlates with the stage of malignancy. Primary node groups involved in the spread of cervical cancer include the paracervical, parametrial, obturator, hypogastric, external iliac, and sacral nodes, essentially in that order. Less commonly, there is involvement in the common iliac, inguinal, and paraaortic nodes. In stage I, the pelvic nodes are positive in approximately 15% of cases and the paraaortic nodes in 6%. In stage II, pelvic nodes are positive in 28% of cases and paraaortic nodes in 16%. In stage III, pelvic nodes are positive in 47% of cases and paraaortic nodes in 28%</p>\r\n",

To a lesser extent, testosterone conversion to estradiol also contributes to the estrogen milieu. Muscle and adipose tissue are the major sites of aromatization. When there is an increase in fat cells, as in obese persons, estrogen levels will be higher, because adipose tissue exhibits a greater aromatization of androstenedione to estrone than does muscle.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that the M&uuml;llerian structures appear during embryonic development in both males and females. Female gonads do not secrete M&uuml;llerian-inhibiting factor (MIF), and the M&uuml;llerian structures persist. Male testes secrete MIF, which causes regression of M&uuml;llerian structures. Anything that prevents MIF secretion in genetic males will result in persistence of M&uuml;llerian structures into the postnatal period. Persons who appear to be normal males but who possess a uterus and fallopian tubes have such a failure of M&uuml;llerianinhibiting factor. Their karyotype is 46,XY, testes are present, and testosterone production is normal. When the testes are located intraabdominally, orchidectomy is required to prevent malignant degeneration in these ectopic gonads.</p>\r\n",

Most women present with signs and symptoms of heart failure ncluding orthopnea and PND. Physical examination reveals signs of heart failure including tachycardia raised JVP pulmonary rales, peripheral edema. Diagnosis is made on echocardiography which shows EF les than 45%. Levels of BNP and troponin which normally do not rise in pregnancy or postpartum are typically raised in PPCM.
