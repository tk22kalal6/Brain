Since its reabsorption is less than the reabsorption of water in the PCT, the TF/P ratio for urea will be > 1.0.

Although prevalence figures vary,probably 20% of obese patients and 2% of lean patients have NAFL.Nonalcoholicsteatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFL, is characterized by the histologic finding of macrovesicular fatty degener-ation with inflammation in a patient with negligible ethanol intake.Most patients have modest elevations in levels of aminotransferases and, occasionally, alkaline phosphatase. Bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time are usually normal unless decompensated cirrhosis is present. Metformin only rarely causes liver hepatotoxicity and would be much less likely than a common disorder such as NAFL.\r\nAlcoholic hepatitis requires about 40 g/d of alcohol intake and would usually produce a more prominent elevation in the level of ASTthan of ALT. The patient has gallbladder stones but is asymptomatic and therefore does not have cholecystitis. The patient has a low-titer positive ANA, raising the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis;however, autoimmune hepatitis is usually characterized by higher levels of aminotransferases, higher titers of autoantibodies, and anelevated γ-globulin level.\r\n",

Mucormycosis is very strongly associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients with underlying immunosuppression (eg, due the solid organ transplantation, hematologic malignancies. or Glucocorticoid therapy) are also at high risk. Mucormycosis tends to affect the paranasal sinuses. Patients complain of facial and periorbital pain, headache, and purulent nasal discharge. The fungi proliferate in the walls of blood vessels and cause necrosis of the corresponding tissue. Black eschar (necrotic tissue) may be seen on the palate or nasal turbinate Mucormycosis is diagnosed by light microscopy of a tissue specimen. Mucor, Rhizopus, and Aspergillus fungi exist in mold form only. They form broad, non-septate hyphae that branch at wide open 90 degree angles. Mucormycosis is  treated by surgical debridement of necrotic tissue and amphotericin B.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nThis patient is most likely experiencing false labor, or Braxton-Hicks contractions. False labor is characterized by contractions that are irregular in timing and duration, and do not result in any cervical dilation. The intensity of Braxton-Hicks contractions does not change,the discomfort is mainly felt in the lower abdomen, and the pain is usually relieved by sedation. In the case of true labor, the uterine contractions occur at regular intervals, tend to become increasingly more intense over time, and results in progressive dilation and effacement of the cervix. Sedation does not stop the discomfort. There are three stages of labor. The first stage of labor is the interval between the onset of labor and full cervical dilation.The first stage consists of a latent phase (with gradual cervical change), and an active phase (characterized by rapid cervical change). The second stage of labor begins with complete cervical dilation and ends with the delivery of the fetus. The third stage of labor is the time from delivery of the fetus to expulsion of the placenta. Since this patient is not in true labor, the best plan of management is to send her home and await spontaneous labor. \r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)<br />\r\nIntermittent variable decelerations occur with fewer than 50% of contractions. They are the most common FHR abnormality that occurs during labor, and typically do not require treatment. Recurrent variable decelerations occur with greater than or equal to 50% of contractions and may be more indicative of impending fetal academia. Management of recurrent variables should include relieving umbilical cord compression. Changing the maternal position is a reasonable first step. Amnioinfusion has been shown to decrease both recurrent variables and the cesarean delivery rate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Mock%20test%20-2%20(OBGY%204).png\" style=\"height:235px; width:540px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)<br />\r\nThe normal sequence of events triggered by suckling is as follows: through a response of the central nervous system, dopamine is decreased in the hypothalamus. Dopamine suppression decreases production of PIF, which normally travels through a portal system to the pituitary gland; because PIF production is decreased, production of prolactin by the pituitary is increased. At this time, the pituitary also releases oxytocin, which causes milk to be expressed from the alveoli into the lactiferous ducts. Suckling suppresses the production of luteinizing hormone&mdash;releasing factor and, as a result, acts as a mild (but not reliable) contraceptive (because the midcycle surge of luteinizing hormone does not occur).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/Mock%20test%20-2%20(OBGY%208).png\" style=\"height:311px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n",

Ventilationperfusion scans with large perfusion defects and ventilation mismatches support the putative diagnosis of PE, but this finding can also be seen with atelectasis or other disorders of lung aeration.

In fact, at times these patients may need to reduce the prolapse in order to void. Following surgical repair, if the urethrovesical junction is not properly elevated, SUI may result. This incontinence may present within the first few days to weeks following surgery. Typically, patients undergoing hysterectomy for prolapse will be evaluated with urodynamic or other studies to help determine if they are likely to leak once normal anatomy is restored following surgery. If they are shown to leak when the cystocele is reduced, the physician may recommend a concomitant procedure to support the mid urethra, such as a mid-urethral sling, to avoid the development of SUI postoperatively. Rectovaginal fistula would present with passage of stool from vagina. Vesicovaginal fistula would present with continuous leakage of urine from the vagina.

A noninvasive renal ultrasound is fast, inexpensive, and accurate way to make the diagnosis by evaluating for hydronephrosis and/or a retroperitoneal fluid collection. Cystoscopy with retrograde intravenous pyelogram has largely been replaced by computed tomography (CT). A CT scan with contrast gives excellent information about the integrity and function of the renal collecting system; however, when the serum creatinine is elevated, intravenous contrast can cause significant renal damage and is contraindicated in those circumstances. A chest x-ray would not be helpful in making the diagnosis. Intravenous antibiotics are not indicated at this time since there is not clear evidence of an infection (normal white blood cell count). The patient has a normal drop in hemoglobin for the surgical blood loss, and does not have signs of hemodynamic instability to warrant a blood transfusion at this time.\r\n",

Epistaxis is very common in children and may be classified as anterior or posterior,depending on the bleeding source. Anterior nosebleeds are by far the most common, and the vast majority occur within the vascular watershed area of the nasal septum (anteroinferior part of the nasal septal mucosa) known as Kiesselbach plexus Anastomosis of the following vessels occurs in this region: &nbsp;Septal branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery. Lateral nasal branch of the sphenopalatine artery Septal branch of the superior labial artery (branch of the facial artery) &nbsp;Management is directed at stopping the bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus, preferably by direct compression of the nasal atae.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nThe clinical description of the lesion, with the presence of a white granular patch or plaque over the buccal mucosa in a patient with a history of alcohol and tobacco use, is most consistent with oral leukoplakia. Leukoplakia is a reactive precancerous lesion that represents hyperplasia of the squamous epithelium. The risk factors for development of leukoplakia are similar to those for squamous cell carcinoma, with smokeless tobacco and alcohol use accounting for the majority of cases. The natural history of oral leukoplakia depends on the degree of dysplasia: with 1%-20% of lesions progressing to squamous carcinoma within lO years. Fortunately, most lesions resolve within a few weeks after cessation of tobacco use. The development of areas with induration and/or ulceration should prompt biopsy to rule out malignant transformation of the lesion.",

Although the three-day history of fever, chills, and sore throat were most likely secondary to tonsillitis: his muffled or \"hot potato voice\" and deviation of the uvula suggest that a peritonsillar abscess has developed as a complication of his tonsillitis. Patients with a peritonsillar abscess typically have prominent unilateral lymphadenopathy. as seen in this patient. This condition can be fatal secondary to either airway obstruction or spread of the infection into the parapharyngeal space: which may lead to involvement of the carotid sheath. Initial treatment consists of aspiration of the peritonsillar abscess and initiation of intravenous antibiotics. Surgical intervention may be necessary if the purulent material cannot be removed with aspiration alone.",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\nThis patient's presentation is concerning malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa (MOE), a severe infection of the external auditory canal and base of the skull usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most patients with MOE are elderly and often have poorly controlled diabetes or are otherwise immunosuppressed. The most common symptoms are severe: unrelenting ear pain (especially prominent at night); purulent drainage with a sense\r\nof fullness and conductive hearing loss on the affected side. Otoscopy shows granulation tissue and an edematous external auditory canal, although the remainder of the examination may be proportional with the severity of the pain. As the infection spreads beyond the external auditory canal, osteomyelitis of the skull base or temporomandibular joint can develop and present with pain exacerbated by chewing. Cranial nerve involvement is sometimes seen.\r\n Given the severity of MOE: systemic therapy with an antipseudomonal antibiotic is recommended. In adults: intravenous ciprofloxacin remains the drug of choice in patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant P aeruginosa, alternate therapies include anti-pseudomonalpenicillins or cephalosporins such as piperacillin and ceftazidime.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nRetinoblastoma is the most common ocular tumor of childhood. It usually presents with a white pupillary reflex (leukocoria) in children (5 years old. Approximately 60q/o of retinoblastomas are sporadic (usually unilateral), while 40% are familial (often, but not always, bilateral). Familial retinoblastoma occurs due to a germline mutation that affects the Rb tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 131 affected children carry one copy of the mutation in all their cells. However, there are two copies of the Rb gene (one allele from each parent), and malignancy does not occur while at least one copy of the gene is still functional. A somatic second mutation acquired early in life is the \"second hif ' that leads to retinoblastoma: as cells with two inactivated Rb genes proliferate uncontrollably and give rise to malignancy. Children with familial retinoblastoma often acquire other \"second htt\" mutations later in life, leading to additional tumors, usually sarcomas such as osteosarcoma in contrast, patients with sporadic retinoblastoma are not at risk for other malignancies, as the chance of two acquired somatic mutations occurring multiple times in different cell lineages is very low.",

Most patients tend to be asymptomatic with retinopathy, with the earliest symptoms being a reduction of visual acuity and/or the presence of floaters. Visual loss can result from chronic macular oedema, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, acute glaucoma secondary to neovascularization of the drainage channels of the anterior chamber, and extensive panretinal photocoagulation to treat the disease at the back of the eye.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)<br />\r\nThis patient has acute appendicitis. Initial symptoms usually include pain in the epigastric or periumbilical region, which generally is mild, constant, and difficult to localize precisely. Pain eventually localizes to the right lower abdominal quadrant. Nausea and vomiting, if present, follow the onset of pain; if they precede the onset of pain, a diagnosis other than appendicitis is likely. Leukocytosis and low-grade fever are common. Urine leukocytes, as is present in this patient, is probably due to the proximity of the inflamed appendix to the bladder and can cause a delay in diagnosis. Physical examination usually reveals localized tenderness in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant during rectal and pelvic examinations may also be present .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/9_1(16).jpg\" style=\"height:320px; width:401px\" /></p>\r\n",

Approximately 25% of babies will become infected if their mother develops chickenpox in the peripartum period. Maternal chickenpox within 5 days of birth presents the greatest risk, as there is insufficient time for transplacental transmission of antibodies. Administration of varicella zoster immuneglobulin within 72 hours of exposure has been shown to prevent and attenuate chickenpox. Development of symptoms in the baby may be as early as 3 days after the onset of the maternal rash, but may be up to 16 days.",

Most cases are caused by viruses, although aseptic meningitis may also be associated with difficult-to-identify infectious agents, inflammation triggered by medications, malignancy, and other systemic inflammatory conditions. Although HSV-1 is typically associated with encephalitis, overt viral meningitis is much more common with HSV-2. The genital lesions of HSV-2 usually precede or accompany the onset of meningitis. \r\n",

Antithrombotic agents remain the most commonly used drugs for acute stroke treatment. Two large clinical trials showed a benefit of treatment with aspirin compared with placebo in short-term mortality and recurrent stroke risk when administered within 48 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole has also been shown to be effective in acute stroke therapy. Clopridogrel is a reasonable alternative to aspirin in intolerant patients. One of these agents should be used in all patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. \r\n",

However, in the absence of any recent history of sexual activity, these findings are more suggestive of reactive arthritis that can develop after C. trachomatis infection. Reactive arthritis occurs in both men and women, and enthesitis and oligoarthritis are common. The classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis occurs in only about one third of patients.
