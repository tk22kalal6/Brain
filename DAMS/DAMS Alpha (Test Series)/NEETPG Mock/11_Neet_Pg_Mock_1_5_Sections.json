In young patients, bilateral INO is highly indicative of the development of multiple sclerosis. On gaze to the left, the primary movement is started in the left cranial nerve (CN) VI nucleus, and cannot be transmitted to the right CN III nucleus via the right medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) because of demyelination secondary to the underlying disease process. As a consequence, the right eye cannot adduct. The reverse is true for gaze directed to the right. However, convergence is usually intact as this maneuver does not utilize the MLF pathway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/2_1(13).jpg\" style=\"height:230px; width:221px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\n\r\nExplanation-\r\nThe pudendal nerve arises from S2-S4 of the sacral plexus and innervates the structures of the perineum, including sensation of the genitalia. Motor functions of the pudendal nerve include voluntary urinary and fecal continence, and contraction of pelvic and urogenital diaphragms to support pelvic viscera. This nerve runs with the internal pudendal artery through the greater sciatic foramen, and the block is placed where it crosses the ischial spine (palpated through the wall of the vagina). A pudendal nerve block can alleviate perineal pain during childbirth; however it will not affect pain from contractions.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nExplanation-\r\nParkinson disease is a bradykinetic movement disorder that results from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. The main dopaminergic pathway in the basal ganglia is the nigrostriatal pathway,\r\n projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum (putamen and caudate),where there are two main classes of dopamine receptors. Dt-receptor stimulation results in excitatory modulation of the direct pathway, which facilitates movement, whereas D2 Receptor stimulation provides inhibitory modulation to the indirect pathway, which inhibits movement. Thus the end result of dopaminergic stimulation to both pathways is the facilitation of movement. The hallmark symptoms of Parkinson disease are cogwheel rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Additional symptoms include akinesia, a characteristic shuffling gait, decreases in eye blink frequency, and decreased facial expression.\r\nC is not correct.\r\nThe nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway originates in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Neurons that release dopamine originates in the substantia nigra and extends their axons into the striatum.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (D)<br />\r\nExplanation-<br />\r\nThis patient most likely has porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common disorder of porphyrin (eg: heme) synthesis. Enzyme deficiencies in the early steps in porphyrin synthesis cause abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric manifestations (due to metabolite buildup) without photosensitivity. Late step (ie, following porphobilinogen IPBCI conversion) derangements (eg, PCT) cause photosensitivity, which is thought to be due to the accumulation of porphyrinogens that react with oxygen on excitation by ultraviolet (sun) light. PCT is caused by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) deficiency, which is either inherited or (more commonly) acquired, manifesting in the presence of iron and of susceptibility factors (eg, alcohol in these patients, smoking: halogenated hydrocarbons, hepatitis C, HIV). Photosensitivity presents as vesicle and blister formation on sun-exposed areas as well as edema, pruritus, pain, and erythema. Deficiencies in coproporphyrinogen oxidase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, or ferrochelatase can also result in photosensitivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/2_1(14).jpg\" style=\"height:148px; width:261px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nExplanation-\r\nNormally, intrapleural pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure during inspiration, allowing the lungs to expand and fill with air. The patient's penetrating chest wound opened her intrapleural space to the atmosphere. Therefore, as she attempts to inhale, her thoracic cavity expands, butair enters through the wound, equalizing the pressure, preventing the normal lung expansion. This results in a simple pneumothorax, which can be treated by relieving that free air with a chest tube placed in the intrapleural space. If air cannot escape through the wound during exhalation,a tension pneumothorax results, in which the quantity of free air in the thoracic cavity increases after each breath. In this case, the intrapleural pressure can increase to the point where it is greater than the intrathoracic pressure. This causes the hallmark clinical signs of tension pneumothorax-hypotension and jugular venous distension-as well as the classic radiographic finding of tracheal and mediastinal deviation.\r\n",

These adaptations will differ depending on how long someone remains at high altitude.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe immediate response to high altitude is hyperventilation, which causes an increased pH, leading to respiratory alkalosis. This would cause a left shift in the Hb dissociation curve at first.&nbsp;<br />\r\nOver the next 2-4 days, however, other changes occur, including an increase in the synthesis of 2,3-BPG. His increased 2,3-BPG allows for more efficient unloading of oxygen at the tissues by raising the Po2 at which oxygen begins to dissociate.Similar shifting of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right is seen with decreased blood pH (which occurs during exercise),increasing Pco2 (which is akin to decreasing pH), and increasing temperature.&nbsp;<br />\r\nPast 2-4 days, 2,3-BPG remains elevated; however, production of erythropoietin is also increased, leading to increased synthesis of new RBCS to increase the overall O2 carrying capacity of the blood.After 3 months living at high altitude, the increased number of RBCs is also contributing to the athlete&#39;s increased endurance, although this would not directly alter the Hb dissociation curve.<br />\r\nA mnemonic for remembering the causes of a right shift in the HgB dissociation curve is &quot;CADET, face right&quot;: Carbon dioxide, Acidosis, 2,3-DPG,<br />\r\n&nbsp;Elevation/exercise, Temperature increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/5_1(5).jpg\" style=\"height:211px; width:242px\" /></p>\r\n",

Symptoms include insomnia. daytime drowsiness,decreased work performance, gastrointestinal issues, and generalized malaise. Jet lag is caused by asynchrony between the body's circadian rhythms (the sleep/wake cycle in particular) and local environmental rhythms.\r\n Circadian rhythms are maintained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives input from specialized photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract. The SCN processes this input and sends information to other hypothalamic nuclei and the pineal gland to modulate body temperature and the production of hormones such as coMsol (stress hormone) and melatonin (induces sleep). Circulating melatonin levels are highest during the night and lowest during the day. In contrast, cortisol peaks in the miming and reaches its lowest level.\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation- a False. On the basis of the patient&rsquo;s blue appearance, his sudden choking, and the fact that he was laughing while eating, it is most likely that he has inhaled a foreign body, and not swallowed. it. This is a case of foreign body aspiration. An inhaled foreign body is a medical emergency which can affect anyone and can occur when least expected. Any medical practitioner should be confident in the basic emergency treatment of a choking patient. b True. This is a case which would benefit from the Heimlich manoeuvre, which should be continued until the patient either recovers or becomes unconscious. c False. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves giving two breaths and 30 chest compressions. This is of no use in this case, as the patient&rsquo;s airway is blocked and no breaths will reach his lungs. Performing chest compressions will only continue to pump increasingly deoxygenated blood to the brain. The Heimlich manoeuvre is required here. This involves standing behind the patient with the patient leaning slightly forward. The physician&rsquo;s arms should be placed around the patient, so that the hands are clasped just below the patient&rsquo;s costal margin in the midline. A sudden, strong, inward and upward thrust must be made using the hands to replicate the patient&rsquo;s natural cough mechanism and help to clear the airway. d False. Obstruction of the larynx must be cleared within a few minutes, otherwise the resulting laryngospasm will most certainly kill the patient. On the other hand, if a foreign body is obstructing one of the two bronchi, the other bronchus may still allow oxygenation of blood for a short time before the signs of hyperinflation and subsequent pneumothorax become apparent.</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nExplanation-\r\nVasoconstriction by a-adrenergic agonists is prominent in the vessels of the nasal mucosa, making these medications effective decongestants.\r\n Phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and oxymetazoline are used as topical preparations for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and common cold,associated congestion and rhinitis.\r\n These medications, however, are characterized by a rapidly declining effect after   a few days of use. This phenomenon is called tachyphylaxis. It occurs because of decreased production of endogenous norepinephrine from the nerve terminals due to a negative feedback mechanism, resulting in relative vasodilation and subsequent edema and congestion. This leads to exacerbation of the nasal congestion symptoms. Rebound rhinorrhea (ie, rhinitis medicamentosa) is described as nasal congestion without cough, sneezing, or postnasal drip. Rebound rhinorrhea is associated with the use of topical decongestants for 3 days. The use of adrenergic agonists should be stopped to allow the restoration of normal norepinephrine feedback pathways.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nExplanation-\r\nClostridium botulinum is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus hat synthesizes botulinum toxin intracellularly and releases it by autolysis, Botulinum toxin prevents the presynaptic release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal at the neuromuscular junction This prevents both nicotinic and muscarinic activation, leading to skeletal muscle weakness and reduced glandular secretions, respectively. Botulism is a result of toxin ingestion and is characterized by  descending symmetric paralysis. Spore formation, which occurs in the subterminal location (between the terminal end and center of the bacteria), allows the bacteria to survive adverse conditions (eg. heat, high- oxygen environment).\r\n Focal dystonia is a localized, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can lead to pain and physical deformity. It is due to involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Injection of botulinum toxin type B into the dystonic muscle results in muscular relaxation and relief of symptoms Botulinum toxin can also be used to treat the muscle spasms of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease, to relax the lower esophageal sphincter in achalasia, and to reduce the appearance of facial wrinkles.\r\n The localised Anticholinergic effect also makes it useful in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. The effects are temporary (approximately 3 months), due to the regeneration of the nerve terminal with time.\r\n",

In this scenario, the CBR is 20. Probable number of pregnancies (Y) Birth rate x population of the area / 1 000 20 x 5000/1000: 100. \r\nBut we add a correction factor of 1 0% to adjust for pregnancy wastage in the form of abortions or stillbirths. Thus, total number of expected pregnancies: Y + 10% of Y:110\r\nAs all the pregnancies are not registered, and at any given time an ANM should have at least half the expected pregnancies registered with her, the number of ANC registrations is taken as 50% of the expected pregnancies. Therefore, Total ANC registrations: total number of expected pregnancies/2: 55. Hence, the closest answer is 60.\r\n",

As urinalysis indicates, he is suffering from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to renal ischemia. Muddy brown casts (seen in the image) on urinalysis are pathognomonic for ATN. Rhabdomyolysis (caused by crush injury in this case) is another common cause of ATN. It ts a direct result of muscle cell necrosis and deposition of myoglobin in the renal tubules. Thus, it does not typically pass through the prerenal stage. Other toxins, such as chemotherapeutic agents and aminoglycoside antibiotics, may also cause this condition.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nExplanation-\r\nGoodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune aisoraer in which antibodies directed against  glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigen cause a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The antibodies can also deposit in the alveolar basement membranes, resulting in hemoptysis. It is most often seen in young men. Of note, Goodpasture syndrome can follow viral infections of the pulmonary system, thought to cause pulmonary damage leading to newly exposed epitopes, which sets off an immunologic response. As in this case, the patient likely had a preceding viral pneumonia (which would explain the x-ray findings). This condition can be diagnosed by the detection of the anti-GBM antibodies in the blood, in combination with a kidney biopsy that demonstrates a linear staining pattern on immunofluorescence (like that shown here). Because this condition may rapidly lead to a compromised airway or declining kidney function, immediate airway protection, plasmapheresis (to remove the autoantibodies from circulation), and treatment with corticosteroids and\r\n cyclophosphamide is indicated.\r\n",

AAT is normally secreted by the liver and acts ta neutralize elastase activity in the lung. In patients with AAT deficiency, increased elastase activity leads to a lass af elastic fibers and increased lung compliance, resulting in panacinar emphysema (see image). Furthermore, the accumulation of dysfunctional AAT in hepatocytes results in liver damage and cirrhosis.

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\n\r\nExplanation-\r\nHistologically, both of these diseases produce distorted crypt architecture with crypt destruction and loss. These abnormalities of the colonic crypts help to differentiate IBD from infectious colitis. Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis produce acute and chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa. Lymphocytes and plasma cells are increased in number in the lamina propria. Neutrophils May be seen within the colonic epithelium, and, if present within the lumens of the crypts, may produce crypt abscesses. This latter change, however, is more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis. One important way to differentiate between these two inflammatory bowel diseases is the location of the involved colon. Crohn’s disease may affect any portion of the GI tract, but most commonly there is involvement of the terminal ileum (regional enteritis) or the proximal portion (right side) of the colon. GI involvement is segmental with skip areas. In contrast, almost all cases of ulcerative colitis involve the rectum, and involvement extends proximally(left side) without skip lesions (diffuse involvement).\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (E)\r\n\r\nHypopituitarism results from destructive processes that involve the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary). These processes may be acute (sudden) or chronic. Sheehan’s syndrome, also known as postpartum pituitary necrosis, results from the sudden infarction of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. This can occur with obstetric complications, such as hemorrhage or shock. The pituitary gland normally doubles in size during pregnancy; hypovolemia during delivery decreases blood flow and may result in infarction of the anterior pituitary.Sheehan’s syndrome produces symptoms of hypopituitarism. The initial sign is cessation of lactation, which may be followed by secondary amenorrhea due to the loss of gonadotropins. Other signs of hypopituitarism include hypothyroidism and decreased functioning of the adrenal gland.\r\nAcute destruction of the pituitary is also associated with DIC and thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. Chronic causes of hypopituitarism include nonsecretory chromophobe pituitary adenomas, empty sella syndrome,\r\nand suprasellar (hypothalamic) tumors.\r\n",

The mother thought it was irritation and gave her daughter's eye a wash with a leading brand of eyewash. However, her symptoms did not settle and in the last24 hours the child has developed a number of blisters on the upper eyelid which are very itchy. Some of these blisters have begun to ooze and the child now has a sticky yellow discharge as well. On examination, there are multiple vesicles on the upper lid, some of which appear excoriated, but these are not in any particular dermatomal pattern. There is an associated yellow discharge and large crusts on the eyelashes. The conjunctiva is inflamed but there is no obvious corneal involvement., Eversion of the upper eyelid shows multiple follicles on the inner lid surface. A preauricular lymph node is palpable on the left side. What is the most likely causative organism?",

      "solution": "Correct answer (D)\r\nExplanation-\r\nViral conjunctivitis is common in patients of all ages. Of the viruses responsible for this condition, herpes simplex virus (HSV) is by far the most problematic. A primary ocular infection with HSV is common in children and causes a follicular conjunctivitis. Patients often present with a red and watering eye with concomitant eyelid skin involvement showing multiple vesicles in a localised area. The Eyelids may be swollen and there may also be an ulcerative blepharitis. If a discharge is present, it tends to be clear and mucus like,  characteristic of viral infections. A yellow discharge normally indicates either a primary bacterial infection or a secondary bacterial infection after a primary viral infection. VZV infections tend to affect the skin in a dermatomal pattern of vesicles.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\nThis patient has a clinical scenario highly concerning for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). here is a 50% reduction in platelet count while exposed to heparin; it appears 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin, although it can be <24 hours if heparin was given within the past 100 days. HIT is associated with an approximately 50% risk of thrombosis. All patients with intermediate or high suspicion for HIT should receive alternative anticoagulation immediately. Although the risk is lower, LMWH (Enoxaparin) can cause HIT and should never be used in patients with suspected or known HIT. Argatroban and Lepirudin are approved for treatment of HIT. Fondaparinux has been studied for use in HIT but is renally excreted and not recommended for dialysis patients. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C) \r\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare yet serious and frequently life-threatening complication of a variety of conditions. DAH may result from coagulation disorders, inhaled toxins, or infections. Most cases of DAH are caused by capillaritis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Early recognition is crucial, because the prompt institution of supportive measures and immunosuppressive therapy is required for survival. \r\n DAH has been associated mainly with following diseases including: \r\n• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis (ANCA) \r\n• Goodpasture syndrome (anti-GBM) \r\n• Systemic lupus erythematosus (ANA) as well as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and mixed connective tissue disease \r\n• Cocaine inhalation (toxicology screen) \r\nDAH has also been associated with medications such as propylthiouracil, phenytoin, and retinoic acid. \r\n",

Although the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is the most accurate indicator of thyroid function in patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, it cannot be used to monitor thyroid hormone replacement therapy in patients with central hypothyroidism. In these patients, the pituitary thyrotropes are absent, and the TSH level is always low, regardless of the level of circulating thyroid hormone. The goal of thyroid hormone replacement in these patients is to titrate the levothyroxine dose to normalize the free T 4 level (or total T 4 concentration and free T 4 index) , not to normalize the TSH level. \r\n",

Fibroblasts, which enter the wound at about day 3, continue to proliferate with increasing collagen deposition. Throughout the proliferative phase, type III collagen predominates. Collagen content is maximal at 2 to 3 weeks, at which time the remodeling phase begins. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\nDiazepam\r\nThis is a clinical scenario often asked previously also in many exams. It is a case of alcohol dependence syndrome in withdrawal, complicated by withdrawal seizures.\r\n \r\nRemember following points:\r\n1. Seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal are stereotyped, generalized, and tonic-clonic in character\r\n2. Patients often have more than one seizure 3 to 6 hours after the first seizure.\r\n3. Status epilepticus is relatively rare and occurs in less than 3 percent of patients.\r\n4. Although anticonvulsant medications are not required in the management of alcohol withdrawal seizures, the cause of the seizures is difficult to establish when a patient is first assessed in the emergency room; thus, many patients with withdrawal seizures receive anticonvulsant medications, which are then discontinued once the cause of the seizures is recognized.\r\n5. The primary medications to control alcohol withdrawal symptoms are the benzodiazepines. Many studies have found that benzodiazepines help control seizure activity, delirium, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and tremor associated with alcohol withdrawal.\r\n6. Benzodiazepines can be given either orally or parenterally; neither diazepam nor chlordiazepoxide however, should be given intramuscularly (IM) because of their erratic absorption by this route.\r\n7. Although benzodiazepines are the standard treatment for alcohol withdrawal, studies have shown that carbamazepine in daily doses of 800 mg is as effective as benzodiazepines(probable question) and has the added benefit of minimal abuse liability.\r\n8. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists and clonidine(FOR PGI) have also been used to block the symptoms of sympathetic hyperactivity, but neither drug is an effective treatment for seizures or delirium. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\nThis fetus is measuring “size less than dates.” In a normal singleton pregnancy from about 18 to 36weeks, the number of weeks of gestation should approximate the fundal height measurement, within 2 cmto 3 cm.The differential for a fundal height measurement that is less than expected includes incorrect dating, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, or fetal demise. In this patient, heart sounds are present, so the pregnancy is still viable. She had a first trimester ultrasound, so the dates are correct.

On examination, you observe an acutely ill patient lying on the bed with her knees drawn up. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, her pulse is 110 beats per minute, and her temperature is 38.8°C (101.8°F).

      "solution": "Correct Answer (C)\r\nThe most probable diagnosis in this case is acute pancreatitis. The pain caused by a myoma in degeneration is more localized to the uterine wall. Low-grade fever and mild leukocytosis may appear with a degenerating myoma, but liver function tests are usually normal. The other obstetrical causes of epigastric pain, such as preeclampsia may exhibit disturbed liver function (sometimes associated with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome), but this patient has only mild elevation of blood pressure and no proteinuria. Acute appendicitis in pregnancy is one of the more common non obstetric causes of abdominal pain. Symptoms of acute appendicitis in pregnancy are similar to those in nonpregnant patients, but the pain is more vague and poorly localized and the point of maximal tenderness moves to the right upper quadrant with advancing gestation. Liver function tests are normal with acute appendicitis. Acute cholecystitis may cause fever, leukocytosis, and pain of the right upper quadrant with abnormal liver function tests, but amylase levels would be elevated only mildly, if at all, and pain would be less severe than described in this patient. The diagnosis that fits the clinical description and the laboratory findings is acute pancreatitis. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\nGBS is an important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Implementation of national guidelines for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis since the 1990s has resulted in an 80% reduction in the incidence of early onset neonatal sepsis due to GBS. The Gram-positive organism can colonize the lower gastrointestinal tract, and Secondary spread to the genitourinary tract is common. Between 10% and 30% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS in the vagina or rectum. Universal prenatal screening is recommended between 35 and 37 weeks. Penicillin G (5 million units IV initially, then 2.5-3 million units/4 hours until delivery) remains the agent of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis, although ampicillin is an acceptable alternative. Data show that GBS isolates are increasingly resistant to second-line therapies. Up to 32% of isolates are resistant to erythromycin, and therefore, this is no longer recommended. Clindamycin is only recommended if the isolate is susceptible to both clindamycin and erythromycin. A patient with a penicillin or cephalosporin allergy should be asked about her specific symptoms. If she has had anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory distress, or urticarial, she should receive vancomycin 1g IV every 12 hours until delivery or clindamycin as described earlier.\r\n",

At the time of laparotomy, a maximum effort should be made to determine the sites of tumor spread and to excise all resectable tumors. Although the uterus and ovaries may appear grossly normal, there is a relatively high incidence of occult metastases to these organs; for this reason, they should be removed during the initial surgery. Ovarian cancer metastasizes outside the peritoneum via the pelvic or para-aortic lymphatics, and from there into the thorax and the remainder of the body. Therefore, a complete staging procedure also includes pelvic washings, pelvic and abdominal exploration for metastatic disease, appendectomy, and lymph node sampling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/obg2.jpg\" style=\"height:442px; width:636px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

In the case of the asymptomatic Bartholin cyst, no treatment is necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/16_1(1).jpg\" style=\"height:126px; width:136px\" /></p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)<br />\r\nMost ovarian malignancies are not found until significant spread has occurred; therefore it is not unreasonable to further evaluate patients as soon as there is a suspicion of an ovarian neoplasm. Pelvic ultrasonography, tumor markers, and even surgical exploration may be part of the evaluation of a patient with an ovarian mass. Pelvic ultrasound findings of internal ovarian papillary vegetations, ovarian size greater than 10 cm, the presence of ascites, possible ovarian torsion, or solid ovarian lesions are indications for exploratory laparotomy in the postmenopausal patient. In a younger woman, a cyst can be followed past one menstrual cycle to determine if it is a follicular cyst, since a follicular cyst should regress after onset of the next menstrual period. If regression does not occur, then surgery is appropriate. Doppler ultrasound imaging allows visualization of arterial and venous flow patterns superimposed on the image of the structure being examined; arterial and venous flow are expected in a normal ovary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/obg6.jpg\" style=\"height:404px; width:1044px\" /></p>\r\n",

By definition, if breast development has not begun by the age of 13 years, delayed puberty should be suspected. Menarche usually follows about 1 to 2 years after the beginning of breast development; if menarche is delayed beyond the age of 16 years, delayed puberty should be investigated. Appropriate laboratory tests include circulating pituitary and steroid hormone levels, karyotypic analysis, and CNS imaging when indicated. An FSH value greater than 40 mIU/mL defines hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a cause of delayed pubertal maturation.

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (C)<br />\r\nSUI is the involuntary loss of urine when intravesical pressure exceeds the maximum urethral pressure in the absence of detrusor activity. It is often brought on by laughing, coughing, or sneezing. This incidence is highest in women between the ages of 45 and 50. SUI may be caused by urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). The other major cause of incontinence is urge incontinence. With urge incontinence, the bladder leaks urine due to involuntary, uninhibited detrusor contractions. The incidence of urge incontinence increases with age. Other causes of urinary incontinence are less common and include overflow incontinence secondary to urinary retention, congenital abnormalities, infections, fistulas, and urethral diverticula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2enu63wt1sf3u.cloudfront.net/ckfinder/files/25_1(6).jpg\" style=\"height:261px; width:411px\" /></p>\r\n",

It may be easy tohear the venous blood flow returning to the heart,especially at the upper sternal edge. This characteristicallyoccurs in both systole and diastole and disappears when the child lies flat- Innocent murmurs are the commonest murmurs heard in children. occurring in up to 50 percent of normal children. They are often discovered in Children with a coexisting infection or with anaemia. Innocent murmurs all relate to a structurally normal heart sound it is clear.It is  important to reassure the parents that their child's heart is normal. Types of innocent murmur include those due to increased flow across the branchpulmonary artery, Still's murmur and venous hums. The murmur should be soft (no thrill), systolic (diastolic murmurs are not innocent) and short, never pansystolic. The child is always asymptomatic. The murmur may change with posture, as in venous hums.\r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (B)\r\nExplanation-\r\nRaj has the characteristic clinical features of acute bronchiolitis – a seasonal viral illness occurring from early autumn to spring, principally affecting infants. T he commonest causative organism is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is responsible for about 80  percent of infections resulting in hospitalisation. In hospital, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) may be sent for viral immunofluorescence or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for RSV and other respiratory viruses (e.g. rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza). This is largely for infection control and epidemiological purposes and does not affect acute management. Around 2 to 3  per cent of all infants are admitted each year with RSV bronchiolitis, but many more are managed at home. Prevention is possible with an RSV monoclonal antibody (palivizumab), but this is reserved for high-risk infants, e.g. oxygen-dependent survivors of prematurity, as it is extremely expensive. There is currently no vaccine available.\r\n",

It is straightforward in that not only is one of the listed choices (A) clearly the best, but the other four choices all are incorrect. Minimalchange disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in childhood, and accounts for more than all other causes combined. The peak incidence is between 2 and 5 years of age. The prognosis is very favorable, and the process rarely progresses to end-stage renal disease. Serum lipids and cholesterol are elevated, as they are with other causes of nephrotic syndrome. Finally, the disease characteristically responds well to treatment with corticosteroids, with only a small minority of patients failing to remit.\r\n",

Biliverdin reductase converts biliverdin to bilirubin. The placenta does not eliminate biliverdin, thus there is a fetal advantage to make bilirubin. During fetal life, normal bowel function is not established and the hepatic conjugating system is somewhat dormant so these systems do not play a prominent role in bilirubin removal. Unconjugated bilirubin (more fat soluble and less water soluble than conjugated bilirubin) easily crosses the placenta to the maternal circulation for disposal by the maternal liver.\r\n",
