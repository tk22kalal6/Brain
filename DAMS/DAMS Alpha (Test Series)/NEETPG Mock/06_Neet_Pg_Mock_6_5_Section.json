      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Histidine, an essential amino acid, has been extensively used in protein-based biopharmaceutical formulations. The physicochemical properties of histidine are unique among amino acids and could afford multifaceted benefits to protein-based biopharmaceutical formulations. With a pKa of approximately 6.0 at the side chain, histidine has been primarily used as a buffering agent, especially for pH 5.5&ndash;6.5. Additionally, histidine exhibited several affirmative properties similar to those of carbohydrates (e.g., sucrose and trehalose) and could therefore be considered to be an alternative approach to established protein-based formulation strategies.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "solution": "<p>Correct Answer (A)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nA well-performed history of a patient can raise suspicion for vitamin A deficiency. The presence of a malabsorptive process, such as IBD, chronic GI infection, cirrhosis, pancreatic insufficiency, prematurity, rubeola infection (measles), a history of living in a resource-poor country, or current pregnancy or lactation in the setting of poor nutrition should raise concern for vitamin A deficiency. The natural progression of chronic VAD most commonly presents with the gradual development of night blindness, increased frequency of GI, pulmonary, and urinary infections, and development of xeroderma and phrynoderma (follicular hyperkeratosis often found on extensor surfaces, shoulders, and buttocks).&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs the severity of deficiency worsens, signs of xerophthalmia develop with Bitot spots(conjunctival, triangular or oval, foamy lesions) and conjunctival xerosis (appears as conjunctival wrinkling). If VAD continues to persist, its later stages present as corneal xerosis, corneal ulceration, and eventually keratomalacia as the corneal ulcers heal, corneal scarring and blindness results. In the setting of an infection, particularly measles, patients with an acute deficiency may present with corneal xerosis and ulceration without preceding night blindness or Bitot&rsquo;s spots Phrynoderma (a form of follicular hyperkeratosis) may also be seen in VAD but is associated with other nutritional deficiencies as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Na+ and Cl− are extracted and K+ and bicarbonate are added. Because the ducts are relatively impermeable to water, the loss of NaCl renders the saliva hypotonic, particularly at low secretion rates. As the rate of secretion increases, there is less time for NaCl to be extracted and the tonicity of the saliva rises, but it always stays somewhat hypotonic with respect to plasma.\r\n",

The neurons of this complex discharge rhythmically and stimulate the phrenic nerve nucleus. There are NK1 receptors and μ-opioid receptors on these neurons, and, in vivo, substance P stimulates and opioids inhibit respiration. Depression of respiration is a side effect that limits the use of opioids in the treatment of pain. However, it is now known that 5HT4 receptors are present in the Pre-Botzinger complex and treatment with 5HT4 agonists blocks the inhibitory effect of opioids on respiration in experimental animals, without inhibiting their analgesic effect. \r\n",

      "solution": "Correct Answer (D)\r\n\r\nPterygium has high chances of recurrences following surgery • It is a degenerative & hyperplastic condition of conjunctiva • The subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration& proliferates as vascularized granular tissue. • Corneal epithelium, bowman’s layer and stroma is destroyed. Etiology: UV rays, dry heat, dusty environment. It appears to be a triangular fold encroaching over the cornea in the area of palpebral aperture, usually on nasal side. It is an asymptomatic condition in early stages except for cosmetic intolerance.visual disturbance due to encroachment of pterygium on papillary area or corneal astigmatism. Diplopia can very occasionally occur due to ocular movement limitation. Treatment: Asymptomatic is best left alone. Otherwise surgery is only effective treatment. Simple excision or Bare sclera technique is high associated with recurrence(80%),so conjunctival autografting is the most popular approach. Pterygium excision followed by conjunctival transplant reduces recurrence\r\n",

Inherited mutations of the APC tumor suppressor gene characterize familial adenomatous polyposis of the colon and predispose to colon cancer but not breast cancer. Mutated VHL is seen in a variety of benign and malignant tumors, including clear cell renal cancers and breast cancer. The HER2 gene is amplified in 15 to 20% of breast cancers; this somatic change is associated with sensitivity of the tumor to HER2-targeted therapy; germline mutations of the HER2 gene have not been described.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This most commonly occurs when the bones<br />\r\ndo not heal properly after a fracture. Pseudoarthrosis usually causes pain, because the two bones are moving against each other, instead of being fused together. This movement may cause problems with metal screws or other hardware used to fuse the bones together. Additional surgery may be required to align the bones and use them together.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
