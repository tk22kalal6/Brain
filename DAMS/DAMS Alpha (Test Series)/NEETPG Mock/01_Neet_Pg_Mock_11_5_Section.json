      "solution": "Correct Answer (A)\r\n\r\nIvabradine\r\nExplanation:\r\nIvabradine is a selective If (\"funny\") current inhibitor in the sinoatrial (SA) node, used to reduce heart rate without affecting myocardial contractility or blood pressure. It is used in:\r\n• Chronic stable angina in patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.\r\n• Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in select patients.\r\nAssociated Adverse Effects:\r\n• Bradyarrhythmias: Due to excessive slowing of SA node activity.\r\n• Visual disturbances (\"phosphenes\"): Patients often report transient enhanced brightness in part of their visual field, related to ivabradine’s action on retinal ion channels (which are similar to those in the SA node).\r\n Other options:\r\nB) Nicorandil:\r\no Potassium channel opener and nitrate-like drug.\r\no Can cause headache and ulcers, but not bradycardia or visual changes.\r\nC) Ranolazine:\r\no Inhibits late sodium current.\r\no May prolong QT interval but does not typically cause bradycardia or visual symptoms.\r\nD) Amlodipine:\r\no A dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.\r\no Can cause edema, flushing, constipation and ankle edema but not visual disturbances\r\n",

A highly ionised drug has low Vd- True.\r\nIonised (charged) drugs are usually water-soluble and do not easily cross lipid membranes to enter tissues.\r\nAs a result, they tend to remain in the plasma and extracellular fluid, resulting in a low Vd.\r\n\r\nIncorrect statements:\r\n• A. Drugs with large Vd can be removed by dialysis- False.\r\nDrugs with a large Vd are extensively distributed into tissues, leaving less drug in the plasma. Dialysis primarily clears drugs from the blood/plasma, so drugs with large Vd are poorly removed by dialysis.\r\n• B. If Vd is large most of the drug remains in the plasma compartment- False.\r\nLarge Vd means the drug leaves the plasma and distributes extensively into tissues and fat. So, less of the drug is in plasma.\r\n• D. Digoxin has low Vd-  False.\r\nDigoxin has a very large Vd (~6–7 L/kg), because it extensively binds to tissues, especially cardiac and skeletal muscle\r\n",

Significant increases in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) occur frequently.\r\n• Unchecked, TLS can progress to lactic acidosis and acute renal failure. \r\n• Treatment includes intravenous fluids, allopurinol, and especially rasburicase (when uric acid >8 mg/dL, contraindicated with G6PD deficiency as can cause hemolysis and methemoglobinemia- i.e. male African/Mediterranean/SE asian ancestry)) and temporary haemodialysis.\r\n• Urinary alkalnization NOT indicated as it can worsen Ca-Phos nephropathy\r\n",

The triad of symptoms is acute, colicky abdominal pain; motor polyneuropathy; and psychosis. Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects more women than men and has its onset between ages 20 and 50 years. The psychiatric symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, lability of mood, depression, and psychosis. Symptoms of this disease also predominately include psychosis, apathy, or depression, along with intermittent abdominal pain, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction. Elevated levels of porphobilinogen are found in the urine of symptomatic patients with acute intermittent porphyria.\r\n \r\n(There is no evidence of presence of acute precipitating stress factor, nor is there any ascending weakness)\r\n",

PWS results from the loss of function of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11–q13.

Hence, both disorders involve genomic imprinting of the same chromosomal region but differ by the parent of origin.\r\n\r\nDiGeorge syndrome is caused by 22q11.2 deletion, Williams syndrome involves a deletion at 7q11.23, and Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant condition—none of which are related to imprinting.\r\n",

The skin pinch may go back slowly in both \"some\" and \"severe\" dehydration, but lethargy and inability to feed are defining features of severe dehydration.\r\n\r\nNote: \"Moderate dehydration\" is not a formal WHO category; it overlaps with \"some dehydration\" but is not used in WHO protocols.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is C. Severe dehydration.\r\n",

The most important component of surfactant is Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), commonly known as lecithin.\r\n\r\nLecithin production increases significantly after 32–34 weeks of gestation, and its levels can be measured in amniotic fluid. A Lecithin:Sphingomyelin (L:S) ratio >2 usually indicates sufficient lung maturity. Sphingomyelin levels remain relatively constant and serve as a reference in this ratio. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine and dipalmitoyl inositol are not primary surfactant components.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the deficiency of lecithin (DPPC) is the key biochemical defect in neonatal RDS. Treatment involves administration of exogenous surfactant and supportive respiratory care.\r\n",
