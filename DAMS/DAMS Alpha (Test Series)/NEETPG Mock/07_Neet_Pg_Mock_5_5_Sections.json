Most cases are caused by viruses, although aseptic meningitis may also be associated with difficult-to-identify infectious agents, inflammation triggered by medications, malignancy, and other systemic inflammatory conditions. Although HSV-1 is typically associated with encephalitis, overt viral meningitis is much more common with HSV-2. The genital lesions of HSV-2 usually precede or accompany the onset of meningitis. ",
