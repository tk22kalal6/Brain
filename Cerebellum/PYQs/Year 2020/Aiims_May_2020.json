C) 1, 3, 5 are true</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">This situation involves multiple aspects: legal, ethical, and medical considerations are paramount. Here's why each statement is addressed as true or false in this context:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>1. Document informed refusal:</strong> True. It is essential for medical practitioners to document any refusal of examination or treatment, particularly in sensitive cases involving minors. Documentation should include detailed information about what was explained to the patient and the guardian, and their reasons for refusal, to ensure clarity and legal safeguarding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>3. Counsel the mother and daughter:</strong> True. The role of a gynecologist includes providing medical counseling, especially when it involves minors and sensitive issues such as sexual activity. Counseling should aim to educate about the health implications of the sexual activity, the benefits of medical examination, and the legal aspects considering the age of consent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>5. Inform the police:</strong> True. According to laws in many jurisdictions, including India, any sexual activity with a minor, regardless of consent, is considered statutory rape. Medical professionals are mandated reporters, which means they are legally obligated to report such cases to law enforcement to ensure the safety of the minor and adhere to legal statutes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>2. Do not inform the police:</strong> False. The gynecologist has a mandatory obligation to report cases of suspected statutory rape, as non-reporting could be considered a failure of duty and legal non-compliance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>4. Examine with necessary force:</strong> False. It is illegal and unethical to perform a medical examination against a patient's will, especially in the case of a minor. The patient's autonomy must be respected, and no examination should proceed without consent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Examination of a victim of sexual assault should be done only after the consent of the victim. It is the accused who can be examined without consent, not the victim. Whether the victim agrees for examination or not, the police always have to be informed as there is an allegation of crime of rape (as sex even with consent with a girl &lt;18 years of age will be considered rape)</span></p>",

Sometimes it may be asymptomatic with imaging findings (<strong><em>cloud sign or bubble sign</em>)</strong>. Aspiration reveals dark fluid consisting of metallic debris.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:10px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:10px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:10px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

A) Atropine and neostigmine are very useful in the management of krait bite</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Neostigmine (along with atropine) can be used for neurotoxic snakes (both cobra and krait). <strong>But the usefulness is much less in krait bite, and much more in cobra bite.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Mechanism of Neostigmine:&nbsp;</strong>Neostigmine is the inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase enzyme.

Neostigmine will not be helpful to counter the effect of these toxins.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Why Atropine used with Neostigmine:&nbsp;</strong>As neostigmine increases the amount of acetylcholine, both nicotinic and muscarinic effects occur. But to treat snake bite we need only nicotinic effects at neuromuscular junction. Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent and helps to counter the muscarinic effects of nicotine, especially bradycardia.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B.

Neostigmine can be part of the management for neurotoxic snake envenomations, and ventilatory support may be necessary if there is significant respiratory compromise. ASV (Anti-Snake Venom) is also used as it neutralizes the venom.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. ASV is the mainstay of treatment:</strong> True. ASV remains the primary treatment for snakebite envenomations in India, effectively neutralizing the venom of various snake species.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Current ASV in India is less effective against humped pit viper:</strong> This is true. There are regional variations in the efficacy of ASV based on the specific snake species prevalent in those regions, and ASV formulations may be less effective against certain species, such as the humped pit viper.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Treatment of snake bite:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>First Aid treatment have limited role.</strong> Reassure the patient, immobilize the limb and keep it below the heart level.

In the obturator type, when a force is applied to femur while the hip joint is in abduction and flexion, the femoral head dislocates anteriorly and inferiorly to the obturator foramen. In the ischial type, a force is applied to femur while hip and knee joints are in hyperflexion without abduction or external rotation. The femoral head dislocates inferiorly next to the ischium. The ischial type is more common than the obturator type.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/10/46.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"314\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

C) Increased urine bilirubin</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Increased urine bilirubin is the least likely finding in newborns with Rh incompatibility. Rh incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh-negative, and the baby is Rh-positive, leading to hemolysis of the baby's red blood cells. This hemolysis releases hemoglobin, which is broken down into biliverdin and then into unconjugated bilirubin. This unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and cannot be excreted directly in the urine because it needs to be conjugated by the liver to become water-soluble. However, the enzyme required for this conjugation (glucuronyl transferase) is immature in newborns, especially in those with Rh incompatibility, leading to an accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Unconjugated bilirubin is not excreted in the urine; instead, it is converted to urobilinogen and stercobilinogen in the intestines by bacteria, which are then excreted in the urine and feces, respectively. This process is why increased fecal urobilinogen and stercobilinogen are likely findings in Rh incompatibility. The lack of mature enzyme activity in the liver of a newborn prevents significant conjugation and excretion of bilirubin in the urine, making increased urine bilirubin an unlikely finding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option A. Increased unconjugated bilirubin</strong>: This is a common finding in newborns with Rh incompatibility due to the hemolysis of red blood cells, which leads to the release of hemoglobin that is converted to unconjugated bilirubin.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option B. Increased fecal urobilinogen</strong>: This is likely because unconjugated bilirubin, once processed by intestinal bacteria, is converted into urobilinogen and stercobilinogen, which are then excreted in the feces.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option D. Increased stercobilinogen</strong>: Like urobilinogen, stercobilinogen is a breakdown product of bilirubin excreted in the feces, making its increase likely in Rh incompatibility.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">In Rh incompatibility, increased urine bilirubin is unlikely due to the immaturity of the newborn's liver enzymes needed for bilirubin conjugation.</span></p>",

When depolarization reaches 7 to 10 mV, the voltage gated Na+ channels start opening at a faster rate. It is called Na+ channel activation.

This prevents mucosal drying and enhances mucociliary clearance.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Nasal cannula:</strong> Despite the term \"nasal cannula,\" the prongs for HFNC are broader and shorter than traditional cannulas. They don't completely occlude the nares, allowing for the patient to breathe room air in addition to the provided gas mixture if needed.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Gas Conditioning:</strong> The humidified and warmed gas ensures better comfort and reduced airway resistance, potentially improving mucociliary function.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>PEEP Effect:</strong> The high flow rates create a degree of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the nasopharynx. This can be beneficial in preventing alveolar collapse and can recruit alveoli, improving oxygenation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Enhanced CO2 Washout:</strong> HFNC reduces the anatomical dead space in the nasopharynx, aiding in more efficient removal of carbon dioxide.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Continuous High Flow:</strong> The high flow rates ensure that the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is more consistent, irrespective of the patient's respiratory pattern.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Advantages:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Better oxygenation:</strong> By delivering higher flow rates, HFNC can achieve better and more consistent oxygenation compared to standard oxygen therapy.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Comfort:</strong> Patients often find HFNC more comfortable than non-invasive positive pressure ventilation masks.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Patients can eat, drink, and communicate while using HFNC.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Indications:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:</strong> Especially if caused by conditions like pneumonia or pulmonary edema.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Post-extubation support:</strong> In patients at risk for reintubation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>During procedures:</strong> Like bronchoscopy, to maintain oxygenation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>In conditions like COPD and asthma:</strong> It may aid in CO2 washout.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Limitations and Contraindications:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Severe hypercapnic respiratory failure:</strong> HFNC doesn't provide as much ventilation support as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or mechanical ventilation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Uncooperative or unconscious patients:</strong> Due to aspiration risk.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Facial trauma or recent facial surgery.</strong></span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:#434343;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Mechanical ventilator:&nbsp;</strong>A mechanical ventilator is a device used to support or replace spontaneous breathing. It is more complex and provides controlled ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Infusion pump:&nbsp;</strong>An infusion pump delivers fluids, such as nutrients and medications, into a patient's body in controlled amounts. It is not related to respiratory support.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. CPAP machine:&nbsp;</strong>A Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine delivers a continuous level of positive airway pressure to keep the airways open.

It contains nuclei that deal with sleep, respiration, bladder control, hearing, taste, eye movement, facial expressions, facial sensation, and posture.

Dislocation of wrist.&nbsp;</strong>Wrist dislocations can occur at the radiocarpal joint, the midcarpal joint, the distal radioulnar joint or may represent a combination of these injuries in severe trauma. Carpal instability in the form of lunate and perilunate dislocations are uncommon injuries but can be frequently missed.&nbsp;The majority of carpal instability is centered around the lunate, given its location in the middle of the wrist. Injuries progress from scapholunate instability to lunate dislocation. Perilunate dislocations and lunate dislocations are high-energy wrist injuries involving falls from height, motor vehicle collisions, or athletic injuries. Lunate dislocate anteriorly but the rest of the carpals remain in position. In Perilunate dislocation, the lunate remains in position and the rest of the carpals dislocate dorsally. The most common type of perilunate instability is transscaphoid perilunate fracture dislocation. <strong>Median nerve is most commonly involved </strong>nerve.

The order of filterability observed in the graph suggests that A is polycationic, B is neutral, and C is polyanionic. This is because polycationic substances would be readily filtered due to their positive charge, while polyanionic substances would be repelled by the negatively charged barrier and exhibit low filterability. Neutral substances would fall somewhere in between, depending on their size and shape. The molecular size exclusion limit you mentioned (between 4-8 nm) is also important for determining which substances are able to be filtered.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:#0d0d0d;font-size:12.0pt;\">The filterability of substances through the kidney glomerular filtration barrier depends on their charge and size.

However, it's important to titrate this down as quickly as clinically feasible to avoid potential oxygen toxicity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">In a patient started on mechanical ventilation, ideal ventilatory settings include a tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg of ideal body weight, a respiratory rate of 12-18 breaths/min, an initial FiO2 of 100% titrated down to maintain SpO2 &gt; 95%, and a starting PEEP of 5 cm H2O. Using a tidal volume of 12 ml/kg of actual body weight is incorrect and can lead to lung injury.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia, 9th Ed.

If an <strong>Perichondral hematoma</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">is left untreated, it usually does not resolve spontaneously. Instead, it often requires intervention to prevent <strong>complications</strong> such as infection or the development of <strong>'Cauliflower</strong> <strong>ear'</strong>. The standard treatment involves <strong>aspiration</strong> of the <strong>hematoma</strong> or <strong>surgical</strong> intervention to prevent <strong>permanent</strong> <strong>deformity</strong> and to reestablish the connection between the <strong>cartilage</strong> and the overlying <strong>perichondrium</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. All cases should receive prophylactic antibiotic:&nbsp;</strong>While not all cases may strictly require prophylactic antibiotics, they are often <strong>administered</strong> in <strong>practice</strong> to <strong>prevent</strong> <strong>infection</strong>, especially because the <strong>ear</strong> <strong>cartilage</strong> is <strong>avascular</strong> and therefore more <strong>susceptible</strong> to <strong>infection</strong>. The effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics is debated, but it is a common practice, particularly when there's been a <strong>break</strong> in the <strong>skin</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. May lead to Pugilistic&nbsp;ear</strong>: This is true. A <strong>'Pugilistic</strong> <strong>ear'</strong> is another term for <strong>'Cauliflower</strong> <strong>ear'</strong>, which can occur if an auricular hematoma is not adequately treated, leading to <strong>fibrosis</strong> and <strong>cartilage</strong> <strong>deformity</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Caused by accumulation of blood in perichondrial space:&nbsp;</strong>This is correct.

Melanoma</strong>. <strong>Melanoma</strong>, also known as&nbsp;<strong>malignant melanoma</strong>, is a type of&nbsp;cancer that develops from the&nbsp;pigment-producing cells known as&nbsp;<strong>melanocytes</strong>. Melanomas typically occur in the skin.&nbsp;In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back.&nbsp;About 25% of melanomas develop from&nbsp;moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or&nbsp;skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is&nbsp;ultraviolet light&nbsp;(UV) exposure in those with low levels of the&nbsp;skin pigment&nbsp;melanin.&nbsp;Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and&nbsp;poor immune function&nbsp;are at greater risk.&nbsp;Diagnosis is by&nbsp;biopsy. Using&nbsp;sunscreen&nbsp;and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma.&nbsp;Treatment is typically removal of the melanoma and potentially affected tissue (border around the melanoma) by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby&nbsp;lymph nodes&nbsp;may be tested for metastasis.&nbsp;For those in whom melanoma has spread,&nbsp;immunotherapy,&nbsp;biologic therapy,&nbsp;radiation therapy, or&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;may improve survival.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Ochronosis</strong>. Ochronosis is named for the reddish-brown hue of tissue termed \"ochre-like\". It is inborn error of metabolism. Ochronosis is due to deposition of a phenolic compound – \"alkaptons\" polymerizing into connective tissue, leading to black urine disease called <strong>alkaptonuria</strong>. Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, alkaptonuria is an inactive gene, mapped on chromosome 3q21-23 coding for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD). The result is systemic sequestration of homogentisate, that upon the decay to benzoquinone, can irreversibly bind with collagen. Polymerization of this molecule takes on an iridescent dark hue, tinting affected tissue and turning urine black. Aside from just discoloration, these processes can cause degradation, degeneration, and developmental problems in all types of collagen. The earliest sign is from parents who notice infants’ diapers are&nbsp;black in color. This disease can be insidious and manifest later in life. Patients may&nbsp;present with back pain or large joint arthralgias in their post-teenage years or early 30s. Pigmentation of the sclera and pinna of the ear is often seen later in life. Constant tendon ruptures especially with minimal trauma. On physical examination, thickened Achilles tendon and bursa effusions are common. For alkaptonuria, a chromatography assay in the urine for homogentisate can be diagnostic, especially, if the color change is noted after being exposed to the air.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A genetic test can determine the existence of the autosomal recessive disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Rosai-Dorfman syndrome.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Rosai-Dorfman disease is a disease that occurs when the body produces too many histiocytes in the lymph nodes. These histiocytes accumulate in the cervical nodes most commonly. Histiocytes may also build up in the skin, upper respiratory tract, and sinuses. Rosai-Dorfman disease is seldom life-threatening. In many instances, the patient’s symptoms resolve on their own. The majority of patients experience enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. While often painless, these nodes can swell and grow rather larger. Swelling may also be reported in the lymph nodes of the groin, armpits, and in the central portion of the chest. This swelling may be accompanied by fever. The diagnosis is made following a tissue biopsy from the affected site. Though it is most commonly diagnosed in the first 10 years of life, it is also found in adults, affecting men and women equally.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image in the question shows extracellular metal deposits (black deposits) surrounded by inflammatory cells, suggestive of metallosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">It is associated with metal-on-metal prosthetic devices.</span></li></ul>",

In certain situations, other cells, such as monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, can be involved. After antigen exposure, an initial local immune and inflammatory response occurs that attracts leukocytes. The antigen engulfed by the macrophages and monocytes is presented to T cells, which then becomes sensitized and activated. These cells then release cytokines and chemokines, which can cause tissue damage and may result in illnesses.

The paretic muscles can be right eye elevator or left eye depressor.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Right superior rectus</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Right inferior oblique</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Left inferior rectus</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Left superior oblique</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Step 2.</strong> Does the hypotropia increase in the right gaze or left gaze?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hypotropia increases in right gaze.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Therefore, the paretic muscle must be either (1) one of the muscles whose primary action is elevating the right eye on the right gaze, or (2) one of the muscles whose primary action is depressing the left eye in the right gaze. The left inferior oblique and the right superior rectus both have a primary action of elevation in right gaze. Therefore, one of these muscles could be the paretic muscle. Likewise, the left superior oblique and the right inferior rectus have a primary action of depression in the right gaze and could be paretic. But since the left inferior oblique and the right inferior rectus did not meet step 1, they can be eliminated from the possible paretic muscles. This leaves us:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Left superior oblique</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Right superior rectus</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Step 3.</strong> Does the hypotropia increase in the right head tilt or left head tilt?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hypotropia increases in the right head tilt. If the deviation increases on right head tilt and decreases on left head tilt, as it does in this example patient, then the right superior rectus is implicated as the paretic culprit.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Right superior oblique:</strong> Incorrect, as paralysis typically leads to hypertropia and excyclotorsion, not hypotropia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Right inferior oblique:</strong> Incorrect, as paralysis would not result in the described pattern of hypotropia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Left inferior oblique:</strong> Incorrect, since paralysis here does not explain the increase in hypotropia with right head tilt and right gaze.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The three-step test is a vital diagnostic tool in strabismus evaluations to identify which extraocular muscle is paretic based on the changes in eye position with head tilt and gaze direction. In this scenario, the findings align with a right superior rectus muscle palsy, consistent with its role in elevating the right eye especially during right gaze and head tilt to the right.</span></p>",

Streptokinase is specifically used in the treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) where there is a fibrin-rich thrombus completely occluding a coronary artery. NSTEMI, in contrast, involves a partial occlusion by a platelet-rich thrombus, and fibrinolytics are generally not recommended because they are less effective and could potentially increase the risk of bleeding without significant benefits.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.
