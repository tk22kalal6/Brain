B) Endothelin antagonists improve symptoms</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The patient has pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma, specifically type 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The right heart catheterization confirms the diagnosis, which is the gold standard for assessing pulmonary hypertension. In patients with PAH, especially those related to connective tissue diseases like scleroderma, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), such as Bosentan, Ambrisentan, and Macitentan, are commonly used to improve symptoms and enhance the patient's functional status. ERAs work by blocking the effects of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor, thus reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and improving outcomes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. CCBs are the first line in all patients:</strong> Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) are not universally used as first-line treatment in all PAH patients. They are only indicated for patients who have a positive response to vasoreactivity testing. For those without a positive response, other targeted therapies, such as endothelin antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, or prostacyclin analogs, are more appropriate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Lung transplant is the best treatment if identified early:</strong> Although lung transplant may be an option for severe, refractory cases, it is not considered the best treatment due to the complexity and risks associated with the procedure, especially in PAH patients. It is generally reserved for those who fail medical therapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Lifestyle modification:</strong> While lifestyle changes can support overall health, they do not directly address the underlying pathophysiology of PAH. Therefore, lifestyle modifications alone are not sufficient as a primary treatment approach for pulmonary hypertension, especially when associated with scleroderma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Endothelin receptor antagonists are effective in improving symptoms and functional status in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with scleroderma.</span></p>",

Add Prednisolone 10mg:</strong> Prednisolone is a systemic corticosteroid, which is generally reserved for severe asthma exacerbations or patients who do not respond to standard therapy (steps 5 and 6 of the asthma management algorithm). Long-term use is associated with significant side effects, making it inappropriate for this patient’s current condition.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

This makes it particularly useful for identifying multiple causative agents in a single test, such as when diagnosing conditions like diarrhea that can be caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.

It is characterized by a partial quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Patients usually have mild bleeding symptoms, and treatment with Desmopressin (DDAVP), which stimulates the release of vWF from endothelial cells, is often effective. Type 1 is not severe, contrary to what option A states.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Type 2</strong>: This type involves a qualitative defect in vWF, meaning the protein is present but does not function properly. There are several subtypes (2A, 2B, 2M, 2N), each with distinct functional defects.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Type 3</strong>: This is the most severe form of vWD, characterized by a near-total or complete absence of vWF. Patients with Type 3 often have symptoms similar to hemophilia, including severe bleeding and very low levels of factor VIII, since vWF stabilizes and carries factor VIII.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Key findings in this condition include elevated JVP with a prominent ‘Y’ descent, irregularly irregular pulse, and signs of systemic congestion like edema. The high-pitched diastolic sound referred to as a pericardial knock is characteristic of constrictive pericarditis and reflects the abrupt cessation of ventricular filling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The prominent ‘Y’ descent in JVP is particularly significant in constrictive pericarditis and is also known as Friderich’s sign.

A fistula in ano is an abnormal connection between the interior of the anal canal and the perianal skin. It often presents as a recurrent swelling or abscess near the anal verge, which may drain spontaneously. The key clues include the location of the swelling near the anal verge and the history of recurrent discharge, making it characteristic of a fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Pilonidal Sinus:&nbsp;</strong>A pilonidal sinus is typically found in the upper part of the natal cleft, far from the anal verge, and is associated with hair follicles in the gluteal region. It commonly affects young men with a hairy back and is located above the coccyx, not near the anus. The key distinction is the location; pilonidal sinuses are not found at the anal verge but higher up in the gluteal cleft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"304\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Fissure in Ano:&nbsp;</strong>A fissure in ano is a linear tear in the lining of the anus, usually caused by trauma or hard stools. It presents with pain during defecation and bright red bleeding but not with a swelling or external opening as seen in fistula in ano. There may be a hypertrophic skin tag covering it (Sentinel pile). Fissures do not have a history of recurrent discharge or a swelling appearance near the anal verge.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120048.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"260\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemorrhoids:&nbsp;</strong>Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus and typically present with painless bleeding, itching, and swelling inside the anal canal or at the anal verge. They do not present with the external openings, recurrent abscesses, or discharging sinuses characteristic of fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120109.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"361\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fistula in Ano should be considered when there is a history of recurrent swelling, abscess formation, or discharge near the anal verge. It is distinguished from pilonidal sinus by its lower location near the anal canal, as opposed to pilonidal sinuses that occur higher up in the natal cleft.</span></p>",

It works by inhibiting the proteasome, which is essential for protein degradation in cells, leading to the accumulation of proteins that induce cell death, particularly in cancer cells. However, Bortezomib is also an immunosuppressant, and one of its known side effects is an increased risk of reactivating latent infections, including <strong>herpes zoster</strong> (shingles). Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which remains dormant in nerve tissue after an initial chickenpox infection. Immunosuppressive therapies can lower the body's immune response, allowing this virus to reactivate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.

PEEP works by maintaining a certain amount of pressure in the lungs at the end of expiration, which helps to keep the alveoli open, preventing their collapse (atelectasis). This is especially important in the prone position, where the distribution of ventilation can be more uniform, improving oxygenation and lung mechanics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

CO2 removal is more dependent on ventilation rate and tidal volume.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Decreases inspiratory pressure:</strong> This option is incorrect because PEEP typically increases the baseline pressure in the lungs, which can actually increase the overall mean airway pressure during inspiration.

A) Blocks adenosine action and causes wakefulness</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Caffeine is a stimulant that is commonly consumed to reduce fatigue and increase alertness. Its primary mechanism of action in promoting wakefulness is through blocking the action of adenosine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that promotes sleep and relaxation by binding to adenosine receptors. Normally, when adenosine binds to its receptors, it leads to drowsiness and a decrease in nerve cell activity. Caffeine, due to its structural similarity to adenosine, competes for these receptors but does not activate them. Instead, it blocks the action of adenosine, preventing the onset of sleepiness and promoting wakefulness.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option B. Activates locus coeruleus and causes wakefulness:</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> The locus coeruleus is a nucleus in the brainstem involved in physiological responses to stress and panic, and it is active during REM sleep to help regulate wakefulness. However, caffeine does not directly activate the locus coeruleus to cause wakefulness; instead, its wakefulness-promoting effect is primarily through adenosine receptor blockade.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option C. No role in maintaining wakefulness if taken 1hr before sleep:</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> This statement is incorrect because caffeine does play a significant role in maintaining wakefulness even if consumed an hour before sleep. Caffeine has a half-life of about 5-6 hours, meaning it remains active in the system for several hours after consumption, potentially leading to difficulty falling asleep.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option D. Activates histamine release and prevents sleep:</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in wakefulness, but caffeine does not exert its wakefulness-promoting effects through histamine release. The primary mechanism is through blocking adenosine receptors, not activating histamine release.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational Objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Caffeine promotes wakefulness primarily by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, thereby preventing the sleep-inducing effects of adenosine.</span></span></span></p>",

A saccular aneurysm is characterized by an outpouching or sac-like bulge on one side of the blood vessel.

STSG is the preferred choice for covering a large, healing wound with healthy granulation tissue, such as a burn or degloving injury. It involves taking a thin layer of skin from a donor site and applying it to the wound. This type of graft covers large areas and is effective in promoting wound healing with adequate tissue coverage while maintaining flexibility. It is generally used on body areas where cosmesis is less of a priority compared to the face, which would require a full thickness graft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. &nbsp;Full thickness skin graft:</strong> This graft involves both the epidermis and the entire dermis and is typically used for areas requiring greater cosmetic outcomes, such as the face. It is not generally used for large wounds with healthy granulation tissue, as STSG would suffice and cover larger areas with a better healing outcome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. &nbsp;VAC dressing:</strong> Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressing is used for non-healing or chronic wounds that require additional stimulation for granulation tissue formation and wound contraction. It is not needed when the wound already has healthy granulation tissue and is progressing well in healing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. &nbsp;Flap:</strong> A flap is used when there is a need for bulk tissue to cover a deep or complex wound that involves structures like bone, tendons, or joints.

In patients with a history of alcohol dependence who present with hypoglycemia, it is crucial to administer thiamine before giving dextrose. The administration of dextrose without thiamine can precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy, a serious neurological condition caused by thiamine deficiency. This is because dextrose administration increases the demand for thiamine as it is required for carbohydrate metabolism, thus depleting the already low thiamine reserves.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Therefore, thiamine should be given intramuscularly (i.m) first to replenish the body's stores and prevent neurological complications, followed by the administration of dextrose to correct hypoglycemia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Normal Saline</strong>: While normal saline can be used to maintain hydration, it does not address the critical issue of hypoglycemia or thiamine deficiency in this patient.

Supplementation with vitamin B6 can enhance the activity of the residual enzyme, helping to reduce homocysteine levels in responsive patients, thus mitigating the symptoms and reducing the risk of complications such as thrombosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Note </strong>–</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The causes of <strong>ectopia lentis</strong> include several conditions, such as <strong>Marfan's syndrome</strong>, <strong>homocystinuria</strong>, <strong>Weill-Marchesani syndrome</strong>, and <strong>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</strong>. These are important to remember when identifying the underlying cause of lens dislocation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Vitamin B12:</strong> While vitamin B12 is also involved in homocysteine metabolism, deficiencies in B12 are not directly related to the presentation seen in homocystinuria. B12 supplementation is more relevant to other conditions such as pernicious anemia or when correcting elevated homocysteine due to B12 deficiency, but it is not the primary treatment for homocystinuria.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Thiamine:</strong> Thiamine (vitamin B1) is not involved in the metabolic pathway of homocysteine. It plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism and is associated with conditions like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and beriberi but not with homocystinuria.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

A) Extranodal extension</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of cancer beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding tissues. This feature has recently been added as a significant factor in the staging and management of head and neck cancers, including oral malignancies. ENE is associated with a poorer prognosis due to its aggressive nature and higher likelihood of recurrence. Therefore, it is a major criterion for adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery and MRND (modified radical neck dissection), as radiotherapy can help reduce the risk of local recurrence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

T3 tumor:</strong> T3 tumors are generally considered advanced due to their size and extent. However, adjuvant radiotherapy is more strongly indicated when other adverse pathological features, such as ENE or involved surgical margins, are present.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Close margin (1.5-2 mm):&nbsp;</strong>Close surgical margins indicate that the tumor was resected near the boundary of normal tissue, increasing the risk of residual disease.

A) Tracheostomy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A tracheostomy involves creating an opening through the neck into the trachea, which may become complicated when the trachea is deviated. In cases of tracheal deviation, the trachea is not in its usual midline position, which can make locating the correct spot for incision more challenging. This difficulty is increased because the trachea's position may not be easily palpable or visible due to its displacement, which can complicate the procedure and increase the risk of complications.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_aEVEcW6.png\" width=\"367\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Laryngeal airway:</strong> A laryngeal airway (LMA) is inserted above the larynx at the supraglottic level. Since this procedure does not involve the trachea directly, a deviated trachea does not affect the placement of an LMA, making it relatively easy to perform.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_T5agVaS.png\" width=\"306\" height=\"231\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Endotracheal intubation:</strong> While endotracheal intubation may become slightly more difficult with tracheal deviation, it usually remains manageable. The main challenge might be encountering some resistance or needing to adjust the angle of the tube. However, with careful maneuvering, the endotracheal tube can still be guided into the trachea.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_f8aYTbB.png\" width=\"443\" height=\"342\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cricothyroidotomy:</strong> This procedure involves making an incision through the cricothyroid membrane, located above the trachea at the level of the larynx. Because the tracheal deviation occurs below this point, it does not directly impact the cricothyroidotomy, making it a viable option even with tracheal deviation.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_H46wIa0.png\" width=\"594\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tracheostomy can be more challenging in cases of tracheal deviation due to the altered position of the trachea, making the precise location for incision difficult to identify.</span></p>",

A) BAL</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">BAL (British Anti-Lewisite), also known as Dimercaprol, is contraindicated in cases of iron overdose. This is because BAL forms toxic complexes with iron, which can worsen the patient’s condition.

In this case, the image and description of the uterus with the placenta still attached indicate PAS. The typical presentation involves severe intraoperative bleeding because the placenta does not detach easily from the uterine wall, necessitating an obstetric hysterectomy to control the hemorrhage. This condition is common in patients with a history of cesarean sections (LSCS) due to scarring in the uterine wall, making placental attachment more likely. Diagnosing PAS antenatally can alter management strategies, such as planning an <strong>elective upper segment cesarean section</strong> <strong>between 34-37 weeks</strong> and avoiding the lower uterine segment to minimize bleeding and complications.

However, MgSO₄ toxicity can occur, which necessitates stopping or adjusting the dose. The first sign of MgSO₄ toxicity is the absence of deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), followed by respiratory depression and reduced urine output. Since magnesium is excreted through the kidneys, urine output is a critical measure of magnesium toxicity risk. A urine output of <strong>less than 30 ml per hour</strong> (or 60 ml in 4 hours) indicates poor excretion and potential toxicity, requiring immediate adjustment or cessation of MgSO₄.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The presentation of grouped painful vesicular lesions on an erythematous base in the genital area, especially in a patient with a history of multiple sexual partners and irregular condom use, is highly suggestive of herpes genitalis. The presence of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) on a smear is a key diagnostic feature of HSV infection.

The lesions do not cluster in the genital area unless the sacral nerve is involved, which is uncommon. Also, the absence of a dermatomal pattern makes this diagnosis less likely.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C.

It is often caused by barotrauma, which can lead to an acute deterioration in ventilated patients, presenting with sudden hypoxemia and increased peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). The clinical signs of absent or reduced breath sounds on one side strongly indicate pneumothorax.

Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance, often seen in conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and, in some cases, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Insulin resistance impairs the body’s ability to utilize glucose efficiently. When TPN, which is high in glucose, is administered, the already compromised insulin response leads to elevated blood glucose levels, resulting in hyperglycemia. This is a common complication in patients receiving TPN, especially those with underlying metabolic conditions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Reactive Hypoglycemia:&nbsp;</strong>Reactive hypoglycemia is a condition where blood glucose levels drop excessively after eating, due to an overproduction of insulin. It is not typically associated with TPN or metabolic syndrome, as TPN administration generally leads to hyperglycemia rather than hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Hyperlipidemia:&nbsp;</strong>While hyperlipidemia is a component of metabolic syndrome, it is not a direct complication specifically associated with TPN. Although TPN can contain lipids, its primary complication related to metabolic syndrome is hyperglycemia due to glucose intolerance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hyperuricemia:&nbsp;</strong>Hyperuricemia, characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, can be associated with metabolic syndrome but is not directly induced by TPN administration. The primary metabolic disturbance from TPN in these patients is related to glucose management rather than uric acid levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In patients with metabolic syndrome, TPN can exacerbate hyperglycemia due to pre-existing insulin resistance.

The clinical presentation typically includes fatigue, weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium).

However, polished rice, commonly consumed in many parts of the world, loses much of its thiamine content due to the removal of the outer layer during polishing. This loss is a contributing factor to thiamine deficiency in populations that primarily consume polished rice, leading to conditions such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, especially among chronic alcoholics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option A.&nbsp; Cucumber and onion:</strong> These items are not significant sources of thiamine.
