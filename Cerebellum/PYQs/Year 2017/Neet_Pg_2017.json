A) Aortic Regurgitation</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Duroziez's sign is a clinical finding specifically associated with aortic regurgitation. This sign consists of a to-and-fro murmur heard over the femoral artery when it is lightly compressed with a stethoscope.

Tricuspid Regurgitation</strong>: Tricuspid regurgitation is characterized by prominent c-v waves in the jugular venous pulse, a systolic murmur along the left sternal border that increases with inspiration (Carvallo's sign), and signs of right heart failure including hepatomegaly, ascites, and edema. Duroziez's sign, which involves the femoral artery, is not associated with tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C.

Duroziez's sign is not characteristic of mitral stenosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Pericardial Effusion</strong>: Pericardial effusion is associated with muffled heart sounds, increased cardiac dullness to percussion, electrical alternans on ECG in large effusions, and pulsus paradoxus.

Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia (&gt;8–10 mM in 24 h or 18 mM in 48 h) disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, allowing immune mediators to enter and contribute to demyelination.

Though myopic patients may have increased risk for glaucoma, posterior staphyloma is primarily associated with pathological myopia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Iridocyclitis:</strong> This is incorrect. Iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis) primarily affects the iris and ciliary body in the anterior segment of the eye. Posterior staphyloma occurs in the posterior segment and is not a feature of inflammatory conditions of the anterior uvea. Iridocyclitis typically presents with pain, photophobia, and circumcorneal injection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Posterior staphyloma is a defining feature of pathological myopia resulting from weakening and outward bulging of the posterior sclera due to excessive axial elongation, leading to characteristic fundus changes and increased risk for macular pathology.</span></p>",

A) Applanation Tonometry</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Applanation tonometry is specifically based on the Imbert-Fick Law (P=F/A), where pressure equals force divided by area. This principle states that the pressure inside an ideal sphere equals the force necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area of flattening. In applanation tonometry, the instrument's footplate flattens the cornea, and the pressure required for this flattening directly correlates with intraocular pressure. Fluorescein dye is used during the procedure, viewed under cobalt blue light to identify when the mires juxtapose each other, indicating the measurement endpoint.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Indentation Tonometry:</strong> This method, exemplified by the Schiotz tonometer, works on a different principle where a plunger indents the cornea. It depends on the relationship between the depth of corneal indentation and intraocular pressure, and is affected by scleral rigidity. It does not utilize the Imbert-Fick Law.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Dynamic Contour Tonometry:</strong> This is a more recent technique using a contoured tip that matches the shape of the cornea to minimize distortion. It uses a pressure sensor to directly measure intraocular pressure rather than applying the Imbert-Fick principle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Rebound Tonometry:</strong> This technique involves propelling a small probe toward the cornea and analyzing its rebound characteristics. The deceleration of the probe upon corneal impact correlates with IOP. It works on principles of motion dynamics rather than the Imbert-Fick Law.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The Imbert-Fick Law (P=F/A) is the fundamental principle behind applanation tonometry, where the force required to flatten a specific area of cornea directly correlates with intraocular pressure - making it the gold standard for IOP measurement.</span></p>",

Higher lipid solubility allows for better penetration through nerve membranes which contain lipid bilayers. This relationship is clearly established in anesthesiology, where potency directly correlates with lipid solubility. The more lipid-soluble a local anesthetic is, the lower the concentration needed to produce effective anesthesia. This explains why highly lipid-soluble agents like dibucaine and bupivacaine are more potent than less lipid-soluble agents like procaine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. pKa</strong>: pKa affects the onset of action rather than potency. A lower pKa means more of the drug exists in the non-ionized form at physiological pH, allowing faster penetration of nerve membranes and quicker onset.

After proteins are synthesized by ribosomes and processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, they are transported to the Golgi apparatus where they undergo further modifications like glycosylation. The Golgi then packages proteins into transport vesicles and directs them to their appropriate destinations within or outside the cell based on specific sorting signals. Localization sequences within proteins serve as molecular \"zip codes\" that the Golgi recognizes to ensure proper targeting to destinations such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or for secretion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Mitochondria:</strong> While mitochondria import specific proteins targeted to them, they do not function as general protein sorting organelles for the cell. Mitochondria are primarily involved in energy production through oxidative phosphorylation and contain their own genome and protein synthesis machinery.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C.

Piezoelectric crystals in transducers are the fundamental components that enable ultrasound imaging by converting electrical energy to sound waves and vice versa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Transducers produce waves by piezoelectric effect</strong> - CORRECT statement. Ultrasound transducers use piezoelectric crystals (specifically PZT) to convert electrical energy into mechanical (sound) waves through the piezoelectric effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Transducers receive waves by reverse piezoelectric effect</strong> - CORRECT statement. When ultrasound waves return to the transducer, they cause the piezoelectric crystals to vibrate, converting mechanical energy back into electrical signals through the reverse piezoelectric effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) has marked piezoelectric effect</strong> - CORRECT statement. PZT is the material used for piezoelectric crystals in ultrasound transducers precisely because of its strong piezoelectric properties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The piezoelectric effect is fundamental to ultrasound imaging technology through both the generation of sound waves and the reception of echoes, but has no role in MRI technology which operates on completely different physical principles.</p>",

Follicular carcinoma typically presents as a solitary thyroid nodule with a strong tendency for hematogenous spread rather than lymphatic spread.

In fact, enlarged cervical lymph nodes may be the presenting feature of papillary carcinoma in some cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid</strong> - Incorrect because medullary carcinoma frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes. Involvement of lymph nodes occurs in 50-60% of cases of medullary carcinoma. This tumor, which arises from parafollicular C cells, also commonly spreads hematogenously, with the liver being the most common site of distant metastasis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D.

These vegetations are notably friable (easily crumbled) due to their composition of fibrin, platelets, inflammatory cells, and large numbers of microorganisms. The friable nature of these vegetations makes them prone to fragmentation, leading to septic embolization which can cause infarcts in distant organs. These lesions are typically bulky and destructive compared to other types of vegetative endocarditis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

In fact, the opposite occurs in apoptosis - cells undergoing apoptosis demonstrate cell shrinkage rather than swelling. Apoptosis is characterized by reduction in cell size (shrinkage) and the formation of membrane-bound fragments called apoptotic bodies. This is in contrast to necrosis, where cellular swelling is a prominent early feature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The morphologic features of apoptosis include cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation (nuclear compaction), formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies, and maintenance of an intact plasma membrane until late in the process.

Intact cell membrane</strong> - This is a feature of apoptosis. Unlike necrosis where there is early loss of membrane integrity, in apoptosis the plasma membrane remains intact throughout most of the process. This prevents leakage of cellular contents and thus prevents inflammation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cytoplasmic eosinophilia</strong> - This is a feature of apoptosis. The cytoplasm of apoptotic cells appears more eosinophilic (red) when stained with H&amp;E due to increased protein density as the cell shrinks and becomes more compact. Apoptotic cells are often described as having a rounded or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Apoptosis features cell shrinkage (not swelling), intact plasma membrane, nuclear compaction, and increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, representing a regulated form of cell death that avoids inflammation, in contrast to necrosis which is characterized by cellular swelling and membrane rupture.</span></p>",

Phenothiazines</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Miosis refers to pupillary constriction, often described as \"pinpoint pupils\" in severe cases. Phenothiazines, which include chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic medications, produce mydriasis (pupillary dilation) rather than miosis due to their antagonistic effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. This anticholinergic activity blocks the parasympathetic stimulation of the pupillary sphincter muscles, preventing constriction and allowing for pupillary dilation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In toxicological assessment, pupillary examination is critical because it often provides immediate diagnostic clues. The classic triad of opioid toxidrome includes respiratory depression, CNS depression, and miosis. This characteristic pinpoint pupil appearance has high diagnostic value, particularly when unresponsive to light in severe intoxication. Pupillary changes usually persist even in comatose states, making them valuable signs when patients cannot provide history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Option&nbsp;A.

Morphine</strong> - Causes significant miosis by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. The miosis is often extreme and unreactive to light stimuli in significant overdose, making it a cardinal sign in opioid toxicity.</li><li><strong>Option&nbsp;C.

This effect is dose-dependent and remains present even when other symptoms fluctuate.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pupillary examination provides rapid diagnostic information in toxicology cases - miosis indicates opioids, organophosphates or clonidine, while mydriasis suggests anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, or phenothiazines like chlorpromazine.</p>",

Late distal tubule and collecting duc</strong>t</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In central diabetes insipidus, there is a deficiency of ADH (vasopressin) secretion from the posterior pituitary. Without ADH, the collecting ducts become <strong>relatively impermeable to water</strong>. This causes the already dilute fluid entering from the distal tubule to remain hypotonic without the normal water reabsorption that would concentrate it. In diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality can be extremely low (50-100 mOsm/L) due to this lack of water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;A.

This notch is specifically caused by vibrations set up when the aortic valve snaps shut. The dicrotic notch occurs at the end of ventricular systole when the aortic pressure exceeds left ventricular pressure, causing the aortic valve to close. This closure creates a brief backward movement of blood and subsequent rebound, generating the characteristic notch in the aortic pressure tracing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;A. Closing of the mitral valve</strong> The mitral valve closes at the beginning of ventricular systole, not during the falling phase of aortic pressure. Mitral valve closure contributes to the first heart sound (S1) and occurs before ejection of blood into the aorta, so it cannot be responsible for the dicrotic notch.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;B. Closing of the tricuspid valve</strong> The tricuspid valve closes at the beginning of right ventricular systole, similar to mitral valve closure. It has no direct effect on aortic pressure and occurs much earlier in the cardiac cycle than the dicrotic notch.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;D. Rapid filling of the left ventricle</strong> Rapid filling of the left ventricle occurs during early diastole, after the aortic valve has closed.

This occurs because alkalosis decreases the ionized fraction of calcium in the blood without affecting total calcium levels.

Specifically, the middle fibers of the deltoid are powerful abductors of the arm at the shoulder joint. The deltoid is a triangular muscle that covers the shoulder joint and gives the shoulder its rounded contour. It is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5, C6). The multipennate arrangement of its acromial fibers allows for strong abduction force, making it the main muscle for this movement range.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option&nbsp;a) Supraspinatus</strong> - While controversial, the supraspinatus is traditionally thought to initiate abduction (0°-15°) rather than being the primary muscle for 15°-90° abduction.

During a fugue, individuals often appear well-groomed and behave in a seemingly normal, goal-directed way, which reflects preserved self-care and orientation. However, once the fugue ends, they usually experience amnesia for what occurred during the episode. While in the fugue state, they might not even recognize anything is wrong and may deny memory issues. These episodes can last from minutes to months, and some individuals may have recurrent fugues. In DSM-5, dissociative fugue is considered a specifier of dissociative amnesia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

In DSM-5, dissociative fugue has been made a subtype of dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Schizophrenia:</strong> People with schizophrenia may wander, but it’s typically disorganized or bizarre rather than purposeful. There are other signs also&nbsp; like hallucinations, delusions, or negative symptoms. The person’s well-groomed appearance and coherent behavior is&nbsp; against this diagnosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Dementia:</strong> Wandering can happen in dementia, but the onset is usually gradual, and the person often appears disheveled or confused. Dementia-related wandering stems from memory loss and impaired judgment, not dissociation. Plus, the sudden nature described in this case doesn't fit with how dementia typically presents.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If someone suddenly leaves home and ends up in a new place with intact self-care, normal-seeming behavior, and later has no memory of it, it must be dissociative fugu<strong>e</strong>—especially if there are no psychotic or neurocognitive symptoms present.</span></p>",

PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine.

This occurs due to a pathological connection between the sound-conducting system and the vestibular apparatus. Loud sounds cause abnormal stimulation of the vestibular system, resulting in vestibular symptoms. This phenomenon is seen in conditions like superior semicircular canal dehiscence, perilymphatic fistula, and advanced otosyphilis where there is an abnormal communication between the inner ear fluid compartments.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Hennebert's Sign</strong>: This refers to the development of vertigo and nystagmus on applying pressure to the external auditory canal (positive fistula test) in the absence of a demonstrable fistula (false positive). It is typically seen in congenital syphilis due to the presence of fibrous adhesions between the stapes footplate and the membranous labyrinth. Unlike Tullio phenomenon which is triggered by sound, Hennebert's sign is elicited by pressure changes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Roll-over Phenomenon</strong>: This is seen in retrocochlear hearing loss (e.g., acoustic neuroma). It refers to a decrease in speech discrimination scores as the intensity of sound is increased beyond a certain level. Unlike Tullio phenomenon, it does not involve vertigo and is related to hearing discrimination rather than vestibular function.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Recruitment Phenomenon</strong>: This is the abnormal growth of loudness perception seen in cochlear hearing loss. Patients with cochlear lesions have difficulty hearing soft sounds, but as intensity increases, they perceive loudness as rapidly growing to normal or even uncomfortable levels. This phenomenon affects hearing rather than balance and does not cause vertigo.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tullio phenomenon specifically describes the vestibular symptoms (vertigo and nystagmus) induced by loud sounds due to pathological communication between the sound-conducting and vestibular systems of the inner ear.</span></p>",

Triptorelin is actually a GnRH agonist (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonist) that, when administered continuously, leads to downregulation of pituitary GnRH receptors, resulting in suppression of FSH and LH release, and consequently decreasing testosterone and estrogen levels.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: D. Tofacitinib</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tofacitinib is a synthetic non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that acts as a JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor. It specifically inhibits JAK-3 and JAK-1 kinases, interfering with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and DNA transcription. Tofacitinib inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokine release. It's classified among the conventional DMARDs as an inhibitor of JAK, along with baricitinib (which is also used in COVID-19).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Option A. Etanercept</strong> - This is a biological DMARD that works by inhibiting TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha). It's administered through subcutaneous route and is categorized among the TNF-α inhibitors including Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept, Infliximab, and Golimumab.</li><li><strong>Option B. Tocilizumab</strong> - This is a biological DMARD that acts as an IL-6 receptor antagonist. It was the first IL-6 targeted monoclonal antibody and is approved for treatment of cytokine release syndrome as well.</li><li><strong>Option C. Abatacept</strong> - This is a biological DMARD classified as a co-stimulation inhibitor. It functions by inhibiting the interaction between T-cells and Antigen Presenting Cells (APC).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tofacitinib represents a distinct class of DMARDs that targets intracellular signaling via JAK inhibition, whereas biological DMARDs like etanercept, tocilizumab, and abatacept target specific extracellular cytokines or cell-surface interactions.</p>",

NK1 receptor antagonist</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aprepitant is a selective, high-affinity NK1 receptor antagonist that blocks the emetic action of substance P. It works by specifically binding to neurokinin-1 receptors in the central nervous system, particularly in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). This mechanism is distinct from the more common 5-HT3 receptor antagonists used as antiemetics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Option A. RANK ligand inhibitor</strong> - This mechanism belongs to drugs affecting bone metabolism like denosumab, not to antiemetic medications.</li><li><strong>Option B. NMDA antagonist</strong> - This mechanism relates to certain anesthetics and analgesics, not to aprepitant or other antiemetics.</li><li><strong>Option D. 5-HT3 antagonist</strong> - While this is the mechanism for ondansetron, granisetron, and palonosetron, aprepitant specifically works through NK1 receptors with minimal effect on 5-HT3 receptors.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Aprepitant's unique NK1 receptor antagonism makes it particularly valuable for preventing delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting when combined with 5-HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone, providing superior control over the complete course of CINV.</span></p>",
