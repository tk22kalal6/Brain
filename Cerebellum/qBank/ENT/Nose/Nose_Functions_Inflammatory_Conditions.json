      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;B) Autonomic imbalance causing parasympathetic overactivity; Vidian neurectomy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Vasomotor rhinitis results from autonomic nervous system imbalance with parasympathetic overactivity causing vasodilation and sinusoidal engorgement of nasal mucosa. The Vidian nerve, formed by parasympathetic fibers from the greater superficial petrosal nerve (branch of facial nerve) and sympathetic fibers from the deep petrosal nerve, can be surgically sectioned (Vidian neurectomy) to reduce excessive nasal secretions and congestion refractory to medical therapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. IgE-mediated mast cell activation; nasal polypectomy:&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. IgE-mediated mast cell activation is characteristic of allergic rhinitis, which is ruled out by negative allergy testing. Nasal polypectomy treats nasal polyps, not vasomotor rhinitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Chronic bacterial infection causing mucosal swelling; functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS):&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. Chronic bacterial infections cause different symptoms and are managed by FESS only if sinus disease is present.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Structural nasal deviation causing airflow turbulence; septoplasty:&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. Structural abnormalities cause obstruction but do not explain autonomic imbalance or negative allergy tests.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Additional points:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Medical management includes avoidance of triggers (temperature, humidity), antihistamines, decongestants, steroids, and tranquilizers.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The Vidian nerve carries parasympathetic fibers that stimulate nasal gland secretion; its section reduces symptoms in refractory cases.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Vasomotor rhinitis is caused by autonomic imbalance with parasympathetic overactivity leading to nasal congestion; refractory cases may benefit from Vidian neurectomy, which interrupts parasympathetic innervation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ref: P.L Dhingra, Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat and Head and Neck Surgery, 6th Edition, pg 170</strong></span></p>",
