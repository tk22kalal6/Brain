      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans. A) It is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, affecting mostly the nasal mucosa and extending to the larynx and bronchi.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_cTQTGsn.png\" width=\"348\" height=\"266\"></strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (Frisch bacillus). The disease typically starts in the nose and can extend to the nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx (especially subglottic region), trachea, and bronchi. It affects both sexes and all ages, with a higher incidence in northern India.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. The disease primarily affects the southern parts of India and mostly females above 50 years of age.</strong> Incorrect. The disease is endemic in several parts of the world and is seen more often in the northern parts of India than the southern parts. It affects both sexes and any age group, not specifically females above 50.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. The granulomatous stage is characterized by painful ulcerative nodules and nasal bleeding:&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. In the granulomatous stage, painless, non-ulcerative granulomatous nodules form in the nasal mucosa with subdermal infiltration causing a “woody” feel to the lower external nose and upper lip. Painful ulcerative nodules and bleeding are not typical features.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Treatment consists only of surgical correction for nasal deformity without any antibiotic therapy:&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. Treatment requires a combination of antibiotics, specifically streptomycin and tetracycline for at least 4–6 weeks, and is repeated if necessary until cultures from biopsy material become negative. Steroids may be added to reduce fibrosis. Surgical treatment is only for airway management and correcting deformity, not the sole treatment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Additional facts:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The disease progresses through three stages: atrophic (foul-smelling purulent nasal discharge and crusting), granulomatous (painless nodules and woody infiltration), and cicatricial (stenosis, nasal deformity, adhesions, and possible subglottic stenosis causing respiratory distress).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Diagnosis is by biopsy showing plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells (large foam cells with bacilli), and Russell bodies (eosinophilic inclusion bodies in plasma cells).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Mikulicz cells and Russell bodies are diagnostic of rhinoscleroma.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_DeROCsx.png\" width=\"467\" height=\"347\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Miculikz cells</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis affecting nasal and respiratory mucosa, diagnosed by biopsy showing Mikulicz cells, and treated with prolonged streptomycin and tetracycline therapy along with possible surgical intervention.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ref: P.L Dhingra Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat and Head and Neck Surgery, 6th Edition, pg 156</strong></span></p>",
