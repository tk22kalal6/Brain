The <strong>NMHP</strong> focuses on <strong>integrating mental health services</strong> with <strong>primary health care</strong>, establishing <strong>tertiary care institutions</strong> for <strong>complex cases</strong>, and <strong>combating the stigma</strong> associated with <strong>mental illnesses</strong>. However, offering <strong>free medication</strong> to all patients is often <strong>not feasible</strong> or included as a core strategy due to logistical, financial, and practical considerations.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;<strong>A.
