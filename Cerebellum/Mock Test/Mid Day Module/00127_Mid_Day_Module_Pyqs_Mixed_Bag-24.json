Dermoid cyst</strong>. A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure.&nbsp;These benign tumors are lined by stratified squamous epithelium with mature skin appendages found on their wall and their lumens filled with keratin and hair.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts are considered to be congenital, but not all of them are diagnosed at birth.&nbsp;Only about 40% of dermoid cysts are diagnosed at birth, while about 60% are diagnosed by five years of age. The dermoid cysts usually present within the first year of life and grow slowly.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts occur most commonly on the head and neck. The etiology of dermoid cysts&nbsp;remains mostly unknown. These occur when skin and skin structures become trapped during fetal development.&nbsp;In the head and neck region, dermoid cysts can most commonly be seen in the frontal, occipital, and supraorbital areas, with the outer third of the eyebrow being the most frequently affected region.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture13_fTE459u.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after multiple myeloma. It is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. All patients report progressive pain. Night pain is also reported in about 25% patients. Characteristic findings are Codman’s triangle and Sunburst periosteal reaction. It is the most radioresistant bone tumor and treated by chemotherapy followed by limb salvage surgery/amputation followed by chemotherapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture14_3f4Ne5o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"182\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Chondroblastoma.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chondroblastoma is a rare type of benign tumor that grows at the ends of the long bones, close to the joints. Most often, the tumors develop at the ends of the femur, tibia, or humerus. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are more common in males. Although chondroblastomas are not cancerous, they can continue to grow if left untreated. A growing tumor can destroy the surrounding bone, making it painful to move the nearby joint. The cause of chondroblastomas is not known. The tumors are thought to arise from the growth plates at the ends of the bones, near joints. Classic <strong>“chicken wire” </strong>calcification is seen. Epiphysis + calcification + upper end humerus = Chondroblastoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture16_KKxJopm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"316\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tumor of distal end radius is always GCT until proven otherwise.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Mc site of giant cell tumor is lower end femur.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lower end femur is Mc site for:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Giant cell tumor</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteosarcoma</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteomyelitis</span></li></ul></li></ul>",

One of the distinctive signs of cocaine abuse is the presence of multiple scratch marks on the body.

This can lead to urinary obstruction, distension of the bladder, and can subsequently cause damage to the kidneys. Common symptoms include weak urine stream, difficulty in urination, recurrent urinary tract infections, and failure to thrive. Diagnosis is usually made with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Choledochal cyst</strong>: This is a congenital dilation of the bile ducts, often causing obstruction. Patients may present with the classic triad of abdominal pain, jaundice, and an abdominal mass, although not all these signs may be evident. Over time, choledochal cysts can lead to complications like cholangitis, pancreatitis, or even malignancy. Diagnosis is typically done with imaging like ultrasound or MRCP, and definitive treatment is surgical removal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Intussusception</strong>: This is a medical condition in which a part of the intestine telescopes into another section, leading to bowel obstruction. It is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. Symptoms include sudden, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and \"currant jelly\" stools (due to mucus and blood). The diagnosis can often be made with an ultrasound or CT abdomen showing the characteristic \"target sign\" and is typically treated with high pressure enema, although some cases may require surgical intervention.</span></p>",
