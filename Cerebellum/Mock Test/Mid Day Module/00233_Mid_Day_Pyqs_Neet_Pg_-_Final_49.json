After the patient starts tolerating ATT (approximately 2 weeks), ART should be initiated. This approach is important because if ART is started, it improves immunity which can lead to increased inflammatory response against TB antigens present in various organs. This excessive inflammatory response is called Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS).&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B.

Anti-tubercular drug resistance:&nbsp;</strong>Anti-tubercular Drug resistance would present as failure to improve rather than initial improvement followed by worsening. Additionally, drug resistance typically develops over a longer period.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D.

As a result, LCFAs cannot be oxidized and accumulate in tissues, leading to fatigue, muscle weakness, and the presence of fat vacuoles on muscle biopsy. The accumulation of triglycerides esterified with long-chain fatty acids is characteristic of carnitine deficiency because LCFAs bind to glycerol when they are not oxidized.

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans. A) Iron</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Heterochromia iridis refers to a difference in color between the two irises or different parts of the same iris. In this case, the heterochromia is acquired due to an intraocular foreign body injury. The pigmentation of the iris associated with a metallic foreign body is characteristic of siderosis bulbi, which is caused by iron deposition.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Siderosis bulbi occurs when an iron-containing foreign body remains in the eye for a prolonged period. The iron gradually dissolves and deposits throughout the ocular tissues, including the corneal endothelium, iris, lens, and retina. This deposition gives the affected iris a darker, rusty-brown appearance compared to the normal eye, resulting in heterochromia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The most common scenario for such injuries is a \"chisel and hammer\" accident, where a person is striking metal with a hammer, causing metal fragments to fly off at high velocity and penetrate the eye. If the patient does not seek immediate medical attention, the retained intraocular foreign body can lead to progressive damage through iron toxicity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-03-20%20125041.jpg\" width=\"448\" height=\"335\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-03-20%20125114.jpg\" width=\"696\" height=\"322\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Glass</strong>: Incorrect. Glass is relatively inert when retained within the eye and does not cause significant tissue reaction or pigmentation changes. It doesn't dissolve to release substances that would cause heterochromia iridis. While glass foreign bodies should be removed if possible, they don't cause the characteristic pigmentation changes seen with iron.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Wood</strong>: Incorrect. Wood foreign bodies typically cause severe inflammatory reactions and potential infections rather than pigmentation changes. Wood is organic and tends to harbor microorganisms, leading to endophthalmitis or orbital cellulitis. It would not cause the heterochromia iridis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Aluminum</strong>: Incorrect. While aluminum is a metal, it is relatively inert compared to iron and copper. Aluminum foreign bodies do not typically cause the extensive pigmentation seen in siderosis bulbi. They can cause a local inflammatory reaction but do not dissolve and distribute throughout the eye to cause widespread tissue staining and heterochromia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Iron-containing intraocular foreign bodies cause siderosis bulbi, a condition characterized by iron deposition throughout ocular tissues, resulting in heterochromia iridis and potential damage to various eye structures.</span></p>",
