D) Lung metastasis is rare and seen as a late feature</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Wilms’ tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children, typically under the age of six. It is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors and presents with a variety of clinical features, most notably an abdominal mass.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Common Presentation:</strong> The most common presenting symptom of Wilms’ tumor is a painless abdominal mass, which may be noticed by the child's parents or during a routine physical examination. This aligns with option A, making it correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Age of Onset:</strong> Wilms’ tumor most frequently occurs in young children, particularly those under the age of six. This is well-documented in clinical practice and research, making option B correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment and Prognosis:</strong> The treatment for Wilms’ tumor typically includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. The majority of patients have a good prognosis and can recover with appropriate treatment, supporting option C as correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lung Metastasis:</strong> Contrary to option D, lung metastasis is actually relatively common in Wilms’ tumor and often one of the first sites of metastasis. It is not rare, nor is it necessarily a late feature. Early detection and treatment of lung metastases are crucial in the management of Wilms' tumor, making this option incorrect.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Commonly presents as an abdominal mass:</strong> This is a correct statement. Wilms’ tumor typically presents as an abdominal mass, which is often the first sign that prompts further investigation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Presents in children &lt; 6 years of age:</strong> This is also correct. The majority of cases occur in children under the age of six, making this a well-recognized feature of the disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Majority of patients recover due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy:</strong> This statement is accurate as well. Advances in chemotherapy and radiotherapy have significantly improved survival rates for patients with Wilms’ tumor.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Lung metastasis in Wilms’ tumor is not rare; it is actually a common site of metastasis and often occurs early in the disease course.</span></p>",

Most common posterior mediastinal tumor:&nbsp;</strong>This statement is incorrect. Thymomas are tumors of the anterior mediastinum, not the posterior.

Usually symptomatic with dyspnoea, dysphagia and SVC syndrome:&nbsp;</strong>Thymomas can be asymptomatic or they may present with symptoms due to compression of nearby structures. While they can cause symptoms like dyspnea (shortness of breath) if they compress the trachea or lungs, or symptoms of Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome if they compress the SVC, these are not the most common presentations. The association with systemic syndromes like myasthenia gravis is more characteristic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Chest Xray is the investigation of choice:&nbsp;</strong>While a chest X-ray can identify a mediastinal mass suggesting a thymoma, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is usually the investigation of choice for further characterization and to evaluate the exact size, location, and any local invasion. The CT scan provides more detailed images than a simple chest X-ray<strong>.</strong></span></p>",

It is characterized by facial flushing and sweating in the region of the face associated with the parotid gland, particularly when eating or thinking about food. The underlying cause of Frey's syndrome is damage to the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve, V3). This damage results in abnormal nerve regeneration and cross-connection between the parasympathetic fibers that stimulate salivation and the sympathetic fibers that control sweating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Mechanism</strong>: The auriculotemporal nerve contains both sensory fibers and parasympathetic secretomotor fibers that supply the parotid gland. Following injury or surgery, these fibers can aberrantly regenerate, causing parasympathetic fibers to innervate sweat glands of the overlying skin, leading to sweating and flushing upon salivation.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Treatment Options</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Topical Antiperspirants</strong>: These can help reduce sweating by blocking sweat glands.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Oral Medications</strong>: Medications that reduce sweating may be prescribed.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Botulinum Toxin Injections</strong>: These injections can block the action of sweat glands, providing relief from symptoms.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Facial Nerve:&nbsp;</strong>The facial nerve controls facial expressions and can be injured during parotid surgery, leading to facial palsy. However, it is not involved in Frey's syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Oculomotor nerve:&nbsp;</strong>The oculomotor nerve controls eye movements and pupil constriction and is not involved in the innervation of the parotid gland or the region affected in Frey's syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Glossopharyngeal nerve:&nbsp;</strong>The glossopharyngeal nerve is involved in taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue and parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. However, it is not directly involved in the facial flushing and sweating characteristic of Frey's syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Frey's syndrome is caused by damage to the auriculotemporal nerve, leading to abnormal sweating and flushing of the face associated with eating or thinking about food.

Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are congenital obstructive lesions in the male urethra that cause significant urinary problems, including recurrent infections, urinary retention, and potential renal damage due to backpressure effects on the kidneys. The preferred management for a significant PUV is endoscopic ablation, also known as cystoscopic ablation.

It is characterized by a combination of infection, low blood pressure (hypotension), and organ dysfunction. Here are some key points about septic shock:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Infection</strong>: Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections. Common sources of infection include lung infections (pneumonia), urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and skin infections.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Systemic Inflammatory Response</strong>: In response to the infection, the body's immune system initiates a widespread inflammatory response. This response can become dysregulated, leading to an exaggerated release of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) into the bloodstream.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Hypotension</strong>: One of the hallmark features of septic shock is low blood pressure (hypotension). The inflammation and vasodilation caused by the infection can lead to a drop in blood pressure, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Organ Dysfunction</strong>: As blood pressure drops and organs receive less oxygen and nutrients, multiple organ systems can begin to fail. This can lead to dysfunction in the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Organ dysfunction is a critical component of septic shock and contributes to its high mortality rate.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Symptoms of septic shock can include fever or hypothermia (low body temperature), rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, altered mental status, and signs of organ dysfunction such as respiratory distress, kidney failure, or liver dysfunction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment</strong>: The treatment of septic shock is a medical emergency and involves aggressive interventions. It typically includes antibiotics to treat the underlying infection, intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure, vasopressor medications to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure, and supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU).</span></li></ol>",

It is commonly seen in the elderly, alcoholics, and patients on anticoagulants. The stretching of Cortical-Dural bridging veins in cerebral atrophy makes them vulnerable to rupture, leading to symptoms of raised intracranial pressure or focal deficits. On head CT scan, acute SDH appears as a hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the layers of the dura mater surrounding the brain. It can occur as a result of head trauma, such as a fall, and may not present with immediate symptoms but can lead to a gradual onset of neurological symptoms, including headache, confusion, and other focal neurological deficits.

At ABPI of 0.3, the limb has reached a critical state where tissue death is impending without urgent intervention.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: C. Pancreas</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Organ size matching is specifically mentioned as important for heart, lung, liver and small bowel transplantation, but not for pancreas transplantation. Allocation of organs must take into account the relative size of the donor and recipient for most organ types. While kidney transplants can be performed between adults and children without significant size concerns, the heart, lung, liver, and small bowel require more careful size matching. The pancreas doesn't appear in discussions of organs requiring strict size compatibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Heart</strong> - Incorrect. Size compatibility is critically important for heart transplantation. A heart that is too large won't fit in the recipient's chest cavity, while one that's too small may not provide adequate cardiac output for the recipient's body size. Precise size matching is essential for proper cardiac function.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Liver</strong> - Incorrect. Size matching is crucial for liver transplantation. An adult donor liver cannot be transplanted into a child because of the size mismatch. This has led to the development of split-liver transplantation, where the liver is divided so the left lobe or left lateral segments can be used for a child and the right lobe for an adult recipient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Lung</strong> - Incorrect. Lung transplantation requires careful size matching to ensure proper fit within the chest cavity. Lungs that are too large cannot physically fit in the recipient's thoracic space, while lungs that are too small may not provide adequate respiratory function for the recipient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While size matching is critical for heart, lung, liver, and small bowel transplantation, it is comparatively less critical for pancreatic transplantation among the given options.</p>",
