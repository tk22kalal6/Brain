Tibial Condyle fracture:</strong>&nbsp;Tibial Plateau fractures are periarticular injuries of the proximal tibia frequently associated with soft tissue injury. Incidence&nbsp;is 1-2% of all fractures. It can be caused in males in age group of 40s due to high energy trauma, and in females of age group of 70s due to low energy falls. Incidence of lateral plateau fracture is 70-80% (due to valgus load), bicondylar is 10-30% (due to axial load), and of medial plateau is 10-20% (due to varus load). In a high energy trauma, there is fracture-dislocation of the medial plateau with soft tissue injuries (meniscus and ACL tear, common peroneal nerve injury). Low energy traumas cause lateral plateau fractures. AP, lateral and oblique radiograph views are helpful; oblique view helps in determining amount of depression. AP view shows depressed articular surface and abnormal joint alignment. Lateral view shows posteromedial fracture lines and abnormal tibial slope.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/07/25/screenshot-2024-07-25-131422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"236\"></span><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>AP and Lateral view showing tibial condyle/plateau fracture</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong>&nbsp;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that affects approximately 1% of the world population, with approximately 50% of adults being unable to work within 10 years of disease onset. The disease involves synovial joints and leads to progressive joint destruction. The knee joint is commonly involved in RA. Severe destruction of the articular cartilage and menisci is a characteristic feature of RA. Bone marrow edema and bone erosion can both also be found, but are less characteristic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/07/25/screenshot-2024-07-25-131433.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemarthrosis of Knee Joint:</strong>&nbsp;Hemarthrosis is bleeding into a joint cavity. It is best diagnosed with arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis. Traumatic injury is the most common cause of hemarthrosis. Non-traumatic hemarthrosis can be caused by bleeding disorders that are either hereditary or&nbsp;acquired. Hereditary bleeding disorders include hemophilia and inherited coagulation factor deficiency disorders. Examples of acquired bleeding disorders include advanced liver or renal disease, vitamin K deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or anticoagulation medication use.&nbsp;Post-operative recurrent hemarthrosis is frequently associated with total knee arthroplasty. The preferred initial imaging modality is plain film radiology of the involved joint and surrounding bones. If a fracture is not seen but strongly suspected, further evaluation with a CT scan is warranted. MRI may be able to&nbsp;diagnose ligamentous or other soft tissue injuries as the cause of hemarthrosis. Ultrasound (US) can help identify and characterize intra-articular fluid collections. The synovial fluid from a hemarthrosis may appear red, pink, or brown depending on the cause of bleeding. Aspiration of the joint and subsequent analysis can differentiate simple effusion, hemarthrosis, lipohemarthrosis, and septic arthritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/07/25/screenshot-2024-07-25-131447.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The given image shows the comminuted fracture of the patella.</span></li></ul>",

Rhabdomyomas of the heart</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rhabdomyomas of the heart are benign tumors that represent one of the earliest manifestations of tuberous sclerosis. These cardiac tumors are typically present during fetal life or early infancy but have a tendency to spontaneously regress with age. The majority of cardiac rhabdomyomas associated with tuberous sclerosis resolve by childhood or early adulthood, often without causing significant clinical problems. While present, they can cause arrhythmias or outflow obstruction, but their natural history is typically one of regression rather than progression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Angiofibromas on the face:</strong> These lesions (formerly called adenoma sebaceum) typically appear during childhood (around 3-5 years of age) and persist throughout adulthood. They are reddish-brown papules that appear in a butterfly distribution across the face and tend to increase in number and size during adolescence rather than resolving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Fibromas around the nails:</strong> Periungual fibromas (Koenen tumors) typically appear during adolescence or early adulthood and persist rather than resolve. These flesh-colored nodules emerge from the nail folds, primarily of the toes but sometimes the fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Angiomyolipomas in the kidneys:</strong> Renal angiomyolipomas are benign tumors that typically appear during childhood or adolescence and continue to grow throughout adulthood. They do not spontaneously regress and may require monitoring or intervention if they grow large or cause symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cardiac rhabdomyomas are unique among the major manifestations of tuberous sclerosis in that they typically appear in early life and have a natural history of spontaneous regression, while most other tuberous sclerosis lesions persist or progress over time.</p>",

This defect leads to decreased absorption and increased urinary excretion of these amino acids, resulting in tryptophan deficiency. Tryptophan is a precursor for niacin (vitamin B3), serotonin, and melatonin. Deficiency in tryptophan can therefore lead to niacin deficiency, manifesting as pellagra-like symptoms.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Unlike Fanconi syndrome, which is characterized by non-selective amino aciduria (excretion of various amino acids including proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine), Hartnup disease typically shows selective amino aciduria, primarily affecting tryptophan and similar neutral amino acids.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Key indicators in this case include:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Pellagra-like symptoms:</strong> Dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia, commonly associated with niacin deficiency.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>No history of flushing and normal urinary 5-HIAA levels:</strong> These findings rule out carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by flushing and elevated 5-HIAA levels due to serotonin overproduction.</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Family history of similar illness:</strong> Suggests a genetic disorder, consistent with the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of Hartnup disease.</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Option A.
