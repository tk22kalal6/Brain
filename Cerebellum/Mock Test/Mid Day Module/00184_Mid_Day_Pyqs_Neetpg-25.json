Patients with a deficiency in the membrane attack complex (MAC) of the complement system, specifically components C5 to C9, are at an increased risk of Neisserial infections. The MAC plays a crucial role in defending against Neisseria species by forming pores in the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell lysis. Without this complex, individuals are susceptible to recurrent or disseminated Neisserial infections, which manifest with symptoms like rash, fever, and altered sensorium, as seen in this patient. The clinical presentation of rash, fever, and altered sensorium strongly suggests meningococcemia, a severe form of infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

D) Dihydrofolate reductase</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent and immune system suppressant. It acts by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, a form of folic acid that is required for the synthesis of thymidylate, purines, and the amino acid methionine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">By inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, methotrexate effectively depletes the cell’s supply of tetrahydrofolate, which in turn inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. This inhibition is particularly effective against rapidly dividing cells, which is why methotrexate is used in the treatment of certain cancers and autoimmune diseases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/30/whatsapp-image-2024-08-30-at-95817-am.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"724\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Clavicle.&nbsp;</strong>The clavicle is one of the most common fractured bones in children. These heal quickly and recover fully.&nbsp;Injuries are usually the result of a fall on an outstretched hand with the force transmitted up the arm.&nbsp;A direct blow to the outer end of the clavicle can be associated with distal third injuries and acromioclavicular joint disruption. The vast majority present with pain, swelling and deformity along the line of the clavicle, and a history of a fall onto an outstretched arm. Fractures of the medial third are usually the result of high impact blunt force to the anterior chest (such as in a motor vehicle accident), and can be associated with neurovascular, pulmonary and cardiac (rare) injuries. Careful airway protection and neurovascular assessment is required. Vascular assessment of the arm should also be performed as the subclavian artery runs close to the clavicle in the middle third.&nbsp;Standard AP with 15 degrees cephalic tilt x-ray of the clavicle will show the fracture in two planes and define displacement. The majority of clavicle fractures are easily managed with a sling and analgesia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture49.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"215\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Scapula</strong>. Scapula fractures are uncommon in children. Scapular body fractures are usually the result of high-energy trauma such as motor vehicle collisions or falls. There is a high incidence of associated injuries including other shoulder girdle fractures, rib fractures, head injury, and lung injury, such as pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion. Glenoid fractures are often due to a direct blow to the lateral shoulder or a fall onto a flexed elbow with the humeral head being driven into the glenoid. The position of the arm dictates whether an anterior or posterior rim fracture occurs. Similarly, acromion fractures are usually due to a direct blow to the lateral shoulder. Coracoid fractures are usually an avulsive injury resulting from pull of the acromioclavicular ligaments or the conjoint tendon. Scapulothoracic dissociation is often due to a severe traction injury. The primary symptom is often pain about the shoulder or back and difficulty with motion. Numbness or weakness may be present with a concomitant brachial plexus injury. The majority of fractures are treated non-operatively. Treatment includes immobilization for 3-4 weeks followed by pendulum exercises and protected range of motion.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Ribs</strong>. Rib fracture in children is caused by a high force injury. Ribs 1-3 are the hardest to break. Ribs 4-10 are typically the most vulnerable while ribs 11-12 are more mobile and therefore, more difficult to break. Since children tend to have more elastic ribs than adults, children are less likely to sustain rib fractures. Therefore, children with rib fractures is a sign of significant trauma and should warrant an investigation of possible child abuse. The physical exam may reveal chest wall bruising, along with bony tenderness to palpitation or crepitus.&nbsp;For simple, isolated rib fractures, conservative treatment is usually adequate which includes appropriate analgesia, rest, and ice. The use of an incentive spirometer should be encouraged to prevent pulmonary atelectasis and splinting.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image given in the question shows the fracture of upper end or proximal end of humerus.</span></li></ul>",
