      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans.&nbsp;A) Carnitine deficiency</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Carnitine deficiency is a condition in which there is insufficient carnitine to transport long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, which is the process that generates energy from fats. As a result, LCFAs cannot be oxidized and accumulate in tissues, leading to fatigue, muscle weakness, and the presence of fat vacuoles on muscle biopsy. The accumulation of triglycerides esterified with long-chain fatty acids is characteristic of carnitine deficiency because LCFAs bind to glycerol when they are not oxidized. This condition often presents with symptoms such as exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and, in severe cases, rhabdomyolysis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. FA synthase defect:</strong> Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is an enzyme that helps in the synthesis of fatty acids in the body. A defect in FAS usually does not present with the clinical picture seen here since fatty acids can be provided through the diet. It is often benign and does not lead to the accumulation of fat vacuoles in muscles or the described clinical symptoms.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. LPL defect:</strong> Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) into free fatty acids for tissue uptake. An LPL defect leads to type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and eruptive xanthomas, which do not match the clinical scenario described in the question.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. LDL receptor defect:</strong> A defect in the LDL receptor results in type 2a hyperlipoproteinemia, characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and a higher risk of atherosclerosis. This condition does not involve the accumulation of fat vacuoles in muscle or present with fatigue related to long-chain fatty acids.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Carnitine is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.

In fact, the opposite is true - cochlear implants often help reduce tinnitus in most patients who experience it prior to implantation. The electrical stimulation provided by the implant can mask or suppress the tinnitus sensation. Studies show that cochlear implantation can reduce or even eliminate pre-existing tinnitus in approximately 70-80% of cases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Cochlear implants lead to improved speech and sound perception</strong>: This statement is true. Cochlear implants bypass damaged hair cells in the cochlea and directly stimulate the auditory nerve, allowing for improved detection and discrimination of sounds. This leads to enhanced speech perception and better understanding of environmental sounds.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Cochlear implants offer a better chance of acquiring normal or near-normal verbal skills:</strong> This statement is true, especially for children who receive implants early. Early implantation (before 6 years of age in pre-lingual deaf children) allows for better development of auditory pathways and improved chances of developing age-appropriate speech and language skills.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Cochlear implants improve sound localization and discrimination</strong>: This statement is true. Cochlear implants help improve sound discrimination abilities, allowing recipients to better distinguish between different sounds. Bilateral implantation particularly improves sound localization abilities by providing binaural cues necessary for spatial hearing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Contrary to increasing tinnitus, cochlear implants typically reduce or suppress pre-existing tinnitus in most patients due to the masking effect of electrical stimulation and reorganization of central auditory pathways following implantation.</span></p>",

C) Intellectual disability</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The term \"mental retardation\" has historically been used in clinical and diagnostic settings, but it has now been largely replaced due to its potential for stigmatization and pejorative connotations. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) by the American Psychiatric Association, the term \"mental retardation\" has been updated to: <strong>Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)</strong>. This term is more respectful and emphasizes the abilities of the individual, rather than just their limitations.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Feeble mindedness and option B. Mental subnormality</strong> are outdated and non-specific terms that were used in the past.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Intellectually challenged</strong> is a non-clinical term that may be used colloquially to describe someone with intellectual disabilities in a more respectful manner.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">It's essential to understand that the term \"mental retardation\" is now outdated and has been replaced with \"intellectual disability\" in clinical settings, especially according to DSM-5, to ensure respectful and non-stigmatizing communication.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 11th edition, Page No 1118-1119.</strong></span></p>",
