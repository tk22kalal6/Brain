Dermoid cyst</strong>. A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure.&nbsp;These benign tumors are lined by stratified squamous epithelium with mature skin appendages found on their wall and their lumens filled with keratin and hair.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts are considered to be congenital, but not all of them are diagnosed at birth.&nbsp;Only about 40% of dermoid cysts are diagnosed at birth, while about 60% are diagnosed by five years of age. The dermoid cysts usually present within the first year of life and grow slowly.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts occur most commonly on the head and neck. The etiology of dermoid cysts&nbsp;remains mostly unknown. These occur when skin and skin structures become trapped during fetal development.&nbsp;In the head and neck region, dermoid cysts can most commonly be seen in the frontal, occipital, and supraorbital areas, with the outer third of the eyebrow being the most frequently affected region.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture13_fTE459u.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after multiple myeloma. It is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. All patients report progressive pain. Night pain is also reported in about 25% patients. Characteristic findings are Codman’s triangle and Sunburst periosteal reaction. It is the most radioresistant bone tumor and treated by chemotherapy followed by limb salvage surgery/amputation followed by chemotherapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture14_3f4Ne5o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"182\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Chondroblastoma.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chondroblastoma is a rare type of benign tumor that grows at the ends of the long bones, close to the joints. Most often, the tumors develop at the ends of the femur, tibia, or humerus. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are more common in males. Although chondroblastomas are not cancerous, they can continue to grow if left untreated. A growing tumor can destroy the surrounding bone, making it painful to move the nearby joint. The cause of chondroblastomas is not known. The tumors are thought to arise from the growth plates at the ends of the bones, near joints. Classic <strong>“chicken wire” </strong>calcification is seen. Epiphysis + calcification + upper end humerus = Chondroblastoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture16_KKxJopm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"316\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tumor of distal end radius is always GCT until proven otherwise.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Mc site of giant cell tumor is lower end femur.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lower end femur is Mc site for:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Giant cell tumor</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteosarcoma</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteomyelitis</span></li></ul></li></ul>",

Additionally, the presence of crackles at the lung bases points to left ventricular failure, which often presents with pulmonary congestion due to backflow of blood into the pulmonary circulation.

The predominant differentiation in KS is lymphatic in nature, which is evident from its histology and pathogenesis. While Kaposi sarcoma has features of both blood vessel and lymphatic differentiation, the predominant endothelial differentiation is lymphatic, which is consistent with the virus's tropism for lymphatic endothelium. This explains why KS can arise in settings of lymphedema (as in the Steward-Treves syndrome) and is classified as a lymphangiosarcoma in such cases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Neural</strong> - Kaposi sarcoma does not show neural differentiation. Neural differentiation is seen in tumors like schwannomas and neurofibromas, which arise from neural sheath cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Muscular</strong> - While blood vessels contain smooth muscle cells, Kaposi sarcoma is primarily of endothelial origin with lymphatic differentiation. Tumors with muscular differentiation include leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Epithelial</strong> - Kaposi sarcoma shows endothelial rather than epithelial differentiation. Epithelial differentiation is characteristic of carcinomas, which arise from epithelial tissues like skin or glandular structures.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Kaposi sarcoma shows predominantly lymphatic endothelial differentiation and is caused by KSHV/HHV8 infection, appearing in four clinical variants: classic, endemic African, transplantation-associated, and AIDS-associated, with the latter being the most aggressive form.</span></p>",

The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical criteria and detection of toxin in stool samples.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">C. difficile, a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus, causes Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) after ingestion of spores of the organism.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The more severe form of the condition is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). It is most commonly associated with prolonged antimicrobial use which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics are cephalosporins, ampicillin, and clindamycin.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The spores are spread by contact with the feces of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins - toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plaques initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall.

Plasma fibrinogen levels diminish acutely in severe cases of DIC. Similarly, antithrombin III levels are reduced in DIC (not increased), with high-grade DIC associated with antithrombin III activity &lt;60% of normal.</li><li><strong>Option B</strong>. <strong>Increased fibrinogen-antithrombin III complexes</strong>: While these complexes might form during coagulation, they are not a standard diagnostic marker for DIC. The diagnosis relies on more established markers like PT, platelet count, and FDPs.</li><li><strong>Option C.</strong> <strong>Increased FDP, decreased PT, increased antithrombin III</strong>: This is incorrect because in DIC, the PT is prolonged (not decreased) due to consumption of clotting factors. Additionally, antithrombin III levels are typically decreased in DIC, not increased.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The laboratory diagnosis of DIC involves a constellation of findings that reflect both excessive coagulation (prolonged PT, thrombocytopenia) and increased fibrinolysis (elevated FDPs) - representing the \"consumptive coagulopathy\" that defines this disorder.</p>",
