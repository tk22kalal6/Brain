D) Lung metastasis is rare and seen as a late feature</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Wilms’ tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children, typically under the age of six. It is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors and presents with a variety of clinical features, most notably an abdominal mass.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Common Presentation:</strong> The most common presenting symptom of Wilms’ tumor is a painless abdominal mass, which may be noticed by the child's parents or during a routine physical examination. This aligns with option A, making it correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Age of Onset:</strong> Wilms’ tumor most frequently occurs in young children, particularly those under the age of six. This is well-documented in clinical practice and research, making option B correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment and Prognosis:</strong> The treatment for Wilms’ tumor typically includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. The majority of patients have a good prognosis and can recover with appropriate treatment, supporting option C as correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lung Metastasis:</strong> Contrary to option D, lung metastasis is actually relatively common in Wilms’ tumor and often one of the first sites of metastasis. It is not rare, nor is it necessarily a late feature. Early detection and treatment of lung metastases are crucial in the management of Wilms' tumor, making this option incorrect.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Commonly presents as an abdominal mass:</strong> This is a correct statement. Wilms’ tumor typically presents as an abdominal mass, which is often the first sign that prompts further investigation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Presents in children &lt; 6 years of age:</strong> This is also correct. The majority of cases occur in children under the age of six, making this a well-recognized feature of the disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Majority of patients recover due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy:</strong> This statement is accurate as well. Advances in chemotherapy and radiotherapy have significantly improved survival rates for patients with Wilms’ tumor.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Lung metastasis in Wilms’ tumor is not rare; it is actually a common site of metastasis and often occurs early in the disease course.</span></p>",

It is characterized by facial flushing and sweating in the region of the face associated with the parotid gland, particularly when eating or thinking about food. The underlying cause of Frey's syndrome is damage to the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve, V3). This damage results in abnormal nerve regeneration and cross-connection between the parasympathetic fibers that stimulate salivation and the sympathetic fibers that control sweating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Mechanism</strong>: The auriculotemporal nerve contains both sensory fibers and parasympathetic secretomotor fibers that supply the parotid gland. Following injury or surgery, these fibers can aberrantly regenerate, causing parasympathetic fibers to innervate sweat glands of the overlying skin, leading to sweating and flushing upon salivation.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Treatment Options</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Topical Antiperspirants</strong>: These can help reduce sweating by blocking sweat glands.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Oral Medications</strong>: Medications that reduce sweating may be prescribed.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Botulinum Toxin Injections</strong>: These injections can block the action of sweat glands, providing relief from symptoms.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.

However, it is not involved in Frey's syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Glossopharyngeal nerve:&nbsp;</strong>The glossopharyngeal nerve is involved in taste sensation from the posterior third of the tongue and parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland.

B) Delirium tremens</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The scenario described is most consistent with delirium tremens (DTs), a severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. DTs usually occur 2-3 days after cessation of heavy, prolonged alcohol consumption and can include symptoms such as agitation, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, and autonomic hyperactivity. The patient’s history of chronic alcohol use, coupled with recent withdrawal, supports this diagnosis. Gait abnormalities, confusion, and agitation are hallmark symptoms in this context.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Wernicke's encephalopathy, often due to thiamine deficiency, presents with a classic triad of global confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia (<strong>mnemonic \"GOA\"</strong>).

C)&nbsp;Vitamin B6 Excess</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Vitamin B6 Excess:</strong> Correct Answer. Excessive intake of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can lead to neuropathy, manifesting as sensory changes such as tingling or burning sensations, especially in the hands and feet.

It is not typically associated with peripheral nerve sensations or tingling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.&nbsp;Vitamin B12 Excess:</strong> Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, and its excess is usually excreted in the urine.

The recommended daily intake of pyridoxine for adults is 1.3-1.7 mg/day, and the tolerable upper intake level (UL) is set at 100 mg/day for adults.

Ascorbic acid deficiency impairs the hydroxylation of collagen, while copper and iron deficiencies affect collagen cross-linking and stability.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Ascorbic Acid:</strong> &nbsp;Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is crucial for collagen synthesis. It acts as a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase, enzymes necessary for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen. Deficiency of Vitamin C leads to scurvy, characterized by weakened collagen and symptoms like bleeding gums and poor wound healing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Copper and Iron:</strong> &nbsp;Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase, an enzyme involved in the cross-linking of collagen fibers, essential for the strength and integrity of collagen. Iron is also involved in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen synthesis. Deficiencies in these minerals can impair collagen formation and structure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Zinc &amp; Magnesium:</strong> While zinc and magnesium are important for overall health and participate in numerous enzymatic reactions, they are not primarily associated with collagen synthesis or cross-linking in the same direct manner as ascorbic acid, copper, and iron.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Post translational modification of collagen on proline and lysine residue is required for its proper hydrogen bond formation and crosslinking which provide strength to collagen fibers. These reactions require vitamin C, copper and iron as cofactors for the enzyme involved in these processes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/12/21/picture4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"281\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ref: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd edition Page no. 548</strong></span></p>",
