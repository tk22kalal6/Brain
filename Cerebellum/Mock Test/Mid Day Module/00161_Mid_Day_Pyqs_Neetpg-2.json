It binds to the AT1 receptor with high affinity. It is also a competitive antagonist of the thromboxane A2 receptor and attenuates platelet aggregation.

Also called the Tobey-Ayer test, it involves compression of the jugular vein while monitoring CSF pressure via lumbar puncture. In lateral sinus thrombosis, compression of the affected side's jugular vein causes no change in CSF pressure, while compression of the normal side increases CSF pressure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Crowe-Beck Test</strong>: This is correctly used for diagnosing lateral sinus thrombosis. It is an alternative to Queckenstedt's test that avoids lumbar puncture. It involves observing retinal vein engorgement through fundoscopy during jugular compression. With lateral sinus thrombosis, compression of the affected side causes no retinal vein engorgement, while compression of the normal side does.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Griesinger's Sign</strong>: This is correctly associated with lateral sinus thrombosis. It refers to edema and tenderness over the mastoid emissary vein (posterior to the mastoid process), which occurs due to thrombophlebitis extending from the lateral sinus to the emissary vein.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">While Queckenstedt's test, Crowe-Beck test, and Griesinger's sign are all valid diagnostic indicators for lateral sinus thrombosis, Laugier's sign is unrelated and specifically associated with zygomatic arch fractures.</span></p>",

Lactose intolerance is characterized by the inability to digest lactose (milk sugar) due to deficiency of the enzyme lactase. When undigested lactose reaches the colon, it gets fermented by colonic bacteria, producing gas and causing symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and watery diarrhea. Steatorrhea, however, is a feature of fat malabsorption disorders like pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, or bile acid deficiency, not lactose intolerance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Lactose intolerance is caused by deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Skim milk will make his symptoms worse than whole milk</strong> - CORRECT. Skim milk contains the same amount of lactose as whole milk (or sometimes slightly more), but less fat. Fat can slow gastric emptying and intestinal transit, potentially reducing symptoms. Therefore, skim milk may indeed cause worse symptoms than whole milk in lactose intolerant individuals.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hydrogen Breath test is a sensitive test to diagnose the condition</strong> - CORRECT. The Hydrogen Breath test is a sensitive and specific test for lactose intolerance. After consuming lactose, undigested lactose is fermented by colonic bacteria, producing hydrogen which is absorbed and exhaled in breath.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Lactose intolerance presents with abdominal pain, bloating, and watery diarrhea after consuming milk products, but not steatorrhea, which is characteristic of fat malabsorption disorders.

According to the WHO classification, SAM includes weight for height &lt;-3 SD (severe wasting), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;11.5 cm (&lt;115 mm) in children 6-59 months, and bilateral pitting edema (kwashiorkor) regardless of anthropometric measurements. Height for age &lt;-2 SD defines stunting, which is a marker of chronic malnutrition rather than acute malnutrition, making it not a criterion for SAM diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options</strong>:&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Mid-Upper-Arm Circumference &lt;115mm</strong> - This is a correct criterion for SAM diagnosis. MUAC &lt;11.5 cm indicates severe acute malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months and is a simple field measurement tool.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Weight for height &lt;3 SD of WHO Standard</strong> - This is a correct criterion for SAM, indicating severe wasting. It reflects acute weight loss or failure to gain weight relative to height.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Bilateral Pitting Edema</strong> - This is a correct criterion for SAM diagnosis regardless of anthropometric measurements. It indicates kwashiorkor, a form of SAM characterized by protein deficiency leading to fluid retention.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is diagnosed by weight for height &lt;-3 SD, MUAC &lt;11.5 cm, or bilateral pitting edema, while stunting (height for age &lt;-2 SD) reflects chronic malnutrition and is not part of SAM diagnostic criteria.</span></p>",
