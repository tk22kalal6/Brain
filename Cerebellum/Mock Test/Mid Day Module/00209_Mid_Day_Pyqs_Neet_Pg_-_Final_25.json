In suicide inhibition, the enzyme itself participates in converting the inhibitor into a highly reactive form that permanently binds to and inactivates the enzyme. Aspirin acts as a suicide inhibitor of cyclooxygenase by covalently modifying a specific serine residue in the enzyme's active site through acetylation, which prevents access of the substrate to the catalytic site and results in permanent inactivation of the enzyme.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

In this condition, light chain (kappa) is produced in the same quantity as heavy chain (mu), which contrasts with other heavy chain diseases where there is predominant production of heavy chain antibody. The disease presents as an M spike of IgM type and commonly manifests with hyper viscosity syndrome due to the large size of IgM molecules.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

It involves the production of abnormal μ heavy chains without associated light chains.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Sezary disease</strong> - This is incorrect. Sezary syndrome is not a heavy chain disease but a variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and neoplastic T cells (Sezary cells) with cerebriform nuclei in the blood.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Franklin disease</strong> - This is incorrect. Franklin disease (gamma heavy chain disease) is characterized by the production of gamma (γ) heavy chains without associated light chains. It presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but not specifically with kappa light chains in urine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is distinguished from other heavy chain diseases by the production of intact IgM molecules with balanced synthesis of heavy and light chains (including kappa light chains), often leading to hyper viscosity syndrome due to high levels of the large IgM protein.</span></p>",

Single-dose methotrexate injection is an appropriate treatment choice for an unruptured ectopic pregnancy when the patient is stable, has no significant symptoms, and the gestational sac is less than 3.5 cm in size without visible cardiac activity.

The most common presentation of acute rejection in current clinical practice is an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine. According to the definition, there should be at least a 25% increase in serum creatinine to diagnose acute rejection. However, in cases where antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is suspected, any rise in serum creatinine can lead to a diagnosis or at least a suspicion of acute rejection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A.

The patient presents with massive splenomegaly, early satiety, bleeding, and a significantly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 85,000/mm³ with immature WBCs in the peripheral smear. These features are characteristic of CML, a type of leukemia where the bone marrow makes too many white blood cells.
