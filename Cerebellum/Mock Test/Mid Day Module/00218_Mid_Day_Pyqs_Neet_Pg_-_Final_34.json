B) The condition is often self-limiting</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HUS is a serious form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by endothelial cell injury, platelet and hyaline thrombi formation, and resultant organ damage. The evidence indicates HUS requires specific therapeutic interventions based on its variant type, with significant potential for morbidity and mortality, particularly related to acute kidney injury. This contradicts the notion that it's typically self-limiting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. It typically follows an episode of hemorrhagic colitis</strong>: This is accurate for STEC HUS (also known as D+ HUS), where diarrhea, often bloody, precedes microangiopathic hemolytic anemia within 1 week in &gt;80% of cases. This gastrointestinal prodrome is characteristic of Shiga toxin-producing <i>E. coli</i> infection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Fever is usually mild or absent</strong>: This statement is correct. The clinical presentation typically includes abdominal pain, cramping, and vomiting, while fever is notably absent in most cases of classic HUS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Serotonin plays no role in its pathogenesis</strong>: The pathogenesis of HUS involves Shiga toxins binding to glycolipid receptors (Gb3) on renal microvascular cells, triggering inflammatory cascades with cytokines and chemokine receptors that result in microvascular thrombosis. Serotonin is not implicated in this pathogenic pathway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HUS represents a&nbsp;</strong>serious disease process requiring variant-specific management approaches, with treatment potentially including supportive care, antimicrobial considerations, plasma therapies, or complement inhibition depending on the subtype.</p>",

It is not involved in meiosis. Instead, it plays an essential role in regulating various physiological processes, such as body temperature, thirst, hunger, and circadian rhythms. It also plays a significant role in controlling the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary by producing releasing or inhibiting hormones.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Adult ovaries </strong>are responsible for producing ova (egg cells) and hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.

Symptoms include painful and swollen elbow, attempts at motion are painful and restricted. On physical examination, the elbow is held in flexion, forearm appears to be shortened from the anterior and posterior view. On palpation, distal humerus creates a fullness within the antecubital fossa. Radiographs shows loss of radiocapitellar and ulnohumeral relationship but maintained radial and ulnar relationship.

Wolff-Chaikoff Effect:</strong> This is the transient inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis that occurs in response to high iodine intake.

Therefore, the recommended management is to repeat an ultrasound between 28 to 32 weeks to reassess the position of the placenta. By this time, the majority of placentas that were initially low-lying will have moved to a safer position, allowing for a more accurate determination of whether there will be any complications related to placenta previa.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The next best step for a pregnant woman found to have a low-lying placenta at 12 weeks is to repeat the ultrasound at around 32 weeks to reassess the placenta's position and determine appropriate management.</span></p>",

The Volkmann splint is designed to gradually stretch and lengthen the shortened muscles. It works on a 3-point fixation mechanism and has a turnbuckle that controls and adjusts the tension.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-14%20131542.jpg\" width=\"647\" height=\"272\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D.

It can be given any shape, anatomically following the contours of the injured limb. It is used for fractures of the lower and upper extremities – shoulder, forearm, hip, ankle, ankles and fingers. In addition, it is used for reliable fixation of the patient’s upper spinal column and head. Immobilization of injured limb using a Cramer splint reduces the level of pain and prevent from additional damage during transportation of the patient.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-14%20131553.jpg\" width=\"562\" height=\"205\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The given image shows the Bohler-Braun splint which is used in the immobilization of the lower limb fractures.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The splint consists of a system of pulleys to provide traction and allow for fracture healing.</span></li></ul>",

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans. A) Baroreceptor activation</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">When noradrenaline is administered intravenously, it primarily stimulates alpha-1 receptors in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction leads to an increase in diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. Our body has compensatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors located in the blood vessels (particularly in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) detect this change.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">These baroreceptors sense the elevated blood pressure and become activated. Once activated, they send signals to the central nervous system, specifically stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic activation results in the release of acetylcholine, which acts on the heart to slow the heart rate (bradycardia). This is a reflex mechanism known as the baroreceptor reflex or baroreflex.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Stimulation of alpha-1 receptors:&nbsp;</strong>This is incorrect because. While noradrenaline does stimulate alpha-1 receptors (causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure), the direct effect of alpha-1 stimulation does not cause a decrease in heart rate. Alpha-1 receptors are primarily located on blood vessels, not on the heart. The decrease in heart rate is an indirect effect mediated through the baroreceptor reflex.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Activation of beta-1 receptors:&nbsp;</strong>This is incorrect because.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Activation of beta-1 receptors would increase heart rate (tachycardia), not decrease it. Beta-1 receptors are present in the heart, and their stimulation leads to positive chronotropic (increased heart rate) and inotropic (increased contractility) effects. While noradrenaline does have some beta-1 agonist activity, the reflex bradycardia from baroreceptor activation usually overrides this direct effect.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Inhibition of baroreceptors:&nbsp;</strong>This is incorrect because.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Noradrenaline causes activation, not inhibition, of baroreceptors. When baroreceptors are inhibited, they would fail to detect the increase in blood pressure, which would cause a failure of the compensatory mechanism that decreases heart rate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">IV administration of noradrenaline causes reflex bradycardia through baroreceptor activation, which is a physiological compensatory mechanism in response to the drug-induced increase in blood pressure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Effect of IV administration of NA on heart rate</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-03-07%20165327.jpg\" width=\"642\" height=\"243\"></strong></span></p>",
