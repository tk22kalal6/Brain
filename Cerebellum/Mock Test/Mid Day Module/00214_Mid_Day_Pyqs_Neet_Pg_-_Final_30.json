      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans. B) Trigeminal nerve</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The corneal reflex (also known as the blink reflex) is a protective mechanism that causes involuntary blinking when the cornea is touched. This reflex involves both sensory and motor components. During a corneal wisp test, a cotton wisp or similar object is brought in from the side (to avoid eliciting a visual reflex) and gently touches the cornea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) serves as the afferent (sensory) pathway for this reflex. Specifically, the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve carries the sensory information from the cornea when it is stimulated. The sensory information is then processed, and an efferent (motor) response is generated via the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle, resulting in the blink.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The corneal sensitivity can be tested more precisely using an instrument called an aesthesiometer, which measures the minimal stimulus required to elicit the blink reflex. Corneal sensation is characteristically decreased in viral corneal ulcers, making this test diagnostically valuable.</span></p><p><br><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-03-20%20124950.jpg\" width=\"502\" height=\"381\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Oculomotor nerve</strong>: Incorrect. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) is responsible for most eye movements by controlling four of the six extraocular muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique). It also innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (responsible for eyelid elevation) and carries parasympathetic fibers that control pupillary constriction and lens accommodation. It has no role in corneal sensation or the blink reflex pathway.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Abducens nerve</strong>: Incorrect. The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for abduction of the eye (moving the eye outward, away from the nose). It has no sensory function and does not participate in the corneal reflex pathway.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Facial nerve</strong>: Incorrect, but partially involved in the reflex arc. While the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is involved in the corneal reflex, it serves as the efferent (motor) pathway, not the afferent pathway. The facial nerve innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle, which causes the eyelid to close during blinking. The question specifically asks about the nerve responsible for \"eliciting\" the reflex, which refers to the sensory component (trigeminal nerve), not the motor response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The corneal reflex is mediated by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) as the afferent (sensory) pathway and the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) as the efferent (motor) pathway.</span></p>",

Strong Beta; Low Gamma emitter</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An ideal therapeutic radioisotope should be a <strong>strong beta emitter with low gamma emission</strong>. Beta particles have relatively high energy and are strongly absorbed by adjacent tissue, allowing them to cause substantial damage to targeted cells (like cancer cells). Low gamma emission is preferred to minimize radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues and healthcare workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Strong Beta; Strong Gamma emitter</strong> - While the strong beta emission is desirable for therapy, strong gamma emission is problematic because gamma rays penetrate deeply through tissue and beyond the patient's body, potentially causing unwanted radiation exposure to healthy tissues and medical personnel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Low Beta; Low Gamma emitter</strong> - Low beta emission would provide insufficient therapeutic effect for treating conditions like cancer that require substantial radiation damage to abnormal cells. The radiation would be too weak to effectively destroy target tissues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Low Beta; Strong Gamma emitter</strong> - This is the worst combination for therapy.
