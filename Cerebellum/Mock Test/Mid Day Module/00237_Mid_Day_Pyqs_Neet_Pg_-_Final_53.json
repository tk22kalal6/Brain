Ultrasound guidance can enhance the accuracy of the procedure by allowing direct visualization of the abscess, ensuring that the needle is correctly positioned to access the abscess cavity. This method is less invasive than incision and drainage (I&amp;D), making it a preferred option if it can effectively manage the abscess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Incision and Drainage:&nbsp;</strong>Incision and drainage is generally considered if aspiration fails repeatedly or if the abscess is too large. While effective, it is not typically the immediate next step after a single failed aspiration attempt. It is more invasive than aspiration and usually reserved for cases where less invasive methods are unsuccessful.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Continue antibiotics only:&nbsp;</strong>Antibiotics are crucial in managing breast abscesses by treating the underlying infection. However, they alone might not suffice for large or dense abscesses. The pus trapped within the abscess often needs to be physically removed to expedite healing and provide symptom relief. Continuing antibiotics without addressing the abscess can lead to prolonged infection and discomfort.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Stop antibiotics as no aspirate was collected:&nbsp;</strong>This option is not recommended. The failure to collect aspirate does not imply the absence of infection. The antibiotics were prescribed based on the clinical diagnosis of a breast abscess, and stopping them prematurely could allow the infection to worsen. Continuation of antibiotics is important until the course is complete or unless indicated otherwise by a physician.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">If the initial aspiration attempt for a breast abscess fails, the next step should be to attempt aspiration again, preferably under ultrasound guidance, before considering more invasive procedures like incision and drainage. This approach ensures accurate access to the abscess and minimizes invasiveness.</span></p>",

The lateral condylar (or capitellar) epiphysis begins to ossify during the first year of life and fuses with shaft at 12&ndash;16 years. Between these ages, it may be sheared off or avulsed by forceful traction. The maximum chances of injury is between 5&ndash;15 years. They are the most common distal humeral epiphyseal fractures. Mechanism of fracture is fall on outstretched arm with varus stress that &ldquo;Pulls off&rdquo; (avulses) lateral condyle or Valgus force (rarely) in which radial head directly pushes off the lateral condyle. The child comes with lateral elbow pain and swelling. On physical examination, there is no obvious deformity seen. The swelling and tenderness are usually limited to the lateral side. Lateral ecchymosis implies a tear in the aponeurosis of the brachioradialis and signals an unstable fracture. There may be increased pain with resisted wrist extension/flexion. Crepitus may be felt at the fracture site. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/08/screenshot-2024-10-08-175630.jpg\" style=\"height:412px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational Objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The given image shows the radial head dislocation. </span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Since it is common at the age between 4-10 years, it is the correct diagnosis of the given condition.</span></span></li>\r\n</ul>",

Paravertebral muscle spasm resulting in stiffness in the affected region is a constant early finding. The spine is held rigid. When bending forward, there is flexion at hips and knees and the spine are in extension (Coin test). Earliest sign in patient with neurological deficit is increased deep tendon reflexes or clonus or extensor plantar response (twitching of muscles can be seen even earlier). The Earliest X-ray feature is loss of Curvature due to paravertebral spasm.

A) Anomaly scan</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The correct answer is <strong>Anomaly scan</strong>. This patient has a low risk of trisomy (such as Down syndrome) but a high risk of neural tube defects (NTD) based on the quadruple marker test. The quadruple marker test includes measurements of beta-hCG, unconjugated estriol, inhibin A, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). A high level of AFP is associated with an increased risk of NTDs, such as spina bifida.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Given the elevated risk for NTDs, the most appropriate next step is an <strong>anomaly scan</strong>, specifically a targeted imaging for fetal anomaly (TIFA) scan. This ultrasound, typically performed between 18 and 20 weeks of gestation, has a high sensitivity (up to 99%) for detecting structural anomalies, particularly neural tube defects. The scan is a non-invasive way to assess the fetus for physical defects.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option B. Amniocentesis:</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> While amniocentesis can detect chromosomal abnormalities and some structural defects, it is invasive and carries a small risk of complications. Since the concern here is structural (NTD) rather than chromosomal, and the anomaly scan is highly effective and non-invasive, amniocentesis is not the first choice.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option C. Chorionic villous sampling (CVS):</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> CVS is another invasive procedure used for early genetic testing, usually performed in the first trimester. It is not useful at 18 weeks and is not the best test for detecting structural anomalies like NTDs.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option D.

It provides tensile strength and functions as a scaffolding for cells and tissues. Collagens are composed of three separate polypeptide chains braided into a triple helix structure. There are about 30 different collagen types identified, with types I, II, III, and V forming linear fibrils that comprise a major proportion of connective tissue in bone, tendon, cartilage, blood vessels, and skin.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Proteoglycan</strong> - Proteoglycans are important components of the ECM, consisting of a core protein with attached glycosaminoglycan chains. While they are significant ECM constituents that contribute to compressibility and lubrication, they are not as abundant as collagen, which makes up approximately 30% of the total protein in the human body.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Collagen is the most abundant and primary structural protein in the extracellular matrix, providing essential tensile strength and scaffolding for tissues throughout the body.</span></p>",

The number of Barr bodies follows the formula of the number of X chromosomes minus one (X-1). Since Klinefelter syndrome patients have two X chromosomes (XXY), they have one Barr body (2-1=1).
