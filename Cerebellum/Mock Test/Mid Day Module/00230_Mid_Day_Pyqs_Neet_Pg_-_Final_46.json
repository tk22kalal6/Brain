C) Neisseria meningitidis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Neisseria meningitidis is a bacterium that commonly causes meningococcal infections, which can lead to serious conditions such as meningococcemia and meningitis. Patients with a deficiency in the membrane attack complex (MAC) of the complement system, specifically components C5 to C9, are at an increased risk of Neisserial infections. The MAC plays a crucial role in defending against Neisseria species by forming pores in the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell lysis. Without this complex, individuals are susceptible to recurrent or disseminated Neisserial infections, which manifest with symptoms like rash, fever, and altered sensorium, as seen in this patient. The clinical presentation of rash, fever, and altered sensorium strongly suggests meningococcemia, a severe form of infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase that is responsible for copper absorption from the intestine and distribution to various tissues. When this gene is mutated, copper cannot be properly absorbed from the intestinal tract, leading to copper deficiency. This X-linked recessive disorder manifests with neurological deterioration, growth failure, and characteristic kinky hair (described as \"steel wool\" hair) due to abnormal copper-dependent cross-linking in hair proteins.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Dubin-Johnson's syndrome</strong> - This is a benign disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by mutations in the ABCC2 gene, which encodes a transport protein that moves bilirubin out of hepatocytes. It has no relation to copper metabolism.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Wilson disease</strong> - This is actually the opposite condition of Menkes disease. Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene (not ATP7A) and results in excessive copper accumulation in tissues, particularly the liver and brain, rather than copper deficiency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

D) Active surveillance</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The given clinical vignette is suggestive of a diagnosis of low-risk prostatic carcinoma. The most likely management for this patient would be active surveillance only.</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Active surveillance is a management approach used for prostate cancer with specific criteria.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Criteria for active surveillance include Gleason score 6, early-stage disease (T1), small volume disease on biopsy, age &gt; 70 years and low PSA (&lt;10 ng/mL).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Active surveillance protocols include regular digital rectal examination and PSA monitoring every 3 to 6 months, with TRUS-guided prostate biopsies every 1 to 3 years.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Radical prostatectomy:&nbsp;</strong>This surgical procedure involves removing the entire prostate gland. It is often considered for prostate cancer treatment, especially for younger, healthier patients or those with more aggressive forms of the disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. External beam radiation:&nbsp;</strong>This treatment involves using targeted radiation beams to kill cancer cells. It can be considered for prostate cancer, particularly when surgery is not an option. The choice between radiation therapy and active surveillance depends on various factors, including the patient's age, overall health, and the stage and aggressiveness of the cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Brachytherapy:&nbsp;</strong>Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy where radioactive seeds or sources are placed directly into or near the tumor. It's a localized treatment and can be used for low to intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Again, the decision to use brachytherapy depends on several factors, including the patient's overall health and the characteristics of the cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Active surveillance is an appropriate management strategy for older patients with low-risk prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 6, early-stage disease, small tumor volume, and low PSA levels.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">This approach minimizes unnecessary treatments and associated side effects, focusing on regular monitoring to detect any changes in the cancer's status.</span></li></ul>",
