Think about what's happening here - the patient has anemia (shown by fatigue, pallor, weakness, and low hemoglobin), but interestingly, only the red blood cell line is affected. The white cells and platelets are completely normal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hallmark of red cell aplasia is that there is a selective reduction in erythroid precursors. The reduced reticulocyte count is also important as it tell us that the bone marrow isn't even trying to compensate for the anemia</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Red cell aplasia can happen for several reasons - parvovirus B19 infection, certain medications, autoimmune disorders, or sometimes associated with thymomas.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A</strong>: Aplastic anaemia If this were aplastic anemia, our patient would be having pancytopenia (low counts across all cell types). Our patient's normal WBC and platelets immediately rule this out.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C</strong>: Iron deficiency anemia; in IDA, the body typically responds by pumping out more reticulocytes to try to compensate. Our patient has reduced Reticulocyte count ruling this out.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D</strong>: Hemolytic anemia would show increased red cell precursors leading to high reticulocyte count.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This question tests knowledge of the differential diagnosis of anemia based on bone marrow findings and cellular indices. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic pattern of red cell aplasia: selective reduction of erythroid precursors with normal myeloid and megakaryocytic lines, accompanied by anemia and low reticulocyte count. The key distinguishing feature is the selective involvement of only the red cell line, differentiating it from other anemias that show different patterns of cell production or destruction.</span></p>",

It is caused by a breakdown in the normal communication between nerves and muscles. The symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis, such as ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), difficulty in chewing, and progressive weakness in the hands that worsens as the day progresses, match the description given in the question. This condition is known for the decremental response upon repeated stimulation, meaning muscle strength decreases with continued use.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option B. Lambert Eaton syndrome</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: This syndrome is also a disorder of the neuromuscular junction but it typically presents with muscle weakness that improves with continued use (incremental response), opposite to Myasthenia Gravis. Hence, the symptom progression described in the question does not fit Lambert Eaton syndrome.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option C. Botulinum toxicity</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis by preventing the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. While it can cause muscle weakness, it does not typically present with the progressive worsening throughout the day as seen in Myasthenia Gravis.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option D. Tetanus toxicity</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. It leads to muscle stiffness and spasms, not the progressive muscle weakness described in the question. Tetanus usually follows an injury such as a thorn prick, leading to muscle rigidity rather than the fluctuating weakness seen in Myasthenia Gravis.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational Objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Myasthenia Gravis is characterized by symptoms such as drooping of the eyelids, difficulty in chewing, and progressive muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, showing a decremental response upon repeated stimulation.</span></span></p>",

Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">O'Donoghue's Triad, also known as the \"Unhappy Triad,\" consists of three specific knee structures that are commonly injured together in sports: the Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL), Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL), and Medial Meniscus. The PCL is not part of this classic injury pattern. This triad typically occurs when a valgus force is applied to the knee while it's in a flexed position with external rotation, commonly during contact sports.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

When considering a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC), it is crucial to ensure that the facility is equipped to handle an emergency cesarean section.
