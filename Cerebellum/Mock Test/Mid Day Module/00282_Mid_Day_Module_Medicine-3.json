B) Essential Mixed Cryoglobulinemia</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The patient presents with the classic triad of <strong>purpura (skin ulcers), arthralgia, and weakness</strong>. This condition is strongly associated with hepatitis C infection, which the patient tests positive for. The presence of hypocomplementemia (reduced serum complement levels) along with mild proteinuria and hematuria further supports this diagnosis.

Post-streptococcal Glomerulonephritis</strong>: While post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can present with hypocomplementemia and hematuria, it typically occurs after streptococcal infections, not hepatitis C. It generally affects children and young adults, and the patient's age (60) makes this less likely. Additionally, it doesn't typically cause the widespread edema and skin ulcers described.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)</strong>: MPGN can be associated with hepatitis C and low complement levels. However, MPGN typically presents with more significant proteinuria (often nephrotic range) than described in this case.

It works by detecting the presence of urease, an enzyme produced by H. pylori. During the test, the patient ingests a urea solution labeled with a carbon isotope. If H. pylori is present, the urease enzyme breaks down the urea, releasing labeled carbon dioxide, which is then measured in the patient's breath. This test is highly accurate, non-invasive, and convenient for follow-up, making it the best choice for confirming the eradication of H. pylori after treatment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The treatment and management of <strong>frostbite</strong> are critical to prevent long-term damage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Analgesics are contraindicated:</strong> This is incorrect. Analgesics, especially opiate analgesics, are crucial during the rewarming process because it is extremely painful.

This helps to restore blood flow and minimize tissue damage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Thrombolytics can be used:&nbsp;</strong>This is correct. In cases where frostbite is severe and the patient presents within 24 hours, thrombolytic therapy may be considered to restore blood flow and prevent tissue death. <strong>MR angiography</strong> can help assess the need for thrombolytics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Amputation in severe cases:&nbsp;</strong>This is correct. In severe frostbite cases, where there is significant tissue necrosis, amputation may be necessary.

A) Decreased Chest Expansion.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In pneumothorax, air accumulates in the pleural space, causing the lung to collapse away from the chest wall. This leads to decreased chest expansion on the affected side. The physical examination findings in pneumothorax typically include an enlarged hemithorax with no breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and potentially a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side in tension pneumothorax.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B.

The presence of air in the pleural space impedes sound transmission, resulting in decreased, not increased, vocal resonance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D.
