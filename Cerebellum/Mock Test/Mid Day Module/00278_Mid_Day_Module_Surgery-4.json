A PEG tube is used for providing nutrition directly into the stomach in patients who cannot swallow food. The distinguishing features of a PEG tube include a retention bolster that secures the tube to the abdominal wall and an inflatable balloon at the end that helps retain the tube within the stomach. The presence of these components in the tray confirms that the &nbsp;is a PEG tube.

Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign tumors of the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being the most frequent site. These tumors are encapsulated and exhibit a mixed cellular composition, leading to a variable consistency, which is reflected in their name \"pleomorphic.\" Clinically, they present as painless, slow-growing masses. The characteristic lift of the earlobe due to the swelling is a classic sign of a parotid gland tumor. Untreated pleomorphic adenomas may undergo malignant transformation, hence surgical excision is typically recommended.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/09/25/histopathology_of_pleomorphic_adenoma.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"461\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Jaw Tumor:&nbsp;</strong>Jaw tumors, particularly those of the mandible or maxilla, are often bony growths or related to the teeth (odontogenic tumors). While they can cause facial asymmetry, they are usually centered around the bones and are not typically located in the parotid gland region. These tumors tend to be hard and lack the variable consistency described in the clinical presentation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Dermoid cyst:&nbsp;</strong>Dermoid cysts are benign cystic tumors containing skin appendages (such as hair follicles), and sometimes hair, teeth, or sebum. They are typically congenital and found on the face, neck, or ovary. While they can appear on the face or neck, the described clinical presentation is less suggestive of a dermoid cyst compared to a pleomorphic adenoma. Dermoid cysts often show indentation due to putty material.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Sebaceous cyst:&nbsp;</strong>Also known as an epidermal cyst, a sebaceous cyst is a benign growth arising from blocked sebaceous glands, often containing a thick, cheese-like material. Sebaceous cysts can appear almost anywhere on the body where sebaceous glands are found, including the face, and often show a black punctum. However, the described clinical presentation and duration better match a pleomorphic adenoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands, typically presenting as a painless, slow-growing mass with variable consistency and often lifting the earlobe due to its location in the parotid gland.</span></p>",

Due to increasing mammography, there occurs over-diagnosis of breast carcinoma</strong>: This is true. Mammography is an essential tool in the early detection of breast cancer, but it has been associated with over-diagnosis. As a result, some women might receive unnecessary treatment for non-life-threatening tumors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. Oral cancer screening is done by visual inspection</strong>: This is true. Visual inspection of the oral cavity can detect precancerous lesions or early signs of oral cancer. Regular dental check-ups often include a visual check for signs of oral cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>3. Cervix cancer screening is done by a pap smear</strong>: This is true. A Pap smear (or Pap test) is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women. The test involves collecting cells from the cervix to be examined under a microscope to detect abnormalities that can turn into cervical cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Option:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>4. Colon cancer screening is done by digital rectal examination</strong>: This statement is not entirely accurate. While a digital rectal examination (DRE) can detect some abnormalities or tumors in the rectum, it is not the primary method for colon cancer screening. The primary methods for colon cancer screening include fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Screening for common cancers using relatively non-invasive tests is expected to lead to early diagnosis, allow more conservative surgical therapies with decreased morbidity, and potentially improve surgical cure rates and overall survival rates.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate colon cancer screening for the average-risk population beginning at age 50 years. Recommended procedures include yearly fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)/fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or FOBT/FIT and flexible sigmoidoscopy.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Visual inspection of the oral cavity has been widely used for screening oral cancer. The target population for oral cancer screening includes those aged 30 years and older who use tobacco and/or alcohol. Advantages of visual inspection include its feasibility, safety, acceptability, accuracy to detect oral precancerous and cancerous lesions, and efficacy and cost-effectiveness in reducing oral cancer mortality.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Screening should begin at age 21 years. For women aged between 21-29 years, screening should be done every 3 years with Pap smear examination. For women aged between 30-65 years, screening should be done every 5 years with both HPV and the Pap co-test.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Using mammography as a routine screening tool in women has been reported to reduce mortality from breast cancer. The United Kingdom recently established an independent expert panel to estimate the benefits and harms associated with screening women in its national screening program. The panel estimated that breast screening resulted in a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality. The panel also noted over-diagnosis of breast carcinoma but concluded that breast screening confers significant benefits and should be continued.</span></li></ol>",

The great saphenous vein has superior patency rates and fewer complications compared to synthetic grafts in this setting. When available and of good quality, the GSV is the preferred choice for femoropopliteal bypass. The great saphenous vein is the best as it lasts longer than polytetrafluoroethylene, Dacron and human umbilical vein as a graft in a femoropopliteal bypass.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Dacron: </strong>Dacron is a brand name for a type of polyester fiber. It has been used as vascular graft material for several years. Dacron grafts are synthetic and durable, and they are primarily used for larger vessel grafts such as aortoiliac or aortofemoral bypass procedures. However, for femoropopliteal bypass, especially for below-the-knee grafts, Dacron is associated with lower patency rates compared to autologous vein grafts<strong>.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): </strong>Polytetrafluoroethylene (often known by the brand name Teflon) is a synthetic material used as a vascular graft. PTFE grafts are most commonly used when a suitable autologous vein is not available. PTFE has acceptable patency rates, especially for above-the-knee femoropopliteal bypasses. However, for below-the-knee grafts, the GSV usually outperforms PTFE in terms of long-term patency<strong>.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Short Saphenous Vein: </strong>The short saphenous vein runs along the back of the calf and drains into the popliteal vein. While it can be used as a graft for femoropopliteal bypass, it is not as commonly chosen as the great saphenous vein. The GSV is generally longer, more superficial, and easier to harvest, making it the preferred autologous graft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The great saphenous vein is the preferred graft material for femoropopliteal bypass due to its superior patency rates and longevity compared to synthetic grafts like Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</span></p>",

The Tokyo guidelines recommend early cholecystectomy within 5-7 days for mild cases (Tokyo I). For this 45-year-old patient whose symptoms are controlled with medical management, proceeding with laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the next available elective list (during the same admission) is the optimal approach, as it reduces the risk of recurrent attacks while operating when inflammation has started to resolve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Observation and regular follow-up</strong> - This is inappropriate for a patient who has already experienced acute cholecystitis. Once symptomatic complications occur, definitive surgical management is required to prevent recurrent attacks, which can be more severe and lead to additional complications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Elective cholecystectomy after inflammation subsides</strong> - This approach represents delayed surgery scheduled weeks to months after discharge, which is now considered an outdated practice. It increases the risk of recurrent episodes during the waiting period and can lead to more difficult surgery due to scarring and adhesions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Urgent open cholecystectomy</strong> - Open cholecystectomy is not the first-line approach unless laparoscopic surgery is contraindicated. For mild to moderate cases that have been medically stabilized, there is no indication for urgent open surgery, as laparoscopic approach offers less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">For acute cholecystitis responsive to medical management, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same admission (on the next available list) is the standard of care, offering the best balance between allowing initial inflammation to subside while preventing recurrent attacks.</span></p>",
