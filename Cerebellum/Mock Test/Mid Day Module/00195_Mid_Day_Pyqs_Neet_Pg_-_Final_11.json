An axillary temperature of 37.5°C represents a normal body temperature and falls below the fever threshold of ≥38.0°C, which would indicate infection. A temperature between 36.5°C and 37.5°C is considered normal and would not trigger the \"fever\" classification in the IMNCI assessment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The WHO IMNCI classification system specifically designates fever as temperature ≥38°C when assessing for possible severe bacterial infection. Without other clinical signs, a temperature of 37.5°C alone would be classified as \"no fever\" and would not meet criteria for antibiotic therapy or referral.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. 50 breaths per minute or more</strong> - This is a danger sign in IMNCI assessment. The age-specific respiratory rate cutoffs (≥60/min for &lt;2 months; ≥50/min for 2-12 months) define fast breathing, which is classified as pneumonia requiring antibiotic therapy or severe pneumonia if accompanied by chest indrawing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. 10 or more skin pustules</strong> - This IS considered a sign of possible severe bacterial infection. The IMNCI guidelines classify multiple skin pustules or a large skin infection as requiring systemic antibiotics due to risk of invasive bacterial disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Temperature less than 35.5°C</strong> - This IS a critical danger sign. Hypothermia in young infants strongly suggests sepsis and represents impaired thermoregulation. IMNCI classifies temperature &lt;35.5°C as a danger sign requiring immediate referral after pre-referral antibiotics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In IMNCI assessment, normal temperature (36.5-37.5°C) does not trigger concern for severe bacterial infection, while fast breathing (age-specific rates), multiple skin infections, and hypothermia (&lt;35.5°C) all represent important clinical signs requiring prompt antibiotic therapy and possible referral.</span></p>",

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans. C) Conjunctival DCR</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Epiphora refers to the overflow of tears onto the face due to inadequate drainage. In this case, probing revealed a blockage at the 7 mm mark of the lacrimal drainage system.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The lacrimal drainage system begins at the punctum and continues through the canaliculus, which has a 2 mm vertical segment followed by an 8 mm horizontal segment. The canaliculi then join to form a common canaliculus before entering the lacrimal sac. The total distance from the punctum to the lacrimal sac is approximately 10 mm.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Since the block is at 7 mm, it is located within the horizontal portion of the canaliculus, before reaching the lacrimal sac. When the obstruction is in the canaliculus itself, neither external DCR nor endoscopic DCR would be effective because these procedures address nasolacrimal duct obstruction, not canalicular obstruction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Conjunctival DCR (also known as conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy or CDCR) is the appropriate procedure, as it bypasses the obstructed canalicular system entirely by creating a new passage directly from the conjunctival sac to the nasal cavity. This is typically done using a Jones tube, which is a glass or silicone tube that connects the medial canthus to the middle meatus of the nose.</span></p><p><br><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-03-20%20181324.jpg\" width=\"1044\" height=\"394\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Extranasal DCR</strong>: Incorrect. External dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a procedure that creates a new pathway between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity by removing the bone between them. It is indicated when the obstruction is in the nasolacrimal duct, not in the canaliculus. Since the block in this case is at 7 mm (within the canaliculus), an external DCR would not address the site of obstruction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Endoscopic DCR</strong>: Incorrect. Endoscopic DCR, like external DCR, creates a passage between the lacrimal sac and nasal cavity, but it is performed using an endoscope through the nasal cavity without an external incision. It is also used for nasolacrimal duct obstructions, not canalicular obstructions. Since the block in this case is in the canaliculus, endoscopic DCR would not be effective.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Dacryocystectomy</strong>: Incorrect. Dacryocystectomy involves the surgical removal of the lacrimal sac. It is typically performed in cases of chronic dacryocystitis with an atonic (non-functioning) lacrimal sac or in certain lacrimal sac tumors. This procedure completely eliminates the tear drainage system without providing an alternative drainage pathway, resulting in permanent epiphora. It is not appropriate for a canalicular obstruction in a young child were preserving or creating a functional drainage system is the goal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Canalicular obstructions (as evidenced by a block at 7 mm from the punctum) are treated with conjunctival DCR (CDCR) using a Jones tube, which bypasses the obstructed lacrimal drainage system by creating a direct connection between the conjunctival sac and the nasal cavity.</span></p>",

The primary goal in such situations is to lower the triglyceride levels to mitigate this risk. Fibrates, such as gemfibrozil or fenofibrate, are the treatment of choice for reducing triglyceride levels effectively. They act by decreasing the hepatic secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and increasing the clearance of triglycerides from the blood.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Option A.
