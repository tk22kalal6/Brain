A) Supravital</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The best stain for biopsy during laryngoscopy for vocal cord examination is <strong>Toluidine blue</strong>, which is a type of supravital stain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Supravital staining allows for the observation of living cells and is particularly useful in this context because it can be used non-invasively during laryngoscopy. Toluidine blue has a high affinity for DNA and RNA, making it effective in highlighting areas with high cellular activity, such as cancerous growths. This stain is particularly useful for detecting early cancerous changes in the vocal cords, as it is absorbed more by cells with high nucleic acid content, indicating a proliferative or carcinomatous state.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Blom-Singer prosthesis</strong> is a type of tracheoesophageal puncture voice prosthesis used for voice rehabilitation after a laryngectomy. When a patient has their larynx removed, typically due to cancer, they lose their natural voice. A Blom-Singer prosthesis is a one-way valve inserted between the trachea and the esophagus that allows air to be diverted into the esophagus to produce sound, enabling the patient to speak. It is placed during surgery or as an office procedure after the surgical site has healed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. A Grommet</strong>, also known as a tympanostomy tube or ventilation tube, is a small tube inserted into the eardrum to allow air to enter the middle ear. It is used to treat recurrent middle ear infections (acute otitis media) or to relieve chronic fluid accumulation in the middle ear (otitis media with effusion). Grommets help reduce the frequency of ear infections and improve hearing by allowing the continuous drainage of fluid and equalizing the pressure between the middle ear and the external atmospheric pressure.</span></p>",

A coin, unlike a button battery, does not have this double ring appearance. Recognizing the double ring sign is crucial because a button battery lodged in the esophagus is a medical emergency due to the risk of severe tissue damage from the battery's contents.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/04/screenshot-2024-09-04-125455.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"284\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

In conductive hearing loss, the air conduction thresholds are worse (higher dB levels) than the bone conduction thresholds, but the bone conduction remains within normal limits. This wide air-bone gap confirms the diagnosis of left-sided conductive deafness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

This is not the case here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

C) Right on left head rotation</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In patients with left vestibular neuritis, the vestibular function on the left side is <strong>hypoactive,</strong> meaning it functions below normal levels. The head impulse test evaluates the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which helps maintain stable vision during head movements. When the head is moved to the left, the left vestibular system (which is hypoactive in this condition) should excite and the right side should inhibit. However, due to the hypoactivity on the left side, the expected response is delayed or diminished, causing the eyes to initially drift towards the hypoactive side (left) followed by corrective saccadic movements to the right. Therefore, saccades will be observed to the right during left head rotation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/04/screenshot-2024-09-04-125010.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"277\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

A) Tracheostomy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A tracheostomy involves creating an opening through the neck into the trachea, which may become complicated when the trachea is deviated. In cases of tracheal deviation, the trachea is not in its usual midline position, which can make locating the correct spot for incision more challenging. This difficulty is increased because the trachea's position may not be easily palpable or visible due to its displacement, which can complicate the procedure and increase the risk of complications.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_aEVEcW6.png\" width=\"367\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Endotracheal intubation:</strong> While endotracheal intubation may become slightly more difficult with tracheal deviation, it usually remains manageable. The main challenge might be encountering some resistance or needing to adjust the angle of the tube. However, with careful maneuvering, the endotracheal tube can still be guided into the trachea.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_f8aYTbB.png\" width=\"443\" height=\"342\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cricothyroidotomy:</strong> This procedure involves making an incision through the cricothyroid membrane, located above the trachea at the level of the larynx.

It presents as a triad of facial nerve palsy, vesicular eruptions on the pinna and external auditory canal, and vestibulocochlear symptoms. The infection represents a reactivation of the herpes zoster virus that had remained dormant in the geniculate ganglion after previous chickenpox infection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Heerfordt Syndrome</strong>: This is a rare manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by the triad of uveitis, parotid gland enlargement, and facial nerve palsy. It is not related to herpes infection of the geniculate ganglion. The facial palsy in this condition is due to granulomatous infiltration of the facial nerve.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Bell's Palsy</strong>: While this is also a facial nerve paralysis, Bell's palsy is idiopathic in nature. Although some theories suggest that herpes simplex virus may be involved in some cases of Bell's palsy, it does not specifically involve vesicular eruptions or definitive evidence of geniculate ganglion involvement as seen in Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Melkersson's Syndrome</strong>: This syndrome (also called Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome) is characterized by recurrent or persistent facial swelling, recurrent facial paralysis, and a fissured tongue (lingua plicata). It is not caused by herpes infection of the geniculate ganglion but is thought to be related to granulomatous disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is specifically characterized by facial nerve palsy due to herpes zoster infection of the geniculate ganglion, presenting with the distinctive triad of facial paralysis, ear/mouth vesicles, and auditory/vestibular symptoms.</span></p>",
