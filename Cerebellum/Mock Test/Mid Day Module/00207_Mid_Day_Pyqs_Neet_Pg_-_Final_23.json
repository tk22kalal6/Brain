B) Essential Mixed Cryoglobulinemia</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The patient presents with the classic triad of <strong>purpura (skin ulcers), arthralgia, and weakness</strong>. This condition is strongly associated with hepatitis C infection, which the patient tests positive for. The presence of hypocomplementemia (reduced serum complement levels) along with mild proteinuria and hematuria further supports this diagnosis. Mixed cryoglobulinemia typically involves a vasculitic process that can present with skin lesions and kidney manifestations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Post-streptococcal Glomerulonephritis</strong>: While post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can present with hypocomplementemia and hematuria, it typically occurs after streptococcal infections, not hepatitis C. It generally affects children and young adults, and the patient's age (60) makes this less likely. Additionally, it doesn't typically cause the widespread edema and skin ulcers described.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)</strong>: MPGN can be associated with hepatitis C and low complement levels. However, MPGN typically presents with more significant proteinuria (often nephrotic range) than described in this case. While MPGN can be secondary to cryoglobulinemia, the clinical presentation more directly points to cryoglobulinemia as the primary diagnosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Focal Segmental Glomerular Sclerosis (FSGS)</strong>: FSGS is not typically associated with hepatitis C infection or hypocomplementemia. It usually presents with significant proteinuria (often nephrotic range) without the systemic manifestations seen in this patient (skin ulcers, vasculitis).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hepatitis C virus infection is strongly associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia, which can manifest with skin lesions, arthralgia, weakness, hypocomplementemia, and kidney involvement with subnephrotic proteinuria and microscopic hematuria.</p>",

Collagen, specifically fibrillar type I collagen, is the predominant component of tendons, making up approximately 60-85% of the dry weight of the tendon. These collagen fibers are arranged in parallel bundles that provide the high tensile strength necessary for tendons to withstand and transmit the mechanical forces generated during muscle contraction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is a fibrous protein formed from fibrinogen during blood clotting and is involved in wound healing rather than tendon structure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Fibrillin</strong> - While fibrillin is an important extracellular matrix glycoprotein associated with elastin in elastic fibers, it is primarily found in tissues requiring elasticity such as blood vessels, skin, and ligaments. It is not a major component of tendons, which require tensile strength rather than elasticity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Proteoglycans</strong> - Although proteoglycans are present in tendons, they make up a much smaller proportion compared to collagen. They contribute to the viscoelastic properties of tendons and help maintain tissue hydration, but they are not the primary structural component.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tendons are composed primarily of type I collagen arranged in parallel bundles, providing the high tensile strength required for their function of transmitting force from muscle to bone.</span></p>",

It arises from the meibomian glands and frequently involves the upper eyelid. This malignancy typically presents initially as a nodule that may be mistaken for a chalazion, more frequently on the upper eyelid.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma:</strong> This presents as a scaly, erythematous plaque with elevated and indurated margins or occasionally as nodular/polypoidal growth.

B) Competitive inhibitor of DHFR.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Methotrexate has different mechanisms for anticancer activity and for Rheumatoid Arthritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Mechanism in Osteosarcoma (As anticancer drug):</strong> Methotrexate acts as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). By inhibiting DHFR, methotrexate interferes with the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, an essential cofactor for DNA synthesis. This leads to a decrease in DNA and RNA synthesis, thereby arresting the cell cycle and inhibiting the growth of rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells in osteosarcoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Mechanism in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):</strong> Methotrexate is used at much lower doses in Rheumatoid Arthritis. In this condition, the major mechanism involves the inhibition of an enzyme called AICAR transformylase, part of the purine synthesis pathway. When AICAR transformylase is inhibited, levels of AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide) accumulate in the cell. This leads to an inhibition of another enzyme called adenosine deaminase, which is responsible for the degradation of adenosine. As a result, adenosine levels increase within the cell and in the extracellular environment.</span><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Adenosine is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. When adenosine interacts with its receptors, it can lead to various effects such as inhibition of inflammatory cell function, vasodilation, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release. These actions contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects observed when methotrexate is used for treating RA.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

External Oblique</strong>: The external oblique is the most superficial of the three flat muscles of the lateral abdominal wall.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Origin and Insertion</strong>: It originates from the outer surfaces of the 5th to 12th ribs and inserts into the linea alba, pubic tubercle, and anterior half of the iliac crest.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Innervation</strong>: Like the internal oblique, it's innervated by the lower six thoracoabdominal nerves and the first lumbar nerve.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.
