B) Tumor vessel lack contractility</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Based on the provided CT image and the clinical context of recurrent bleeding, the most accurate statement is Tumor vessels lack contractility, which contributes to the propensity for bleeding in tumorous growths.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>\"Tumor vessel lack contractility</strong>\" is a true statement about tumor vessels. They are often abnormally formed, with poor structural integrity and can lack the ability to contract, which normally helps control bleeding when vessels are injured.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Outgrown the blood supply:</strong> Suggests that the lesion has grown faster than the blood vessels can proliferate to support it. This can lead to areas of necrosis within tumours.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Bleeding is from the adjacent invading vessels:</strong> Implies that the normal vessels adjacent to the tumor are the source of bleeding. However, the bleeding associated with tumors is usually due to the tumor vessels themselves because they are prone to rupture, not the adjacent normal vessels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Lacks capsule:</strong> May or may not be true depending on the type of tumor. Some benign tumors have a well-defined capsule, while malignant tumors often lack a capsule.

CMV esophagitis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">CMV (Cytomegalovirus) esophagitis is an infection of the esophagus caused by the Cytomegalovirus. It predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients. The characteristic endoscopic finding in CMV esophagitis is the presence of large, linear or serpiginous (snake-like) ulcers, often located in the distal esophagus. These ulcers typically have well-defined edges and are surrounded by relatively normal mucosa, which helps to differentiate them from other types of esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Candida Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Candida esophagitis is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans. It is common in immunocompromised patients or those on prolonged antibiotics or inhaled steroids. Endoscopic findings typically show white-yellow plaques or patches that can be scraped off, often described as having a \"cottage cheese-like\" appearance, rather than serpiginous ulcers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Herpetic Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Herpetic esophagitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. It is characterized by odynophagia (painful swallowing) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Endoscopically, herpetic esophagitis usually presents with small, well-circumscribed ulcers that resemble \"volcano-like\" or \"punched-out\" lesions, which are different from the serpiginous ulcers seen in CMV esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Radiation Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Radiation esophagitis is a side effect of radiation therapy, particularly for cancers in the chest area, such as lung cancer. It manifests with symptoms like pain, difficulty swallowing, and a sensation of something stuck in the throat. Endoscopic findings may include mucosal redness, swelling, and non-specific ulcerations, but not the distinct serpiginous ulcers typical of CMV esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Serpiginous ulcers in the esophagus observed during endoscopy are characteristic of CMV esophagitis, especially in immunocompromised patients. This feature helps differentiate it from other forms of esophagitis such as Candida, herpetic, and radiation-induced esophagitis.</span></p>",

After proteins are synthesized by ribosomes and processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, they are transported to the Golgi apparatus where they undergo further modifications like glycosylation. The Golgi then packages proteins into transport vesicles and directs them to their appropriate destinations within or outside the cell based on specific sorting signals.

Type II hypersensitivity is antibody-mediated cytotoxic hypersensitivity where antibodies directly bind to antigens on cell surfaces. In Rheumatic Fever, antibodies produced against streptococcal antigens cross-react with self-antigens on heart tissue due to molecular mimicry between streptococcal M protein and human heart tissue antigens. This cross-reactivity leads to immune-mediated damage to heart valves and myocardium. The mnemonic \"MBIRH Positive\" for Type II reactions specifically includes Rheumatic fever among its examples.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

B) Glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin assay</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A combination of glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin assay can be used for the detection of Clostridium difficile.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that causes Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection after ingestion of spores of the organism. The more severe form of the condition is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Enzyme immunoassay to detect glutamate dehydrogenase is less specific compared to toxin detection for diagnosis. So a combination of the two can be used for diagnostic confirmation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The condition is most commonly <strong>associated with prolonged antimicrobial use</strong>, which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The <i><strong>most commonly implicated antibiotics are</strong></i> <i><strong>cephalosporins, ampicillin, and clindamycin</strong></i>. The spores are spread by contact with the feces of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins-toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation. The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plagues initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. It contains necrotic leukocytes, fibrin, and cellular debris. The anamnestic IgG response determines which patients develop the disease or remain asymptomatic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. <strong>The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical criteria and detection of toxin or the organism in stool samples. </strong>This can be done by <u>nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PC) or by culture.</u></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Discontinuation of any ongoing antimicrobials and adequate hydration are general measures that are recommended. Oral fidaxomicin or vancomycin is the first-line treatment. Oral metronidazole can be used when these are not available.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

None of the above:</strong> There are effective methods, particularly the one described in option B.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">For effective and accurate diagnosis of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection, a combination of glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin assays is recommended. This approach ensures both the presence of the organism and its potential to cause disease through toxin production are assessed, guiding appropriate treatment and infection control measures.</span></p>",

B) Crigler Najjar type 2</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In the case described above, the neonate had unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that did not subside even after 3 weeks of birth, but had normal liver enzymes, PT/INR, and albumin levels, and no hemolysis was seen on a peripheral blood smear. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Crigler-Najjar type 2.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: B. Having liver cirrhosis</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Liver cirrhosis reduces thyroid hormone requirements because cirrhosis is associated with decreased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) metabolism, which leads to reduced clearance of thyroid hormones. Cirrhosis is a condition that decreases TBG levels. When TBG levels are decreased, less exogenous thyroid hormone is needed to maintain euthyroidism as more free hormone is available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Being pregnant:</strong> Pregnancy actually <strong>increases</strong> thyroid hormone requirements by up to 45% during pregnancy in levothyroxine-treated hypothyroid women. Women should increase levothyroxine from once daily dosing to nine doses per week as soon as pregnancy is confirmed to anticipate these increased needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Taking phenytoin:</strong> Phenytoin <strong>increases</strong> thyroid hormone requirements. As an antiepileptic drug (AED), phenytoin induces hepatic enzymes that accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones, necessitating higher replacement doses to maintain euthyroidism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Receiving androgen therapy:</strong> Androgen therapy <strong>decreases</strong> TBG levels, which would theoretically reduce thyroid hormone requirements, similar to cirrhosis. However, this doesn't automatically translate to a significant clinical reduction in replacement needs compared to the pronounced effect of liver cirrhosis on overall thyroid hormone metabolism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conditions that decrease thyroid-binding globulin levels or reduce thyroid hormone metabolism (like cirrhosis) decrease thyroid hormone replacement requirements, while conditions that increase binding proteins or enhance metabolism (like pregnancy or enzyme-inducing medications) increase replacement needs.</p>",
