However, these stones are not typically associated with laxative abuse.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

They are not directly associated with laxative abuse.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Calcium oxalate: </strong>Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stone. Factors that increase the urine concentration of these constituents can contribute to stone formation.

Laparoscopic appendectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove the appendix, typically performed in the first two trimesters. This method is preferred due to advantages such as reduced postoperative pain, quicker recovery, and fewer postoperative complications compared to open surgery. Delaying surgery in cases of acute appendicitis increases the risk of complications like rupture, abscess formation, fetal loss, or preterm birth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Delaying treatment can lead to serious complications such as rupture or abscess formation, which can increase the risk of fetal loss or preterm birth. While surgical intervention in the second trimester is considered safer, it is not advisable to wait in acute conditions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C.

This regimen is not appropriate for acute appendicitis without lump formation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Stoppa operation</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Stoppa operation is the open pre-peritoneal large mesh repair technique for complex inguinal hernias. This procedure involves placing a large prosthetic mesh in the pre-peritoneal space that covers the entire myopectineal orifice bilaterally. It's specifically designed for complex, recurrent, or bilateral inguinal hernias. The Stoppa approach provides excellent coverage of all potential hernia sites while avoiding direct contact with nerves in the inguinal canal, reducing the risk of chronic pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A.</strong> <strong>Lichtenstein operation</strong> - Incorrect because the Lichtenstein repair is an onlay mesh technique where the prosthetic mesh is placed on top of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, not in the pre-peritoneal space. While it uses mesh, it employs a different anatomical approach and placement technique.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B.</strong> <strong>Shouldice operation</strong> - Incorrect because the Shouldice repair is a tissue-based herniorrhaphy technique that doesn't use mesh at all. It involves multiple layers of suturing of the native tissue (double breasting of conjoint tendon and inguinal ligament and halves of fascia transversalis) to create a 4-layer posterior wall repair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D.</strong> <strong>Mac-Vay Operation</strong> - Incorrect because the McVay (Cooper ligament) repair is another tissue-based repair that doesn't utilize mesh. This technique involves suturing the conjoint tendon to Cooper's ligament (pectineal ligament) rather than to the inguinal ligament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Stoppa operation is characterized by placement of a large prosthetic mesh in the pre-peritoneal space for complex inguinal hernias, covering bilateral myopectineal orifices simultaneously.</p>",
