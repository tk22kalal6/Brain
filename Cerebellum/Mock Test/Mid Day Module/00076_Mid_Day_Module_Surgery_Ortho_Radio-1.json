This pathogen was once a common cause of septic arthritis in children, particularly those under 5 years of age, before the widespread use of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. It typically spreads through respiratory droplets and can lead to systemic infections, including septic arthritis, in vulnerable populations. Septic arthritis caused by H. influenzae usually presents similarly to other causes, with fever and joint pain. While it is a potential cause, its prevalence has significantly decreased due to vaccination, making it less common than Staphylococcus aureus in current clinical practice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C) Streptococcus pneumoniae:&nbsp;</strong>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive bacterium known for causing pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. It can cause septic arthritis, particularly in children, but is not the most common causative agent. It is more associated with infections of the respiratory system and can spread to joints. Like H. influenzae, it spreads through respiratory droplets and can lead to systemic infections, including septic arthritis. The presentation of septic arthritis caused by S. pneumoniae is similar to that of other organisms, with joint pain and swelling. Although a possible cause of septic arthritis, it is less frequently encountered than Staphylococcus aureus in children.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Escherichia coli:&nbsp;</strong>Escherichia coli (E.coli) is a gram-negative bacterium commonly found in the intestines. Some strains can cause serious infections, including urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal disease. E. coli can cause septic arthritis, particularly in neonates and children with underlying conditions, such as urinary tract infections or abdominal infections, leading to hematogenous spread. It typically enters joints through the bloodstream or following trauma. It is more common in children with specific risk factors. Symptoms are similar to other causes of septic arthritis, including joint swelling, pain, and fever. While E. coli can cause septic arthritis, it is not the most prevalent organism responsible for this condition in children.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The most common cause of septic arthritis in children is Staphylococcus aureus.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While other pathogens like Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli can also cause this condition, they are less frequently encountered compared to Staphylococcus aureus in current clinical settings.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the impact of vaccination programs have influenced the epidemiology of these infections over time.</span></p></li></ul>",

It is characterized by the presence of malignant osteoblasts and varying amounts of osteoid production. The cells are often pleomorphic and show high mitotic activity. Patients usually present with pain, swelling, and sometimes a pathological fracture. Radiologically, osteosarcomas may show a \"sunburst\" pattern or Codman's triangle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B) Osteoclastoma:&nbsp;</strong>Osteoclastoma, or giant cell tumor of bone, is a benign but locally aggressive tumor that typically arises in the epiphysis of long bones, particularly around the knee. Characterized by the presence of numerous giant cells (multinucleated osteoclast-like cells) and mononuclear stromal cells. The tumor may also have a background of reactive bone and fibrous tissue. Patients often present with joint pain and swelling, particularly in young adults (20-40 years old). X-rays typically show a lytic, subarticular lesion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Chondrosarcoma:&nbsp;</strong>Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that produces cartilage and is the second most common primary malignant bone tumor, commonly found in the pelvis and long bones. Composed of chondrocytes producing a cartilage matrix. Depending on the grade, it may show varying degrees of cellularity, atypia, and calcification. Patients typically present with pain and swelling. Radiologically, it appears as a lytic lesion with calcified areas.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Chordoma is characterized by physaliphorous cells, indicating its origin from notochordal remnants.</span></li></ul>",

It involves various strategies to reduce pain through medications, physical therapy modalities (like heat, cold, and electrical stimulation), and psychological support. While important, pain management is typically considered a means to an end rather than the primary goal. Reducing pain can facilitate engagement in rehabilitation activities but does not encompass the full scope of rehabilitation's objectives.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C) Strength Gain:&nbsp;</strong>Strength gain involves exercises and activities designed to increase muscle power and endurance. This can be a significant component of rehabilitation, especially following surgery or injury. While strengthening is vital for recovery and overall function, it is typically a subset of the broader objective of functional improvement. Gaining strength contributes to functional abilities but is not the sole focus.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Range of Motion Improvement:&nbsp;</strong>Improving range of motion (ROM) involves exercises and interventions aimed at increasing joint mobility. This is essential for regaining function, particularly after injuries or surgeries that may limit movement. Like strength gain, improving ROM is crucial but is considered one aspect of the overall goal of functional improvement. Enhanced range of motion supports functional tasks but is not the ultimate aim of rehabilitation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Functional improvement captures the overarching objective of orthopaedic rehabilitation, which is to enhance the patient's ability to engage in daily activities and improve their quality of life.</span></p></li></ul>",

Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF):&nbsp;</strong>This is a surgical technique where the fractured bone fragments are realigned and then stabilized internally using plates, screws, or rods. Typically indicated for complex or unstable fractures, particularly in older children or adults. In children under 2 years, ORIF is usually avoided due to the potential for complications, such as growth disturbances and the risks associated with surgery. This method is more invasive and requires careful management of post-operative care.

This traction is typically used in the treatment of fractures of the femur in infants and young children. While gallows traction is effective in certain circumstances (especially in very young children), it is not as commonly used today for femoral shaft fractures as spica casting. It is more cumbersome and requires prolonged hospitalization and monitoring, making it less convenient than spica casting.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. External Fixation:&nbsp;</strong>This method uses external devices attached to the bone via pins or screws to stabilize a fracture. Typically reserved for more complex fractures or in cases where internal fixation is not feasible. While effective in certain situations, it is less commonly used for simple femoral shaft fractures in very young children. It carries risks such as pin site infections and complications associated with having external hardware. Not the first choice for simple femoral shaft fractures in children under 2 years due to its invasive nature and associated risks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Spica Casting is the most appropriate, non-invasive, and convenient method of treatment.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">It provides sufficient immobilization and allows the bone to heal effectively with minimal risk of complications.</span></li></ul>",

X-rays show joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and sometimes bone cysts. The diagnosis is primarily clinical based on history and physical examination findings.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/04/screenshot-2024-10-04-184724.png\" style=\"height:337px; width:300px\" /></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Option C) Pseudogout:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Pseudogout, or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease, is characterized by the accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joint.

It runs down the posterior aspect of the thigh and branches into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. While the sciatic nerve can be injured in fractures of the femur, it is typically more associated with proximal femoral fractures (like intertrochanteric fractures) rather than supracondylar fractures. Its anatomical location makes it less vulnerable in the case of a supracondylar fracture.

The popliteal nerve can be injured in supracondylar femur fractures, especially if there is significant displacement or swelling in the area. The nerve&#39;s position makes it susceptible to direct trauma or compression from hematoma formation.

While femoral vessel injuries can occur with proximal femoral fractures, they are less commonly associated with supracondylar fractures of the femur due to the location of the fracture and the relative protection provided by surrounding structures.

Symptoms include hip pain, inability to bear weight, and a shortened and externally rotated limb. Patients may have severe pain with movement. Diagnosis is usually confirmed via X-ray or MRI.

On CTA, an abscess may appear as a well-defined fluid collection with possible enhancement after contrast administration.

Presentation includes arrythmias, muscle weakness, respiratory or cardiac failure, oedema, lethargy or seizures; and at its most severe, the syndrome can be fatal. Laboratory tests will reveal low levels of phosphate, potassium, calcium and magnesium and a lactic acidosis.
