Symptoms include painful and swollen elbow, attempts at motion are painful and restricted. On physical examination, the elbow is held in flexion, forearm appears to be shortened from the anterior and posterior view. On palpation, distal humerus creates a fullness within the antecubital fossa. Radiographs shows loss of radiocapitellar and ulnohumeral relationship but maintained radial and ulnar relationship.

It may lead to proximal radial migration and subluxation of inferior radio-ulnar joint, weakness of extremity and discomfort in distal radioulnar joint with heavy activities, and may produce cubitus valgus deformity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/03/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"153\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D.

A) Transvestic Fetishism</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Transvestic Fetishism is a condition where an individual wears clothing of the opposite sex primarily to achieve sexual arousal. The key aspect of this disorder is the act of cross-dressing for the purpose of sexual gratification, not because of a desire to be of the opposite gender or any issues with gender identity. The patient described is not interested in males and is engaging in cross-dressing purely for sexual arousal, fitting the diagnosis of Transvestic Fetishism.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Gender Dysphoria:</strong> Gender Dysphoria involves a conflict between an individual’s biological sex and their gender identity, such as a biologically male person identifying as female or vice versa. There is no indication in this case of any gender identity issues; the patient cross-dresses purely for sexual arousal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

The most common cause for a separation of the AC joint is from a fall directly onto the shoulder, injuring the ligaments around the AC joint. If the force is severe enough, the ligaments attaching to the underside of the clavicle are torn, causing the separation of the clavivle and the scapula. The scapula moves downward from the weight of the arm, creating a bump or bulge above the shoulder.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/04/105.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Torticollis.&nbsp;</strong>Torticollis is a symptom of cervical spine abnormality. Congenital torticollis is due to fibrosis of sternocleidomastoid muscle on one side that fails to elongate as child grows. The cause is muscle ischemia from a distorted position in utero (breech) or birth injury. A history of difficult labour followed by lump over SCM (sternomastoid tumor) in first few weeks of life, which disappears in few months is present. Then, there is neither deformity nor obvious limitation of movements. Deformity does not become apparent until the child is 1-2 years old. SCM on involved side may feel tight and hard and a mass or knot can be detected in the body of SCM. It can disappear spontaneously. There may be asymmetrical development of face (plagiocephaly).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/04/127.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"358\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">High riding medially rotated scapula, shaped like an equilateral triangle is seen in Klippel-Feil syndrome.

A) More risk of perianal fistulae</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but they have distinct characteristics and should not be considered the same. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, and is known for causing \"skip lesions,\" meaning areas of diseased tissue interspersed with healthy tissue.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Perianal fistulae</strong>: Crohn’s disease is more associated with perianal complications, including fistulae, abscesses, and fissures, due to the deeper transmural inflammation that characterizes the disease. This is in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which primarily involves the mucosa and submucosa and starts from the rectum, rarely involving perianal areas.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Lesions are continuous</strong>: This statement is incorrect for Crohn’s disease. Continuous lesions are characteristic of ulcerative colitis. In Crohn’s disease, the inflammation is patchy, with skip lesions being typical.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Malignancy is more common</strong>: Malignancy is more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis, particularly colorectal cancer, due to the long-standing inflammation typically confined to the colon. Crohn’s disease has a lower risk of malignancy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Often presents with hematochezia</strong>: Hematochezia, or the passage of fresh blood in the stool, is more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis. Crohn’s disease typically presents with non-bloody diarrhea, although some cases might involve blood, it is not as frequent as in ulcerative colitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Crohn’s disease is characterized by a higher risk of perianal fistulae and skip lesions, in contrast to ulcerative colitis, which presents with continuous lesions and a higher risk of colorectal malignancy.</span></p>",

D) Done before analysing outcomes</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Clinical audit in obstetrics is a method performed to ensure that healthcare provisions are standardized and consistently improved in line with evidence-based practice. The purpose of an obstetrics audit is to analyze the current level of care and identify areas for improvement.

This helps in determining whether the current practices are effective or if changes are needed to improve patient outcomes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A.
