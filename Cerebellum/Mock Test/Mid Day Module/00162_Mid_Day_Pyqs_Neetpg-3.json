Synchondrosis is a type of primary cartilaginous joint where bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. In the context of long bones, this joint occurs between the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) and the diaphysis during the development of the bone.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The epiphyseal plate is a layer of hyaline cartilage that allows the bone to grow in length. As growth continues, this cartilage eventually undergoes ossification, transforming into bone and thereby eliminating the synchondrosis joint, marking the end of growth in length.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Syndesmosis</strong>: This is a fibrous joint where bones are connected by a ligament or a sheet of fibrous tissue. It does not involve cartilage and is therefore not applicable to the junction between the epiphysis and diaphysis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Synarthrosis</strong>: Synarthrosis refers to an immovable joint. While synchondrosis could be considered a type of synarthrosis when ossified, it specifically refers to the cartilaginous joint prior to ossification. Thus, this option is less specific and not the correct answer in this context.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Symphysis</strong>: Symphysis is a secondary cartilaginous joint where bones are joined by fibrocartilage. It is typically found in the midline of the body, such as the pubic symphysis or the intervertebral discs. This type of joint does not describe the connection between the epiphysis and diaphysis of a long bone.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The joint formed between the epiphysis and diaphysis of a long bone during development is a synchondrosis, which is a primary cartilaginous joint composed of hyaline cartilage that eventually ossifies as growth completes.</span></p>",

This means that Ciclesonide is inactive when administered and only becomes active when it reaches the lungs, where it is <strong>converted into its active form by bronchial esterases</strong>. This activation in the target site, the bronchial airways, significantly reduces the drug's systemic side effects, including the risk of oral candidiasis, which is common with other inhaled corticosteroids.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Because the majority of the drug that deposits in the oropharynx remains inactive, the likelihood of developing oral candidiasis (a common side effect of other inhalational steroids due to local immunosuppression) is significantly lower with Ciclesonide.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option B.

However, like other opioids, it carries a risk of abuse, especially if taken in large doses. Atropine, an anticholinergic drug, is mixed with diphenoxylate in subtherapeutic doses to deter misuse. When taken as prescribed, the amount of atropine is too small to cause significant effects. However, if someone tries to abuse diphenoxylate by taking a large number of tablets, the atropine will also accumulate and cause unpleasant side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and blurred vision. These side effects are uncomfortable and discourage further abuse of the medication.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Option A.

C) Excess Melanin</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by decreased melanin, not excess melanin. PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to increased levels of phenylalanine in the blood and decreased levels of tyrosine. Since tyrosine is a precursor for melanin synthesis, patients with PKU have decreased melanin production, resulting in characteristic physical features including blonde hair, fair skin, and blue eyes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

In PKU, the body cannot convert phenylalanine to tyrosine due to the enzyme deficiency, resulting in decreased tyrosine levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Excess Phenylalanine</strong> - This is correct. PKU results in elevated levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites (phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate) due to the enzymatic defect.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

At birth, the GFR is significantly lower than adult values, typically around 15-20 ml/min/1.73m². During the first few weeks of life, GFR increases dramatically, reaching approximately 50% of adult values by 1-2 weeks of age. By 1-2 years of age, the GFR reaches adult levels of approximately 100-120 ml/min/1.73m². This rapid maturation reflects the postnatal development of renal blood flow, increased filtration surface area, and improved filtration pressure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Birth - Incorrect</strong>. At birth, the GFR is only about 15-20% of adult values. The kidneys are still immature with limited filtration capacity, which is why newborns have limited ability to concentrate urine and excrete waste products.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. 2-5 years - Incorrect</strong>. This is too late, as adult levels of GFR are already achieved by 1-2 years of age. By 2-5 years, kidney function has been at adult levels for some time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Puberty - Incorrect</strong>. This is much too late. Adult-level GFR is reached many years before puberty. At puberty, the kidneys have long been functioning at adult capacity in terms of filtration rate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Renal function matures rapidly during infancy, with GFR reaching adult levels by 1-2 years of age.</span></p>",

Intussusception is a condition where one segment of intestine telescopes into another segment, causing intestinal obstruction. The original RotaShield vaccine showed an association with intussusception at a rate of approximately 1 case per 10,000 vaccinated infants, with most cases occurring within 1 week of the first dose. This led to its voluntary withdrawal. Newer rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) were subsequently developed and have a much lower risk of intussusception (approximately 1-5 cases per 100,000 vaccinated infants).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Polio Vaccine</strong> - Incorrect. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been replaced by the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in many countries, but this was due to the rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), not intussusception.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The original rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield) was withdrawn due to an increased risk of intussusception.</span></p>",
