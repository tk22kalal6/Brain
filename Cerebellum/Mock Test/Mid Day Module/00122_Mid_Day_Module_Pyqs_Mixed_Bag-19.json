This is the first step because the TSH test helps determine whether the nodule is functioning (producing thyroid hormone) or non-functioning. If TSH is suppressed, indicating a hyperfunctioning (autonomous) nodule, further evaluation with a radionuclide scan may be appropriate to assess whether the nodule is \"hot\" (functioning). If TSH is normal or elevated, the next steps typically include an ultrasound (USG) of the neck and possibly fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, depending on ultrasound findings. The management plan is tailored based on these initial results.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

This is highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, particularly in the context of immobilization and the hypercoagulable state following surgery.

Additionally, lower albumin levels help to reduce blood viscosity and facilitate the movement of immune cells to sites of inflammation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Given the clinical context of weight loss, fever, and ascites, along with a high ADA level, it is reasonable to initiate anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) without further invasive testing. Starting ATT and monitoring the patient's response is an effective and practical approach, especially in resource-limited settings.

The great saphenous vein has superior patency rates and fewer complications compared to synthetic grafts in this setting. When available and of good quality, the GSV is the preferred choice for femoropopliteal bypass.

Dacron: </strong>Dacron is a brand name for a type of polyester fiber. It has been used as vascular graft material for several years. Dacron grafts are synthetic and durable, and they are primarily used for larger vessel grafts such as aortoiliac or aortofemoral bypass procedures. However, for femoropopliteal bypass, especially for below-the-knee grafts, Dacron is associated with lower patency rates compared to autologous vein grafts<strong>.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

PTFE grafts are most commonly used when a suitable autologous vein is not available. PTFE has acceptable patency rates, especially for above-the-knee femoropopliteal bypasses. However, for below-the-knee grafts, the GSV usually outperforms PTFE in terms of long-term patency<strong>.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Short Saphenous Vein: </strong>The short saphenous vein runs along the back of the calf and drains into the popliteal vein. While it can be used as a graft for femoropopliteal bypass, it is not as commonly chosen as the great saphenous vein. The GSV is generally longer, more superficial, and easier to harvest, making it the preferred autologous graft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The great saphenous vein is the preferred graft material for femoropopliteal bypass due to its superior patency rates and longevity compared to synthetic grafts like Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</span></p>",
