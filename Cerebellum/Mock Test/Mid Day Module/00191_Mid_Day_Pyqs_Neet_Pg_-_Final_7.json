A) Cocaine</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cocaine is a <strong>powerful sympathomimetic drug</strong> that stimulates the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as tachycardia (rapid heart rate) and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). One of the distinctive signs of cocaine abuse is the presence of multiple scratch marks on the body. This occurs due to tactile hallucinations, commonly referred to as \"cocaine bugs\" or \"formication/ Magnan Symptoms\" where the user feels as though insects are crawling on or under their skin, causing them to scratch incessantly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>B</strong>. <strong>Morphine:</strong> Morphine is a <strong>central nervous system depressant</strong>, not a stimulant. It typically causes bradycardia (slow heart rate) rather than tachycardia or arrhythmias. It also does not produce tactile hallucinations or scratch marks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>C</strong>. <strong>Datura:</strong> Although Datura can cause tachycardia and arrhythmias due to its anticholinergic properties, it is not commonly known as a drug of abuse. Moreover, Datura does not typically cause the tactile hallucinations that result in scratch marks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>D</strong>. <strong>Cannabis:</strong> Cannabis has <strong>minimal physiological effects</strong> compared to cocaine. It is unlikely to cause significant tachycardia or arrhythmias. Cannabis also does not cause tactile hallucinations or the resultant scratch marks seen with cocaine use.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cocaine abuse can be identified by symptoms of tachycardia, arrhythmias, and the presence of scratch marks due to tactile hallucinations (cocaine bugs).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>“Cocaine is the drug of abuse”</strong></span></p>",

The LDL receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of cholesterol levels in the blood by mediating the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles into cells, particularly in the liver. When the LDL receptor is defective or absent, LDL particles cannot be effectively removed from the bloodstream, leading to elevated cholesterol levels, which predispose individuals to atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.

Gluteus maximus</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The superior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae muscles. Gluteus maximus is instead innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve. The superior gluteal nerve arises from the sacral plexus (L4, L5, S1) and exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle. It then runs between the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles and supplies both these muscles along with the tensor fasciae latae.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option&nbsp;A. Gluteus medius</strong> - This muscle is correctly innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. It functions primarily as a hip abductor and helps stabilize the pelvis during walking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option&nbsp;C. Gluteus minimus</strong> - This is indeed supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. Like the gluteus medius, it acts as a hip abductor and medial rotator of the thigh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option&nbsp;D. Tensor fasciae latae</strong> - This muscle receives innervation from the superior gluteal nerve. It functions to tense the fascia lata and assists in hip flexion, abduction, and medial rotation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Education Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) innervates three muscles: gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae, while the gluteus maximus receives its innervation from the inferior gluteal nerve (L5, S1, S2).</p>",

Latissimus dorsi:</strong> This muscle is known as the \"stand at ease\" muscle, the \"climbers muscle,\" and the \"swimmers muscle.\" It originates from the back and inserts into the front between two major muscles. When it contracts, it causes backward movement, extension, adduction, and medial rotation of the shoulder.
