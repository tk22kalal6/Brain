Therefore, serum lipids must be more closely monitored in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment. Dietary modifications, reduction in dose, or drug therapy should be employed to control significant elevations of triglycerides. If, despite these measures, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL levels persist, the discontinuation of acitretin should be considered. So, acitretin is not contra-indicated in these patients, but should be used cautiously.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Female patients should avoid getting pregnant for 3 years after therapy:&nbsp;</strong>Female patients of childbearing age should avoid getting pregnant after therapy because acitretin is teratogenic and can cause fetal malformations.

This long half-life also means that accumulation of the drug can occur with repeated dosing, increasing the risk of toxicity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Acitretin is not contraindicated in persons with hyperlipidemia, although lipid levels should be monitored during therapy.

This can happen if the thoracic duct is damaged. The thoracic duct is a major lymphatic vessel that runs in the thorax but is not typically at risk with subclavian line placement. Chylothorax would be more of a concern with procedures that are done in close proximity to the thoracic duct, like surgeries or interventions in the mediastinum or around the esophagus.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Arterial puncture</strong> is one of the most common complications associated with the subclavian approach for central venous catheter placement. The subclavian artery lies directly beneath the vein, so inadvertent puncture of the artery can occur if the needle is advanced too deeply or at an incorrect angle. Accidental puncture of the subclavian artery can lead to complications such as hematoma, hemothorax, and can also be problematic if not recognized because threading a catheter into the arterial system can have catastrophic consequences.</span></p>",

Polyclonal B Cell Activation</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><br>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is specifically known to induce autoimmunity through polyclonal B cell activation. This mechanism involves direct stimulation of multiple B cell clones without antigen specificity, leading to excessive antibody production including autoantibodies. EBV can bypass the normal antigen-specific activation pathway, stimulating many B cell clones simultaneously and resulting in hypergammaglobulinemia with potential self-reactive antibodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Molecular Mimicry</strong> - This mechanism involves microorganisms sharing antigenic determinants with self-antigens, causing cross-reactive immune responses. While this is a legitimate mechanism of autoimmunity (examples include Shigella flexneri and HLA B27), it's not the primary mechanism by which EBV induces autoimmunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Release of Sequestered Antigen</strong> - This occurs when normally hidden self-antigens (like spermatozoa or ocular antigens) are released following tissue injury, triggering an immune response. EBV does not primarily operate through this mechanism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C.

The mesonephric duct is one of the primary structures in the early embryonic development of the urinary and reproductive systems.

In cells, the non-diffusible ions are primarily the negatively charged proteins (Prot-) trapped inside. This creates an electrical imbalance that affects the distribution of all permeable ions, ultimately resulting in more total osmotically active particles (ions) inside the cell than outside. This ion imbalance contributes to the osmotic pressure that would make cells swell and potentially rupture if not counterbalanced by the Na, K ATPase pump.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;a.
