This is typically associated with injury of the median nerve, leading to weakness in the thenar muscles. In the context of a lateral condyle fracture, this is less likely unless there was direct injury to the median nerve, which is uncommon.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/04/screenshot-2024-10-04-171806.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"281\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B) Pointing index sign:&nbsp;</strong>The pointing index sign occurs when the patient can extend the index finger while the other fingers are flexed, often due to median nerve damage. In children with fractures of the humerus, this might be seen if the injury affected the median nerve. However, this sign specifically indicates issues with the median nerve, not directly related to the complications of a lateral condyle fracture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/04/screenshot-2024-10-04-171814.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"295\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C) Wrist drop:&nbsp;</strong>Wrist drop is a clinical sign indicative of radial nerve injury, characterized by the inability to extend the wrist and fingers, leading to a \"dropped\" appearance. While the radial nerve can be affected by humeral fractures, especially those involving the lateral condyle, wrist drop would not typically present as a direct result of a healed fracture that has caused deformity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/04/screenshot-2024-10-04-172024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Loss of adduction and abduction of fingers, directly ties to potential ulnar nerve involvement due to the fracture's anatomical implications and healing process.</span></li></ul>",

OA typically results from a combination of factors, including age, wear and tear on the joints, obesity, and previous joint injuries. Patients with OA may present with joint pain, swelling, and reduced range of motion. Pain is usually worse with activity and improves with rest. X-rays typically show joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis, but not lytic lesions. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. In this case, the presence of a lytic lesion is not consistent with osteoarthritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B) Primary Bone Tumour:&nbsp;</strong>Primary bone tumours are tumours that originate in the bone itself. They can be benign or malignant. Common primary malignant bone tumours include osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. Patients may experience localized pain, swelling, and sometimes systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss. Imaging studies may show lytic or sclerotic lesions, depending on the tumour type. However, primary bone tumours are more common in younger individuals and are less likely to occur in someone with a history of cancer. Diagnosis often involves imaging and biopsy. While possible, the context of a known history of breast cancer makes this less likely than metastatic disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Avascular Necrosis:&nbsp;</strong>Avascular necrosis, also known as osteonecrosis, is the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. AVN can be caused by trauma, prolonged use of corticosteroids, alcoholism, or certain medical conditions. Patients may present with joint pain, especially during weight-bearing activities. Imaging may show areas of bone collapse or cystic changes, but AVN typically presents with more subchondral changes rather than lytic lesions. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, imaging studies (X-rays or MRI), and the presence of risk factors. The description of a lytic lesion in the context of this patient's history does not align with AVN.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Metastatic Disease aligns with the common presentation of breast cancer metastasizing to the bones, particularly in the context of a known malignancy.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Lytic lesions (areas of bone destruction) are commonly seen on imaging studies.</span></li></ul>",

In osteomalacia, alkaline phosphatase levels are typically increased due to the increased osteoblastic activity in response to inadequate mineralization of bone. This elevation serves as a compensatory mechanism as the body attempts to mineralize the osteoid matrix. This is a diagnostic feature of osteomalacia.

They are indicative of insufficient mineralization and are a hallmark of osteomalacia. This is a diagnostic feature of osteomalacia.

Fractures increase the risk of venous thromboembolism due to immobility, injury to blood vessels, and other factors such as surgery or trauma. Long bone fractures, particularly in the lower extremities, are significant risk factors for PE. Symptoms may include sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, and sometimes hemoptysis. Severe cases can lead to collapse or death. PE can be a serious and life-threatening condition.

However, DVT can also be asymptomatic, which makes it harder to detect. If a DVT dislodges, it can lead to a pulmonary embolism, as mentioned above. Thus, while DVT itself may not be life-threatening, it poses a significant risk for more severe complications. Prophylaxis with anticoagulants and mobilization strategies are essential to prevent DVT in patients with long bone fractures.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Associated Joint Injuries:&nbsp;</strong>Long bone fractures can often be accompanied by injuries to adjacent joints, which may affect their function, stability, and overall recovery. Common associated injuries can include ligament tears, cartilage damage, and dislocations. Joint injuries can lead to chronic pain, decreased range of motion, instability, and long-term complications such as osteoarthritis. While associated joint injuries can significantly impact the function and quality of life, they typically do not pose an immediate life threat compared to the other complications listed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis are also severe and potentially life-threatening conditions, fat embolism can present acutely after a fracture and lead to multiple organ system failure, making it particularly concerning.</span></p></li></ul>",

SCFE is associated with growth plate instability and can be related to obesity or hormonal factors. It is most commonly seen during periods of rapid growth. Symptoms include hip or knee pain, limping, and reduced range of motion, particularly internal rotation. The pain may be referred to the knee, leading to initial misdiagnosis.

It can occur after an injury or surgery but can also arise without any clear precipitating event, particularly in immunocompromised children. Symptoms include localized bone pain, swelling, fever, and sometimes a limp. Pain may be severe and localized rather than diffuse. X-rays may show bone changes, but early osteomyelitis may not be visible until there is significant bone loss. MRI is often more sensitive for detecting early changes. Diagnosis typically involves clinical evaluation, blood tests, and imaging. Given the chronic presentation and specific findings, osteomyelitis is less likely in this scenario.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Osteosarcoma:&nbsp;</strong>Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumour that typically arises in the metaphysis of long bones, most commonly around the knee in adolescents.

This pathogen was once a common cause of septic arthritis in children, particularly those under 5 years of age, before the widespread use of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. It typically spreads through respiratory droplets and can lead to systemic infections, including septic arthritis, in vulnerable populations. Septic arthritis caused by H. influenzae usually presents similarly to other causes, with fever and joint pain.

It can cause septic arthritis, particularly in children, but is not the most common causative agent. It is more associated with infections of the respiratory system and can spread to joints. Like H. influenzae, it spreads through respiratory droplets and can lead to systemic infections, including septic arthritis. The presentation of septic arthritis caused by S. pneumoniae is similar to that of other organisms, with joint pain and swelling.

Some strains can cause serious infections, including urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal disease. E. coli can cause septic arthritis, particularly in neonates and children with underlying conditions, such as urinary tract infections or abdominal infections, leading to hematogenous spread. It typically enters joints through the bloodstream or following trauma. It is more common in children with specific risk factors. Symptoms are similar to other causes of septic arthritis, including joint swelling, pain, and fever. While E. coli can cause septic arthritis, it is not the most prevalent organism responsible for this condition in children.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The most common cause of septic arthritis in children is Staphylococcus aureus.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While other pathogens like Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli can also cause this condition, they are less frequently encountered compared to Staphylococcus aureus in current clinical settings.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the impact of vaccination programs have influenced the epidemiology of these infections over time.</span></p></li></ul>",

In cutaneous anthrax, the diagnosis is mostly clinical. However, confirmation can be established by the culture of the lesion, serologic testing, or punch biopsy.

Angle of jaw is most commonly involved. Involvement of bone is usually due to adjacent soft tissues. Mandible is most commonly involved. Vertebrae (spreading from lung or gut) or pelvis (spreading from cecum or colon) may also be involved. Infection of an extremity is uncommon. X-ray show cystic areas of bone destruction with concomitant bone formation and bone destruction.
