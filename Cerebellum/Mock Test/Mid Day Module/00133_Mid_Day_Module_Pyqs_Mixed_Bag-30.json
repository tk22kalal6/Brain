It typically presents when the CD4 count drops below 500 cells per cubic millimeter. Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels. The exact CD4 count at which Kaposi's sarcoma presents can vary, but it is generally observed in patients with moderately suppressed immune systems, which corresponds to a CD4 count of less than 500 cells/mm³.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Graph showing&nbsp;</strong>the<strong> Opportunistic infections </strong>associated with<strong> HIV infections and </strong>correlation with<strong> CD4 T cells counts.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/30/screenshot-2024-08-30-180625.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\"></strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When the CD4 count is at 500, individuals might also face bacterial skin infections, HSV, and fungal infections.

These one-celled conidia are tear shaped to clavate and do not yield chains. The S. schenckii colonies never become cottony or floccose.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infection with the dimorphic soil fungus S schenckii is usually transmitted by the mold form from organic matter through cutaneous inoculation. The mycosis has also been transmitted from animals through bites or scratches.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The initial reddish, necrotic, nodular papule of cutaneous sporotrichosis generally appears 1-10 weeks after a penetrating skin injury. The lesion is a suppurating granuloma that consists of histiocytes and giant cells, with neutrophils that accumulate in the center and that are surrounded by lymphocytes and plasma cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The fungal infection spreads from the initial lesion along lymphatic channels, forming the chain of indolent nodular and ulcerating lesions typical of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Other tissues are involved by direct extension and, less often, by hematogenous dissemination. The most common extracutaneous infection sites are in the bones, joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae. Hematogenous dissemination—particularly in immunocompromised hosts—results in widely disseminated cutaneous and visceral infection, including meningitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Eumyectoma or mycetoma&nbsp;</strong>also called as Madura foot, is a chronic subcutaneous granulomatous soft-tissue infection. The etiological agent may be fungal (eumycetoma) or bacterial (actinomycetoma) and appears under microscopic examination as hyphae or thin filaments, respectively. The cardinal features of the disease are tumefaction, sinus formation, and presentation of grains or granules in draining exudate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Phialophora verrucosa</strong> is a common cause of chromoblastomycosis. A primary lesion is represented by an erythematous papule or a warty growth, which gradually enlarges from the site of infection assuming various forms and sizes. The infection may occur anywhere on the body, however most frequently it affects limbs, especially feet and shins. The fungus is seen as round or irregular, dark brown, yeast-like bodies with septae, (known as sclerotic bodies) on histology.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/03/31/1_grpav2l.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"380\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Sporothrix schenckii, the cause of sporotrichosis, typically presents as a chain of nodular and ulcerating lesions along lymphatic channels following traumatic inoculation, earning it the name \"Rose Gardener's Disease.\"</span></p>",

In the image, the pink, circular structures with a laminated appearance are keratin pearls.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Intercellular bridges, also known as <strong>desmosomes</strong>, are specialized cell junctions that connect adjacent squamous epithelial cells.
