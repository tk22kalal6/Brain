A) Rotator cuff tear</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) and their tendons that surround the shoulder joint.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">They help to stabilize the humerus in the shoulder socket and facilitate shoulder movement, especially rotation and abduction (lifting the arm away from the body).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A tear can be partial or full thickness.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In a 60-year-old, tears are often degenerative due to chronic wear and tear, age-related changes in tendon vascularity, and repetitive overhead activities.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Acute tears can also occur from trauma (e.g., a fall).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Clinical Presentation:&nbsp;</strong></span><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Pain</strong>: Often worse with overhead activities, at night, or when lying on the affected side.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Weakness</strong>: Difficulty lifting the arm, especially against resistance.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Limited Range of Motion: </strong>Primarily active range of motion (patient trying to move the arm), while passive range of motion (someone else moving the arm) may be less affected, unless significant pain or stiffness is present.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Positive Drop Arm Test:</strong> This is performed by passively abducting the patient's arm to 90 degrees and then asking them to slowly lower it.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A positive test occurs if the patient cannot smoothly control the lowering of the arm and it \"drops\" suddenly, or if they experience significant pain. This specifically indicates a tear of the supraspinatus tendon.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The patient's age, chronic pain and weakness, and the definitive positive drop arm test strongly point to a rotator cuff tear. This test is a classic indicator of supraspinatus pathology, which is the most commonly torn rotator cuff tendon.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Adhesive Capsulitis:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A condition characterized by significant pain and progressive stiffness and loss of both active and passive range of motion in the shoulder joint. It involves thickening and contraction of the joint capsule.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Often idiopathic (no clear cause), but can be associated with diabetes, thyroid disorders, or immobilization after injury.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Clinical Presentation:&nbsp;</strong></span><ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Pain</strong>: Often severe, especially in the initial \"freezing\" phase.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Progressive Stiffness:</strong> Characterized by a global loss of both active and passive range of motion in multiple planes (abduction, external rotation, internal rotation). This is a key differentiator from a rotator cuff tear where passive range of motion is often preserved.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While a 60-year-old can develop adhesive capsulitis, the primary finding in the case is weakness and a positive drop arm test.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While adhesive capsulitis causes weakness due to pain and stiffness, the drop arm test is not typically positive in adhesive capsulitis in the way it is for a rotator cuff tear.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The hallmark of adhesive capsulitis is restricted passive range of motion, which isn't explicitly mentioned as the primary issue.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

Scapular Winging:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A condition where the scapula (shoulder blade) protrudes abnormally from the back of the thorax, resembling a \"wing.\"&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">This is due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles that stabilize the scapula, most commonly the serratus anterior (due to long thoracic nerve injury) or the trapezius (due to accessory nerve injury).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Causes</strong>: Nerve injury (e.g., from trauma, surgery, or viral illness), muscle weakness, or instability.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Visible protrusion of the scapula, especially during arm elevation or pushing activities. Can cause pain and weakness, particularly with overhead activities.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While it causes weakness and can lead to shoulder pain, the primary finding for scapular winging is the visible deformity of the scapula.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">More importantly, it does not typically result in a positive drop arm test. The weakness pattern is different, impacting the ability to stabilize the scapula rather than directly impacting the ability of the rotator cuff to hold the arm in abduction.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The drop arm test specifically assesses the integrity of the supraspinatus tendon, a key component of the rotator cuff.</span></p>",

D) Avascular necrosis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A condition resulting from the temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to a bone.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Without blood, the bone tissue dies and eventually collapses. In the hip, it commonly affects the femoral head (the \"ball\" part of the hip joint).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Can occur at any age but is often seen in adults between 30-60 years.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Steroid use (most common non-traumatic cause), alcohol abuse, trauma (fractures/dislocations of the hip), sickle cell disease, lupus, Gaucher's disease, chemotherapy, radiation, kidney disease, etc. While not explicitly mentioned, many 60-year-olds might have underlying conditions or medication use that could predispose them to AVN.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Gradual onset of pain, initially intermittent, then constant. Pain often worsens with weight-bearing. Limping is common. Range of motion may be restricted, especially internal rotation and abduction, due to pain.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Early X-rays can be normal. Later stages show sclerosis (increased bone density), lucency (areas of bone death), subchondral collapse (crescent sign), and eventual flattening of the femoral head and joint space narrowing. MRI is the most sensitive imaging test for early AVN.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In a 60-year-old with hip pain and limping, AVN is a significant consideration, especially if there are risk factors (even if unstated).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The progression can be relatively insidious, and the pain often worsens with weight-bearing.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. TB Hip (Tuberculosis of the Hip):</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Tuberculosis affecting the hip joint is a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. It's a chronic infectious disease that can lead to joint destruction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While TB can affect any age, isolated TB hip in a 60-year-old in a non-endemic area without other systemic symptoms of TB (fever, night sweats, weight loss) is less common than other degenerative or ischemic conditions. It's more often seen in younger individuals or those from endemic regions, or with compromised immune systems.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Chronic pain, limping, muscle spasm, and progressive restriction of hip movement. There might be constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Early X-rays might be normal, but later show joint space narrowing, subchondral erosions, and often a \"cold abscess\" (a collection of pus without the usual signs of acute inflammation).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While possible, the absence of systemic symptoms or a known TB history in a 60-year-old makes it less probable as a primary diagnosis compared to other more common hip pathologies in this age group.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">TB hip often progresses slower and might have more diffuse joint involvement on imaging.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that primarily causes inflammation of the synovial lining of joints. It's typically polyarticular (affecting multiple joints) and symmetrical.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Can occur at any age but often presents between 30 and 60 years. While it can affect the hip, it usually involves smaller joints of the hands and feet first and then progresses to larger joints.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Joint pain, stiffness (especially morning stiffness lasting over 30 minutes), swelling, tenderness, and warmth.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Fatigue and generalized malaise are common. Hip involvement often comes later in the disease course and is typically bilateral.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">X-ray Features: Symmetrical joint space narrowing, erosions, and periarticular osteopenia.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The presentation describes left hip pain (unilateral). While RA can affect the hip, it's typically part of a broader, polyarticular, and often symmetrical joint involvement pattern. The sole presentation of unilateral hip pain makes RA less likely than conditions primarily affecting one hip.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the axial skeleton (spine and sacroiliac joints), leading to stiffness and fusion of vertebrae. It's a type of spondyloarthritis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood (typically before 40 years of age). It is rare for AS to present for the first time at 60 years old.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Chronic back pain and stiffness, especially in the morning and improving with exercise.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Hip involvement can occur, often bilateral, and can be severe, but it's typically secondary to or concurrent with spinal involvement.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">&nbsp;Sacroiliitis (inflammation of the SI joints) is the hallmark. Spinal changes include squaring of vertebrae and eventual \"bamboo spine.\" Hip involvement shows symmetrical joint space narrowing and erosions.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The age of onset (60 years old) makes new onset Ankylosing Spondylitis extremely unlikely. While a patient with pre-existing AS might have hip pain at 60, the primary presentation at this age would not typically be AS.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Avascular Necrosis</strong> is the most plausible answer among the given choices for a 60-year-old presenting with unilateral hip pain and limping.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">&nbsp;It is likely due to typical age of onset, systemic features, or predominant unilateral hip pain presentation.</span></li></ul>",

As a result, the myocardial tissue becomes structurally vulnerable to rupture.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">&nbsp;Ventricular rupture can lead to cardiac tamponade, which presents with sudden hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension — features consistent with <strong>Beck’s triad</strong> of tamponade physiology.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In this clinical scenario, the patient developed acute hemodynamic compromise on day 5 post-MI, which is classic for <strong>ventricular rupture</strong>, making it the most likely complication in the third to seventh day window.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Intracardiac thrombus formation:</strong> Thrombosis (intracardiac mural thrombus) is a known complication after MI, but it is more common in areas of akinetic myocardium, especially in large anterior infarcts. While mural thrombus can occur around the 3–7 day period, it does not typically cause acute tamponade and sudden hemodynamic collapse, making it less likely the cause in this patient with hypotension and features of tamponade.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Autoimmune pericarditis:</strong> This refers to <strong>Dressler syndrome</strong>, which is an autoimmune pericarditis occurring weeks after myocardial infarction, not usually in the third to seventh day window. Dressler syndrome is characterized by fever, pleuritic chest pain, and a pericardial friction rub, rather than sudden tamponade. Therefore, autoimmune pericarditis is incorrect in this time frame and setting.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Conduction disturbances:</strong> Arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are among the most common early complications of MI but tend to happen within the first 24–48 hours. While arrhythmias can still occur later, they do not classically present with cardiac tamponade physiology. Thus, although conduction disturbances are possible, they are not the most likely cause of tamponade in a patient 3–7 days post-MI.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Ventricular free wall rupture is the most feared complication 3–7 days after myocardial infarction due to macrophage-mediated tissue degradation before collagen scar formation<strong>.</strong></span></p>",

The image reveals areas of erythema surrounded by a <strong>white, serpiginous border</strong>, primarily on the dorsum of the tongue.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">These findings are classic for <strong>Geographic tongue</strong>, also known as <strong>benign migratory glossitis</strong>.
