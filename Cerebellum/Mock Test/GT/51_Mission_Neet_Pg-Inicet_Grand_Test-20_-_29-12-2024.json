Nicotine patch:</strong> The nicotine patch is a form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) that delivers a steady, controlled dose of nicotine through the skin to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. While it is effective in some individuals, it does not prevent weight gain, and its success rate is lower compared to bupropion or varenicline, with a 20% success rate. Additionally, nicotine replacement therapy can have a lower efficacy when compared to agents like bupropion in terms of long-term smoking cessation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Varenicline</strong>: Varenicline is a partial agonist at nicotinic receptors, which reduces the pleasurable effects of smoking and alleviates withdrawal symptoms. While it is effective, varenicline is associated with a higher risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. For this reason, it may not be the best option for patients who do not have a history of psychiatric disorders but may have concerns about such side effects. Moreover, weight gain is not typically a concern with varenicline.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Clonidine</strong>: Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that is primarily used for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. However, clonidine is less effective in promoting long-term cessation compared to bupropion or varenicline, and it can be associated with side effects such as hypotension and sedation. It is not as commonly used as a first-line agent for smoking cessation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Bupropion is an effective pharmacologic option for smoking cessation, especially in patients who are concerned about weight gain after quitting smoking.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">It is weight-neutral or slightly weight-reducing and works by inhibiting dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake.
