B) Erythema migrans</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Erythema migrans is a characteristic rash seen in Lyme disease, an infection caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by tick bites. This rash typically appears within 3-30 days of the tick bite, beginning as a small red spot that gradually expands in a circular or target-like pattern. The lesion can reach sizes of 5-30 cm or more and is usually warm to the touch but not painful. The expanding nature of the rash without pain or itching, combined with its target-like appearance, strongly suggests erythema migrans, especially if the patient has a history of potential tick exposure in endemic areas.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Erythema migrans is often diagnosed clinically based on its characteristic appearance, especially in regions where Lyme disease is common.

It is responsible for <strong>internal rotation</strong> of the humerus (upper arm) and plays a role in adduction and extension of the arm.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A tear in the <strong>subscapularis tendon</strong> affects the ability to internally rotate the arm and lift it behind the back. This tendon is crucial for the <strong>internal rotation</strong> of the shoulder and for bringing the hand behind the back, as seen in this patient’s inability to lift the arm after it is placed behind the back.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>test for a subscapularis tear</strong> is called the <strong>\"lift-off\" test</strong>. In this test, the patient is asked to place the back of their hand on their lower back and then try to lift the hand away from the back. If the tendon is torn, the patient will be unable to do so.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Subscapularis tear leads to weakness in internal rotation, making it difficult to lift the hand from the back. Despite the intact ability to abduct the arm and place the hand on the lower back, the person cannot lift it due to the lack of effective internal rotation and shoulder stabilization.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Teres Major Tendon Tear:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>teres major</strong> muscle is located on the posterior (back) part of the scapula and plays a role in internal rotation, extension, and adduction of the arm, especially when the arm is in a raised position. The teres major works synergistically with the latissimus dorsi.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">However, a tear of the <strong>teres major</strong> tendon would not typically result in an inability to lift the arm from the back after placing it there. This is because the <strong>teres major</strong> is less important for the specific movement of lifting the hand from the back compared to the subscapularis, which is responsible for internal rotation and lifting.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A tear of the teres major would likely affect movements like adduction and extension, especially when the arm is in a raised position. While it may affect the overall function of the shoulder, it wouldn't specifically impair the ability to lift the hand from behind the back in the way that a subscapularis tear would.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Long Head of Biceps Tendon Tear:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>long head of the biceps tendon</strong> originates from the scapula (specifically the supraglenoid tubercle) and attaches to the biceps muscle. While the biceps is primarily known for its role in elbow flexion, the long head of the biceps also contributes to <strong>shoulder flexion</strong> and <strong>stabilization</strong> of the shoulder joint.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A tear in the long head of the biceps tendon would most likely result in <strong>weakness in shoulder flexion</strong> and <strong>pain</strong> during activities involving overhead lifting. However, it would not directly impair the ability to place the hand behind the back or lift it from behind.</span></li><li><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A tear of the long head of the biceps may lead to a <strong>popeye deformity</strong> (bulging of the muscle) and decreased strength in shoulder flexion, but it would not prevent the arm from being placed behind the back or lifting it in the same way as a subscapularis tendon tear.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Acromioclavicular (AC) Joint Dislocation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>acromioclavicular (AC) joint</strong> is located where the acromion process of the scapula meets the clavicle. Dislocations of the AC joint, also known as <strong>shoulder separations</strong>, typically occur due to trauma (e.g., falling on the shoulder or direct impact). These injuries often lead to pain, swelling, and decreased ability to move the shoulder, especially with overhead or cross-body motions.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">An <strong>AC joint dislocation</strong> might cause <strong>pain and limited range of motion</strong>, especially during arm elevation or when moving the arm across the body. However, it does not directly affect the specific motion of lifting the hand from behind the back after it has been placed there. The patient's ability to internally rotate and position the arm behind the back might still be intact, even in the presence of an AC joint dislocation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">AC joint dislocations primarily cause discomfort, swelling, and weakness in overhead motions. While there may be difficulty lifting the arm, the inability to lift the hand from the lower back as described in the scenario is more likely to be due to a rotator cuff issue, such as a subscapularis tendon tear, rather than an AC joint dislocation.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Subscapularis tendon tear directly impacts the ability to internally rotate the arm and perform movements such as lifting the hand from behind the back.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The subscapularis is a key player in this motion, and a tear in its tendon would result in the specific functional limitation.</span></li></ul>",

It is based on the principle that fetal red blood cells (which contain fetal hemoglobin) are more resistant to acid than adult red blood cells.

D) Pityriasis versicolor is a form of dermatitis &amp; it is associated with atopy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Pityriasis versicolor, also known as tinea versicolor, is a superficial fungal infection caused by the yeast Malassezia. It presents as hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches on the skin, particularly on the trunk and upper arms. It is not considered a form of dermatitis and is not associated with atopy. Atopic conditions typically include conditions like atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, which are linked to immune dysregulation, not fungal infections.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Pityriasis versicolor is treated with antifungal medications rather than therapies used for dermatitis or eczematous conditions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. All eczema is dermatitis, but not all dermatitis is eczema:</strong> This statement is correct. Dermatitis is a broad term that refers to inflammation of the skin, while eczema specifically refers to a subset of dermatitis characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. All eczematous conditions are classified under dermatitis, but not all forms of dermatitis are eczematous (for example, contact dermatitis may not have the same chronic features as eczema).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Pruritus is hallmark clinical feature:</strong> This is correct. Pruritus (itching) is indeed a hallmark clinical feature of dermatitis and is commonly present in various types of dermatitis, including eczema. Itching is a central symptom that often leads to excoriation and exacerbates inflammation in dermatitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Nummular eczema is the other name for Discoid eczema:</strong> This statement is also correct. Nummular eczema, also known as discoid eczema, is a type of eczema characterized by coin-shaped, well-defined plaques of eczema on the skin. It is often intensely pruritic and commonly affects adults.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Pityriasis versicolor is not classified as a form of dermatitis and is unrelated to atopy.

Although the shadow on the X-ray initially raised suspicion of a foreign body, the patient’s history (no known ingestion of a foreign object) and the typical age-related calcification pattern support that it is likely calcified cartilage.

In spinal anesthesia, the anesthetic is injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a rapid onset of anesthesia within minutes. In contrast, epidural anesthesia requires the anesthetic to diffuse across the dura mater into the spinal nerves, which takes more time to take effect. Thus, spinal anesthesia acts faster than epidural anesthesia.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. The density of the block is less</strong>: This statement is correct. The <strong>density of the block</strong> (i.e., the intensity and completeness of the sensory and motor blockade) achieved with epidural anesthesia is generally less than that achieved with spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia typically produces a more intense and dense blockade because it directly affects the spinal cord and CSF. Epidural anesthesia allows for more controlled and graded effects, which may not be as dense as spinal anesthesia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Less chances of post-dural puncture headache:</strong> This statement is also correct. <strong>Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH)</strong> is a potential complication when the dura mater is punctured, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to leak. In spinal anesthesia, the dura is intentionally punctured to deliver the anesthetic into the CSF, which can lead to PDPH in some cases. In epidural anesthesia, however, the anesthetic is administered outside the dura mater in the epidural space, reducing the risk of PDPH since the dura is not penetrated. If the epidural needle inadvertently punctures the dura, there is still a risk of PDPH, but this is generally lower than with spinal anesthesia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. More useful in postoperative pain relief:</strong> This statement is correct. <strong>Epidural anesthesia is particularly useful for postoperative pain management</strong> because an epidural catheter can be left in place for continuous or intermittent drug delivery. This allows for extended pain control, which is particularly beneficial for surgeries with expected postoperative pain. Spinal anesthesia, on the other hand, is typically a single injection that provides a finite duration of anesthesia and is not suitable for prolonged postoperative pain management.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Epidural anesthesia and spinal anesthesia have distinct characteristics.

Nitrogen dissolved in the blood during the dive forms bubbles when there is a rapid reduction in pressure, leading to symptoms such as <strong>joint pain, dizziness, fatigue, and skin rash</strong> (known as “the bends”).

C) Failure to use splintage in safety position</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>\"safety position\"</strong> (or <strong>functional position</strong>) is an optimal position in which to splint or immobilize the hand to prevent <strong>contractures</strong> and stiffness during the healing phase. This position is designed to preserve <strong>tendon length</strong> and <strong>joint alignment</strong> while the hand heals. It typically involves:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Wrist extension</strong> of 20–30 degrees</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>MCP joint flexion</strong> (metacarpophalangeal joints) around 60-70 degrees</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>IP joints</strong> (interphalangeal joints) slightly flexed</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Thumb in a relaxed position</strong> to avoid <strong>contracture</strong> of the thenar muscles</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">When <strong>splintage is not used correctly</strong> or when the hand is <strong>immobilized in an inappropriate position</strong>, it can lead to several types of problems:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Immobilization in an improper position can cause soft tissue structures (e.g., ligaments, tendons) to adapt to a shortened or fixed position. This can result in <strong>permanent stiffness</strong> once healing is complete.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">If the hand is not immobilized in the <strong>functional position</strong>, the <strong>flexor tendons</strong> may shorten, leading to a loss of normal motion (e.g., a \"claw hand\" deformity).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Prolonged immobilization in an improper position can also cause the muscles to weaken, which further contributes to <strong>stiffness</strong> and <strong>loss of function</strong>.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Increased risk of deformities</strong>: Without proper splinting, the hand may heal in an abnormal position, leading to <strong>deformities</strong> like <strong>boutonnière deformity</strong>, <strong>mallet finger</strong>, or <strong>clawing</strong> of the fingers.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

While fractures cause pain and limit movement during the acute healing phase, stiffness is typically a result of complications arising from the <strong>healing process</strong>. Some factors related to fractures can lead to stiffness:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Inadequate fracture reduction</strong> or <strong>poor alignment</strong> of the bone during healing can result in <strong>joint malalignment</strong>, which in turn contributes to <strong>stiffness</strong>.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Post-traumatic arthritis</strong> may develop in some fractures, particularly if the joint surface is involved or if the fracture is not properly aligned.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Immobilization for prolonged periods</strong> can lead to <strong>muscle atrophy</strong> and joint stiffness as the surrounding soft tissues lose flexibility and strength.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Tendon Injuries:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Tendon injuries are a common cause of stiffness in hand injuries, particularly <strong>flexor tendon injuries</strong> (e.g., lacerations or ruptures of the flexor tendons). Tendons are responsible for the smooth movement of the hand and fingers, and any disruption in their function can result in stiffness:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">After tendon injuries, scar tissue can form around the injured tendon, restricting its ability to glide smoothly through its tendon sheath. This results in <strong>functional stiffness</strong> in the affected fingers or hand.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">After tendon repairs, <strong>immobilization</strong> is often necessary during the healing phase to avoid disrupting the repair. However, this can lead to stiffness if not carefully managed, as prolonged immobilization can result in <strong>joint contractures</strong> and <strong>muscle atrophy</strong>.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">If proper <strong>rehabilitation exercises</strong> are not followed after tendon repair or injury, it can result in long-term stiffness due to the lack of normal tendon movement.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. The Presence of Edema:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Edema</strong> (swelling) is a common and normal response to hand injuries, including fractures, sprains, tendon injuries, and soft tissue damage. Swelling can initially contribute to stiffness by limiting the ability of the joints and tendons to move smoothly.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Edema is typically a short-term issue</strong>: Swelling usually resolves with appropriate <strong>elevation</strong>, <strong>compression</strong>, and <strong>movement</strong> once the acute inflammatory phase has passed.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Edema-related stiffness</strong> is typically temporary and improves as the swelling goes down.

The <strong>retropharyngeal space</strong> is closely related to critical structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and major blood vessels (e.g., internal carotid arteries).

C) Fracture comminution</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Fracture comminution refers to the degree of fragmentation or splintering of the femoral bone at the site of the fracture. Comminuted fractures involve multiple bone fragments, making the reduction and realignment process more difficult.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Malrotation risk with comminuted fractures: In comminuted fractures, the fracture fragments may not be able to be aligned easily because the fragments often have no clear anatomical relationship to one another. This leads to difficulty in maintaining correct rotational alignment during the reduction process.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Comminution can result in soft tissue interposition, loss of fracture reduction, or inability to achieve a proper rotational alignment during the insertion of the intramedullary nail.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Comminuted fractures are one of the primary causes of malrotation during femoral nailing because they make it more difficult to achieve and maintain the correct rotational alignment. The smaller and more fragmented the pieces of bone, the more likely the surgeon is to over-rotate or under-rotate the fragments while attempting to reduce and align the femur. Therefore, fracture comminution is the most associated factor with malrotation.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The <strong>antegrade</strong> femoral nailing technique uses an entry point at the <strong>distal femur</strong>, typically at the <strong>greater trochanter</strong>, while <strong>retrograde</strong> nailing uses an entry point at the <strong>distal femoral condyles</strong>.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Malrotation risks from entry point</strong>: The correct entry point is crucial because <strong>misplacement of the entry point</strong> can lead to incorrect alignment of the femoral nail in the bone, which in turn can lead to rotational malalignment. However, <strong>entry point errors</strong> typically affect the <strong>anteroposterior alignment</strong> (i.e., the position of the nail in the sagittal plane) more than <strong>rotation</strong> specifically.

The level of the fracture is important because it influences the biomechanical forces acting on the fracture, the method of reduction, and the potential for deformities after fixation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Higher fractures (proximal femur) might be associated with more difficult reductions because of the <strong>bony and soft tissue structures</strong> in the region (e.g., hip joint, muscles). <strong>Distal fractures</strong>, especially those near the knee, may also be challenging because of the close proximity to the knee joint, which can make rotational alignment more difficult.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While the <strong>fracture level</strong> affects the technical challenges of reduction, it is not the <strong>most important factor</strong> in causing <strong>rotational malalignment</strong> during nailing. The degree of comminution (destruction of the bone) or other factors like soft tissue interference are more likely to influence the outcome.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Experienced surgeons are more likely to achieve proper <strong>fracture reduction</strong> and <strong>alignment</strong>, and to be able to make adjustments if rotational malalignment occurs.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Inexperienced surgeons may struggle more with achieving correct alignment and managing complex fractures, which could increase the risk of malrotation. However, a <strong>skilled surgeon</strong> can generally correct <strong>malrotation</strong> during the procedure, especially if they are aware of the challenges associated with certain fracture types.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While <strong>surgeon experience</strong> is important, it is not as directly related to malrotation as the <strong>comminution</strong> or <strong>fracture pattern</strong> itself. Even experienced surgeons can struggle with highly comminuted fractures or with fractures in challenging anatomical locations.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Comminution makes it significantly more difficult to achieve proper reduction and rotational alignment of the femur during nailing.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">When the bone is shattered into multiple fragments, it becomes harder to align them properly, leading to a higher risk of malrotation.</span></li></ul>",

C) Alanine aminotransferase</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)</strong> is an enzyme that plays a critical role in amino acid metabolism by catalyzing the transfer of an amino group from alanine to α-ketoglutarate, forming pyruvate and glutamate. This process requires <strong>pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)</strong>, the active form of vitamin B6, as a cofactor. In cases of vitamin B6 deficiency, ALT activity is compromised because PLP is essential for the enzyme's function. Vitamin B6 deficiency thus affects amino acid metabolism and can lead to neurological and hematological symptoms due to impaired synthesis of neurotransmitters and heme.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Glutaminase</strong>: Glutaminase converts glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, which is important in renal ammonia production. However, this enzyme does not require pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor and is therefore not directly affected by a deficiency in vitamin B6.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Glutamate dehydrogenase:</strong> Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia. This enzyme uses NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactors but does not depend on pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), making it unaffected by vitamin B6 deficiency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Glutamine synthetase:</strong> Glutamine synthetase catalyzes the conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine. It requires ATP but does not use pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor, so its activity is not impacted by a lack of vitamin B6.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)</strong> is dependent on pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, for its catalytic activity.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Vitamin B6 deficiency impairs enzymes that rely on PLP, which disrupts amino acid metabolism and can lead to neurological and hematological symptoms.</span></li></ul>",
