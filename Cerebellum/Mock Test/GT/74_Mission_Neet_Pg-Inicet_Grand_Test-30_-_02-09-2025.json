Hypothyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities via altered prolactin and gonadotropin levels, but patients often present with systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, constipation, or cold intolerance.

It is the most common congenital paralytic squint:&nbsp;</strong>False. Congenital abducens palsy is rare; the <strong>oculomotor</strong> and <strong>trochlear</strong> palsies are more commonly seen congenitally, and the most common congenital squint overall is <strong>congenital esotropia</strong>, not specifically a paralytic form.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Correct Statements:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Statement 2. Primary deviation is less than secondary deviation:</strong> True. In paralytic squints, secondary<strong> deviation</strong> (when the affected eye fixes) is typically <strong>greater</strong> than the <strong>primary</strong> deviation (when the normal eye fixes) due to Hering’s law of equal innervation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_90CuQ4L.png\" width=\"522\" height=\"391\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Statement 3. It can be diagnosed with the forced duction test:&nbsp;</strong>True. In abducens nerve palsy, the lateral rectus muscle is weak or paralyzed. The forced duction test—where the examiner passively moves the eye—will show a <strong>free</strong> passive abduction, confirming a <strong>nerve</strong> (neurogenic) cause rather than a mechanical restriction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Statement 4. It presents with ipsilateral esotropia</strong>: True. Abducens palsy causes <strong>esotropia</strong>, the <strong>affected</strong> eye turns <strong>inward</strong> (esotropia) on the side of the lesion—this is indeed ipsilateral.
