Recognizing this subtle change allows for timely intervention before irreversible muscle and nerve damage occur.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

These processes result in reduced spinal flexibility, fusion of sacroiliac joints, and the “bamboo spine” appearance on imaging, all causing the described symptoms and functional impairment.

The most likely injury is a&nbsp;medial meniscus tear, which commonly presents with joint line pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms like locking, popping, or a painful click. The McMurray test, performed with external rotation of the tibia and extension of the knee, elicits this painful click, which is diagnostic of medial meniscus injury.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Anterior laxity of the tibia relative to the femur:&nbsp;</strong>This finding is&nbsp;typical of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury&nbsp;and is detected with the Lachman or anterior drawer test. ACL tears usually occur with a popping sensation at the time of injury and lead to immediate hemarthrosis, rather than isolated medial joint pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Excessive valgus deviation with lower leg abduction:&nbsp;</strong>This indicates&nbsp;medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury, which occurs due to force pushing the knee inward (valgus stress).

The EHL is responsible for extending the big toe and assisting in dorsiflexion of the foot; its involvement produces difficulty in toe extension and clearing the foot during gait. This presentation strongly fits the described clinical scenario of pain radiating along the L5 dermatome, after heavy lifting, with classic MRI findings of disc pathology impinging the L5 root. Since EHL weakness is sensitive for L5 radiculopathy, focusing on this muscle in neurological exam aids localization and management.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Numerous studies confirm that individuals with celiac disease have up to two times higher fracture risk, even before diagnosis, due to defective bone mineralization and inflammation.
