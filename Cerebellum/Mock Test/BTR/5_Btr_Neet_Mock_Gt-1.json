This receptor has two subunits (a and g), each crossing the membrane twice, resulting in intracellular N and C termini (NT, CT). Salt is sensed following Na<sup>+</sup> movement; sour is mediated by movement of H<sup>+</sup>. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes are sensed via G-protein-coupled receptors that span the membrane seven times and have varying lengths of CT and NT (represented as ribbon structures).

These H+ ions activate ion channels rather than G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the TRPV1 (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Receptor Type 1) channel and acid-sensitive ion channels are involved in mediating the sour taste. These channels open in response to the presence of H+ ions, allowing the ions to enter the taste cells, which leads to the perception of a sour taste.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Metabotropic receptors, which involve GPCRs, mediate other taste modalities like sweet, bitter, and umami but are not involved in sour taste.

Paget’s Disease:&nbsp;</strong>Paget's disease of bone is a chronic disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling. It involves excessive bone resorption followed by abnormal bone formation, leading to weakened bones that are prone to fractures. Paget’s disease typically affects older adults, and it is rare in individuals under 40. The disease commonly involves the pelvis, spine, femur, and skull. Paget's disease can show \"cotton wool\" appearance (patchy sclerosis), bowing of bones, and enlarged bones. In severe cases, it can lead to deformities and fractures. It may present with joint pain and deformities leading to difficulty with walking or limping, but this is rare in young people. Paget's disease can be confirmed with increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-08%20135819.jpg\" width=\"432\" height=\"446\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Multiple Myeloma:&nbsp;</strong>Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. It leads to the formation of multiple tumors in bone marrow, which can cause bone destruction, pain, fractures, and anemia. The disease is uncommon in young individuals and is typically diagnosed in people over 65 years old. In multiple myeloma, X-rays often show punched-out lesions (areas of bone destruction), and the bones may appear weakened. There may also be diffuse osteopenia (reduced bone density). Bone pain, fatigue, weakness, fractures, and in some cases, kidney problems. However, limping as an initial presenting symptom would be unusual. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed through blood tests (like serum protein electrophoresis) and bone marrow biopsy, along with imaging studies.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-08%20135835.jpg\" width=\"359\" height=\"394\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Osteopoikilosis:&nbsp;</strong>Osteopoikilosis is a rare, benign bone condition characterized by multiple, round or oval-shaped bone islands (sclerotic foci) within the bones. These are usually found incidentally on X-rays and are typically asymptomatic. It is a congenital condition, and affected individuals usually do not experience any symptoms. The key feature of osteopoikilosis is the presence of multiple small, well-circumscribed areas of increased bone density, often described as \"bone islands.\" These are most commonly seen in the pelvis, femur, and other long bones. Typically, osteopoikilosis is asymptomatic and does not cause any pain or functional impairment. It is generally found incidentally during radiological investigations for other reasons. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic appearance of bone islands on X-ray. There is no need for further clinical investigation unless complications (like fractures) occur, which is very rare.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-08%20135845.jpg\" width=\"483\" height=\"324\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Paget's disease is unlikely due to the patient's young age.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Multiple myeloma is unlikely because it's very rare in young individuals and typically presents with systemic symptoms.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Osteopoikilosis is unlikely as it is asymptomatic and would not cause limping.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Fibrous dysplasia is the most likely diagnosis due to its characteristic appearance on X-ray and its association with bone pain, deformities, and limping in young individuals.</span></li></ul>",

A) Synovial Chondromatosis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Synovial chondromatosis is a rare benign condition where the synovial membrane of joints forms multiple cartilaginous nodules.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">These nodules can become free-floating bodies within the joint, and over time, they may undergo calcification or ossification.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">It results from the metaplasia of the synovial lining, leading to the formation of cartilaginous nodules, which may later calcify or ossify.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">These free-floating nodules can cause pain, joint effusion, and limited range of motion, as the synovium becomes inflamed and irritated.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">X-rays typically reveal multiple, well-defined, round or oval-shaped calcified bodies within the joint, which may be free-floating or fixed to the synovial lining.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The classic \"popcorn\" appearance on imaging is a hallmark of synovial chondromatosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Pain, swelling, stiffness, and a decreased range of motion are common due to irritation of the synovium, along with mechanical symptoms from free-floating bodies in the joint.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Most commonly affects large joints like the knee, hip, or elbow, and it can involve both unilateral and bilateral joints.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The knee is a very common site of involvement.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Surgical excision of the nodules is the treatment of choice, and the prognosis is generally good once the nodules are removed.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Synovial Sarcoma:&nbsp;</strong>Synovial sarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumour that often arises near large joints, usually in the deep tissues of the limbs. It can occur in younger adults, commonly affecting the knee or elbow. It is a malignant tumour that arises from synovial tissue or surrounding soft tissues. Synovial sarcoma is typically characterized by a complex chromosomal translocation (t(X;18)), which leads to abnormal gene expression. Synovial sarcoma may present as a soft tissue mass near the joint. X-ray may show a well-circumscribed mass or calcifications within the soft tissue, but the tumour itself is often better seen on MRI or CT. These masses can be heterogeneous and irregular in shape, often extending into the joint or surrounding structures. Symptoms are usually related to the mass effect of the tumour. Patients may present with a palpable mass, pain, swelling, and decreased joint mobility due to the tumour’s involvement of the soft tissues around the joint. Pain often worsens with activity. Synovial sarcoma can be diagnosed with imaging studies (MRI is most helpful) and confirmed with biopsy to detect characteristic histological features. Treatment usually involves surgical resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be necessary depending on the stage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-21%20134355.jpg\" width=\"328\" height=\"347\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Osteosarcoma:&nbsp;</strong>Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumour that often arises in the metaphysis of long bones, particularly around the knee. It is more common in adolescents and young adults. Osteosarcoma arises from the osteoblasts and typically produces bone or osteoid. It can be associated with a genetic mutation (e.g., in the TP53 gene), and it often occurs in the metaphysis of long bones (femur, tibia, humerus). X-rays often show a destructive bone lesion with an aggressive appearance. There is typically an ill-defined periosteal reaction, which may result in the formation of a \"Codman's triangle\" (a raised periosteum seen on the edge of a tumour). There may also be bone fragmentation or a mixed lytic and sclerotic pattern in the lesion. Osteosarcoma typically presents with localized pain, swelling, and, in some cases, a palpable mass. The pain often worsens over time, and there may be a history of injury that exacerbates the pain. It often presents in the younger population, typically between ages 10 and 30. Imaging studies (X-ray, MRI) and biopsy are used for diagnosis. CT scans or PET scans may be performed to evaluate for metastasis, as osteosarcoma commonly metastasizes to the lungs. Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and surgical resection of the tumour.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-21%20134410.jpg\" width=\"398\" height=\"397\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Giant Cell Tumour:&nbsp;</strong>Giant cell tumour (GCT) is a benign but locally aggressive bone tumour that commonly affects the epiphysis of long bones, particularly around the knee. Giant cell tumours are composed of multinucleated giant cells and are typically found in the epiphyseal region of long bones. Although they are benign, they can cause significant local bone destruction and may recur after surgery. X-rays often show a lytic, expansile lesion in the epiphysis of long bones, commonly affecting the distal femur, proximal tibia, or radius. The lesion has a \"soap bubble\" appearance, with well-defined borders but an expansile, destructive nature. Giant cell tumours typically present with pain, swelling, and a decrease in range of motion, especially in weight-bearing joints. However, it is usually a solitary lesion and not typically associated with multiple nodules or calcifications in the joint space. Imaging studies and biopsy are used to confirm the diagnosis. MRI is helpful to determine the extent of the tumour, and biopsy confirms the presence of multinucleated giant cells. Treatment involves curettage and bone grafting, although recurrence is common. In some cases, surgical resection or joint replacement may be required.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/Screenshot%202025-02-21%20134426.jpg\" width=\"310\" height=\"419\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">While giant cell tumours can cause pain and swelling in the knee, they typically do not present with multiple calcified bodies in the joint space.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The radiographic appearance would be more characteristic of a lytic lesion rather than the calcified nodules of synovial chondromatosis.</span></li></ul>",
