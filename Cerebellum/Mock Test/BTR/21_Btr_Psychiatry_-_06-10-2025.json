She recently got a roommate, a nursing student, who leaves her stethoscope on the coffee table after returning from class. The patient sweats and feels her heart start to race whenever she sees the stethoscope. This patient's response to her roommate's stethoscope is an example of which of the following phenomena?</span></p>",

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Ans.</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>A) Classical conditioning</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In this case, the patient experiences sweating and anxiety when she sees a stethoscope. The stethoscope, which was once a neutral stimulus, has become a conditioned stimulus after repeated pairing with stressful doctor visits that caused anxiety. This is a classic example of classical conditioning where a neutral object acquires the ability to trigger a learned emotional or physical response through association.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Negative punishment:&nbsp;</strong>Negative punishment means removing a pleasant stimulus after a behavior to decrease the chance of that behavior happening again. For example, if a child misbehaves and their parents take away their toy, this is negative punishment. In the patient’s case, no positive stimulus is being taken away, so this does not fit.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Negative reinforcement:&nbsp;</strong>Negative reinforcement occurs when removal of an unpleasant stimulus makes a behavior more likely to occur in the future. For example, wearing earplugs to avoid loud noise encourages the behavior of wearing earplugs again. Here, the patient is not removing an unpleasant stimulus after any behavior, so it is not negative reinforcement.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Operant conditioning:&nbsp;</strong>Operant conditioning involves learning through consequences of behavior such as reinforcement or punishment. For example, giving a dog a treat for sitting increases the chance the dog will sit again. The patient’s anxiety is not due to consequences of her own actions but rather to an automatic association with a stimulus, so operant conditioning is not correct.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_lHbvEwU.png\" width=\"970\" height=\"885\"></span></p>",

B) Retrograde amnesia</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In retrograde amnesia, there is loss of memory for events that occurred before the onset of the amnesia. The pattern is typically temporally graded, meaning that recent memories are lost more severely than older memories. This happens because older memories are more firmly consolidated in long-term storage, while recent ones are still vulnerable to disruption.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Anterograde amnesia:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to the inability to form new memories after the onset of the condition. Patients can remember past events but struggle to create and store new information. It does not primarily affect past memories, so it is not the correct choice here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Global amnesia:&nbsp;</strong>This condition involves both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, where patients cannot form new memories and also lose some past memories. However, the defining feature in the question is recent memories being more severely affected than remote, which specifically fits retrograde amnesia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Senile dementia:&nbsp;</strong>In dementia, memory loss is progressive and involves both recent and remote memories, but recent memories are usually affected first due to impaired short-term recall. However, the mechanism is different, and the key feature of temporally graded loss as described in the question best matches retrograde amnesia.</span></p>",

D) Projection</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Projection is a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, emotions, or impulses to another person. In this case, the boy is unable to express his own negative emotions about his parents’ divorce. Instead, he unconsciously projects his feelings of anger onto his parents, believing that they are angry with him, even though they have not shown this. This matches the classic definition of projection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Acting out:</strong> Acting out refers to expressing unconscious emotions or impulses through actions rather than words. For example, a teenager who is upset about parental conflict may skip school or get into fights. The boy in this vignette is not engaging in disruptive behaviours, so acting out does not fit.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Displacement:</strong> Displacement is redirecting emotions from a threatening target to a safer one. For example, a child angry at his parents might displace the anger onto his toys or younger sibling. In this case, the boy is not redirecting his feelings but rather attributing them to his parents, so it is not displacement.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Identification:</strong> Identification occurs when a person unconsciously models themselves after another person they admire or fear. For example, a bullied child may start to behave like the bully. There is no evidence in the vignette that the boy is modeling himself on his parents, so identification is not correct.</span></p>",

Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs due to excessive serotonergic activity in the nervous system, usually as a result of combining medications that increase serotonin levels, such as SSRIs, MAO inhibitors, and TCAs. In this case, the combination of sertraline (an SSRI), an MAO inhibitor, and amitriptyline (a TCA) significantly increases serotonin, leading to the development of serotonin syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome: (<strong>Mnemonic – RASH D</strong>)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>R</strong>estlessness</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>A</strong>gitation</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>S</strong>eizures</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>H</strong>yperreflexia</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>D</strong>iarrhea</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine with serotonin receptor antagonist properties, making it the drug of choice for treating serotonin syndrome.
