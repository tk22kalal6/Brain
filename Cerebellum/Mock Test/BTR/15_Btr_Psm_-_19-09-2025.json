C) &lt;30% of the calories should come from Fat</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In diabetic patients, dietary modification is an essential part of management. Limiting fat intake to less than 30% of total calories helps reduce insulin resistance, prevent dyslipidemia, and decrease cardiovascular risk, which is high in diabetics. Within this, saturated fat should be kept below 10% of total calories, and trans fats should be avoided. Emphasis is placed on complex carbohydrates, high-fiber foods, and weight control.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. At least 80g dietary fibre:&nbsp;</strong>This amount is excessive and not practical. The recommended daily intake of fiber for diabetics is about 25–40 g, which helps improve glycemic control and lipid profile.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. &lt;8 g salt intake everyday:&nbsp;</strong>This recommendation is more relevant to hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction, not specifically to glycemic control. However, diabetics with hypertension are advised to limit salt to &lt;5 g/day.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cholesterol &lt;100g:&nbsp;</strong>This is incorrect because cholesterol intake is measured in milligrams, not grams. The actual recommendation is dietary cholesterol intake &lt;300 mg/day (and even lower, &lt;200 mg, in diabetics with cardiovascular disease).</span></p>",

Performing surgeries in makeshift hospitals or temporary rural OTs is not recommended because of poor infrastructure, risk of infection, and lack of postoperative care.

A) The states with API &lt;1 and all their districts reporting API &lt;1 are in the elimination phase</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Annual Parasite Incidence (API) is an important epidemiological indicator for malaria. According to the National Framework for Malaria Elimination in India (2016–2030), a state can be considered in the elimination phase if the API is less than 1 and <strong>all districts</strong> within that state also report API &lt;1. This ensures transmission is uniformly controlled and not just limited to selected areas. Achieving and maintaining API &lt;1 across all districts is a prerequisite before declaring malaria elimination status.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. NPU is the best for protein quality:</strong> This is incorrect. Biological Value (BV) is considered the best index for protein quality, not Net Protein Utilization (NPU). BV measures how efficiently dietary protein is converted into body proteins. Biological Value = [retained Nitrogen/Absorbed nitrogen] x 100</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Standardisation is done before comparing the mortality rates of two countries due to difference in number of deaths:</strong> Wrong because standardization corrects for differences in <strong>age structure of populations</strong>, not just the number of deaths. Crude mortality rates may be misleading if age distributions differ.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Perflation ventilation is a type of mechanical ventilation</strong>: Incorrect. There is no such type of ventilation called perflation ventilation. Recognized types include volume-controlled, pressure-controlled, high-frequency, etc. This option is a distractor.</span></p>",

D) Seal cracks and close all windows and doors</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">When airborne toxic fumes are released, the immediate safest action for people inside buildings is to “shelter in place” — close and seal windows and doors and block gaps to reduce infiltration of contaminated air. This minimizes exposure until authorities give further instructions (evacuation or decontamination). Evacuation can be dangerous if done without directions because residents might move into contaminated zones. After sealing, people should switch off ventilation/AC that brings outside air and listen to official updates.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Telephone to inform friends</strong>: Calling friends is not the immediate protective action — it wastes time and may expose the caller while delaying sheltering. Priority is to reduce exposure first; communication can follow once safely sheltered or via emergency broadcasts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Evacuate immediately</strong>: Immediate evacuation is risky unless there is clear direction from authorities; residents may move into contaminated plumes or traffic gridlock. Evacuation is done only when officials instruct and provide safe routes and destinations.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Open windows for ventilation</strong>: Opening windows increases indoor contamination by allowing toxic fumes to enter — this is the opposite of what should be done during a chemical leak. Only ventilate when authorities confirm the area is safe.</span></p>",
