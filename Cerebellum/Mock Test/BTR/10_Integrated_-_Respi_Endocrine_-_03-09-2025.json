This means that Ciclesonide is inactive when administered and only becomes active when it reaches the lungs, where it is <strong>converted into its active form by bronchial esterases</strong>. This activation in the target site, the bronchial airways, significantly reduces the drug's systemic side effects, including the risk of oral candidiasis, which is common with other inhaled corticosteroids.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Because the majority of the drug that deposits in the oropharynx remains inactive, the likelihood of developing oral candidiasis (a common side effect of other inhalational steroids due to local immunosuppression) is significantly lower with Ciclesonide.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option B.

It is a prodrug activated by bronchial esterase:</strong> This is also correct. Ciclesonide remains inactive until it reaches the lungs, where it is converted into its active form by bronchial esterases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option D. It has comparable efficacy to other inhalational corticosteroids:</strong> This is correct. Ciclesonide is just as effective as other inhalational corticosteroids in managing respiratory conditions such as asthma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Ciclesonide, a prodrug inhalational corticosteroid, has a lower risk of causing oral candidiasis compared to other inhalational steroids because it remains inactive until it reaches the lungs, where it is activated by bronchial esterases.</span></p>",
