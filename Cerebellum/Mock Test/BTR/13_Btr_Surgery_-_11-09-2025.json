A) Adjuvant radiotherapy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">After breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), adjuvant radiotherapy is typically recommended. Radiotherapy has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of local recurrence after BCS for DCIS.

Trastuzumab therapy</strong>: Trastuzumab is a targeted therapy used for HER2-positive invasive breast cancers.
