A fistula in ano is an abnormal connection between the interior of the anal canal and the perianal skin. It often presents as a recurrent swelling or abscess near the anal verge, which may drain spontaneously. The key clues include the location of the swelling near the anal verge and the history of recurrent discharge, making it characteristic of a fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Pilonidal Sinus:&nbsp;</strong>A pilonidal sinus is typically found in the upper part of the natal cleft, far from the anal verge, and is associated with hair follicles in the gluteal region. It commonly affects young men with a hairy back and is located above the coccyx, not near the anus. The key distinction is the location; pilonidal sinuses are not found at the anal verge but higher up in the gluteal cleft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"304\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Fissure in Ano:&nbsp;</strong>A fissure in ano is a linear tear in the lining of the anus, usually caused by trauma or hard stools. It presents with pain during defecation and bright red bleeding but not with a swelling or external opening as seen in fistula in ano. There may be a hypertrophic skin tag covering it (Sentinel pile). Fissures do not have a history of recurrent discharge or a swelling appearance near the anal verge.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120048.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"260\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemorrhoids:&nbsp;</strong>Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus and typically present with painless bleeding, itching, and swelling inside the anal canal or at the anal verge. They do not present with the external openings, recurrent abscesses, or discharging sinuses characteristic of fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120109.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"361\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fistula in Ano should be considered when there is a history of recurrent swelling, abscess formation, or discharge near the anal verge. It is distinguished from pilonidal sinus by its lower location near the anal canal, as opposed to pilonidal sinuses that occur higher up in the natal cleft.</span></p>",

This type of ulcer is typically neuropathic or trophic due to nerve damage caused by leprosy, leading to decreased sensation and subsequent injury. The first and most crucial step in managing such ulcers is debridement and proper dressing.

Common symptoms include pain, redness, and swelling in the area of the buttocks crease, and sometimes it can release pus.

It typically starts as a reddened and tender area, which becomes hard and then softens as it fills with pus. Boils can occur anywhere on the body, but they're more common on the face, neck, armpits, buttocks, and thighs.

A) Extranodal extension</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of cancer beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding tissues. This feature has recently been added as a significant factor in the staging and management of head and neck cancers, including oral malignancies. ENE is associated with a poorer prognosis due to its aggressive nature and higher likelihood of recurrence. Therefore, it is a major criterion for adjuvant radiotherapy following surgery and MRND (modified radical neck dissection), as radiotherapy can help reduce the risk of local recurrence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

STSG is the preferred choice for covering a large, healing wound with healthy granulation tissue, such as a burn or degloving injury. It involves taking a thin layer of skin from a donor site and applying it to the wound. This type of graft covers large areas and is effective in promoting wound healing with adequate tissue coverage while maintaining flexibility. It is generally used on body areas where cosmesis is less of a priority compared to the face, which would require a full thickness graft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. &nbsp;Full thickness skin graft:</strong> This graft involves both the epidermis and the entire dermis and is typically used for areas requiring greater cosmetic outcomes, such as the face. It is not generally used for large wounds with healthy granulation tissue, as STSG would suffice and cover larger areas with a better healing outcome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. &nbsp;VAC dressing:</strong> Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressing is used for non-healing or chronic wounds that require additional stimulation for granulation tissue formation and wound contraction. It is not needed when the wound already has healthy granulation tissue and is progressing well in healing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. &nbsp;Flap:</strong> A flap is used when there is a need for bulk tissue to cover a deep or complex wound that involves structures like bone, tendons, or joints.

Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance, often seen in conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and, in some cases, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Insulin resistance impairs the body’s ability to utilize glucose efficiently. When TPN, which is high in glucose, is administered, the already compromised insulin response leads to elevated blood glucose levels, resulting in hyperglycemia. This is a common complication in patients receiving TPN, especially those with underlying metabolic conditions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Reactive Hypoglycemia:&nbsp;</strong>Reactive hypoglycemia is a condition where blood glucose levels drop excessively after eating, due to an overproduction of insulin.

Hyperlipidemia:&nbsp;</strong>While hyperlipidemia is a component of metabolic syndrome, it is not a direct complication specifically associated with TPN.

Hyperuricemia:&nbsp;</strong>Hyperuricemia, characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, can be associated with metabolic syndrome but is not directly induced by TPN administration.

The provided images show a post-operative scenario where the penis has been surgically removed, and a perineal urethrostomy has been created with a catheter in place. Additionally, drains are visible in the upper groin area, which are indicative of bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection. This combination of procedures is typical in the management of penile cancer, where both the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes are addressed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. &nbsp;Orchidectomy:</strong> Orchidectomy, or surgical removal of one or both testicles, is not typically part of the treatment for penile cancer unless testicular involvement is specifically noted, which is not suggested by the images. The presence of inguinal dissection further confirms that this is not just an orchidectomy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Debridement:</strong> Debridement is a procedure involving the removal of necrotic or infected tissue to promote wound healing. The images do not show the characteristics of a debridement procedure, such as wound cleansing or preparation for further wound care. Instead, the structured surgical approach seen suggests a more extensive oncologic procedure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord, which supplies blood to the testicle, becomes twisted, cutting off the blood supply. This condition presents with acute scrotal pain and is a surgical emergency. The intra-operative image shows a discolored and non-viable testis, which is characteristic of testicular torsion. Exploration in such cases is mandatory to assess the viability of the testis and to perform detorsion or orchiectomy if necessary.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Torsion of testicular appendage:</strong> Torsion of the testicular appendage, a small vestigial remnant located at the superior pole of the testis, is a self-limiting condition and does not usually necessitate surgical exploration. The testis in such cases remains normal, and the main feature is localized pain without the full testicular involvement seen in the provided image.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Torsion of both:</strong> It is highly unlikely for both the testis and the appendage to undergo torsion simultaneously as they are separate anatomical structures. Thus, the option of torsion of both is not realistic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Testicular hematoma:</strong> A testicular hematoma would present as swelling due to bleeding within the testicular parenchyma or surrounding tissue, often following trauma. The appearance would not match the twisted and non-viable look of the testis shown in the image.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Testicular torsion presents as acute testicular pain and requires urgent surgical intervention.

In elderly patients with a history of trauma, a sub-acute subdural hematoma often presents with symptoms that develop gradually over weeks due to slow venous bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped (banana-shaped) hyperdense area, which is characteristic of a subdural hematoma.

Nissen fundoplication involves a complete 360-degree wrap of the gastric fundus around the lower esophagus to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter, which helps prevent gastroesophageal reflux. The image shows a complete wrap around the gastroesophageal junction, characteristic of the Nissen procedure. This procedure is commonly performed to treat severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or hiatal hernia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Toupet Fundoplication: </strong>Toupet fundoplication is a partial (270-degree) posterior wrap of the gastric fundus around the esophagus. This procedure is less constrictive than Nissen fundoplication and is often used in patients with esophageal motility disorders. The image does not depict the 270-degree posterior wrap seen in Toupet fundoplication.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Dor Fundoplication: </strong>Dor fundoplication is a partial (180-200 degree) anterior wrap of the gastric fundus around the esophagus. It is often used as a complementary procedure to surgeries such as Heller myotomy for achalasia. The wrap shown in the image is complete and not partial, ruling out Dor fundoplication.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Gastrectomy: </strong>Gastrectomy refers to the surgical removal of part or all of the stomach, often performed for conditions like gastric cancer or severe peptic ulcer disease. The image does not show any removal of stomach tissue, making this option incorrect.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Nissen Fundoplication is a surgical procedure involving a complete 360-degree wrap of the gastric fundus around the lower esophagus to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. It is distinct from other partial fundoplication techniques such as Toupet and Dor, which involve less than a full wrap.</span></p>",
