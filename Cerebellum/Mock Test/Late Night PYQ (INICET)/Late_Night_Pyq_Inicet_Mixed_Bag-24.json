In a patient of cirrhosis, there is splanchnic vasodilation, due to which there is decreased effective arterial blood volume. This stimulates the RAAS axis and as a result, the levels of Aldosterone are increased.

These receptors are located intracellularly, primarily within the nucleus, and function as transcription factors that regulate gene expression. When thyroid hormones (such as levothyroxine and liothyronine) enter the cell, they bind to these nuclear receptors. The hormone-receptor complex then binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of target genes, leading to modulation of gene transcription and subsequent protein synthesis. This process is crucial for the regulation of metabolism, growth, and development.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

These receptors span the cell membrane and, upon ligand binding, activate tyrosine kinase activity leading to a cascade of intracellular signaling events.

Lordosis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Lordosis refers to the inward (anterior) curvature of the spine. It's the normal anatomical curvature seen in the lumbar (lower back) and cervical (neck) regions. In the lumbar region, lordosis allows for an upright posture and helps to evenly distribute the body's weight and the forces exerted on the spine. While a certain degree of lumbar lordosis is normal and healthy, excessive lordosis (often called \"swayback\") can lead to pain and other issues.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Scoliosis:</strong> Scoliosis refers to a lateral (side-to-side) curvature of the spine. While any part of the spine can be affected, scoliosis most commonly develops in the thoracic (upper/mid back) and/or lumbar (lower back) regions. It's important to note that while scoliosis can affect the lumbar spine, it is not the normal anatomical curvature for that region. Instead, it's a pathological condition which can be idiopathic (most common, especially in adolescents), congenital, or secondary to other conditions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Kyphosis:</strong> Kyphosis describes a forward (anterior) rounding or curvature of the spine, producing a \"hunchback\" appearance. The normal anatomical region that displays kyphosis is the thoracic spine (upper/mid back). When present in the lumbar spine, it is considered pathological and is usually secondary to conditions like osteoporosis (which causes compression fractures), degenerative diseases, or other spine disorders.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Recurvatum:</strong> Recurvatum typically refers to a backward bending or hyperextension of a joint. While this term can be applied to various joints in the body, it's most commonly associated with the knee joint, where the knee bends backward excessively. It doesn't directly pertain to the natural anatomical curvatures of the spine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In adults,</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The cervical curve is a lordosis (convex forwards),</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The thoracic curve is a kyphosis (convex dorsally),</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The lumbar curve is also a lordosis,</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The pelvic curve is concave anteroinferiorly.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/05/03/ia-60.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"572\"></span></p>",

In this scenario, the primary causes are hypoventilation and situations involving low inspired oxygen tension (low FiO2).</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Hypoventilation:</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> This condition leads to hypoxemia due to inadequate ventilation. When ventilation is insufficient, the amount of oxygen entering the alveoli drops, leading to a corresponding decrease in the amount of oxygen diffusing into the blood, resulting in hypoxemia. However, because the underlying issue is with ventilation and not with oxygen diffusion or blood flow, the A-a gradient remains normal.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Low FiO2 or Low Barometric Pressure:</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> This can occur in scenarios such as high altitude where the barometric pressure is low, leading to reduced oxygen availability in the air.

B) A</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Among the shown options, Gibbs free energy change of an enzyme-catalysed reaction is shown by A.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Formation of a product requires the breaking of substrate bonds and conformational change <strong>forming a highly unstable transitional state intermediate, it requires energy and this is called Gibbs free energy of activation</strong>. In an enzyme-catalysed reaction, this energy barrier is reduced by forming a relatively stable intermediate-enzyme complex. <strong>The enzyme provides attachment sites for the substrate and speeds up the rate of reaction</strong>. <strong>It doesn't change the Gibbs energy of either the substrate or the product.</strong> Gibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalysed reaction (with no intermediate state) is shown in the image given below.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/07/06/whatsapp-image-2023-06-12-at-190121011091-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"421\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B:</strong> All the reactions have a transition state, but not all reactions have an intermediate state. There are 2 reasons as to why option B</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">﻿﻿﻿<strong>Transition state intermediate usually has higher energy compared to the substrate or product</strong>. Very unusually a dip might be seen like this when the enzyme-intermediate complex is more stable than the product, and the product is not formed.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">﻿﻿﻿<strong>Every intermediate state is again, always followed by another transition state</strong>. Therefore, every reaction, if it has an intermediate state, needs to have two transition states as shown in the image given below. We don't have 2 such transition states in curve B in the question, which makes it an incorrect answer.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/07/06/whatsapp-image-2023-06-12-at-190121011093.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"480\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C:</strong> Free energy change cannot be a straight line.
