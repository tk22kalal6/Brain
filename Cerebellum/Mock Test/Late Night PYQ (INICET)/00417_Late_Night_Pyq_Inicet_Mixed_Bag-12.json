Not extensively distributed to tissues</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Apparent Volume of distribution (Vd) = dose administered I.V/ plasma concentration It indicates how extensively the drug is distributed in the tissues. For example, Chloroquine has the highest volume of distribution, as it is mostly distributed to the liver and a very small amount is left for the action on RBC.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">E.g.: If a 1000 mg of drug A is given i.v (100% bioavailability) and the plasma concentration reached is 10 mg/ liter then the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is 1000/10= 10 liters.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">But the normal blood volume is about 5 liters. A high Vd is due to accumulation of drug A being distributed in extravascular tissues resulting in low plasma concentration.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Half-life or t1/2 relationship with volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (CI) is given by the formula t 1/2 = 0.693 × Vd /CI. t1/2 is directly proportional to Vd but it is also inversely proportional to clearance. If a drug has a low volume of distribution but clearance is very low, t1/2 can still be high. So low Vd doesn't always imply low t1/2.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Low t 1/2:&nbsp;</strong>The half-life (t1/2) of a drug is influenced by both its volume of distribution (Vd) and its clearance (Cl). It is given by the formula:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">t1/2=0.693×Vd/Cl</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A low Vd does not necessarily imply a low half-life, as the half-life is also dependent on the clearance of the drug. If the clearance is low, the half-life can still be long despite a low Vd.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Low bioavailability:&nbsp;</strong>Bioavailability refers to the fraction of an administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation in an unchanged form. It is primarily affected by the route of administration and first-pass metabolism, not by the volume of distribution.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Low efficacy:&nbsp;</strong>Efficacy refers to the ability of a drug to produce a desired therapeutic effect. It is determined by the drug’s mechanism of action and intrinsic activity at its target receptors, not by its volume of distribution.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A low apparent volume of distribution (Vd) indicates that the drug is not extensively distributed to tissues and remains largely confined to the blood plasma.

It selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels.

For full-thickness burns, sequential excision and grafting must be considered.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Initial treatment for burns includes cleaning the burnt areas and removing loose dead skin.
