This combination is effective against Burkholderia cepacia, a pathogen known for its resistance to many standard antibiotics. The standard regimen includes Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), which has broad-spectrum bacterial coverage, combined with a 3rd generation cephalosporin such as ceftazidime or cefoperazone-sulbactam to cover for the pathogen's unique resistance profiles and aggressive infection nature, especially in immunocompromised patients or those with existing cardiac issues.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Carbapenems and 3rd generation cephalosporin:</strong> Incorrect because the combination of carbapenems with cephalosporins is generally not recommended. They both share a similar mechanism of action, inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, and could potentially compete for the same binding sites, thus reducing their effectiveness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cefepime and tigecycline:</strong> Incorrect because tigecycline is not particularly effective against Burkholderia cepacia. Cefepime alone would not sufficiently manage the infection due to the bacteria's robust resistance profile.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The standard regimen for Burkholderia cepacia is cotrimoxazole with ceftazidime /cefoperazone-sulbactam.</span></p>",

If an <strong>Perichondral hematoma</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">is left untreated, it usually does not resolve spontaneously. Instead, it often requires intervention to prevent <strong>complications</strong> such as infection or the development of <strong>'Cauliflower</strong> <strong>ear'</strong>. The standard treatment involves <strong>aspiration</strong> of the <strong>hematoma</strong> or <strong>surgical</strong> intervention to prevent <strong>permanent</strong> <strong>deformity</strong> and to reestablish the connection between the <strong>cartilage</strong> and the overlying <strong>perichondrium</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. All cases should receive prophylactic antibiotic:&nbsp;</strong>While not all cases may strictly require prophylactic antibiotics, they are often <strong>administered</strong> in <strong>practice</strong> to <strong>prevent</strong> <strong>infection</strong>, especially because the <strong>ear</strong> <strong>cartilage</strong> is <strong>avascular</strong> and therefore more <strong>susceptible</strong> to <strong>infection</strong>. The effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics is debated, but it is a common practice, particularly when there's been a <strong>break</strong> in the <strong>skin</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. May lead to Pugilistic&nbsp;ear</strong>: This is true. A <strong>'Pugilistic</strong> <strong>ear'</strong> is another term for <strong>'Cauliflower</strong> <strong>ear'</strong>, which can occur if an auricular hematoma is not adequately treated, leading to <strong>fibrosis</strong> and <strong>cartilage</strong> <strong>deformity</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Caused by accumulation of blood in perichondrial space:&nbsp;</strong>This is correct.

A)</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Arachidonic acid</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Eicosanoids are derived from arachidonic acid, which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid found in cell membranes. Arachidonic acid serves as the precursor for eicosanoid synthesis when it is released from membrane phospholipids through the action of enzymes such as phospholipase A2. Once released, arachidonic acid can be metabolized into various eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Platelet aggregation: </strong>Platelet aggregation refers to the process of blood platelets clumping together. While eicosanoids can influence platelet aggregation by promoting or inhibiting it, they are not formed directly from platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation involves the activation of platelets and the release of various signaling molecules, including some eicosanoids, as part of the clotting process.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. 4 fused rings: </strong>Eicosanoids are not characterized by having four fused rings. Instead, they are typically small molecules with a 20-carbon backbone structure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Arginine: </strong>Arginine is an amino acid and is not directly involved in the formation of eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are primarily derived from arachidonic acid, as mentioned earlier.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Eicosanoids are bioactive lipid molecules that play a crucial role in various physiological processes in the body. They are formed from arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid has (20 C, 4=)&nbsp;and is synthesized from linoleic acid. Eicosanoids (Prostaglandins and leukotrienes) are synthesized from arachidonic acid. So, Linoleic acid is considered as most essential fatty acid.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: Harper’s 31<sup>st</sup> ed/pg- 224</strong></span></p>",

Osteopetrosis</strong>. This disease is commonly seen in children. It is a <strong>diaphyseal dysplasia </strong>characterized by failure of bone resorption due to <strong>functional deficiency of osteoclast</strong>. Due to functional deficiency of osteoclasts, calcified chondroid (cartilage) and primitive woven bone persists down into metaphysis and diaphysis, leading to osteosclerosis and increased brittleness of bones (marble bone disease). Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis is diagnosed in adult asymptomatic patients. It may present with mild anemia, pathological fractures premature osteoarthritis, and rarely osteomyelitis of mandible. Autosomal recessive malignant (congenital) osteopetrosis clinically presents at birth or in early infancy because of obliteration of marrow cavity by bony overgrowth resulting in inability of bone marrow to participate in hematopoiesis. Pancytopenia develops resulting in abnormal bleeding, easy bruising, progressive anemia, and failure to thrive. <strong>Laboratory parameters are serum calcium low, serum PTH high, serum phosphate low and serum ALP high. </strong>Radiological hallmark is increased radiopacity of bones. There is no distinction between cortical and cancellous bone, because intramedullary canal is filled with bone. Endobones (os in os or bone within bone appearance) and rugger jersey spine are seen on radiographs. Treatment is bone marrow transplant.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/24/screenshot-2024-01-23-195319.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"316\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Paget’s disease</strong>. It is characterized by <strong>excessive disorganized bone turnover, </strong>that encompasses excessive osteoclastic activity initially followed by disorganized excessive new bone formation. <strong>Osteoclast appears larger and irregular </strong>whereas <strong>osteoblast are relatively normal. </strong>The new bone formed is abnormal, very vascular and larger (deforms and fractures) than preexisting bone, which leads to cortical widening and deformity. The diagnostic histological feature of Paget's disease is irregular area of lamellar bone fitting together like a jigsaw with randomly distributed cement lines. Initial osteolytic phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascularization (Radiologically seen as advancing lytic wedge or <strong>blade of grass lesion). </strong>2nd phase of active bone formation and resorption replaces normal lamellar bone with structurally weak woven bone that bend, bow and fracture easily. In 3rd sclerotic (burnt out) phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to hard, dense, less vascular pagetic or <strong>mosaic bone</strong>. <strong>Most people are asymptomatic. </strong>The sites most commonly involved are <strong>pelvis</strong>, tibia, followed by skull, spine, clavicle and femur. It <strong>affects men (&gt; 50 years) more commonly.</strong> <strong>Pain is most common presenting symptom. </strong>Limb looks bent and feels thick, and skin is unduly warm due to high vascularity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/24/screenshot-2024-01-23-195330.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"316\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Blade of grass</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Hip fractures are most commonly seen in elderly females due to osteoporosis.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>",

Recurrence rate is maximum if the patient's age is less than 20 years: </strong>The recurrence rate for anterior shoulder dislocation is indeed highest among younger patients, particularly those under the age of 20. Statistics show that the recurrence rate is 55% for those aged 12 to 22, 37% for ages 23 to 29, and only 12% for ages 30 to 40. The higher recurrence in younger patients is attributed to increased joint laxity and higher activity levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Axillary nerve is most commonly injured: </strong>Axillary nerve injury is the most frequent complication following an anterior shoulder dislocation. The nerve, which innervates the deltoid muscle and provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the upper arm, is highly vulnerable because of its anatomical location. Injury can result in deltoid muscle paralysis and loss of sensation over a small area on the shoulder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. CT scan is preferred for knowing the bony lesion: </strong>A three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan is the preferred imaging technique for detecting osseous (bony) lesions and quantifying the extent of bone loss. It is more accurate than X-rays for assessing fractures and bone integrity and is considered the gold standard for evaluating bone-related pathologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common type: </strong>Anterior shoulder dislocation is far more common than posterior dislocation. It often occurs due to trauma that forces the shoulder into abduction and external rotation. The anterior glenoid rim can become rounded or worn down over time if the dislocation is recurrent. Anterior dislocations account for the majority of shoulder dislocation cases in adults.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common type, has the highest recurrence rate in patients under 20 years, commonly results in axillary nerve injury, and requires a CT scan for accurate evaluation of bony lesions.</p>",

Perinatal asphyxia occurs when the fetus or newborn suffers from oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) or inadequate perfusion (ischemia) to the organs. This condition often leads to tissue lactic acidosis and hypercarbia. Hypotonia in a newborn is a clinical indicator of neurological compromise, which is commonly associated with perinatal asphyxia.
