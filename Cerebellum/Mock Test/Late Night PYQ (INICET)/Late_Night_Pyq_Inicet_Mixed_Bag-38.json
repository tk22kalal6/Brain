Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood:</strong> Traditionally, to prevent blood from clotting inside the syringe when obtaining an ABG, a small amount of heparin was added to the syringe. However, in contemporary practice, syringes used for ABG are pre-heparinized, which means they already contain a coating of dry heparin that will mix with the blood sample and prevent clotting. Adding additional heparin to such a syringe is unnecessary and can dilute the sample, potentially altering the results.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder:</strong> This statement is accurate. A patient can have a mixed acid-base disorder where two primary disorders (e.g., metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis) coexist and \"cancel\" each other out, leading to a seemingly \"normal\" pH. However, when the components of the arterial blood gas (ABG) like PaCO2 and HCO3- are evaluated, abnormalities can be detected.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. If modified Allen’s test is negative, alternate site is chosen:</strong> The modified Allen's test is a simple way to evaluate the collateral blood flow to the hand via the ulnar artery. Before taking a sample or placing an arterial line in the radial artery, it's a recommended step to ensure that if the radial artery becomes occluded, the hand will still receive adequate blood flow. If the test is negative (indicative of inadequate collateral flow), it's safer to choose an alternate site for arterial puncture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Radial artery is the preferred site:</strong> The radial artery is commonly chosen for ABG sampling and arterial line placement due to its accessibility, the presence of collateral blood flow (via the ulnar artery), and its relatively superficial location which makes puncture technically easier. Furthermore, complications like hematoma or injury are less problematic at this location when compared to other potential sites, such as the femoral artery.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective :</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Adding extra heparin to pre-heparinized ABG syringes is unnecessary and can alter the blood sample.</span></p>",

This is applicable <strong>only if a person loses the capacity to make mental healthcare or treatment decisions</strong>. Individuals can also appoint “Nominated Representative (NR)”, who will help in taking decisions regarding the treatment if he or she loses the capacity to make decision.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: Forensic Psychiatry in India, Interface of Indian Laws and Mental Health, Page No 42.</strong></span></p>",

D) 1, 2, and 4</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Ventricular muscle fibers exhibit several unique properties that are crucial for their function:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>1. All or None Law</strong>: This principle states that a single muscle fiber will either contract fully or not at all in response to a stimulus. Ventricular muscle fibers act as a syncytium due to the presence of gap junctions made up of connexin proteins, which allows them to follow the all-or-none law. Thus, this property is true for ventricular muscle fibers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. Length-Tension Relation</strong>: The length-tension relationship in ventricular muscle fibers is a reflection of the Frank-Starling law, which states that the force of contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to its initial length (or end-diastolic volume, EDV). This relationship is crucial for adjusting cardiac output based on the volume of blood returning to the heart. Within physiological limits, an increase in the initial length of the muscle fiber increases the force of contraction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>4. Long Refractory Period</strong>: Ventricular muscle fibers have a long refractory period due to the extended plateau phase in their action potential. This long refractory period is crucial in preventing tetanus and ensuring that the heart muscle relaxes fully before the next contraction, maintaining efficient pumping action.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Option:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>3. Tetanus</strong>: Tetanus is a sustained muscle contraction that occurs when the muscle is stimulated at a high frequency. However, due to the long refractory period in ventricular muscle fibers, tetanus is not possible. The plateau phase (phase 2) of the cardiac action potential is prolonged, which ensures that the heart muscle cannot be re-stimulated before the previous contraction is complete. This prevents sustained contractions (tetanus), which would be detrimental to cardiac function.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Ventricular muscle fibers follow the all-or-none law, have a length-tension relationship (Frank-Starling law), and possess a long refractory period that prevents tetanus.</span></p>",

By observing the patient's spontaneous breathing, clinicians can gauge whether the patient is in distress or if they're maintaining their airway and oxygenating adequately. Self-extubation doesn't automatically necessitate re-intubation. If the patient is breathing well and does not desaturate, self-extubated patients may not require re-intubation.

Exercise ECG testing:&nbsp;</strong>Exercise ECG testing, also known as exercise stress testing or treadmill testing, involves the patient exercising on a treadmill or stationary bicycle while their heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) are monitored. The purpose is to determine how the heart responds to the stress of exercise. Abnormal changes in the ECG during or after exercise may suggest coronary artery disease (CAD). While this test can indicate the presence of CAD, it does not specifically predict perioperative cardiac complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy:&nbsp;</strong>Also known as a nuclear stress test, this investigation involves injecting a small amount of radioactive substance into the patient and using a special camera to visualize how blood flows through the heart muscle, both at rest and during stress (either exercise or with a medication). This test can identify areas of the heart that aren't getting enough blood, indicative of CAD. While it can detect and evaluate the severity of CAD, it's less specific than dobutamine stress echocardiography in predicting perioperative cardiac complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Coronary angiography:&nbsp;</strong>This is a procedure in which a contrast dye is injected into the coronary arteries, and X-rays are taken to visualize the flow of blood through these arteries. It is used to directly visualize blockages in the coronary arteries. As the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing CAD, coronary angiography can provide detailed information about the location and severity of blockages. However, it's an invasive procedure, involving threading a catheter through the blood vessels to the heart, and carries risks such as bleeding, allergic reactions, or kidney damage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Dobutamine stress echocardiography is the most accurate non-invasive investigation for predicting perioperative cardiac complications due to its ability to simulate exercise and identify areas of the heart with reduced blood flow.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia, 9<sup>th</sup> Ed.
