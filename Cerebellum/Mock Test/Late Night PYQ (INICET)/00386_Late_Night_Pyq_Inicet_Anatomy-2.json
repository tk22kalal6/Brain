Bridging veins</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image demonstrating a bleed over the arachnoid layer but beneath the dura suggests a subdural hemorrhage. It is most commonly caused by the shearing of cortical bridging veins.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A subdural hemorrhage is a type of intracranial hemorrhage, which is bleeding within the skull. It occurs when blood accumulates between the dura mater (the tough outermost layer of the meninges) and the arachnoid mater (the middle layer of the meninges) surrounding the brain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Subdural hemorrhages are usually caused by trauma to the head, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents, which can tear the veins that bridge the dura and arachnoid layers. The bleeding can create pressure on the brain, leading to neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, dizziness, seizures, and in severe cases, coma or death.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The symptoms of a subdural hemorrhage can develop immediately or may take hours or even days to appear, depending on the severity of the bleeding. In some cases, a small subdural hemorrhage may resolve on its own without treatment, while larger or more severe bleeds may require surgery to relieve pressure on the brain and stop the bleeding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Factors that can increase the risk of a subdural hemorrhage include advanced age, alcohol or drug abuse, blood-thinning medications, and medical conditions that affect blood clotting or increase the risk of falls.

Moreover, the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis (provided by the radial nerve and median nerve, respectively) continue to function.

It includes key components such as the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate gyrus. These structures support a variety of functions related to emotions, behavior, motivation, long-term memory, and olfaction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Amygdala:</strong> Integral for processing emotions, the amygdala is especially involved in fear, anxiety, and social cognition. It also plays a significant role in forming and retrieving emotional memories.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> Essential for learning and memory, the hippocampus is pivotal in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory and spatial navigation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Thalamus:</strong> Although primarily known as the relay station for sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex, the thalamus also supports functions of the limbic system by regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other structures are :</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hypothalamus is involved in regulating many bodily functions, including hunger, thirst, body temperature, and circadian rhythms. It also plays a key role in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The cingulate gyrus is involved in a variety of functions, including emotion regulation, attention, and the processing of pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Together, these structures form a complex network that plays a crucial role in many aspects of human behavior and cognition. Dysfunction or damage to the limbic system can lead to a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/05/09/anatomy-may-inicet-2022-19-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"301\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The limbic system’s role is critical, as its structures are deeply integrated into the processes governing emotions, memory, and essential physiological functions. Damage or dysfunction in any part of the limbic system can lead to profound psychological and cognitive impairments, affecting everything from emotional regulation to memory processing.</span></p>",

The gluteus medius muscle is critical for stabilizing the pelvis during gait. When functioning normally, it prevents the pelvis from dropping to the opposite side during the swing phase of the walk. If injured or dysfunctional, such as might occur from a traumatic fall, the ability to maintain pelvic stability is compromised, leading to a lurching gait, known clinically as a Trendelenburg gait.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/05/03/ia-84_kpcG9e3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"514\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>The structure shown in the image are :</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">1-Gluteus maximus</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">2-Gluteus medius</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">3-Piriformis</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">4-Sciatic nerve</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>1.

Its involvement is more related to power movements like climbing or jumping rather than gait stability.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>3. Piriformis</strong>: A small muscle located deep in the buttock, behind the gluteus maximus. It helps with lateral rotation of the hip. Although it is near the sciatic nerve, it is less likely involved in producing a lurching gait unless it compresses the sciatic nerve, causing sciatica.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>4. Sciatic Nerve</strong>: The largest nerve in the body, running from the lower back to the feet. While injury to this nerve can cause pain and weakness in the legs, it typically would not cause a lurching gait unless there is significant associated muscle weakness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Clinical Insight:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Injury to the gluteus medius or the superior gluteal nerve can lead to an inability to properly abduct the hip on the stance side, resulting in a drop of the pelvis on the contralateral side when the affected leg is weight-bearing. This is often demonstrated by a positive Trendelenburg sign and manifests as a compensatory lurch toward the affected side to maintain balance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Additional Information</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Gluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip joint. Mechanism of actions of gluteus medius and minimus-</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action results in a slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in the upright position.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, neck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur. This occurs in conditions like paralysis of the glutei, developmental dysplasia of the hip, etc.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. This leads to a positive Trendelenburg's sign with a characteristic lurching gait - the patient lurches towards the affected side with contralateral pelvis drop.</span></li></ul>",

This condition can lead to significant swelling in the throat and difficulty swallowing. Post-operative bleeding in such cases, especially the continuous type noted as soaking through gauze, is most commonly associated with venous sources rather than arterial.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The given image is a cadaveric specimen with an arrow pointing to the tonsillar fossa. The paratonsillar / external palatine vein is the typical site of venous origin for post-tonsillectomy bleeding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The paratonsillar vein, which is closely associated with the tonsillar bed and provides significant venous drainage for the tonsil, is the likely source of this bleeding. Venous bleeding tends to be continuous and can be persistent if the vein is not adequately secured during surgery.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Torrential hemorrhage can be due to injury to an aberrantly large or aberrantly placed tonsillar arterial branch of the facial artery.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong> <strong>Tonsillar branch of the facial artery</strong>: The tonsils receive blood supply primarily from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery.

Thalamus</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The given clinical stem of a hemi-sensory loss and severe excruciating pain of the affected areas is suggestive of thalamic pain syndrome also known as Dejerine Roussy syndrome. Hence, thalamus marked as B is most likely to be involved.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The thalamus is a paired structure, with one thalamus on each side of the brain. It relays sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex and regulates consciousness, sleep, and alertness. The thalamus has multiple nuclei, each serving different functions. The ventral posterior nucleus, for instance, is vital for relaying somatosensory information. If the thalamus is damaged, it can lead to loss of sensation, and in certain cases, even cause the burning, shooting pain and abnormal temperature sensations described in the scenario, which aligns with the symptoms of thalamic syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/11/09/picture2_rw0NybC.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"304\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>The structures marked in the image are:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.&nbsp; </strong>A- Internal capsule</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B</strong>.

Internal capsule</strong>: The internal capsule is a bundle of white matter fibers that separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the lenticular nucleus (putamen and globus pallidus). The anterior limb separates the head of the caudate from the lenticular nucleus, while the posterior limb separates the thalamus from the lenticular nucleus. It contains ascending and descending axonal fibers running between the cerebral cortex and the brainstem/spinal cord. Damage to the internal capsule, especially its posterior limb, can cause contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia (motor deficits). However, the woman's motor functions are described as normal, making this a less likely option given the scenario.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Subthalamic nucleus</strong>: The subthalamic nucleus is part of the basal ganglia circuit and is specifically associated with motor function. Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus, particularly on one side, might result in hemiballismus, which is characterized by violent, flinging movements of the contralateral limbs. It is not typically associated with sensory disturbances, or the pain described in the scenario.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Substantia nigra</strong>: The substantia nigra is in the midbrain and plays a critical role in reward, addiction, and movement. It contains dopamine-producing neurons. The degeneration of these neurons is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Lesions in the substantia nigra would primarily produce motor symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremors. It would not typically lead to the sensory disturbances described in the scenario.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>The thalamic pain syndrome</strong> is caused by the occlusion of these thalamic and thalamogeniculate branches. C/L hemisensory loss, which begins as numbness and escalates to cause intense burning pain in the affected areas, is what distinguishes it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A thalamic lesion results in a breakdown in communication between the brain's afferent route and cortex because the thalamus serves as the site for the relay of sensory information between the periphery and cortex. The healing process following a thalamic infarct is painful.</span></p>",

This leads to weakness or paralysis of the small hand muscles, specifically those innervated by the ulnar nerve. Patients have hyperextension at the MCP joints and flexion at the IP joints of the 4th and 5th fingers, giving the appearance of a \"claw hand\". The \"clawing\" is most evident when the patient tries to extend the fingers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Policeman tip hand (also known as \"Bishop's hand\")</strong> : This deformity is characterized by hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and flexion of the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the 4th and 5th fingers.

While Horner's syndrome can be associated with a Klumpke's injury, it is not the most characteristic clinical finding for Klumpke's paralysis.

The main branch of Middle meningeal artery lies under this structure NOT accessory middle meningeal artery.

Correct</strong>: A blow to the pterion can be very dangerous because the middle meningeal artery runs just deep to this area, on the inner side of the skull. If this artery is ruptured due to a fracture at the pterion, it can lead to an epidural hematoma, which is a type of traumatic brain injury.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>It corresponds to the site of the anterolateral fontanelle of the fetal skull.

This fontanelle usually closes a few months after birth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pterion is the junction point of four bones in the skull: the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones. The term \"pterion\" comes from the Greek word \"pteron,\" meaning \"wing,\" because the pterion is located at the point where the sphenoid bone and the temporal bone form a wing-like shape. The pterion is located just above the zygomatic arch and anterior to the ear. The middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, runs underneath the pterion and is at risk of injury in cases of head trauma.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/05/09/ia-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"568\"></span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p>",

Ventricular tapping is the term used to describe the process of removing CSF from the anterior fontanelle. The various structures pierced are the scalp, dura, and arachnoid.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Fontanelle tap/ Percutaneous ventricular puncture:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infants who need urgent ventricular decompression and have an open anterior fontanelle and no access to a VP shunt undergo a fontanelle tap or percutaneous ventricular puncture. A butterfly needle is used to immediately puncture the infant's open fontanelle and enter the lateral ventricle in order to obtain CS samples, alleviate pressure, or insert a drain or catheter.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Procedure: A 25-gauge butterfly needle is inserted through the anterolateral aspect of the anterior fontanelle (away from the midline, avoiding the superior sagittal sinus).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When performing a fontanelle tap, the following layers are pierced:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Scalp</strong>: This includes the skin and the underlying connective tissue of the scalp.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Membranous fontanelle</strong>: The actual fontanelle is a soft spot on a baby's head where the bones of the skull have not yet fused together. It's a membranous gap between the cranial bones.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Dura mater</strong>: The tough outermost membrane of the three layers of the meninges that surround the brain and spinal cord.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Arachnoid mater</strong>: A thin, wispy layer that lies underneath the dura mater.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</strong>: Once through the arachanoid mater, the needle enters the subarachnoid space where the CSF is located.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Note: The fontanelle tap bypasses the bony skull, which is why it's an accessible route in neonates and infants for procedures that require access to the CSF. However, as the child grows, these fontanelles close, and the method is no longer viable.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fontanelle tap is a critical emergency procedure used in infants for CSF sampling or pressure relief from the ventricles, exploiting the unossified sections of the skull for direct access to the CSF. This procedure is unique to neonates and young infants where the fontanelle is present and typically involves piercing the scalp, dura, and arachnoid layers.</span></p>",

An arterial puncture is the most common complication of a central line insertion below this bone.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Complications of central vein catheterization are -&nbsp;</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Arterial puncture- this is the most common complication.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cardiac tamponade is the most important life-threatening complication. It occurs as a result of puncture of intrapericardial superior vena cava, right atrium, or right ventricle.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pneumothorax- injury to the underlying pleura may lead to pneumothorax. This is more common in subclavian vein catheterization.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chylothorax can occur particularly in left subclavian vein catheterization.

While thrombophlebitis can occur following any central line placement, it's more commonly associated with peripheral IV lines. However, central venous catheters are more commonly associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is the formation of a blood clot inside the larger, deeper veins.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.</strong> <strong>Empyema</strong>: Empyema refers to the accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity. While empyema itself is not a direct complication of central line placement, pneumothorax or hemothorax (air or blood in the pleural space, respectively) caused by central line placement can lead to infection and subsequently empyema if not recognized and treated.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D</strong>. <strong>Chylothorax</strong>: Chylothorax is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural space. This can happen if the thoracic duct is damaged. The thoracic duct is a major lymphatic vessel that runs in the thorax but is not typically at risk with subclavian line placement. Chylothorax would be more of a concern with procedures that are done in close proximity to the thoracic duct, like surgeries or interventions in the mediastinum or around the esophagus.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Arterial puncture</strong> is one of the most common complications associated with the subclavian approach for central venous catheter placement. The subclavian artery lies directly beneath the vein, so inadvertent puncture of the artery can occur if the needle is advanced too deeply or at an incorrect angle. Accidental puncture of the subclavian artery can lead to complications such as hematoma, hemothorax, and can also be problematic if not recognized because threading a catheter into the arterial system can have catastrophic consequences.</span></p>",

It connects to the pelvic wall on both sides, between the greater and lesser sciatic foramen. The pelvic diaphragm is formed by the levator ani and coccyges muscles, which define the lower limit of the true pelvis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/06/28/whatsapp-image-2023-06-12-at-1901258.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"322\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, and puborectalis combine to form Levator ani. The muscles in both sexes blend together posterior to the vagina and around the anus. The form in which the anococcygeal body attaches to the coccyx posterior to the anal aperture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Urogenital hiatus is present anteriorly separating the muscles. This allows the urethra and vagina to pass through. Levator ani reinforces the external anal sphincter. In women, it functions as the vaginal sphincter.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The coccyges muscles are triangular in shape and form the posterior part of the pelvic diaphragm, one on each side. The apices are attached to the ischial spine tips. The bases connect to the coccyx and sacrum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/05/18/ai-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"287\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.</strong> <strong>Sphincter Ani Externus (External Anal Sphincter)</strong>: This is a circular muscle that surrounds the anus.

It is innervated by the pudendal nerve, allowing for voluntary control over defecation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.</strong> <strong>Obturator Muscle</strong>: This term often refers to two muscles - obturator externus and obturator internus. They are situated on either side of the obturator membrane in the pelvis. <strong>Obturator Externus</strong>: Obturator nerve and <strong>Obturator Internus</strong>: Nerve to obturator internus (a branch of the sacral plexus).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.</strong> <strong>Perianal Fascia</strong>: The perianal fascia is not a muscle but is the connective tissue located in the perianal region, around the anus.
