These one-celled conidia are tear shaped to clavate and do not yield chains. The S. schenckii colonies never become cottony or floccose.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infection with the dimorphic soil fungus S schenckii is usually transmitted by the mold form from organic matter through cutaneous inoculation. The mycosis has also been transmitted from animals through bites or scratches.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The initial reddish, necrotic, nodular papule of cutaneous sporotrichosis generally appears 1-10 weeks after a penetrating skin injury. The lesion is a suppurating granuloma that consists of histiocytes and giant cells, with neutrophils that accumulate in the center and that are surrounded by lymphocytes and plasma cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The fungal infection spreads from the initial lesion along lymphatic channels, forming the chain of indolent nodular and ulcerating lesions typical of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Other tissues are involved by direct extension and, less often, by hematogenous dissemination. The most common extracutaneous infection sites are in the bones, joints, tendon sheaths, and bursae. Hematogenous dissemination—particularly in immunocompromised hosts—results in widely disseminated cutaneous and visceral infection, including meningitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

It is usually a benign, self-limited condition with no systemic symptoms except for mild neck pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Eumyectoma or mycetoma&nbsp;</strong>also called as Madura foot, is a chronic subcutaneous granulomatous soft-tissue infection. The etiological agent may be fungal (eumycetoma) or bacterial (actinomycetoma) and appears under microscopic examination as hyphae or thin filaments, respectively. The cardinal features of the disease are tumefaction, sinus formation, and presentation of grains or granules in draining exudate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Phialophora verrucosa</strong> is a common cause of chromoblastomycosis. A primary lesion is represented by an erythematous papule or a warty growth, which gradually enlarges from the site of infection assuming various forms and sizes. The infection may occur anywhere on the body, however most frequently it affects limbs, especially feet and shins. The fungus is seen as round or irregular, dark brown, yeast-like bodies with septae, (known as sclerotic bodies) on histology.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/03/31/1_grpav2l.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"380\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Sporothrix schenckii, the cause of sporotrichosis, typically presents as a chain of nodular and ulcerating lesions along lymphatic channels following traumatic inoculation, earning it the name \"Rose Gardener's Disease.\"</span></p>",

It is the method of choice in cardiac arrest patients</strong>.</span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Incorrect statement. Rapid sequence intubation typically involves administering an induction agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation without the risk of aspiration. However, in cardiac arrest patients, the priority is to secure the airway quickly without delay. Often, these patients do not require medications for intubation as they are unresponsive and without protective reflexes. Also, chest compressions and defibrillation (if indicated) are of higher priority.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 minutes is done:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Correct statement. Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen before RSI helps to denitrogenate the lungs, ensuring that the patient has an adequate oxygen reserve during the apneic period (the time between paralysis and successful intubation). The goal is to delay the onset of hypoxemia during the apnea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. High-volume low-pressure cuff Endotracheal tube is used:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Correct statement. A high-volume low-pressure cuff on the endotracheal tube distributes the pressure over a larger area of the tracheal mucosa. This minimizes the risk of tracheal injury or necrosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Induction agent and muscle relaxant are given simultaneously:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Correct statement. In RSI, immediately after administering the induction agent (to render the patient unconscious), a neuromuscular blocking agent (muscle relaxant) is given to paralyze the patient, thus facilitating endotracheal intubation. This rapid administration of drugs is to minimize the time between loss of protective reflexes and securing the airway, hence reducing the risk of aspiration.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective :</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Rapid sequence intubation is not the method of choice in cardiac arrest patients due to the need for immediate airway management and ongoing chest compressions, making drug administration less critical.</span></p>",

B) Nodular episcleritis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Upon the application of phenylephrine, the superficial episcleral vessels lose their color, a phenomenon known as blanching. As a result, the likely conclusion is nodular episcleritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">2.5% phenylephrine proves valuable in distinguishing between episcleritis and scleritis. This distinction arises from the fact that the vessels within the episclera lie close to the surface, making them susceptible to blanching. In contrast, in cases of scleritis, these vessels do not undergo such a color change.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The ability of phenylephrine to cause blanching of the inflamed episcleral vessels is a useful diagnostic tool, helping to differentiate episcleritis from more serious conditions like scleritis, where the inflammation involves deeper tissues and the vessels do not blanch.</span></p>",

The irregular rhythm (possibly atrial fibrillation) increases the risk of embolization, leading to acute mesenteric ischemia, typically involving SMA leading to massive intestinal gangrene if not treated promptly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Acute severe pancreatitis</strong>: While this can cause severe abdominal pain, it typically presents with pain radiating to the back and is often associated with a history of alcohol intake or gallstone disease. The absence of bowel sounds might be seen, but other signs like fever, lack of increased amylase or lipase levels, and the nature of pain differentiate it from AMI.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B</strong>. <strong>Ruptured aortic aneurysm</strong>: This is a life-threatening condition that presents with sudden, severe pain. While it can cause hypotension, the nature of pain and other clinical findings (e.g., palpable pulsatile abdominal mass) can differentiate it from AMI.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Peptic ulcer perforation</strong>: A perforated peptic ulcer can lead to sudden, severe abdominal pain. However, this typically presents with a board-like rigid abdomen due to the spillage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, leading to acute peritonitis. This is different from the \"soft\" abdomen described in the scenario.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The given clinical scenario suggests acute mesenteric ischemia as a possible diagnosis. The most common cause of acute mesenteric ischemia is an embolus. The risk factors for acute mesenteric ischemia/embolus in the given clinical scenario are the presence of an irregularly irregular pulse suggestive of atrial fibrillation and a previous history of ischemic heart disease/myocardial infarction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain in a patient with atrial fibrillation or atherosclerosis is the most important clue to an early diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia. The pain is typically in the central abdomen and out of proportion to the physical findings. Associated features may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, peritonitis, and passage of bloody stools.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia, and management involves laparotomy. The goal of operative exploration is to reset the compromised bowel and restore blood supply via embolectomy.</span></p>",

If only the medial rectus were paretic, you would primarily observe limitation in horizontal inward movement of the affected eye without the associated ptosis, \"down and out\" positioning, or pupil involvement seen in the provided images. These broader symptoms indicate involvement of multiple muscles, which is characteristic of oculomotor nerve palsy, not isolated medial rectus palsy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Trochlear nerve palsy: Incorrect because.</strong> Trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) palsy affects the superior oblique muscle, which primarily results in problems with eye rotation and vertical gaze, especially when looking downward and inward. Patients often present with vertical diplopia (double vision), head tilt away from the side of the lesion to compensate for the misalignment, and no ptosis or pupillary involvement. The symptoms and the eye movement limitations shown in the images do not match those typically associated with trochlear nerve palsy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Abducens nerve palsy: Incorrect because.</strong> Abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) palsy results in failure of the lateral rectus muscle, leading to an inability to abduct the eye (move outward). Patients with this condition will have the affected eye positioned inward (medially) due to unopposed action of the medial rectus. This condition would not cause the ptosis or the \"down and out\" appearance nor the wide range of motion impairments displayed in the images, such as the inability to move the eye upward or downward.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Oculomotor nerve palsy significantly affects eye movement and eyelid function due to its role in innervating most of the extraocular muscles as well as lifting the eyelid. Diagnosis often involves a comprehensive evaluation of eye movement patterns, eyelid function, and pupil response, along with investigations to determine underlying causes.

Left superior gluteal nerve palsy</strong>. When the patient is standing on one leg, the opposite pelvis should be lifted upwards by abduction of the ipsilateral hip joint, in a normal patient. When the abductors are weak due to superior gluteal nerve paresis, the pelvis will sag, called positive Trendelenburg sign. In a patient with a positive&nbsp;Trendelenburg&nbsp;sign, the pelvis sags toward the normal unsupported side, which is the swing leg. When the left superior gluteal nerve is affected, on standing on the left lower limb, the right side pelvis will drop and when the patient stands on the right leg, the left side pelvis will be lifted up.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Right inferior gluteal nerve palsy</strong>. The inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus muscle. It is therefore, responsible for extending the trunk from a forward bending position and extending the hip from sitting-to-standing or during stair-climbing or rising from a squatted position. The nerve does not confer any sensation. Injury to this nerve is most commonly iatrogenic in origin and is the most at risk nerve during total hip arthroplasty via a posterior approach.&nbsp;Injury typically leads to an altered gait pattern known as <strong>gluteus maximus ‘lurch’. </strong>The sequelae of nerve injury are denervation of the ipsilateral gluteus maximus muscle. The lurching gait results from the weakening or absence of an ipsilateral hip extension. Clinically, patients may also report wasting of the ipsilateral gluteus maximus muscle and loss of the defined shape to the affected buttock.&nbsp;In a normal gait cycle, the gluteus maximus begin to contract at the moment of the ipsilateral heel-strike to initiate ipsilateral hip extension. In inferior gluteal nerve injury, the trunk will extend when the heel strikes on the ground on the affected side to compensate for weak/absent hip extension. This backward trunk lurch is present in the whole stance phase of the gait cycle and locks the hip in extension. In some cases, the hamstrings muscle compensates to an extent. Therefore, in the right inferior gluteal nerve palsy, the right side hip will not extend during the initial heel strike and the trunk will lean backwards/extend.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Left inferior gluteal nerve palsy</strong>. In the injury of left sided gluteal nerve, the left hip will not extend during the initial heel strike, leading to backward lurch or extension of the trunk.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">On standing on the right lower limb, the left side pelvis drops and while standing on the left leg, the right side pelvis lifted up. This is indicative of right superior gluteal nerve palsy. This sign is called Trendelenburg Sign.</span></li></ul>",

D) Tidal volume – 12 ml/kg of actual BW&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Incorrect Setting:</strong> The generally recommended starting tidal volume for many patients, especially those at risk for or with established acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is closer to 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight. Using 12 ml/kg of actual body weight can potentially lead to lung injury, especially in patients with pre-existing lung pathology or those who are at risk, such as trauma patients.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Respiratory rate - 12 Breaths/min:&nbsp;</strong>This is a typical starting point for the respiratory rate (RR) in many mechanically ventilated adults. The RR can be adjusted based on the patient's metabolic needs, acid-base balance, and CO2 levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. PEEP - 5 cm H2O:&nbsp;</strong>Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) helps keep alveoli open at the end of expiration, improving oxygenation and potentially preventing alveolar collapse. A starting PEEP of 5 cm H2O is a common initial setting in many ventilated patients, and it can be titrated based on oxygenation needs and potential hemodynamic effects.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. FiO2 - 100%:&nbsp;</strong>Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) refers to the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture. Starting with a high FiO2, like 100%, ensures that the patient is receiving the maximum amount of oxygen. However, it's important to titrate this down as quickly as clinically feasible to avoid potential oxygen toxicity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">In a patient started on mechanical ventilation, ideal ventilatory settings include a tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg of ideal body weight, a respiratory rate of 12-18 breaths/min, an initial FiO2 of 100% titrated down to maintain SpO2 &gt; 95%, and a starting PEEP of 5 cm H2O. Using a tidal volume of 12 ml/kg of actual body weight is incorrect and can lead to lung injury.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia, 9th Ed.

Three types are a tendinous avulsion (X-ray is normal), a small flake of bone or a large dorsal bone fragment, (some times with subluxation of Joints). </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/24/picture10.jpg\" style=\"height:121px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The image shown in the question is of Swan Neck Deformity, which is seen in the cases of rheumatoid arthritis. </span></span></span></p>",
