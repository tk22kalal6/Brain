The most common cause is alcohol misuse, but other conditions that affect nutrition can also lead to Korsakoff syndrome.

It is primarily associated with chronic alcohol misuse. It is characterized by anterograde amnesia (difficulty forming new memories) and often retrograde amnesia (loss of past memories). Confabulation is common, where patients fill memory gaps with fabricated information. Treatment involves thiamine replacement and abstaining from alcohol. It often follows or coexists with Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is an acute syndrome requiring immediate thiamine treatment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: A Short Textbook of Psychiatry, 7th edition, Page No 38-40.</strong></span></p>",

It is used to relieve craving for tobacco by substituting nicotine in tobacco with nicotine in safer forms. Various preparations include nicotine gums, nicotine lozenges, nicotine patch, nicotine spray and nicotine inhaler. Nicotine gum's absorption can be affected by acidic beverages, so it's advised to avoid them shortly before or while using the gum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:#343541;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: </strong></span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 11th edition, Page No 684.</strong></span></p>",

It is often associated with alcohol misuse, but can also be caused by other conditions. The primary features of Korsakoff syndrome include:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>1. Confabulation:&nbsp;</strong>Patients often create <strong>false memories</strong> or stories to fill in gaps in their memory. These are not intentional lies, but rather attempts to make sense of their memory loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. Amnesia:&nbsp;</strong>This involves significant memory impairment. <strong>Anterograde amnesia</strong> (difficulty forming new memories) is more prominent than retrograde amnesia (difficulty recalling past memories).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>3. Peripheral neuropathy:</strong> This is also seen in Korsakoff syndrome, involving nerve damage that can cause pain, numbness, or weakness, typically in the hands and feet.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Option:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>4. Ophthalmoplegia:</strong> This is not a feature of Korsakoff syndrome. Ophthalmoplegia, or paralysis of the eye muscles, is a characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which often precedes Korsakoff syndrome but is a separate condition.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by amnesia, confabulation, and peripheral neuropathy, but not ophthalmoplegia, which is associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy.</span></p>",

This is applicable <strong>only if a person loses the capacity to make mental healthcare or treatment decisions</strong>.

It primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes. Memory may be preserved in the early stages, but personality and language changes are prominent.

The primary symptoms are motoric (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), but dementia can develop in the later stages of the disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;C. Huntington's disease: </strong>This is a genetic disorder that affects the basal ganglia, especially the caudate nucleus, which is also a subcortical structure. Cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms are common.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;D.
