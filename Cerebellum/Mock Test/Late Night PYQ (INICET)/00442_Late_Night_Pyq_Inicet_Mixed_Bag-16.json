C) 1, 3, 5 are true</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">This situation involves multiple aspects: legal, ethical, and medical considerations are paramount. Here's why each statement is addressed as true or false in this context:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>1. Document informed refusal:</strong> True. It is essential for medical practitioners to document any refusal of examination or treatment, particularly in sensitive cases involving minors. Documentation should include detailed information about what was explained to the patient and the guardian, and their reasons for refusal, to ensure clarity and legal safeguarding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>3. Counsel the mother and daughter:</strong> True. The role of a gynecologist includes providing medical counseling, especially when it involves minors and sensitive issues such as sexual activity. Counseling should aim to educate about the health implications of the sexual activity, the benefits of medical examination, and the legal aspects considering the age of consent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>5. Inform the police:</strong> True. According to laws in many jurisdictions, including India, any sexual activity with a minor, regardless of consent, is considered statutory rape. Medical professionals are mandated reporters, which means they are legally obligated to report such cases to law enforcement to ensure the safety of the minor and adhere to legal statutes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>2. Do not inform the police:</strong> False. The gynecologist has a mandatory obligation to report cases of suspected statutory rape, as non-reporting could be considered a failure of duty and legal non-compliance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>4. Examine with necessary force:</strong> False. It is illegal and unethical to perform a medical examination against a patient's will, especially in the case of a minor. The patient's autonomy must be respected, and no examination should proceed without consent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Examination of a victim of sexual assault should be done only after the consent of the victim. It is the accused who can be examined without consent, not the victim. Whether the victim agrees for examination or not, the police always have to be informed as there is an allegation of crime of rape (as sex even with consent with a girl &lt;18 years of age will be considered rape)</span></p>",

D) Pancreatic insufficiency</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The presentation of chronic diarrhea and steatorrhea indicates a malabsorption syndrome. Key diagnostic tests include the D-xylose test, duodenal biopsy, and Schilling test to help identify the underlying pathology. In this case:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Normal D-xylose test</strong> – This suggests an intact small intestinal mucosa, as D-xylose is a monosaccharide absorbed directly by the intestinal lining without requiring digestive enzymes.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Normal duodenal biopsy</strong> – This finding further excludes small intestinal conditions like celiac disease or intestinal lymphangiectasia, which typically show abnormalities on biopsy.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Abnormal Schilling test</strong> – An abnormal Schilling test indicates impaired absorption of vitamin B12. Pancreatic enzymes are required to release vitamin B12 from its bound form, facilitating its absorption. In pancreatic insufficiency, a lack of these enzymes leads to an abnormal Schilling test, which may normalize after pancreatic enzyme supplementation.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pancreatic insufficiency, often associated with chronic pancreatitis, causes a deficiency in pancreatic enzymes, which are crucial for the digestion and absorption of nutrients, particularly fats. This deficiency leads to steatorrhea and an abnormal Schilling test, aligning with the clinical findings.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Celiac disease</strong>: &nbsp;In celiac disease, the D-xylose test would typically be decreased, and duodenal biopsy would show abnormal findings such as villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and epithelial cell damage. This makes celiac disease an unlikely diagnosis here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Ulcerative colitis</strong>: &nbsp;Ulcerative colitis affects the colon and does not typically lead to fat malabsorption or steatorrhea, as fat absorption occurs in the small intestine. Additionally, it does not affect the Schilling or D-xylose tests.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intestinal lymphangiectasia</strong> : This condition involves abnormal lymphatic function, leading to malabsorption, but it would show an abnormal duodenal biopsy with findings such as dilated lymphatics and clubbed villi.
