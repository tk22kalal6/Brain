A) Bag &amp; Mask ventilation&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In a neonate presenting with a scaphoid abdomen, certain respiratory interventions need to be carefully considered due to the high risk of underlying conditions like congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This is contraindicated in neonates with a scaphoid abdomen suspected of having CDH. The use of positive pressure from bag and mask ventilation can exacerbate the displacement of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defect, potentially worsening respiratory distress and leading to further compromise of pulmonary function. This method of ventilation can increase the risk of pneumothorax, gastric distention, and further reduce lung volume, which is already compromised in CDH.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. IPPV (Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation)</strong>: Like intubation, IPPV is used via a mechanical ventilator after intubation and can provide controlled and safe respiratory support. It is also appropriate in these scenarios to ensure that airway pressure is managed carefully to avoid exacerbating the hernia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intubation</strong>: This is the preferred method for securing the airway in a neonate with a scaphoid abdomen when CDH is suspected. Intubation allows for controlled ventilation settings, minimizes gastric distension, and helps manage the baby’s respiratory status more effectively.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The critical point in managing a neonate with a scaphoid abdomen, particularly when a condition like CDH is suspected, involves avoiding exacerbation of the hernia through inappropriate respiratory support techniques. Opting for intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation instead of bag &amp; mask ventilation is crucial to prevent further complications and stabilize the infant's condition. Properly securing the airway and ensuring adequate ventilation without increasing the risk of further pulmonary or gastrointestinal injury is essential in the initial management of these patients.</span></p>",

Osteoma of the floor of the mouth:</strong> Osteoma is a benign bone tumor. An osteoma of the floor of the mouth would represent an abnormal growth of bone within that specific region.

These terms describe tissue necrosis with ulceration resulting from prolonged pressure that exceeds capillary occlusion pressure (over 30mmHg), leading to tissue anoxia and breakdown.

Unlike decubitus ulcers, they result from venous hypertension rather than direct pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Arterial ulcer</strong> - Arterial (ischemic) ulcers occur at distal locations like toes and dorsum of foot. They are characteristically deep, severely painful, and associated with signs of peripheral vascular disease including brittle nails, sparse hair, and intermittent claudication. They stem from inadequate arterial perfusion rather than external pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Neuropathic ulcer</strong> - Neuropathic ulcers typically form on weight-bearing areas of the foot with characteristic \"punched out\" edges and surrounding callosity. They develop due to sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy (commonly in diabetic patients) rather than from external pressure. The painless nature of these ulcers distinguishes them from decubitus ulcers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pressure sores (decubitus ulcers) result from sustained pressure exceeding tissue perfusion pressure, causing ischemia and necrosis predominantly at bony prominences like the ischium, greater trochanter, and sacrum in immobile patients.</p>",

The best investigation would be a CECT abdomen (not provided in the option) or MRCP.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Correct. MRCP is a non-invasive imaging technique that visualizes the biliary and pancreatic ducts. It provides detailed images without the need for ionizing radiation or invasive procedures. Given the patient's age and presentation, MRCP is an ideal choice to visualize obstructions or abnormalities in the bile duct system without posing additional risks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Endoscopic ultrasound</strong>: This is a useful modality for visualizing the biliary tree, pancreas, and surrounding structures. It can be particularly helpful in assessing small lesions or stones that might be missed by other imaging modalities. It would be utilised if MRCP/CECT did not yield adequate diagnosis, or for staging of periampullary tumors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography:&nbsp;</strong>This is an invasive procedure where contrast is injected directly into the biliary system through the liver, and then X-rays are taken. It can be diagnostic as well as therapeutic (e.g., for bile duct drainage). However, it's more invasive than MRCP and might not be the first choice for solely diagnostic purposes in a 72-year-old patient.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):&nbsp;</strong>ERCP is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth to the duodenum and injecting contrast into the bile and pancreatic ducts. While ERCP can visualize and treat obstructions, it's invasive and carries risks like pancreatitis, especially if used primarily for diagnostic purposes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Obstructive jaundice is a condition in which there is a blockage of the flow of bile out of the liver.

STSG is the preferred choice for covering a large, healing wound with healthy granulation tissue, such as a burn or degloving injury. It involves taking a thin layer of skin from a donor site and applying it to the wound. This type of graft covers large areas and is effective in promoting wound healing with adequate tissue coverage while maintaining flexibility. It is generally used on body areas where cosmesis is less of a priority compared to the face, which would require a full thickness graft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. &nbsp;Full thickness skin graft:</strong> This graft involves both the epidermis and the entire dermis and is typically used for areas requiring greater cosmetic outcomes, such as the face. It is not generally used for large wounds with healthy granulation tissue, as STSG would suffice and cover larger areas with a better healing outcome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. &nbsp;VAC dressing:</strong> Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressing is used for non-healing or chronic wounds that require additional stimulation for granulation tissue formation and wound contraction. It is not needed when the wound already has healthy granulation tissue and is progressing well in healing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. &nbsp;Flap:</strong> A flap is used when there is a need for bulk tissue to cover a deep or complex wound that involves structures like bone, tendons, or joints.

This progression occurs when the pleural defect acts as a flap valve during respiratory cycles, trapping air with each breath and progressively increasing intrapleural pressure. The statement that simple pneumothorax \"can never become\" tension pneumothorax is false, as this conversion is a well-recognized complication that requires vigilant monitoring of patients with simple pneumothorax.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Improper dressing of an open chest wound can lead to tension pneumothorax:</strong> This statement is correct. Complete occlusion of an open pneumothorax (sucking chest wound) without allowing air to escape can convert it to tension pneumothorax. This is why three-sided occlusive dressings are recommended.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. It can commonly occur after mechanical ventilation with PEEP:</strong> This statement is correct. Positive pressure ventilation, especially with PEEP, can rupture emphysematous bullae or cause barotrauma, leading to tension pneumothorax, particularly in patients with COPD or ARDS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Severe chest trauma with rib fractures can lead to it:</strong> This statement is correct.

It is due to hypertrophy of longitudinal muscles alone\" is the one that would not be seen in a case of Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Which makes it the right answer to the question asking which wouldn't be seen in IHPS. IHPS is caused by hypertrophy of the circular muscles of the pylorus, not the longitudinal muscles. This hypertrophy leads to an obstruction at the gastric outlet.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. It presents with non-bilious vomiting</strong>: This statement is correct. IHPS typically presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting. This is because the pyloric stenosis obstructs the gastric outlet, but it is located before the bile duct entry into the duodenum. Therefore, vomitus will not contain bile.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. USG is nearly 100% sensitive to detect IHPS</strong>: While ultrasonography (USG) is a highly sensitive and commonly used modality for the diagnosis of IHPS, stating that it is nearly \"100% sensitive\" may be an overstatement. However, for the purpose of the question, it is understood that USG is the preferred and very reliable method of diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Common metabolic condition seen is Hypokalemic alkalosis</strong>: This statement is correct. Prolonged vomiting due to IHPS leads to the loss of gastric acid. This results in a metabolic alkalosis. The kidneys compensate for this by excreting more potassium in the urine, leading to hypokalemia. Hence, the condition termed \"hypokalemic alkalosis\" is a common metabolic disturbance in IHPS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) involves hypertrophy of the circular muscles of the pylorus, leading to gastric outlet obstruction and presenting with non-bilious vomiting.
