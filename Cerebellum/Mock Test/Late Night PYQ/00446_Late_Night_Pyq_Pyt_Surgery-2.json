      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Ans. A) Immediate Endoscopic removal</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The X-ray shows a coin stuck in the esophagus. When the entire circumference of the coin is seen on the AP (anteroposterior) view of the chest X-ray, it indicates that the coin is likely to be in the esophagus. If the coin appears as a slit on the AP view of the X-ray, it would likely be in the trachea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Based on the X-ray findings showing a coin in the esophagus and the clinical symptoms of dysphagia, drooling of saliva, and choking, the correct line of management is immediate endoscopic removal to prevent complications such as obstruction, perforation, or infection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Immediate Bronchoscopic removal: </strong>Incorrect. Bronchoscopic removal would be indicated if the foreign body was in the trachea or bronchi. Since the X-ray indicates the coin is in the esophagus, this is not the correct procedure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Heimlich's maneuver: </strong>Incorrect. The Heimlich maneuver (or abdominal thrusts) is a first aid procedure used to treat upper airway obstructions caused by foreign objects. This would be appropriate if the child were actively choking due to an obstruction in the trachea or upper airway, but since the coin is lodged in the esophagus, this is not the correct action.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Wait and Watch: </strong>Incorrect. In some cases, especially with smaller, non-sharp objects that are not causing acute distress, a \"wait and watch\" approach might be reasonable to see if the foreign body passes naturally through the digestive system. However, given the size of the coin and the potential risks associated with a foreign body in the esophagus, this is not a recommended approach in this scenario.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">When a foreign body such as a coin is detected in the esophagus on X-ray, immediate endoscopic removal is indicated to prevent potential complications.</span></p>",

The interrupted sutures shown are typical for this correction. This bunching of tissue resembles a dog's ear, hence the name.

Given the patient's history of ischemic heart disease (IHD), he is at risk for cardiac emboli. The symptoms described, such as severe diffuse abdominal pain out of proportion to the clinical findings with an absence of bowel sounds and vomiting, are typical for AMI. The irregular rhythm (possibly atrial fibrillation) increases the risk of embolization, leading to acute mesenteric ischemia, typically involving SMA leading to massive intestinal gangrene if not treated promptly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Acute severe pancreatitis</strong>: While this can cause severe abdominal pain, it typically presents with pain radiating to the back and is often associated with a history of alcohol intake or gallstone disease.

Dirty wounds are at high risk of developing postoperative infections.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

While popliteal emboli do occur, they are less frequent than femoral emboli in acute limb ischemia presentations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D.
