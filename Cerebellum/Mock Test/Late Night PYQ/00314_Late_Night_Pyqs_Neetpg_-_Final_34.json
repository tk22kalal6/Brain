Septoplasty:</strong> In septoplasty, the septum is straightened by removing or reshaping the cartilage and bone but importantly, the removed parts are replaced back between the mucosal flaps. This restoration of structure reduces the likelihood of perforations because the mucosal layers are supported by the replaced bone or cartilage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Septal perforation is a recognized complication of SMR due to the complete removal of septal cartilage and bone without replacement, which can lead to mucosal tears and eventual perforation if the layers do not heal correctly.</span></p>",

D) Intravenous fluids with I.V. regular insulin</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In a patient presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the immediate management involves <strong>FLIP Therapy (fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy and Potassium management)</strong>. This patient's blood glucose is significantly elevated, and the presence of ketones indicates DKA, which is a medical emergency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>1. Fluids</strong>: The initial step is to administer intravenous (IV) fluids to correct dehydration and stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status. The typical approach involves giving isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) at a <strong>rate of 10-20 mL/kg/hr (2-3L) for the first 2-3 hours</strong>. This helps to correct hypovolemia, improve perfusion, and begin to lower blood glucose levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Criteria for fluid management</strong>: After the initial two to three hours of treatment, switch from initial fluids (typically normal saline) to half normal saline for ongoing maintenance.&nbsp;If capillary blood glucose (CBG) drops below 300 mg/dL, and specifically if it falls below 250 mg/dL, add 5% dextrose water to the regimen.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The purpose of adding dextrose is to maintain a target CBG range of 200 to 300 mg/dL. This range helps prevent hypoglycemia, which is a critical concern in the management process.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. Insulin</strong>: Insulin therapy is crucial to halt ketogenesis and reduce blood glucose levels. After 1 hr of fluid start insulin. The <strong>recommended protocol for DKA involves IV regular insulin</strong> because of its rapid onset and short duration of action. The insulin regimen follows a fixed dose insulin infusion (FDII) approach. This helps to normalize blood glucose and ketone levels efficiently.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">First option: Continuous infusion at 0.15 units/kg/hour.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Second option (<strong>more commonly used</strong>): Administer a 0.1 units/kg bolus, followed by a 0.1 units/kg/hour infusion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>IV regular insulin</strong> is preferred over subcutaneous (SC) insulin in emergency settings like DKA due to its predictable absorption and ability to be titrated easily based on frequent blood glucose monitoring.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Adjustments Based on Blood Glucose Levels</strong>: Monitor capillary blood glucose (CBG). If CBG drops below 300 mg/dL, reduce the insulin infusion to half the dose (0.05 units/kg/hour).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Criteria for Stopping Insulin Infusion</strong>: Insulin infusion can be stopped ONLY when the patient tolerates oral feeds without vomiting or abdominal pain. Other criteria include resolution of ketoacidosis, negative or trace positive plasma ketones, and an <strong>anion gap less than 12</strong>, pH more than 7.3 and serum bicarbonate more than 18.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Transition to subcutaneous insulin upon meeting these criteria.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Potassium</strong> Management: Potassium addition is tailored based on serum potassium levels. When serum potassium levels are within a normal range, add approximately 40 milliequivalents of potassium chloride (KCL) per liter of IV fluid administered. This ensures adequate potassium levels to prevent hypokalemia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Monitoring</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If serum potassium is below 3.3, administer IV potassium chloride (KCL) before insulin to prevent hypokalemia-induced arrhythmias.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If serum potassium is between 3.3 and 5.2, administer insulin and KCL together.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If serum potassium exceeds 5.3 &amp; above, administer insulin without KCL and monitor serum potassium closely.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment Goals and Precautions</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Aim for a target CBG of 200 to 300 mg/dL to avoid hypoglycemia.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The common causes of death in patients with DKA, particularly during the treatment phase –&nbsp;</span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Cerebral edema</strong> (MC) may occur due to a rapid decrease in blood glucose levels, which can lead to an osmotic shift. This shift causes fluids to move from the extracellular fluid (ECF) to the intracellular fluid (ICF), resulting in swelling of the brain tissue.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">2<sup>nd</sup> MC cause is <strong>Potassium Disorder</strong> esp.

C) Aneurysm</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hunterian ligature operation refers to proximal ligation of the feeding artery to treat an aneurysm. This surgical technique was pioneered by John Hunter, who recognized that ligating the artery proximal to the aneurysm could reduce blood flow into the aneurysmal sac, allowing it to thrombose and potentially shrink over time. This approach avoids direct manipulation of the aneurysm sac, which historically was a riskier procedure before modern vascular techniques.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A: Varicose veins</strong> Incorrect. The surgical management for varicose veins includes techniques like Trendelenburg operation (flush ligation of great saphenous vein at saphenofemoral junction), stripping, EVLA (Endovenous Laser Ablation), RFA (Radiofrequency Ablation), foam sclerotherapy, and SEPS (Subfascial Endoscopic Perforator Surgery). Hunterian ligation is not used for varicose veins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B: Arteriovenous fistulae</strong> Incorrect. Management of arteriovenous fistulae typically involves embolization techniques. Simple ligation of the feeding artery alone is specifically mentioned as being \"of no lasting value and is actually detrimental as it may preclude treatment by embolisation.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D: Acute ischemia</strong> Incorrect. Acute limb ischemia requires restoration of blood flow, not interruption of it. Treatment involves emergency embolectomy or thrombectomy (using Fogarty balloon catheter), not arterial ligation which would worsen ischemia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hunterian ligature operation involves proximal ligation of the feeding artery to an aneurysm to reduce flow and promote thrombosis of the aneurysmal sac - representing one of the earliest surgical approaches to aneurysm management before modern vascular reconstruction techniques.</p>",

B) Vancomycin</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The clinical scenario involves a 45-year-old patient with enterococcal endocarditis and a known allergy to penicillin, presenting with previous allergic reactions including rash and swelling.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The physician needs to choose an antibiotic that is safe for a patient with a penicillin allergy as well as effective for enterococcal endocarditis. Let's review the options:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is not related to penicillin.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">It is safe for patients with penicillin allergies and is commonly used to treat gram-positive infections, including those caused by enterococci.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Aztreonam: </strong>Aztreonam is a monobactam antibiotic that is generally considered safe for patients with penicillin allergies because it does not share the beta-lactam ring structure of penicillins, which is typically responsible for allergic reactions. However, aztreonam is effective only against gram negative bacteria and is not suitable for enterococcal infections which is a gram positive bacteria.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Ceftriaxone: </strong>Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin. Although cephalosporins have a beta-lactam ring similar to penicillins, the rate of cross-reactivity is relatively low, especially with third-generation cephalosporins. However, caution is advised in patients with a history of severe penicillin allergy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Piperacillin: </strong>Piperacillin is a penicillin derivative and should be avoided in patients with penicillin allergies due to the high risk of cross-reactivity and potential for severe allergic reactions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Conclusion</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The safest options for a patient with a penicillin allergy are:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Aztreonam (Option a)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Vancomycin (Option b)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Given the specific need to avoid penicillin and its derivatives and to treat gram positive (enterococcal) infections, Vancomycin is a safe and effective choice for treating enterococcal endocarditis in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">b. Vancomycin</span></p>",
