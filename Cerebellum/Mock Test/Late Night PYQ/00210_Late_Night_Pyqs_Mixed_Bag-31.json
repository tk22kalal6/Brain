Red cell aplasia&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This patient's presentation is classic for red cell aplasia. Think about what's happening here - the patient has anemia (shown by fatigue, pallor, weakness, and low hemoglobin), but interestingly, only the red blood cell line is affected. The white cells and platelets are completely normal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hallmark of red cell aplasia is that there is a selective reduction in erythroid precursors. The reduced reticulocyte count is also important as it tell us that the bone marrow isn't even trying to compensate for the anemia</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Red cell aplasia can happen for several reasons - parvovirus B19 infection, certain medications, autoimmune disorders, or sometimes associated with thymomas.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A</strong>: Aplastic anaemia If this were aplastic anemia, our patient would be having pancytopenia (low counts across all cell types). Our patient's normal WBC and platelets immediately rule this out.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C</strong>: Iron deficiency anemia; in IDA, the body typically responds by pumping out more reticulocytes to try to compensate. Our patient has reduced Reticulocyte count ruling this out.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D</strong>: Hemolytic anemia would show increased red cell precursors leading to high reticulocyte count.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This question tests knowledge of the differential diagnosis of anemia based on bone marrow findings and cellular indices. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic pattern of red cell aplasia: selective reduction of erythroid precursors with normal myeloid and megakaryocytic lines, accompanied by anemia and low reticulocyte count. The key distinguishing feature is the selective involvement of only the red cell line, differentiating it from other anemias that show different patterns of cell production or destruction.</span></p>",

Langerhans cell histiocytosis</strong>. It is the idiopathic destruction of histiocytes. The disease has characteristics of both an abnormal reactive process and a neoplastic process. It may present initially as a rash, and can disseminate and involve bone marrow, lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the pituitary gland. Histologically, the primary lesion is granulomatous with an influx of eosinophils, macrophages, T cells and multinucleated cells. The Birbeck granule is the microscopic hallmark of the disorder but may not be seen in lesions of the spleen, liver, and GI tract. The rash&nbsp;may be distinguished by the presence of&nbsp;petechiae, bloody crusting, or firmly indurated nodules. Bony involvement occurs in 78% patients. Solitary osseous lesions are incidentally found and may include the skull, hip/pelvis, femur, or ribs. This bony involvement may produce bone pain.&nbsp;In long bones, endosteal scalloping may be responsible for a “budding appearance”.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/04/screenshot-2024-01-04-190814.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"460\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Endosteal scalloping presenting as budding appearance</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Neuroma with bone involvement.&nbsp;</strong>Morton's&nbsp;neuroma&nbsp;is one of the most common pain syndromes affecting the&nbsp;forefoot. It is characterized by tenderness and burning pain in the plantar surface of the forefoot, with painful paresthesias in the two affected&nbsp;toes. This pain syndrome is caused by perineural fibrosis of the interdigital nerves. Although the nerves between the third and fourth toes are affected most commonly, the second and third toes and, rarely, the fourth and fifth toes can be affected as well. Patients may feel like they are walking with a stone in the shoe. The pain worsens with prolonged standing or walking for long distances and is exacerbated by poorly fitting or improperly padded shoes. Morton's neuroma is associated with wearing tight, narrow-toed shoes. On physical examination, pain can be reproduced by firmly squeezing the 2 metatarsal heads together with one hand while placing firm pressure on the interdigital space with the other hand. This maneuver is known as the&nbsp;<strong>Mulder sign</strong>. The patient exhibits an antalgic gait in an effort to reduce weight bearing during walking.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/04/screenshot-2024-01-04-190827.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"370\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Papillary carcinoma of thyroid.&nbsp;</strong>Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is an epithelial malignancy showing follicular cell differentiation and nuclear features.&nbsp;It is the most frequent thyroid neoplasm. The tumor usually appears as an irregular solid mass. One key feature is the ability to invade adjacent structures like lymphatics. About 10% patients may present with metastatic disease at initial presentation.&nbsp;It usually presents as an asymptomatic thyroid mass with or without enlargement of regional (cervical) lymph nodes. Hoarseness and dysphagia occur in approximately 20% cases, signaling recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement with vocal cord paralysis or tracheal compression. Nodal metastases in the lateral neck&nbsp;are reported&nbsp;in 27% patients. The examination reveals a painless hard lesion of less than 5 cm.

The approximate length to be inserted is around 55 cm. The preferred position for inserting the Ryle's tube is in a sitting position with the neck slightly flexed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The proper positioning of the tube can be confirmed through auscultation in the epigastric area while injecting a bolus of air or by an abdominal radiograph. The ideal placement for an NG tube used for suction is within the stomach to avoid damage to the duodenum. In contrast, an NG feeding tube should be placed post-pyloric to reduce the risk of aspiration.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Indications for NG tube usage include gastric decompression in intestinal obstruction, aspiration of gastric fluid, nutritional support, and medication administration.
