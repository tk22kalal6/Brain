      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. A) Fibroadenoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">On ultrasound, fibroadenomas typically appear as well-defined, homogeneous, hypoechoic (dark) masses with smooth margins. They may sometimes exhibit a 'halo' sign, which is a thin, echogenic rim surrounding the lesion. The mass in the image shows these characteristic features, making fibroadenoma a likely diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Breast Cyst:&nbsp;</strong>Cysts are fluid-filled sacs within the breast. On ultrasound, they appear as anechoic (completely black) round or oval structures with well-defined edges and posterior acoustic enhancement (increased brightness behind the cyst due to lack of absorption of ultrasound waves by the fluid). The lesion in the image does not show these typical features of a cyst.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Breast Carcinoma:&nbsp;</strong>Breast cancers can appear in various forms on ultrasound, but they typically present as irregular, microlobulated, or spiculated masses with heterogenous echotexture and may show shadowing due to their density. The margins are often ill-defined, which is not consistent with the well-defined borders seen in the image.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Metastasis to Breast from Another Primary Site:&nbsp;</strong>Metastases to the breast are rare and usually present as multiple round masses that can mimic benign lesions. However, they are not common and typically have a background of known primary malignancy elsewhere, which isn't indicated here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective :</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fibroadenoma appearance on USG is as a ‘Halo’ sign.</span></p>",

This test involves obtaining the recipient's serum, adding donor blood samples, and looking for antibody-antigen complexes.

Live vaccine SA -14-14-2 is quite good during outbreaks too. But JENVAC has an edge over SA 14-14-2 because of the higher immunity levels it creates with a single dose.

While older guidelines or some regions may have used the live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine given subcutaneously, updated practices now favor the inactivated IM vaccine due to its broader safety profile and compatibility with adult vaccination.

D) Supracondylar humerus fracture</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image shows a child with a deformity known as <strong>cubitus varus</strong>, which is a complication of supracondylar humerus fractures. This deformity occurs when the distal part of the arm deviates medially, leading to a \"gunstock\" appearance of the arm. Cubitus varus is a known consequence of a malunited supracondylar humerus fracture, where the carrying angle of the elbow is reduced.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Supracondylar fractures are common in children, especially after a fall on an outstretched hand, and improper alignment during healing can lead to this deformity. The deformity is mostly a cosmetic issue but is directly associated with this type of fracture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/23/screenshot-2024-09-21-161323.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"389\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Radial head fracture</strong>: Radial head fractures typically present with pain during rotation of the forearm and do not commonly cause cubitus varus or valgus deformities. The main issue with radial head fractures is decreased range of motion, particularly pronation and supination, rather than a visible deformity like in this case.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Lateral condyle humerus fracture</strong>: A lateral condyle fracture can lead to <strong>cubitus valgus</strong>, where the distal part of the arm deviates laterally, increasing the carrying angle. This is the opposite deformity to cubitus varus, which we see here. Non-union of lateral condyle fractures is the common cause of cubitus valgus, not cubitus varus.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Mid-shaft humerus fracture</strong>: A mid-shaft humerus fracture does not typically result in deformities like cubitus varus. While this fracture can result in functional issues, especially related to nerve injury (such as radial nerve palsy), it does not lead to elbow deformities unless complicated by additional elbow injury.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Cubitus varus</strong>, a \"gunstock\" deformity, is a classic complication of malunited <strong>supracondylar humerus fractures</strong> in children, where the carrying angle is reduced, causing medial deviation of the arm.</span></p>",

It involves sheep erythrocytes coated with a subagglutinating dose of anti-erythrocyte antibody that are used as antigen in an agglutination test.

Symptoms typically include sudden and severe pain in one testicle, swelling, redness, and often nausea and vomiting. The affected testicle may lie horizontally and be high-riding.

In pregnant patients with prosthetic heart valves, anticoagulation management is crucial to prevent thromboembolic complications. Warfarin is typically avoided in the late third trimester due to the risk of fetal bleeding and other complications during delivery. It is recommended to switch from warfarin to heparin (usually low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) at around 36 weeks of gestation.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Since the patient is still on warfarin at 37 weeks, the immediate action is to switch to LMWH to reduce the risks associated with warfarin during labor and delivery. <strong>Before planning an induction of labor (IOL) or cesarean section, heparin should be stopped 12-24 hours before the planned delivery to minimize the risk of bleeding.</strong></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A. Continue warfarin</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: Continuing warfarin at this stage is inappropriate because it increases the risk of bleeding for both the mother and the fetus during labor or delivery. Warfarin crosses the placenta and poses significant risks during the peripartum period.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option C.

A) Circumstantiality</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">This is a classic example of <strong>Circumstantiality,&nbsp;</strong>which refers to a pattern of speech in which the patient includes excessive and unnecessary details but eventually returns to the main point.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">In this case, the patient eventually answers the doctor's question about her age but takes a long, indirect route with additional, unnecessary details about marriage, children,&nbsp; appearance and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>returns to the main point.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B.

Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. Ceruloplasmin is a protein that binds copper in the bloodstream. In Wilson's disease, serum ceruloplasmin levels are typically low.
