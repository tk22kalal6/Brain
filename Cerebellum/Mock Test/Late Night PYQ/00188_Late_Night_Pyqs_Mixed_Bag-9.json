Bridging veins</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image demonstrating a bleed over the arachnoid layer but beneath the dura suggests a subdural hemorrhage. It is most commonly caused by the shearing of cortical bridging veins.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A subdural hemorrhage is a type of intracranial hemorrhage, which is bleeding within the skull. It occurs when blood accumulates between the dura mater (the tough outermost layer of the meninges) and the arachnoid mater (the middle layer of the meninges) surrounding the brain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Subdural hemorrhages are usually caused by trauma to the head, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents, which can tear the veins that bridge the dura and arachnoid layers. The bleeding can create pressure on the brain, leading to neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, dizziness, seizures, and in severe cases, coma or death.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The symptoms of a subdural hemorrhage can develop immediately or may take hours or even days to appear, depending on the severity of the bleeding. In some cases, a small subdural hemorrhage may resolve on its own without treatment, while larger or more severe bleeds may require surgery to relieve pressure on the brain and stop the bleeding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Factors that can increase the risk of a subdural hemorrhage include advanced age, alcohol or drug abuse, blood-thinning medications, and medical conditions that affect blood clotting or increase the risk of falls.

A) Ectopic ureter</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The clinical presentation described is most consistent with an <strong>ectopic ureter</strong>. An ectopic ureter is a congenital anomaly where the ureter does not insert into the bladder at the normal location (the trigone). Instead, it may insert outside the bladder, such as into the urethra, vagina, or other structures in females. This abnormal insertion leads to continuous dribbling of urine because the urine bypasses the bladder's normal storage function.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Continuous Urine Dribbling:&nbsp;</strong>The hallmark symptom of an ectopic ureter, particularly in females, is constant urinary dribbling or incontinence despite normal voiding. This is because the ureter drains urine directly into a location outside the bladder, where it cannot be stored.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Normal Voiding:&nbsp;</strong>The girl still voids normally because she likely has a second, normally positioned ureter that drains into the bladder, allowing for regular voiding alongside the continuous leakage from the ectopic ureter.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

However, it does not typically cause continuous dribbling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR):&nbsp;</strong>VUR is the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and possibly the kidneys.

It is caused by a breakdown in the normal communication between nerves and muscles. The symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis, such as ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), difficulty in chewing, and progressive weakness in the hands that worsens as the day progresses, match the description given in the question. This condition is known for the decremental response upon repeated stimulation, meaning muscle strength decreases with continued use.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option B. Lambert Eaton syndrome</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: This syndrome is also a disorder of the neuromuscular junction but it typically presents with muscle weakness that improves with continued use (incremental response), opposite to Myasthenia Gravis. Hence, the symptom progression described in the question does not fit Lambert Eaton syndrome.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option C. Botulinum toxicity</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis by preventing the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. While it can cause muscle weakness, it does not typically present with the progressive worsening throughout the day as seen in Myasthenia Gravis.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option D.

It leads to muscle stiffness and spasms, not the progressive muscle weakness described in the question. Tetanus usually follows an injury such as a thorn prick, leading to muscle rigidity rather than the fluctuating weakness seen in Myasthenia Gravis.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational Objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">Myasthenia Gravis is characterized by symptoms such as drooping of the eyelids, difficulty in chewing, and progressive muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, showing a decremental response upon repeated stimulation.</span></span></p>",

This test is used primarily to detect the agglutination of red blood cells (RBCs) by substances such as viruses or anti-blood group antibodies.

According to Poiseuille's law, the resistance (R) to airflow through a tube is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the tube (R ∝ 1/r^4). This means that even a small reduction in the diameter of the tube will result in a significant increase in resistance. The law can be expressed as R = 8ηL/πr^4, where η is the viscosity of the gas, L is the length of the tube, and r is the radius of the tube.

Multiple brown tumor.</strong> It has been reported that 2-5% patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have brown tumor (osteitis fibrosa cystica). Bone brown tumor secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is very rare, which is caused by massive secretion of PTH. First, a large amount of bone calcium is mobilized into blood, resulting in fibrous tissue hyperplasia in bone and leaky hemorrhage. Then, macrophage reactive hyperplasia resulted in phagocytosis of red blood cells and a large amount of hemosiderin is produced, thereby forming a brown nodule. The lesions are usually multiple, most commonly seen in ribs, clavicle, pelvis, long bones and mandibles while others are rare. The radiograph of brown tumor is often characterized by osteoporosis, thinning of cortical bone and multiple localized cystic bone destruction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture46.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"313\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C.
