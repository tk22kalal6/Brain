D) Angle closure glaucoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Angle closure glaucoma is a condition where there is a sudden increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the closure of the angle between the iris and the cornea, which obstructs the drainage of aqueous humor. This leads to a rapid rise in IOP, resulting in acute, severe eye pain, headache, nausea, and a sudden loss of vision. A key clinical sign of an acute angle closure glaucoma attack is a mid-dilated, vertically oval, and sluggishly reacting pupil. The vertically oval pupil occurs due to ischemia of the iris sphincter muscles caused by the high IOP.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/27/screenshot-2024-08-27-105538.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"268\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This condition is an ophthalmic emergency, and immediate treatment is necessary to prevent permanent vision loss. The high IOP can cause damage to the optic nerve, leading to irreversible vision loss if not promptly managed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Note - Vogt's triad</strong> is a set of three clinical signs associated with the aftermath of an acute attack of glaucoma. This triad includes sphincter atrophy (damage to the iris sphincter muscle), a mid-dilated pupil that does not react well to light, and glaucoma flecken, which are patches of pigmentation or discoloration on the lens of the eye resulting from the damage caused by the increased intraocular pressure during a glaucoma attack.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. CSR/Macular degeneration</strong>: Central serous retinopathy (CSR) and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) are conditions that cause a <strong>gradual, painless loss of central vision</strong>. They do not present with acute pain, sudden vision loss, or pupillary abnormalities like a vertically oval pupil.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Cataract</strong>: Cataracts cause a <strong>gradual, painless decrease in vision</strong> due to the clouding of the lens. They do not cause sudden vision loss, pain, or changes in pupil shape.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Optic neuritis</strong>: Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause sudden vision loss and pain, particularly with eye movement. However, it does not cause changes in the shape of the pupil or a vertically oval pupil. The <strong>pain in optic neuritis is typically associated with eye movements</strong> rather than the constant severe pain seen in angle closure glaucoma.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:48px;\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Acute angle closure glaucoma is characterized by sudden, painful vision loss, and a mid-dilated, vertically oval, sluggishly reacting pupil.

The ice test is useful for&nbsp;ptosis. An ice pack is applied to the affected upper eyelid for 2-5 minutes. A positive test is the improvement of&nbsp;ptosis&nbsp;by &gt; 2mm or more.
