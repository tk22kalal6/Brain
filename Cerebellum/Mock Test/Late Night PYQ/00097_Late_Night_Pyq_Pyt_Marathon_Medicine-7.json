A) HbA1C</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">HbA1C, also known as glycated hemoglobin, is the best test for assessing long-term control of diabetes. It reflects the average blood glucose levels over the past 2 to 3 months. This is because the lifespan of a red blood cell (RBC) is approximately 90 to 120 days, and HbA1C measures the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated (coated with sugar). Therefore, it provides a comprehensive view of a patient's blood glucose control over a longer period.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Glycated Albumin:</strong> Glycated albumin reflects blood glucose control over a shorter period, typically the last 2 to 3 weeks. While it can be useful in certain situations, it does not provide as long-term a view as HbA1C.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Urine sugar:</strong> Measuring sugar in the urine is not a reliable method for assessing long-term glucose control. It only indicates that the blood glucose level has been high enough to spill over into the urine, which reflects immediate/ recent glucose levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Fasting blood sugar:</strong> Fasting blood sugar provides information about the blood glucose level at a single point in time, typically after an overnight fast.

Hyperparathyroidism</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the body. In conditions where there is an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, such as in hyperparathyroidism, there is a corresponding increase in blood calcium levels. The body responds to this hypercalcemia by increasing the secretion of calcitonin to help lower the calcium levels back to normal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Hyperthyroidism:&nbsp;</strong>While hyperthyroidism involves the thyroid gland, it does not typically result in increased calcitonin levels. Hyperthyroidism mainly increases thyroid hormones like thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), not calcitonin.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Hypoparathyroidism:&nbsp;</strong>This condition is characterized by decreased PTH levels, leading to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), not hypercalcemia that would stimulate calcitonin production.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cushing's syndrome:&nbsp;</strong>Cushing's syndrome involves an excess of cortisol, a steroid hormone, and does not directly affect calcitonin levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Increased calcitonin levels are typically seen in response to hypercalcemia, as seen in hyperparathyroidism.

The primary cause of this condition is mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLr) gene.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> The LDL receptor is responsible for the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the blood into the liver. When there are mutations in the LDLr gene, the receptors are either dysfunctional or deficient. As a result, LDL cholesterol cannot be effectively removed from the bloodstream, leading to elevated levels of LDL cholesterol. This condition significantly increases the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Heterozygous FH:</strong> This form is more common and results in moderately high LDL cholesterol levels (200-300 mg/dL).

This type typically results from the rupture of small perforating arteries or arterioles weakened primarily by chronic hypertension, leading to bleeding directly into the brain tissue. This can occur in areas such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:</strong> Incorrect. While serious, subarachnoid hemorrhages are less common and typically result from the rupture of aneurysms rather than hypertension.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Subdural Hemorrhage:</strong> Incorrect. Subdural hemorrhages, usually due to venous tears, are more commonly associated with trauma rather than spontaneous vascular events.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Extradural Hemorrhage:</strong> Incorrect. Extradural (epidural) hemorrhages are rare and almost exclusively trauma-related, involving bleeding between the inner surface of the skull and the dura mater.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The primary cause of intracerebral hemorrhage is hypertension, which leads to the rupture of small arteries in the brain, emphasizing the importance of managing blood pressure to prevent such critical events.</span></p>",
