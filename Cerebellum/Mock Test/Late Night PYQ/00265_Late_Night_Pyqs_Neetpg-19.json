Becomes more positive</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In the given clinical scenario, the patient has hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause a shift in the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value, increased cell excitability, and impairments in membrane potential changes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Hyperkalemia can affect the resting membrane potential of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, in the following ways:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons. However, in hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration can lead to an increased positive charge outside the cell. This positive charge tends to depolarize the cell membrane, shifting the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Altered Excitability: The increased resting membrane potential caused by hyperkalemia can make the cell more excitable. It reduces the threshold required for an action potential to be initiated, making the cell more likely to depolarize and generate an action potential even in response to weaker stimuli.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Impaired Membrane Potential Changes: Hyperkalemia can interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to depolarize and repolarize properly during an action potential. It reduces the electrochemical gradient for sodium (Na+) entry during depolarization and decreases the driving force for potassium (K+) exit during repolarization. This can result in slower and less efficient propagation of action potentials.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;Disrupted Ionic Balance: Elevated potassium levels can disrupt the balance of other ions, such as sodium and calcium, which are essential for normal cell function. The altered ionic balance can interfere with the proper functioning of ion channels and other membrane proteins involved in generating and regulating action potentials.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. No change:</strong> Incorrect. Changes in extracellular potassium concentrations directly impact the resting membrane potential.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Becomes more negative:</strong> Incorrect. An increase in extracellular potassium concentration results in depolarization (more positive resting membrane potential), not hyperpolarization.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. First becomes more positive, then negative:</strong> Incorrect. While complex fluctuations can occur under dynamic conditions, primarily, hyperkalemia causes a persistent depolarization (more positive shift) without an initial opposite change.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In hyperkalemia, as seen in patients with severe muscle injury, the resting membrane potential becomes more positive due to decreased potassium efflux, leading to increased excitability of nerve and muscle cells. This can affect the normal function of these cells, potentially leading to complications such as muscle weakness or cardiac arrhythmias.</span></p>",

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is characterized by bleeding that occurs between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. This type of bleeding is protected by the arachnoid mater, making it resistant to being washed away by water during an autopsy.

B) Dobutamine stress echocardiography</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">This is an echocardiogram that is performed while the heart is under the stress of increased workload. If a patient cannot exercise, a drug called dobutamine is administered to simulate the effects of exercise on the heart.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The test helps identify areas of the heart that may not be receiving enough blood due to blockages in the coronary arteries. A significant change in the motion of the heart wall during the test is a strong predictor of perioperative cardiac complications, making this test highly valuable in the mentioned context.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Exercise ECG testing:&nbsp;</strong>Exercise ECG testing, also known as exercise stress testing or treadmill testing, involves the patient exercising on a treadmill or stationary bicycle while their heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) are monitored. The purpose is to determine how the heart responds to the stress of exercise. Abnormal changes in the ECG during or after exercise may suggest coronary artery disease (CAD). While this test can indicate the presence of CAD, it does not specifically predict perioperative cardiac complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy:&nbsp;</strong>Also known as a nuclear stress test, this investigation involves injecting a small amount of radioactive substance into the patient and using a special camera to visualize how blood flows through the heart muscle, both at rest and during stress (either exercise or with a medication). This test can identify areas of the heart that aren't getting enough blood, indicative of CAD. While it can detect and evaluate the severity of CAD, it's less specific than dobutamine stress echocardiography in predicting perioperative cardiac complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Coronary angiography:&nbsp;</strong>This is a procedure in which a contrast dye is injected into the coronary arteries, and X-rays are taken to visualize the flow of blood through these arteries.

As the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing CAD, coronary angiography can provide detailed information about the location and severity of blockages. However, it's an invasive procedure, involving threading a catheter through the blood vessels to the heart, and carries risks such as bleeding, allergic reactions, or kidney damage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Dobutamine stress echocardiography is the most accurate non-invasive investigation for predicting perioperative cardiac complications due to its ability to simulate exercise and identify areas of the heart with reduced blood flow.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Ref: Miller’s Anesthesia, 9<sup>th</sup> Ed.

The innermost layer of the trachea consists of pseudostratified columnar epithelium.

However, it is actually a single layer of cells.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Pseudostratified columnar epithelium</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> primarily consists of tall, column-like cells that are closely packed together. Despite appearing layered due to the varying positions of the nuclei, it is a single layer of cells. This structure is crucial for the trachea as it often contains cilia (tiny hair-like projections) and goblet cells that produce mucus. The cilia help move mucus and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract, aiding in keeping the airways clear.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

The condition is characterized by abnormal bone growth around the stapes bone in the middle ear, leading to its <strong>fixation</strong>. This fixation prevents the stapes from vibrating in response to sound waves, thereby reducing the transmission of sound to the inner ear and causing hearing loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In otosclerosis, the tympanic membrane (eardrum) typically appears normal upon examination. The hearing loss in otosclerosis is conductive, meaning it is due to a problem in the outer or middle ear, which transmits sound to the inner ear. A pure-tone audiogram (PTA) showing a 56dB hearing loss indicates significant conductive hearing impairment, consistent with otosclerosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.
