B) Calcitriol</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D and plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphate metabolism in the body. It directly acts on vitamin D receptors (VDRs) present in the parathyroid gland, leading to a decrease in the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong> Calcitriol increases the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines. Elevated levels of calcium in the blood provide negative feedback to the parathyroid glands, which reduces the production of PTH. Additionally, calcitriol directly inhibits the synthesis and secretion of PTH by binding to VDRs in the parathyroid gland. This dual action ensures a reduction in PTH levels, making calcitriol an effective treatment for conditions associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Note - <strong>Paricalcitol</strong>: A synthetic vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist used to reduce PTH levels in primary hyperparathyroidism.

Risedronate:</strong> Risedronate is a bisphosphonate used to treat osteoporosis. It works by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which can sometimes lead to hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can reflexively increase PTH levels, rather than decrease them.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

It is often caused by barotrauma, which can lead to an acute deterioration in ventilated patients, presenting with sudden hypoxemia and increased peak inspiratory pressure (PIP).

B) Primary adrenal insufficiency</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is characterized by inadequate production of adrenal hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. The clinical presentation typically includes fatigue, weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium). The physical finding of hyperpigmentation, especially in areas like the knuckles, arms, and legs, is a classic feature due to increased production of ACTH, which has melanocyte-stimulating activity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In this case, the combination of fatigue, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperpigmentation strongly supports the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Both the PaCO₂ and bicarbonate (HCO₃) levels are decreased, aligning with the pattern seen in metabolic acidosis.

PCP is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients, especially when the CD4 count is below 200 cells/cu.mm.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The treatment of choice for PCP is co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). It is essential to start treatment empirically in suspected cases of PCP because delayed treatment can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The dose of co-trimoxazole is typically higher for treating PCP than for prophylaxis.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Steroids are indicated in severe cases of PCP to reduce inflammation, specifically if the patient has hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt; 70 mmHg) or an alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient &gt; 35 mmHg. In this scenario, there is no data indicating severe disease, so co-trimoxazole alone is appropriate.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options: </span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

P pulmonale refers to the presence of abnormally tall P waves in the ECG, usually greater than 2.5 mm in height in lead II. This finding indicates right atrial enlargement, which is commonly associated with pulmonary conditions such as pulmonary hypertension. Right atrial enlargement occurs due to increased pressure or volume overload in the right atrium, often secondary to lung diseases that lead to increased pulmonary artery pressures.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.
