Dermoid cyst</strong>. A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure.&nbsp;These benign tumors are lined by stratified squamous epithelium with mature skin appendages found on their wall and their lumens filled with keratin and hair.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts are considered to be congenital, but not all of them are diagnosed at birth.&nbsp;Only about 40% of dermoid cysts are diagnosed at birth, while about 60% are diagnosed by five years of age. The dermoid cysts usually present within the first year of life and grow slowly.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts occur most commonly on the head and neck. The etiology of dermoid cysts&nbsp;remains mostly unknown. These occur when skin and skin structures become trapped during fetal development.&nbsp;In the head and neck region, dermoid cysts can most commonly be seen in the frontal, occipital, and supraorbital areas, with the outer third of the eyebrow being the most frequently affected region.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture13_fTE459u.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after multiple myeloma. It is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. All patients report progressive pain. Night pain is also reported in about 25% patients. Characteristic findings are Codman’s triangle and Sunburst periosteal reaction. It is the most radioresistant bone tumor and treated by chemotherapy followed by limb salvage surgery/amputation followed by chemotherapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture14_3f4Ne5o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"182\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Chondroblastoma.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chondroblastoma is a rare type of benign tumor that grows at the ends of the long bones, close to the joints. Most often, the tumors develop at the ends of the femur, tibia, or humerus. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are more common in males. Although chondroblastomas are not cancerous, they can continue to grow if left untreated. A growing tumor can destroy the surrounding bone, making it painful to move the nearby joint. The cause of chondroblastomas is not known. The tumors are thought to arise from the growth plates at the ends of the bones, near joints. Classic <strong>“chicken wire” </strong>calcification is seen. Epiphysis + calcification + upper end humerus = Chondroblastoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture16_KKxJopm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"316\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tumor of distal end radius is always GCT until proven otherwise.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Mc site of giant cell tumor is lower end femur.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lower end femur is Mc site for:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Giant cell tumor</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteosarcoma</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteomyelitis</span></li></ul></li></ul>",

It allows for real-time data generation and monitoring, providing critical insights into cure rates, incidences of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), treatment failures, relapses, and other important metrics.

A) Tracheostomy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A tracheostomy involves creating an opening through the neck into the trachea, which may become complicated when the trachea is deviated. In cases of tracheal deviation, the trachea is not in its usual midline position, which can make locating the correct spot for incision more challenging. This difficulty is increased because the trachea's position may not be easily palpable or visible due to its displacement, which can complicate the procedure and increase the risk of complications.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_aEVEcW6.png\" width=\"367\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Laryngeal airway:</strong> A laryngeal airway (LMA) is inserted above the larynx at the supraglottic level. Since this procedure does not involve the trachea directly, a deviated trachea does not affect the placement of an LMA, making it relatively easy to perform.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_T5agVaS.png\" width=\"306\" height=\"231\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Endotracheal intubation:</strong> While endotracheal intubation may become slightly more difficult with tracheal deviation, it usually remains manageable. The main challenge might be encountering some resistance or needing to adjust the angle of the tube. However, with careful maneuvering, the endotracheal tube can still be guided into the trachea.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_f8aYTbB.png\" width=\"443\" height=\"342\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cricothyroidotomy:</strong> This procedure involves making an incision through the cricothyroid membrane, located above the trachea at the level of the larynx. Because the tracheal deviation occurs below this point, it does not directly impact the cricothyroidotomy, making it a viable option even with tracheal deviation.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_H46wIa0.png\" width=\"594\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tracheostomy can be more challenging in cases of tracheal deviation due to the altered position of the trachea, making the precise location for incision difficult to identify.</span></p>",

This occurs due to chronic gall bladder inflammation and formation of cholecysto-duodenal fistula (GB to duodenum). Through the communication, a gall stone may pass into the duodenum and then into small bowel.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Small gallstones may pass through the intestines spontaneously, but larger stones (2-5 cm) are more likely to cause obstruction, usually at the terminal ileum or ileocecal valve.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Symptoms may include acute, intermittent, or chronic episodes of gastrointestinal obstruction, abdominal distension and tenderness, high-pitched bowel sounds, and obstructive jaundice.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Diagnosis is typically made with a plain abdominal radiograph, which may show signs of obstruction, Pneumobilia (air within the biliary tree), and a gallstone in the intestines (RIGLER’S TRIAD).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Treatment involves surgical intervention, with a longitudinal incision made on the antimesenteric border to remove the gallstone.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>&nbsp;Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option B</strong>. <strong>Adhesive intestinal obstruction: </strong>This results from the formation of adhesions (bands of scar tissue) that can develop after surgery, which then bind the intestines together. These adhesions can pull the intestines out of place or create a kink or twist. The patient's history of an abdominal hysterectomy is suggestive of this, as post-surgical adhesions are a common cause of intestinal obstruction. However, the presence of air in the biliary tree does not fit with this diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option C</strong>. <strong>Ischemic enterocolitis: </strong>Refers to inflammation of the intestine due to reduced blood supply, often caused by blockage or constriction of the blood vessels that serve the intestines.

Symptoms include lower left-sided abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits. While diverticulitis can lead to complications like abscesses, fistulas, or bowel obstructions, the specific presentation of vomiting bile and air within the biliary tree on imaging is not consistent with a primary diagnosis of diverticulitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis characterized by the presence of air within the biliary tree, obstructive symptoms, and the formation of a cholecysto-duodenal fistula.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">It typically presents with signs of gastrointestinal obstruction and is diagnosed through imaging, revealing pneumobilia and a gallstone in the intestines.</span></li></ul>",

Greater auricular nerve</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The greater auricular nerve is a sensory nerve that supplies the skin of the external ear, the area over the parotid gland, and the angle of the mandible. It is a branch of the cervical plexus, specifically arising from the cervical spinal nerves C2 and C3. Any acute inflammation of the gland such as acute sialadenitis results in pain in the preauricular region. The pain is mainly due to stretching of the capsule resulting in stimulation of the greater auricular nerve.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Facial nerve</strong>: The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) traverses through the parotid gland but does not innervate it. Instead, it provides motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression. Damage to the facial nerve may lead to facial paralysis or weakness, but it's not directly responsible for sensation or pain below the earlobe.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Investing layer of deep cervical fascia</strong>: This is a layer of connective tissue that envelops the neck and extends into the face. It surrounds several structures, including the parotid gland.

Auriculotemporal nerve</strong>: This is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3). It provides sensory innervation to the skin above the parotid gland, the external ear, and the external auditory canal. Though it provides sensation to the aforementioned areas, the region described in the scenario (below the earlobe) is not primarily innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/07/12/whatsapp-image-2023-06-12-at-19012101101026_rTVPiw9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"566\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Greater auricular nerve</strong> originates from the cervical plexus, specifically from the C2 and C3 spinal nerves.

D) Superior tarsal muscle</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The superior tarsal muscle, also known as Muller's muscle, is a smooth muscle that assists in elevating the upper eyelid. In Horner syndrome, there is damage to the sympathetic nerve supply, specifically the T1 nerve, which innervates the superior tarsal muscle. Paralysis of this muscle leads to ptosis, or drooping of the upper eyelid, because the muscle cannot perform its function of aiding eyelid elevation. Horner syndrome typically results from a disruption in the sympathetic nerves, leading to symptoms like ptosis, miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

It's caused by an abnormal development of the eye's drainage system, leading to increased intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve. Symptoms can include photophobia, excessive tearing (lacrimation), and cloudy, enlarged corneas. Given the symptoms&nbsp; described, congenital glaucoma is a likely diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)</strong>: This is a group of metabolic disorders caused by the absence or malfunctioning of lysosomal enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans. While MPS can affect the eyes, leading to problems like corneal clouding and glaucoma, the key symptoms often include developmental delay, skeletal and joint abnormalities, and coarse facial features. Eye-related symptoms are typically not the first presenting symptoms in MPS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Congenital Cataract</strong>: This refers to a clouding of the lens of the eye that is present at birth. Congenital cataracts can cause a variety of symptoms including a noticeable white, grey, or yellow spot in the pupil, nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movements), and yes, potentially photophobia. However, lacrimation (excessive tearing) is not a typical symptom of cataracts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Ophthalmia Neonatorum</strong>: This condition is a form of conjunctivitis that occurs in newborns. Typically, it's caused by bacteria acquired during passage through the birth canal from an infected mother. The primary symptoms include redness of the eyes, swelling of the eyelids, and discharge, which may be watery or pus-like. Photophobia can be a symptom, but it's not as common as in some other conditions like congenital glaucoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Congenital Glaucoma should be suspected in infants presenting with photophobia, excessive tearing, and cloudy, enlarged corneas, as it is due to the abnormal development of the eye's drainage system leading to increased intraocular pressure.</span></p>",

The Warburg effect is a metabolic phenomenon observed in many cancer cells where they preferentially use glycolysis to generate energy, but it does not make cancer cells immortal.

This worm lays its eggs around the perianal region, which leads to intense itching. The characteristic D-shaped (plano-convex) eggs seen in the images further confirm the diagnosis of Enterobius vermicularis.
