D) Lung metastasis is rare and seen as a late feature</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Wilms’ tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children, typically under the age of six. It is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors and presents with a variety of clinical features, most notably an abdominal mass.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Common Presentation:</strong> The most common presenting symptom of Wilms’ tumor is a painless abdominal mass, which may be noticed by the child's parents or during a routine physical examination. This aligns with option A, making it correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Age of Onset:</strong> Wilms’ tumor most frequently occurs in young children, particularly those under the age of six. This is well-documented in clinical practice and research, making option B correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment and Prognosis:</strong> The treatment for Wilms’ tumor typically includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy. The majority of patients have a good prognosis and can recover with appropriate treatment, supporting option C as correct.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lung Metastasis:</strong> Contrary to option D, lung metastasis is actually relatively common in Wilms’ tumor and often one of the first sites of metastasis. It is not rare, nor is it necessarily a late feature. Early detection and treatment of lung metastases are crucial in the management of Wilms' tumor, making this option incorrect.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Wilms’ tumor typically presents as an abdominal mass, which is often the first sign that prompts further investigation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Presents in children &lt; 6 years of age:</strong> This is also correct. The majority of cases occur in children under the age of six, making this a well-recognized feature of the disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Majority of patients recover due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy:</strong> This statement is accurate as well.

A) Most common neoplasm of thymus</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Thymomas are indeed the most common primary tumors of the thymus. These tumors originate from the epithelial cells of the thymus, an organ located in the anterior mediastinum. While they can be associated with various systemic syndromes, particularly myasthenia gravis, they may also be asymptomatic and are sometimes discovered incidentally<strong>.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Most common posterior mediastinal tumor:&nbsp;</strong>This statement is incorrect. Thymomas are tumors of the anterior mediastinum, not the posterior. Neurogenic tumors are the most common tumors in the posterior mediastinum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Usually symptomatic with dyspnoea, dysphagia and SVC syndrome:&nbsp;</strong>Thymomas can be asymptomatic or they may present with symptoms due to compression of nearby structures. While they can cause symptoms like dyspnea (shortness of breath) if they compress the trachea or lungs, or symptoms of Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome if they compress the SVC, these are not the most common presentations. The association with systemic syndromes like myasthenia gravis is more characteristic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Chest Xray is the investigation of choice:&nbsp;</strong>While a chest X-ray can identify a mediastinal mass suggesting a thymoma, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is usually the investigation of choice for further characterization and to evaluate the exact size, location, and any local invasion. The CT scan provides more detailed images than a simple chest X-ray<strong>.</strong></span></p>",

It is characterized by facial flushing and sweating in the region of the face associated with the parotid gland, particularly when eating or thinking about food. The underlying cause of Frey's syndrome is damage to the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve, V3).

Here are some key points about septic shock:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Infection</strong>: Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections. Common sources of infection include lung infections (pneumonia), urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and skin infections.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Systemic Inflammatory Response</strong>: In response to the infection, the body's immune system initiates a widespread inflammatory response. This response can become dysregulated, leading to an exaggerated release of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) into the bloodstream.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Hypotension</strong>: One of the hallmark features of septic shock is low blood pressure (hypotension). The inflammation and vasodilation caused by the infection can lead to a drop in blood pressure, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Organ Dysfunction</strong>: As blood pressure drops and organs receive less oxygen and nutrients, multiple organ systems can begin to fail. This can lead to dysfunction in the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Organ dysfunction is a critical component of septic shock and contributes to its high mortality rate.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Symptoms of septic shock can include fever or hypothermia (low body temperature), rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, altered mental status, and signs of organ dysfunction such as respiratory distress, kidney failure, or liver dysfunction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment</strong>: The treatment of septic shock is a medical emergency and involves aggressive interventions. It typically includes antibiotics to treat the underlying infection, intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure, vasopressor medications to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure, and supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU).</span></li></ol>",

D) Subdural Hematoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The given clinical scenario suggests Acute Subdural Hematoma (SDH), which is the accumulation of blood between the arachnoid membrane and the dura, resulting from the tearing of a bridging vein running from the cerebral cortex to the Dural sinuses. It is commonly seen in the elderly, alcoholics, and patients on anticoagulants. The stretching of Cortical-Dural bridging veins in cerebral atrophy makes them vulnerable to rupture, leading to symptoms of raised intracranial pressure or focal deficits. On head CT scan, acute SDH appears as a hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the layers of the dura mater surrounding the brain. It can occur as a result of head trauma, such as a fall, and may not present with immediate symptoms but can lead to a gradual onset of neurological symptoms, including headache, confusion, and other focal neurological deficits. Subdural hematomas are known to have delayed presentations after the initial trauma, making this the likely diagnosis in the context of a fall with subsequent neurological symptoms.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Frontal lobe meningioma</strong>: While a frontal lobe meningioma can cause neurological symptoms, it typically develops slowly and is not usually associated with an acute presentation following a fall. Additionally, the symptoms of a meningioma can vary widely depending on its location and size.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

When a hernia is reducible, it means that the protruded organ or tissue can be pushed back into its original place.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The standard treatment for a reducible hernia is surgical repair. This often involves reducing the hernia and reinforcing the weakened area with a mesh to prevent recurrence.

The clinical presentation of gallstones (cholelithiasis) and gallbladder cancer (carcinoma) can sometimes be distinguished. Gallstones commonly cause symptoms such as biliary colic (episodic, severe right upper quadrant pain) and may lead to acute cholecystitis, which includes symptoms like pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. In contrast, gallbladder carcinoma may present with more persistent or progressive symptoms, including unexplained weight loss and, in some cases, a palpable abdominal mass. The two conditions can have overlapping symptoms, but their clinical courses can be distinguished based on the duration and progression of symptoms.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Gallbladder carcinoma often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.
