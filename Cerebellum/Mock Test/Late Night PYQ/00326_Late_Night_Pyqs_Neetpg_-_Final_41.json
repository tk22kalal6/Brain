Although it can cause pedal edema in some patients but the pedal edema which is given in the question seems to be due to renal insufficiency itself. The adverse effect of pedal edema does not make it contra-indicated for hypertension.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also has a long duration of action and is well-tolerated in patients with renal insufficiency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Hyperkalemia can exacerbate renal dysfunction and pose serious health risks, making aliskiren an unsuitable choice for this patient.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Chlorthalidone: </strong>Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic. Thiazide diuretics are typically ineffective in patients with significantly impaired renal function (e.g., low GFR) and can cause electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Therefore, chlorthalidone is not recommended for patients with renal insufficiency and low urine output.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Prazosin: </strong>Prazosin is an alpha-blocker used to lower blood pressure. However, it is not typically a first-line drug for hypertension due to its side effects, such as postural hypotension. Additionally, prazosin can cause fluid retention, which may worsen renal function in patients with renal insufficiency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Amlodipine is the preferred antihypertensive medication for patients with renal insufficiency, as it effectively lowers blood pressure without negatively impacting renal function.</span></p>",

RBs represent the metabolically active, replicative stage of the chlamydial life cycle that can only survive within host cells. After the infectious elementary body enters the host cell, it transforms into the reticulate body which then multiplies by binary fission within a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion body. The RB cannot survive in the extracellular environment due to its fragile cell wall and dependency on host cell resources.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. The reticulate body is the infectious form</strong> - This is incorrect because the elementary body (EB), not the reticulate body, is the infectious form of Chlamydia trachomatis. The EB is the extracellular, metabolically inactive form that is specialized for transmission between cells and hosts. It has a rigid cell wall that enables it to survive in the harsh extracellular environment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. The elementary body shows metabolic activity</strong> - This is incorrect because the elementary body is metabolically inactive. EBs are described as the \"extracellular and infective form\" that only become metabolically active after transforming into reticulate bodies inside host cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. The elementary body is the form that replicates</strong> - This is incorrect because replication is exclusive to the reticulate body form. The life cycle clearly shows that RBs, not EBs, are the \"replicative form\" that divides by binary fission within host cells. Elementary bodies cannot replicate and must first transform into reticulate bodies for multiplication to occur.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chlamydia trachomatis has a biphasic life cycle with the metabolically active reticulate body (RB) existing exclusively intracellularly where it replicates, while the environmentally resistant elementary body (EB) serves as the infectious, extracellular form that cannot replicate until it transforms into an RB inside a host cell.</span></p>",

A) Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vitamin B12 deficiency is most commonly seen in short bowel syndrome with ileal resection because vitamin B12 (cobalamin) absorption occurs exclusively in the terminal ileum. B12 requires binding to intrinsic factor (produced by gastric parietal cells) and this B12-IF complex is then absorbed only in the terminal ileum. When this portion of the bowel is resected, patients inevitably develop B12 deficiency regardless of dietary intake, as there is no alternative absorption site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)</strong>: Thiamine is primarily absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum, not the ileum. Short bowel syndrome with ileal resection would not typically cause thiamine deficiency unless the proximal small bowel is also affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C.

Gene knockout involves the complete deletion of a gene, allowing scientists to directly observe what happens when the gene is absent. This approach reveals the gene's function by demonstrating the physiological, biochemical, and developmental consequences of its removal. The phenotypic changes observed in knockout animals provide conclusive evidence about what the gene actually does in the organism.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Southern blot:</strong> This technique is used for DNA-DNA hybridization to detect specific DNA sequences. It's useful for detecting mutations, genome mapping, paternity testing, and localization of genes for genetic disorders, but doesn't directly assess gene function.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Northern blot:</strong> This involves RNA-DNA hybridization to detect RNA expression. While it shows if and when a gene is expressed, expression patterns alone don't definitively reveal function. Expression analysis can indicate where and when a gene is active but doesn't conclusively demonstrate what it does.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Transgenic animals:</strong> These have foreign DNA introduced into their genome. While useful for studying gene regulation and expression, transgenic approaches typically introduce new or modified genes rather than determining the function of existing genes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Gene knockout animals provide the most direct assessment of gene function by revealing the consequences of gene deletion, offering definitive evidence of the gene's physiological role that other methods cannot provide.</span></p>",

C) Dexmedetomidine</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Dexmedetomidine produces sedation that most closely resembles normal physiological sleep. As an α2 adrenergic agonist, it acts on receptors in the locus coeruleus (the primary site for modulating wakefulness), creating a sedative effect similar to non-REM sleep. Unlike other sedatives, patients sedated with dexmedetomidine can be easily aroused, maintain their respiratory drive, and return to their baseline sedative state when unstimulated - characteristics that closely mimic natural sleep patterns. This unique sleep-like sedation provides hemodynamically stable sedation without significant respiratory depression.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Propofol</strong>: While effective for sedation, propofol produces a state distinctly different from natural sleep. It causes significant respiratory depression, acts primarily on GABA receptors, and produces EEG patterns different from natural sleep. Propofol suppresses airway reflexes and can cause apnea, unlike normal sleep.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Midazolam</strong>: This benzodiazepine alters normal sleep architecture by increasing stage 2 sleep while decreasing stages 3, 4, and REM sleep. Unlike natural sleep, midazolam-induced sedation involves respiratory depression and altered EEG patterns. Benzodiazepines produce amnesia and muscle relaxation not typical of physiological sleep.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Ketamine</strong>: Produces dissociative anesthesia, a cataleptic state far removed from natural sleep. Ketamine causes increased muscle tone, hallucinations, and emergence reactions. It stimulates the sympathetic system (increasing heart rate and blood pressure) and produces an EEG pattern distinctly different from sleep.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Dexmedetomidine uniquely provides sedation that closely resembles natural sleep with preserved respiratory function, arousability, and EEG patterns similar to non-REM sleep, making it ideal for ICU sedation where maintaining physiological sleep cycles is beneficial.</span></p>",

This happens in severe cases of ulcerative colitis, particularly when there is extensive colonic involvement (pancolitis). Unlike Crohn's disease, which can primarily involve the ileum with transmural inflammation, backwash ileitis in ulcerative colitis is superficial, represents an extension of the inflammatory process, and is limited to the mucosa and submucosa.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Crohn's Disease</strong> - While Crohn's disease commonly affects the terminal ileum, the pattern of involvement is distinctly different from backwash ileitis. Crohn's disease features transmural inflammation, skip lesions, granulomas, and fibrosis. It primarily affects the ileum rather than being secondary to colonic inflammation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Colonic Carcinoma</strong> - Colorectal carcinoma does not cause backwash ileitis. Carcinomas are malignant neoplasms that may invade locally but do not typically cause inflammatory changes in the distal ileum. They remain localized to their site of origin unless they metastasize.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Ileal Polyp</strong> - Ileal polyps are discrete lesions that occur within the ileum and do not cause the diffuse inflammatory process characteristic of backwash ileitis. Polyps may be inflammatory, hamartomatous, or neoplastic, but they do not cause inflammation extending from the colon into the ileum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Backwash ileitis refers specifically to the mild inflammatory involvement of the distal ileum in severe ulcerative colitis (particularly pancolitis) and is a distinctive feature that helps differentiate ulcerative colitis from other inflammatory bowel conditions.</span></p>",
