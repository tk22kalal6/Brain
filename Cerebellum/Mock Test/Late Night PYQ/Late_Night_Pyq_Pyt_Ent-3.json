If the patient has significant lymph node involvement or is symptomatic (e.g., weight loss), a neck dissection is warranted along with total laryngectomy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A.

It is primarily used for palliative care or in cases with distant metastasis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Concurrent Chemoradiation: </strong>Concurrent chemoradiation is a consideration for organ preservation in advanced laryngeal cancers.

Bleeding is from the adjacent invading vessels:</strong> Implies that the normal vessels adjacent to the tumor are the source of bleeding.

Noise-induced hearing loss typically presents a notch at 4000Hz. Hence, this statement is incorrect.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Associated Ménière's disease is not a contraindication for stapes surgery:</strong> Ménière's disease is indeed a contraindication for stapes surgery. The presence of Ménière's disease can lead to complications such as irritation of the saccule during the surgery, causing vertigo and giddiness.

The otoscopic examination reveals air-fluid levels behind an intact tympanic membrane, indicative of fluid in the middle ear. This condition is known as secretory otitis media (also called otitis media with effusion), where the middle ear is filled with sterile fluid, leading to conductive hearing loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Ototoxicity:</strong> Ototoxicity refers to damage to the inner ear structures, particularly the hair cells, due to exposure to certain ototoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, cisplatin). This results in sensorineural hearing loss and is not characterized by air-fluid levels in the middle ear.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Adhesive otitis media:</strong> Adhesive otitis media is characterized by the retraction of the tympanic membrane, which adheres to the medial wall of the middle ear. This condition results from chronic eustachian tube dysfunction and does not typically present with air-fluid levels as seen in secretory otitis media.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/06/03/screenshot-2024-06-03-114133.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"267\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Tympanosclerosis:</strong> Tympanosclerosis involves the formation of calcium plaques within the fibrous layer of the tympanic membrane or middle ear due to recurrent infections. This leads to stiffening of the tympanic membrane and conductive hearing loss. The otoscopic findings show calcific deposits, not fluid levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/06/03/screenshot-2024-06-03-114201.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"243\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Secretory otitis media is characterized by the presence of sterile fluid in the middle ear, resulting in conductive hearing loss, and is often seen following the treatment of ASOM.</span></p>",

The request to increase the TV volume suggests a hearing problem, likely due to conductive hearing loss caused by chronic adenoiditis with adenoid hypertrophy. Enlarged adenoids can obstruct the Eustachian tube, leading to fluid accumulation in the middle ear, known as otitis media with effusion. This condition causes conductive hearing loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Adenoidectomy involves the surgical removal of the adenoids to alleviate the obstruction.
