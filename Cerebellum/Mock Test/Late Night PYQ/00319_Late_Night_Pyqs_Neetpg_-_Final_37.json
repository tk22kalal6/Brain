When the vocal cords are tightly stretched, they vibrate at a higher frequency, which is necessary for producing high-pitched notes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In this scenario, the female singer is unable to sing higher frequency notes, indicating that her vocal cords are not adequately tense. This suggests paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle, which normally maintains the tension of the vocal cords. If the cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed, typically due to damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, the vocal cords become bowed, loose, and floppy, impairing the ability to produce high-frequency sounds.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/04/screenshot-2024-09-04-110048.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"320\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/04/screenshot-2024-09-04-110030.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"171\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Thyroarytenoid:</strong> This muscle acts as both an adductor and a relaxer of the vocal cords, contributing to lowering the pitch of the voice rather than raising it.

B) Umbilical excision with herniorrhaphy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">The clinical scenario presented is that of an umbilical hernia that was previously reducible but has now become irreducible. This suggests the hernia has become complicated, possibly due to incarceration or strangulation, where the contents are trapped, leading to ischemia or gangrene of the herniated tissue. The overlying skin also appears gangrenous and requires excision.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">The correct management involves surgical intervention to excise the affected umbilical tissue and perform herniorrhaphy, which is a repair of the hernia without the use of a mesh, particularly when there are complications such as strangulation or infection. The surgical approach must address both the excision of compromised tissue and the closure of the hernial defect to prevent recurrence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option A. Umbilical excision:</strong> This option only addresses the excision of the skin and does not treat the underlying hernia. Simply excising the umbilical tissue will not resolve the hernia defect or prevent recurrence, making this option inadequate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option C. Antibiotics:</strong> Antibiotics alone are not a definitive treatment for a hernia. While antibiotics may be used if there is an associated infection, they do not resolve the underlying mechanical problem of a hernia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option D. Incision and drainage:</strong> This procedure is appropriate for abscesses and localized infections but not for hernias. There is no indication of an abscess in this scenario; rather, it is a hernia with possible ischemic or gangrenous changes, requiring surgical repair rather than drainage.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">In cases of complicated umbilical hernias, especially when the hernia becomes irreducible, surgical intervention with umbilical excision and herniorrhaphy is necessary to repair the hernia and prevent further complications.</span></p>",

Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that is not found in plant sources, making it a potential deficiency for strict vegetarians. As a result, the newborn of this mother is likely to experience a deficiency in vitamin B12.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">While vitamin D is another nutrient that lacks plant sources, it can be synthesized in the skin through exposure to sunlight.

These spaces form when cholesterol crystals are dissolved during routine tissue processing, leaving behind characteristic empty clefts. They are typically found in the necrotic core of the atherosclerotic plaque, alongside foam cells, necrotic debris, fibrin, and other plasma proteins. These crystalline cholesterol deposits contribute to the \"grumous\" (soft and friable) nature of the lipid core in advanced atheromas.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Foam Cells</strong> - These are lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells found in atherosclerotic plaques, but they appear as cells with foamy cytoplasm due to accumulated lipid droplets, not as empty needle-shaped spaces. Foam cells are a key feature of atherosclerotic lesions, particularly in early fatty streaks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Smooth Muscle Cells</strong> - These cells are present in atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in the fibrous cap, but they appear as spindle-shaped cells with nuclei, not as empty spaces. Smooth muscle cells play an important role in plaque stabilization through ECM production.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Glycogen</strong> - Glycogen deposits appear as clear spaces within cell cytoplasm but have a different morphology than cholesterol clefts and are not typically a prominent feature of atherosclerotic plaques. Glycogen is more commonly observed in glycogen storage diseases or in certain liver pathologies.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cholesterol clefts, appearing as characteristic needle-shaped empty spaces in histopathology, are hallmark features of advanced atherosclerotic plaques, representing crystalline cholesterol deposits that have been dissolved during tissue processing.</span></p>",

Rather, barrier methods like condoms provide contraception without altering tubal anatomy or function. While there are numerous documented risk factors for ectopic pregnancy including various contraceptive methods, condoms do not appear among these established risk factors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP)</strong>: Incorrect. Use of progestin-only pills or postcoital estrogen preparations increases the chance of tubal pregnancy, likely due to impaired tubal motility. OCPs can alter tubal function, potentially increasing risk when contraception fails.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intrauterine device (IUD)</strong>: Incorrect. IUDs are associated with increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. While they effectively prevent intrauterine pregnancy, they prevent tubal implantation to a lesser extent. There is a relative increase in tubal pregnancy (7 times more) should pregnancy occur with an IUD in situ. The relative risk varies by IUD type: Progestasert &gt; LNG-IUD &gt; Copper IUD.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Tubal ligation</strong>: Incorrect. This is a significant risk factor. There is a 15-50% chance of pregnancy being ectopic if conception occurs after sterilization failure. Tubal surgery (either for sterilization or fertility restoration) represents one of the highest risk factors for ectopic pregnancy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">While barrier methods like condoms have no effect on ectopic pregnancy risk, hormonal contraceptives, IUDs, and surgical procedures involving the fallopian tubes significantly increase the risk of ectopic implantation due to their effects on tubal function, anatomy, or motility.</span></p>",

The DIEP flap is a muscle-sparing flap, meaning it involves only the removal of skin, fat, and blood vessels (perforators), without taking any of the rectus abdominis muscle. This reduces the risk of post-operative abdominal weakness and complications, unlike the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, which includes muscle. Therefore, it is incorrect to refer to the DIEP flap as a myocutaneous flap because it does not include muscle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>DIEP is a myocutaneous flap: </strong>This statement is false. A myocutaneous flap includes muscle tissue, whereas the DIEP flap spares the rectus abdominis muscle, utilizing only the skin, fat, and perforator vessels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Pedicled TRAM based on superior epigastric artery: </strong>The pedicled TRAM flap stands for Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap. It relies on the superior epigastric artery for blood supply, which remains attached (pedicled) to its original source. The flap, including the rectus muscle, is tunneled under the skin to the chest to reconstruct the breast. This statement is accurate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Free TRAM based on inferior epigastric artery: </strong>The free TRAM flap involves the removal of a section of the abdominal tissue, including the rectus muscle, along with the inferior epigastric arteries. This flap is transplanted to the chest and connected to the chest's blood vessels using microsurgical techniques. This flap utilizes both the superior and inferior epigastric arteries. This statement is accurate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. DIEP based on deep inferior epigastric artery: </strong>The DIEP flap is similar to the free TRAM flap but does not involve the removal of the rectus muscle. Instead, it uses only the skin, fat, and perforator blood vessels based on the deep inferior epigastric artery. This design spares the abdominal muscles, reducing post-operative complications. This statement is accurate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The DIEP flap is a muscle-sparing flap used in breast reconstruction, involving the skin, fat, and blood vessels without including muscle tissue, which differentiates it from a myocutaneous flap like the TRAM flap.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/09/25/picture21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"296\"></span></p>",

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. B) Coiling</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The management of choice for aneurysms by interventional radiologists is coiling. This minimally invasive procedure involves the insertion of platinum coils into the aneurysm through an endovascular route. The coils promote clotting within the aneurysm, effectively reducing the risk of rupture and stabilizing the aneurysm.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Coiling is performed under the guidance of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which allows the radiologist to visualize the blood vessels and accurately place the coils within the aneurysm. This technique has become the gold standard for treating cerebral aneurysms due to its minimally invasive nature and high success rate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Clipping:</strong> This is a surgical procedure where a neurosurgeon places a clip at the neck of the aneurysm to prevent blood flow into it. While effective, it is more invasive than coiling and typically not performed by interventional radiologists.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Nimodipine:</strong> Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to prevent vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is not a treatment for aneurysms but a supportive therapy to prevent complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Angioplasty:</strong> Angioplasty is used to widen narrowed or obstructed blood vessels, often in cases of peripheral arterial disease. It is not a primary treatment for aneurysms.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Coiling is the preferred management for aneurysms performed by interventional radiologists, involving the insertion of coils to promote clotting and stabilize the aneurysm.</span></p>",
