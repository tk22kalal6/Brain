A) It is best tested in the fasting state on day 2 of menstrual cycle</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein secreted by the Sertoli cells in males and the granulosa cells of early antral follicles in females. It serves as a marker of ovarian reserve and is crucial in assessing fertility potential. Here are the reasons why option A is incorrect:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>AMH Testing:</strong> Unlike some other hormones, AMH does not require fasting and can be tested at any time during the menstrual cycle. The timing of testing AMH is not restricted to day 2 of the menstrual cycle as with some other reproductive hormone assessments.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Glycoprotein from granulosa cell of early antral follicle</strong>: This is a true statement. AMH is indeed a glycoprotein produced by the granulosa cells of early antral follicles in the ovaries.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Correlates with pregnancy rate of IVF cycles</strong>: This is also true. AMH levels correlate with ovarian reserve and can give an indication of the likelihood of a successful IVF cycle. Higher levels generally suggest a better response to ovarian stimulation and thus potentially higher pregnancy rates.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. It decreases sensitivity of the pre-antral follicles to FSH</strong>: This statement is correct. AMH reduces the sensitivity of pre-antral and small antral follicles to Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which is a mechanism to regulate follicle recruitment and maturation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) does not need to be tested in the fasting state or specifically on day 2 of the menstrual cycle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Ref: Page no 76, DC Dutta’s Textbook of Gynecology 6<sup>th</sup> edition</strong></span></p>",

Anemia and lowered tissue oxygen tension trigger the production of erythropoietin, which stimulates erythroid differentiation and leads to the appearance of increased numbers of erythroid precursors (normoblasts) in the marrow. This results in compensatory increases in erythropoiesis, leading to a prominent reticulocytosis in the peripheral blood.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Pulmonary edema and arrhythmias are some of the complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infection is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food and water. The organisms produce an enterotoxin known as cholera toxin (CT). It has 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B subunit (binding units) fixes to the GM1 ganglioside receptors on jejunal epithelial cells. The A subunit dissociates into the A2 fragment, which attaches the A1 fragment to the B subunit. This results in prolonged <strong>accumulation of cAMP,</strong> which causes an outpouring of large amounts of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. Ultimately, it results in profuse watery diarrhea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In addition to the cholera toxin, additional toxins such <u>as zona occludes toxin and accessory</u> <u>cholera toxin are also produced</u>.

Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), has unique properties among ARBs due to its partial agonistic activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma).

To answer this, let's break down each of the options:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Dopamine</strong> is a well-known neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is first converted to DOPA, which then converts to dopamine. Dopamine plays various roles in the brain, including involvement in reward, motivation, and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Serotonin</strong> (5-hydroxytryptamine) is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is then decarboxylated to form serotonin. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation, sleep, and other functions.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>GABA</strong> (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid glutamate. The conversion of glutamate to GABA involves a decarboxylation reaction that requires vitamin B6 as a cofactor. GABA plays a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Creatine</strong>, however, is not a neurotransmitter. While creatine is synthesized from the amino acids glycine, arginine, and methionine, it functions primarily as a molecule that helps to supply energy to cells, particularly muscle cells, by regenerating ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Creatine is not involved in neurotransmission.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Dopamine</strong>: Incorrect, because it is a neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tyrosine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Serotonin</strong>: Incorrect, because it is a neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid tryptophan.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. GABA</strong>: Incorrect, because it is a neurotransmitter derived from the amino acid glutamate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Creatine is not a neurotransmitter. It is a molecule that plays a key role in energy metabolism, particularly in muscle cells, but it does not function in neurotransmission.

Duration of TIA &gt; 5 mins:&nbsp;</strong>In the ABCD2 score, the duration of the TIA is an important factor. TIA lasting 10-59 minutes scores 1 point, and TIA lasting more than 60 minutes scores 2 points. Duration less than 10 minutes would score 0. However, since the option simply says \"Duration of TIA &gt; 5 mins,\" without specifying how much longer, it's less clearly defined in this question, but generally longer durations imply a higher score.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. SBP &gt; 140 mm Hg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg:&nbsp;</strong>High blood pressure at the time of TIA, defined as SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, scores 1 point in the ABCD2 score.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.
