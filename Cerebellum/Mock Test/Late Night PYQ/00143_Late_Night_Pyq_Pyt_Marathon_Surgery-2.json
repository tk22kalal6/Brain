Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In a thyroid storm, these hormone levels become dangerously elevated, leading to a wide range of symptoms and complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Symptoms of a thyroid storm may include:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">High fever</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Rapid and irregular heartbeat (tachycardia)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Elevated blood pressure</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Extreme agitation and restlessness</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Profuse sweating</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tremors and shaking</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Delirium or confusion</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Coma (in severe cases)</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Thyroid storms can be triggered by various factors, such as surgery, infection, trauma, or medication changes in individuals with underlying hyperthyroidism. The condition is more common in people with Graves' disease, a common cause of hyperthyroidism.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Treatment of a thyroid storm is a medical emergency and typically involves a combination of interventions to rapidly lower thyroid hormone levels, control symptoms, and support vital organ function.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The usual cause of thyroid storm in thyroidectomy is inadequate patient preparation before surgery.

Unlike decubitus ulcers, they result from venous hypertension rather than direct pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Arterial ulcer</strong> - Arterial (ischemic) ulcers occur at distal locations like toes and dorsum of foot. They are characteristically deep, severely painful, and associated with signs of peripheral vascular disease including brittle nails, sparse hair, and intermittent claudication. They stem from inadequate arterial perfusion rather than external pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Neuropathic ulcer</strong> - Neuropathic ulcers typically form on weight-bearing areas of the foot with characteristic \"punched out\" edges and surrounding callosity.

Medullary carcinoma: </strong>Medullary thyroid carcinoma originates from parafollicular C cells in the thyroid gland. These cells produce calcitonin, and the carcinoma often increases levels of this hormone. The tumor can appear as a firm mass in the neck. Histologically, it contains nests or sheets of cells in an amyloid stroma. It doesn't show the typical lymphocytic infiltration seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Clinical hypothyroidism is not a feature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: </strong>Rarely, the thyroid gland can be affected by primary thyroid lymphoma, which often arises in the setting of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, it would be differentiated by its histological appearance, with large numbers of lymphoid cells but lacking the characteristic features of Hashimoto's, such as Hurthle cells. Hypothyroidism is not a feature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Grave's disease: </strong>Grave's disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to overproduction of thyroid hormones. Symptoms might include weight loss, increased heart rate, tremors, and exophthalmos (bulging eyes). The histology of Grave's disease is characterized by tall, columnar epithelial cells and scalloped colloid, which is different from the described histological findings.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and increased sensitivity to cold.</span></p>",

Here's an analysis of the scenarios mentioned:</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In rare cases, liver transplantation might be considered for metastatic testicular cancer if it is isolated to the liver and the primary cancer is under control. Testicular cancer tends to have a better overall prognosis compared to many other cancers due to its high responsiveness to chemotherapy. If the metastasis is limited and other treatments have been effective, liver transplantation could be a potential option.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Melanoma</strong>: Liver transplantation is not typically recommended for metastatic melanoma due to the aggressive nature of the disease and the likelihood of widespread metastasis. Melanoma is known to respond poorly to immunosuppression, which is a requisite part of post-transplant care.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Breast Cancer (Ca breast)</strong>: Like melanoma, metastatic breast cancer is generally not considered suitable for liver transplantation. Breast cancer can metastasize to multiple organs, and the post-transplant immunosuppression regime can exacerbate the spread and recurrence of the cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Active Renal Cell Carcinoma (Active RCC)</strong>: RCC is typically resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation, and like melanoma and breast cancer, is generally not considered suitable for liver transplantation due to poor outcomes associated with the disease's aggressive nature and potential for widespread metastatic sites.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Liver transplantation for metastatic cancer is rare and generally only considered under specific conditions. These conditions typically include the isolation of metastasis to the liver, good control of the primary cancer, and a lack of other effective treatment options.

It has been shown to provide the highest percentage of excess weight loss compared to other bariatric procedures. BPD/DS achieves significant weight reduction by reducing the stomach size and bypassing a substantial portion of the small intestine, which limits calorie absorption. However, this procedure also has a higher risk of nutritional complications compared to other bariatric surgeries.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>B.

STSG is the preferred choice for covering a large, healing wound with healthy granulation tissue, such as a burn or degloving injury. It involves taking a thin layer of skin from a donor site and applying it to the wound. This type of graft covers large areas and is effective in promoting wound healing with adequate tissue coverage while maintaining flexibility. It is generally used on body areas where cosmesis is less of a priority compared to the face, which would require a full thickness graft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. &nbsp;Full thickness skin graft:</strong> This graft involves both the epidermis and the entire dermis and is typically used for areas requiring greater cosmetic outcomes, such as the face. It is not generally used for large wounds with healthy granulation tissue, as STSG would suffice and cover larger areas with a better healing outcome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. &nbsp;VAC dressing:</strong> Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressing is used for non-healing or chronic wounds that require additional stimulation for granulation tissue formation and wound contraction. It is not needed when the wound already has healthy granulation tissue and is progressing well in healing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. &nbsp;Flap:</strong> A flap is used when there is a need for bulk tissue to cover a deep or complex wound that involves structures like bone, tendons, or joints. Since the wound described has healthy granulation tissue and is not deep, a flap is unnecessary.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Split thickness skin grafts are the best choice for covering large, healthy granulating wounds, particularly in areas where cosmesis is not the primary concern.</span></p>",

This cream is used for second degree deep and third degree burns.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>B.</strong> <strong>Excision and Grafting</strong>: Excision and grafting are typically reserved for severe burn injuries that involve full-thickness damage to the skin and underlying tissues. In the case of a pink, oozing, and painful scald injury, which is likely partial-thickness, excision and grafting may be overly aggressive and not necessary.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>C.</strong> <strong>Paraffin Gauze Dressing</strong>: Paraffin gauze dressings are often used for burn wounds.

While this dressing may be suitable, collagen dressings (Option D) are better at promoting wound healing and tissue repair.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The best dressing for burn wounds is skin; collagen is a good substitute for skin, especially in partial-thickness burns. For full-thickness burns, sequential excision and grafting must be considered.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Initial treatment for burns includes cleaning the burnt areas and removing loose dead skin. Blisters are de-roofed and an appropriate dressing is applied.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Biological dressing (collagen dressings, amniotic membrane, etc.) is the preferred dressing material, especially in partial thickness burns.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If this is not available then a non-adhesive dressing like paraffin gauze impregnated with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream, colloidal silver, ionic silver cream, or silver nitrate cream may be applied. Since increased resistance to SSD has recently emerged, it should be used judiciously and reserved for deep dermal, full thickness, infected, and old neglected burns.</span></p>",

IHPS is caused by hypertrophy of the circular muscles of the pylorus, not the longitudinal muscles. This hypertrophy leads to an obstruction at the gastric outlet.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. It presents with non-bilious vomiting</strong>: This statement is correct. IHPS typically presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting. This is because the pyloric stenosis obstructs the gastric outlet, but it is located before the bile duct entry into the duodenum. Therefore, vomitus will not contain bile.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. USG is nearly 100% sensitive to detect IHPS</strong>: While ultrasonography (USG) is a highly sensitive and commonly used modality for the diagnosis of IHPS, stating that it is nearly \"100% sensitive\" may be an overstatement. However, for the purpose of the question, it is understood that USG is the preferred and very reliable method of diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Common metabolic condition seen is Hypokalemic alkalosis</strong>: This statement is correct. Prolonged vomiting due to IHPS leads to the loss of gastric acid. This results in a metabolic alkalosis. The kidneys compensate for this by excreting more potassium in the urine, leading to hypokalemia. Hence, the condition termed \"hypokalemic alkalosis\" is a common metabolic disturbance in IHPS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) involves hypertrophy of the circular muscles of the pylorus, leading to gastric outlet obstruction and presenting with non-bilious vomiting.
