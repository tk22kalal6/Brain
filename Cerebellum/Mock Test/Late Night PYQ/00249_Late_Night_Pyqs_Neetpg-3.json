D) It occurs at the junction of the anterior 1/3rd and posterior 2/3rd</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Singer's nodules (also called Screamer's nodes) appear symmetrically on the free edge of vocal cords at the junction of anterior one-third with posterior two-thirds. This specific location is the area of maximum vibration of the cord during phonation, making it subject to maximum trauma. They develop due to vocal abuse or misuse when a person speaks in unnatural low tones for prolonged periods or at high intensities.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Laser therapy is the treatment of choice:</strong> This is incorrect. Early cases of vocal nodules are treated conservatively through voice rest and speech therapy, especially in children. Surgery is only required for large nodules or nodules of long standing in adults. Even when surgery is indicated, it can be performed either with cold instruments or laser - neither being designated as the \"treatment of choice.\"</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Requires excision as it is potentially malignant:</strong> This is incorrect. Singer's nodules are non-neoplastic, benign lesions that form due to trauma from vocal abuse. They have no malignant potential. They develop through a process of submucosal edema and hemorrhage that undergoes hyalinization and fibrosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Most common symptom is pain:</strong> This is incorrect. Hoarseness is the most common complaint in patients with vocal nodules. Vocal fatigue and pain in the neck on prolonged phonation may occur as secondary symptoms, but they are not the primary presenting complaint.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Singer's nodules develop at the junction of anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3 of vocal cords due to vocal abuse, primarily causing hoarseness, and are initially managed with conservative treatment including voice rest and speech therapy.</span></p>",

This enzyme is critical in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, a precursor needed for the de novo synthesis of thymidylate (dTMP). By inhibiting DHFR, methotrexate leads to a decrease in thymine monophosphate (TMP), which is necessary for DNA synthesis and repair.

The extreme pain described is also more characteristic of MOE.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

The following are mature defense mechanisms-</span></p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Sublimation: Transformation of a socially unacceptable impulse into socially acceptable behaviour. E.g. A middle-aged man with unacceptable sexual desire becomes a painter and starts making nude paintings</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Anticipation: Preparing in advance for an unpleasant situation. E.g. A student plans all his arguments comprehensively before telling his father about a bad exam result.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Humour: Use of comedy to deal with an unpleasant situation. E.g&nbsp; Two medical students joked and laughed at themselves after getting humiliated by the examiner during the viva</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Altruism: Use of a social cause to deal with own emotions. E.g. After losing his son in an accident while driving drunk, a man launched an anti-drunk driving campaign, educating others about the dangers of driving under the influence.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Suppression: A voluntary decision not to think about an event for some time and avoid the accompanying emotions. E.g. A highly stressed medical student, facing an upcoming entrance exam, chooses to take a one-day break and doesnt think about the exam at all. It is the only voluntary/conscious defense mechanism</span></li></ol>",

This condition typically affects patients over 60 years of age, matching our elderly patient's demographic. The classic symptoms include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), regurgitation of undigested food (especially at night when recumbent), halitosis (bad breath), and cough with aspiration pneumonia (explaining the bilateral lung crepitations).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Visual Support</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Zenker's diverticulum occurs when herniation of pouch starts in the midline. It is at first behind the esophagus and then comes to lie on its left.

Plummer-Vinson Syndrome:</strong> This condition is characterized by hypochromic microcytic anemia, dysphagia, and esophageal webs. It typically affects women in their 40s and 50s, not elderly men.

Direct Bony Invasion</strong>: This is a common route of intracranial spread of middle ear infection. Cholesteatoma or chronic infection can erode the tegmen tympani (roof of middle ear), allowing infection to spread to the middle cranial fossa causing extradural or subdural abscess. Similarly, erosion of the posterior wall can lead to cerebellar abscess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Oval or Round Window</strong>: These are preformed pathways through which infection can spread from the middle ear to the inner ear (labyrinthitis), and then to the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle through the cochlear aqueduct or internal auditory canal. The subarachnoid space can be accessed through the cochlear aqueduct, which connects the scala tympani with the subarachnoid space.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Spread via Bloodstream</strong>: Hematogenous spread is another valid route where infection spreads through venous channels, particularly through emissary veins or by thrombophlebitis of the sigmoid sinus. This can lead to lateral sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or brain abscess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">While middle ear infections can spread to intracranial structures through direct bone erosion, preformed pathways (oval/round windows), and bloodstream, there is no lymphatic route for such spread since the brain lacks traditional lymphatics.</span></p>",

It involves an excessive accumulation of endolymph in the inner ear's membranous labyrinth, particularly affecting the cochlea. This condition causes sensorineural hearing loss (not conductive) because it affects the sensory hair cells in the cochlea. The hearing loss in Ménière's disease is typically fluctuating and predominantly affects the lower frequencies.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Otosclerosis</strong>: This condition causes conductive hearing loss. Otosclerosis involves abnormal bone formation around the stapes footplate, leading to its fixation in the oval window. This prevents normal transmission of sound vibrations from the middle ear to the inner ear, resulting in conductive hearing loss of up to 60 dB.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Serous otitis media</strong>: This condition causes conductive hearing loss. Also known as otitis media with effusion, it involves accumulation of non-purulent fluid in the middle ear space. This fluid impedes the movement of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain, resulting in conductive hearing loss typically ranging from 20-40 dB.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Suppurative otitis media</strong>: This condition causes conductive hearing loss. Acute or chronic suppurative otitis media involves infection of the middle ear with purulent discharge. The presence of pus in the middle ear and/or perforation of the tympanic membrane interferes with sound transmission, resulting in conductive hearing loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Endolymphatic hydrops (Ménière's disease) is an inner ear disorder causing sensorineural hearing loss, while conditions affecting the external or middle ear (otosclerosis, otitis media) cause conductive hearing loss by interfering with the mechanical transmission of sound to the inner ear.</span></p>",

These structures form during the 4th week of embryonic life and contribute to the development of facial structures. The disruption in development leads to the characteristic features of Goldenhar syndrome, including facial asymmetry, ear anomalies (microtia, anotia, preauricular tags or pits), vertebral anomalies, and ocular manifestations (epibulbar dermoids, colobomas).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. First and Second Branchial Pouches</strong> - Incorrect. While branchial pouches are involved in the development of structures in the head and neck region, Goldenhar syndrome specifically involves malformation of the branchial arches rather than the pouches. Branchial pouches give rise to structures such as the middle ear cavity, tonsils, and parathyroid glands.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

During a fugue, individuals often appear well-groomed and behave in a seemingly normal, goal-directed way, which reflects preserved self-care and orientation. However, once the fugue ends, they usually experience amnesia for what occurred during the episode. While in the fugue state, they might not even recognize anything is wrong and may deny memory issues. These episodes can last from minutes to months, and some individuals may have recurrent fugues. In DSM-5, dissociative fugue is considered a specifier of dissociative amnesia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Dissociative amnesia:</strong> This involves an inability to recall important personal information, usually related to trauma or stress, but it does not necessarily&nbsp; include the travel or wandering behavior seen in fugue states. In DSM-5, dissociative fugue has been made a subtype of dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Schizophrenia:</strong> People with schizophrenia may wander, but it’s typically disorganized or bizarre rather than purposeful. There are other signs also&nbsp; like hallucinations, delusions, or negative symptoms. The person’s well-groomed appearance and coherent behavior is&nbsp; against this diagnosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Dementia:</strong> Wandering can happen in dementia, but the onset is usually gradual, and the person often appears disheveled or confused. Dementia-related wandering stems from memory loss and impaired judgment, not dissociation. Plus, the sudden nature described in this case doesn't fit with how dementia typically presents.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If someone suddenly leaves home and ends up in a new place with intact self-care, normal-seeming behavior, and later has no memory of it, it must be dissociative fugu<strong>e</strong>—especially if there are no psychotic or neurocognitive symptoms present.</span></p>",
