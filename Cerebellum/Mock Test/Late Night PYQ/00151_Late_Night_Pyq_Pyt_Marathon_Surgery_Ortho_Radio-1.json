In PUJO, the obstruction occurs at the junction between the renal pelvis and the ureter, causing the pelvis to become disproportionately dilated compared to the calyces. This results in significant thinning of the renal tissue, which is evident in the image.

Due to functional deficiency of osteoclasts, calcified chondroid (cartilage) and primitive woven bone persists down into metaphysis and diaphysis, leading to osteosclerosis and increased brittleness of bones (marble bone disease). Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis is diagnosed in adult asymptomatic patients. It may present with mild anemia, pathological fractures premature osteoarthritis, and rarely osteomyelitis of mandible. Autosomal recessive malignant (congenital) osteopetrosis clinically presents at birth or in early infancy because of obliteration of marrow cavity by bony overgrowth resulting in inability of bone marrow to participate in hematopoiesis. Pancytopenia develops resulting in abnormal bleeding, easy bruising, progressive anemia, and failure to thrive. <strong>Laboratory parameters are serum calcium low, serum PTH high, serum phosphate low and serum ALP high. </strong>Radiological hallmark is increased radiopacity of bones. There is no distinction between cortical and cancellous bone, because intramedullary canal is filled with bone. Endobones (os in os or bone within bone appearance) and rugger jersey spine are seen on radiographs. Treatment is bone marrow transplant.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/24/screenshot-2024-01-23-195319.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"316\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Paget’s disease</strong>. It is characterized by <strong>excessive disorganized bone turnover, </strong>that encompasses excessive osteoclastic activity initially followed by disorganized excessive new bone formation. <strong>Osteoclast appears larger and irregular </strong>whereas <strong>osteoblast are relatively normal. </strong>The new bone formed is abnormal, very vascular and larger (deforms and fractures) than preexisting bone, which leads to cortical widening and deformity. The diagnostic histological feature of Paget's disease is irregular area of lamellar bone fitting together like a jigsaw with randomly distributed cement lines. Initial osteolytic phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascularization (Radiologically seen as advancing lytic wedge or <strong>blade of grass lesion). </strong>2nd phase of active bone formation and resorption replaces normal lamellar bone with structurally weak woven bone that bend, bow and fracture easily. In 3rd sclerotic (burnt out) phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to hard, dense, less vascular pagetic or <strong>mosaic bone</strong>. <strong>Most people are asymptomatic. </strong>The sites most commonly involved are <strong>pelvis</strong>, tibia, followed by skull, spine, clavicle and femur. It <strong>affects men (&gt; 50 years) more commonly.</strong> <strong>Pain is most common presenting symptom. </strong>Limb looks bent and feels thick, and skin is unduly warm due to high vascularity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/24/screenshot-2024-01-23-195330.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"316\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Blade of grass</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Hip fractures are most commonly seen in elderly females due to osteoporosis.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>",

The chronic phase of lipodermatosclerosis is characterized by well-defined, circumferential, thick, darkly pigmented, non-tender plaques. These plaques are described as having a firm, “woody” induration, and the sclerotic change with circumferential narrowing of the lower leg and concurrent proximal and distal edema, that produces the classic “inverted champagne bottle” appearance of the lower extremity. The rounded cork of the champagne bottle is symbolic of the edematous foot, the central fibrosis around the ankle represents the neck, and the bottle's body embodies the lymphedema proximal to the area of constriction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/03/26.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image shown in the question is called Popeye Sign, which is visible on elbow flexion due to bicipital tendonitis.</span></li></ul>",

This condition is often visualized as a \"slip\" on X-rays or CT scans. A characteristic sign is the \"beheaded dog\" or \"Scottish terrier sign,\" where the neck of the dog (representing the pars interarticularis) appears broken, indicating spondylolysis, which can lead to spondylolisthesis.

Melanoma</strong>. <strong>Melanoma</strong>, also known as&nbsp;<strong>malignant melanoma</strong>, is a type of&nbsp;cancer that develops from the&nbsp;pigment-producing cells known as&nbsp;<strong>melanocytes</strong>. Melanomas typically occur in the skin.&nbsp;In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back.&nbsp;About 25% of melanomas develop from&nbsp;moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or&nbsp;skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is&nbsp;ultraviolet light&nbsp;(UV) exposure in those with low levels of the&nbsp;skin pigment&nbsp;melanin.&nbsp;Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and&nbsp;poor immune function&nbsp;are at greater risk.&nbsp;Diagnosis is by&nbsp;biopsy. Using&nbsp;sunscreen&nbsp;and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma.&nbsp;Treatment is typically removal of the melanoma and potentially affected tissue (border around the melanoma) by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby&nbsp;lymph nodes&nbsp;may be tested for metastasis.&nbsp;For those in whom melanoma has spread,&nbsp;immunotherapy,&nbsp;biologic therapy,&nbsp;radiation therapy, or&nbsp;chemotherapy&nbsp;may improve survival.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Ochronosis</strong>. Ochronosis is named for the reddish-brown hue of tissue termed \"ochre-like\". It is inborn error of metabolism. Ochronosis is due to deposition of a phenolic compound – \"alkaptons\" polymerizing into connective tissue, leading to black urine disease called <strong>alkaptonuria</strong>. Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, alkaptonuria is an inactive gene, mapped on chromosome 3q21-23 coding for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD). The result is systemic sequestration of homogentisate, that upon the decay to benzoquinone, can irreversibly bind with collagen. Polymerization of this molecule takes on an iridescent dark hue, tinting affected tissue and turning urine black. Aside from just discoloration, these processes can cause degradation, degeneration, and developmental problems in all types of collagen. The earliest sign is from parents who notice infants’ diapers are&nbsp;black in color. This disease can be insidious and manifest later in life. Patients may&nbsp;present with back pain or large joint arthralgias in their post-teenage years or early 30s. Pigmentation of the sclera and pinna of the ear is often seen later in life. Constant tendon ruptures especially with minimal trauma. On physical examination, thickened Achilles tendon and bursa effusions are common. For alkaptonuria, a chromatography assay in the urine for homogentisate can be diagnostic, especially, if the color change is noted after being exposed to the air.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A genetic test can determine the existence of the autosomal recessive disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Rosai-Dorfman syndrome.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Rosai-Dorfman disease is a disease that occurs when the body produces too many histiocytes in the lymph nodes. These histiocytes accumulate in the cervical nodes most commonly. Histiocytes may also build up in the skin, upper respiratory tract, and sinuses. Rosai-Dorfman disease is seldom life-threatening. In many instances, the patient’s symptoms resolve on their own. The majority of patients experience enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. While often painless, these nodes can swell and grow rather larger. Swelling may also be reported in the lymph nodes of the groin, armpits, and in the central portion of the chest. This swelling may be accompanied by fever. The diagnosis is made following a tissue biopsy from the affected site. Though it is most commonly diagnosed in the first 10 years of life, it is also found in adults, affecting men and women equally.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image in the question shows extracellular metal deposits (black deposits) surrounded by inflammatory cells, suggestive of metallosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">It is associated with metal-on-metal prosthetic devices.</span></li></ul>",
