The yeast can colonize and infect these catheters, leading to systemic infections.

This characteristic tumbling motility is temperature-dependent - present at 25°C but absent at 37°C.

They are facultative anaerobes known for their hardiness and antibiotic resistance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;D. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</strong> - This is a Gram-positive bacillus that can sometimes appear as short filaments. While it can cause infections in humans, particularly erysipeloid (a localized skin infection), it does not exhibit the tumbling motility characteristic of Listeria. It is primarily associated with infections acquired through occupational exposure to infected animals.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Listeria monocytogenes is uniquely characterized by its temperature-dependent tumbling motility, which serves as a critical diagnostic feature when identifying this foodborne pathogen that causes severe infections, particularly in pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals.</span></p>",

Rose Waaler Test</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><br>The Rose Waaler Test is not a heterophile agglutination test but rather an autoantibody test used to detect rheumatoid factor. It involves sheep erythrocytes coated with a subagglutinating dose of anti-erythrocyte antibody that are used as antigen in an agglutination test. This test detects autoantibodies (Rheumatoid Factor) that react with the Fc fragment of IgG, making it fundamentally different from heterophile tests that involve cross-reactive antigens between different species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Paul-Bunnell Test</strong> - This IS a heterophile agglutination test. It's used in infectious mononucleosis to detect heterophile antibodies that agglutinate sheep or horse red blood cells. These antibodies develop in response to EBV infection but cross-react with antigens on these animal erythrocytes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Weil-Felix Test</strong> - This IS a heterophile agglutination test. It detects antibodies in rickettsial infections that cross-react with antigens of Proteus vulgaris bacteria, demonstrating shared epitopes between the different species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Cold Agglutination Test</strong> - This IS a heterophile agglutination test used in primary atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma pneumoniae). It detects antibodies that cause agglutination of human erythrocytes at low temperatures through cross-reactive mechanisms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Heterophile agglutination tests involve antibodies produced against one organism that cross-react with antigens of unrelated organisms due to shared epitopes, while the Rose Waaler test detects autoantibodies specific to self-immunoglobulins.</span></p>",

H. ducreyi is extremely fastidious and requires more specialized media such as chocolate agar with isovitalex X for optimal recovery. H. Influenza requires Blood agar supplemented with X and V factors for its growth.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

The cholera toxin (2 subunits – A &amp; B) does not enter the intestinal cells directly; instead, it binds to the GM1 ganglioside receptor on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. This binding facilitates the entry of the toxin into the cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Once inside the cell, the cholera toxin activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP levels cause the inhibition of sodium absorption and an increase in chloride and water secretion into the intestinal lumen. This results in the characteristic watery diarrhea of cholera.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Aplastic anemia</strong> is typically seen in patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell disease, who develop transient aplastic crises due to parvovirus B19 infection. The virus targets erythroid progenitor cells, leading to a temporary cessation of red blood cell production.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

This clinical presentation strongly suggests sporotrichosis, which is caused by <i>Sporothrix schenckii</i>. Sporotrichosis is frequently encountered in gardeners, forest workers and manual laborers, with the sub-Himalayan hilly areas being an endemic region in India.

Trichophyton rubrum</strong>: Incorrect because <i>T. rubrum</i> is a dermatophyte that causes superficial mycoses like tinea (ringworm) infections. It typically presents with circular, dry, erythematous, scaly, and itchy lesions rather than ulcers. Dermatophytoses don't typically progress to form multiple ulcers as described in this case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Cudotrichum species</strong>: This genus is not a known human pathogen causing subcutaneous or cutaneous infections with the presentation described.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Aspergillus</strong>: Incorrect because <i>Aspergillus</i> species predominantly cause respiratory infections (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, or invasive aspergillosis) or superficial infections like otomycosis. They don't typically cause multiple cutaneous ulcers in immunocompetent individuals, especially not in the pattern described for this farmer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Sporotrichosis is a chronic subcutaneous mycosis caused by <i>Sporothrix schenckii</i> that frequently affects agricultural workers and presents as noduloulcerative lesions along lymphatics (lymphocutaneous form) following minor trauma, with the sub-Himalayan region being an endemic area for this infection in India.</p>",

It typically presents as budding yeasts and pseudohyphae rather than branching rods, making it an incorrect option for this diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Sporotrichosis:</strong> This is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, which presents with ulcerative lesions along lymphatic channels. It does not appear as gram-positive filamentous rods, making it inconsistent with the given microscopic findings.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Histoplasma:</strong> Histoplasma is a dimorphic fungus that appears as intracellular yeast forms within macrophages. It does not have the filamentous, branching rod structure observed in this case, eliminating it as a possible answer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In cases involving subcutaneous infections with gram-positive filamentous rods and branching, consider Nocardia as the responsible organism, particularly in the context of actinomycetoma.</span></p>",

This impairs the killing of certain bacteria and fungi.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Catalase-positive organisms:</strong> These organisms can neutralize hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species that the host cells might produce. Catalase-positive bacteria include <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, <i>Aspergillus species</i>, <i>Nocardia</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas</i>.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Recurrent Infections:</strong> Patients with CGD frequently suffer from recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms due to their inability to effectively kill these pathogens.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.
