A) Beta hCG</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The correct answer is <strong>Beta hCG</strong> (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin). Beta hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. In the context of an ectopic pregnancy, which is a pregnancy located outside the uterine cavity (commonly in the fallopian tubes), the measurement of Beta hCG levels is crucial for diagnosis and management.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Beta hCG</strong>: In a normal intrauterine pregnancy, Beta hCG levels typically double every 48-72 hours. In ectopic pregnancies, these levels usually rise more slowly. Additionally, Beta hCG levels are used to determine the mode of management for unruptured ectopic pregnancies (medical, surgical, or expectant management) and to assess the discriminatory zone, which is the level of Beta hCG at which an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on ultrasound.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Estradiol</strong>: This is a form of estrogen, a hormone involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, but it is not a marker for ectopic pregnancy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Progesterone</strong>: This hormone supports the early stages of pregnancy by preparing the uterine lining for implantation, but it is not specifically used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Estriol</strong>: Another form of estrogen produced during pregnancy, it is not used as a marker for ectopic pregnancy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Beta hCG&nbsp;</strong>is the primary marker used to diagnose and manage ectopic pregnancies, providing essential information about pregnancy location and viability.</span></p>",

This is because the thyroid gland is anatomically located in the neck, and even when a goiter extends behind the sternum into the chest, the neck provides the most direct and least invasive access for surgical removal. The retrosternal portion of the goiter can usually be mobilized and delivered into the neck for excision without the need for more invasive thoracic approaches. The vascular supply of the goiter also predominantly comes from cervical vessels like the inferior thyroid artery, making the neck approach feasible and effective.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Congenital Glaucoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Congenital Glaucoma&nbsp;</strong>is a rare condition that can occur in babies and young children. It's caused by an abnormal development of the eye's drainage system, leading to increased intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve. Symptoms can include photophobia, excessive tearing (lacrimation), and cloudy, enlarged corneas. Given the symptoms&nbsp; described, congenital glaucoma is a likely diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)</strong>: This is a group of metabolic disorders caused by the absence or malfunctioning of lysosomal enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans. While MPS can affect the eyes, leading to problems like corneal clouding and glaucoma, the key symptoms often include developmental delay, skeletal and joint abnormalities, and coarse facial features. Eye-related symptoms are typically not the first presenting symptoms in MPS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Congenital Cataract</strong>: This refers to a clouding of the lens of the eye that is present at birth. Congenital cataracts can cause a variety of symptoms including a noticeable white, grey, or yellow spot in the pupil, nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movements), and yes, potentially photophobia. However, lacrimation (excessive tearing) is not a typical symptom of cataracts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Ophthalmia Neonatorum</strong>: This condition is a form of conjunctivitis that occurs in newborns. Typically, it's caused by bacteria acquired during passage through the birth canal from an infected mother. The primary symptoms include redness of the eyes, swelling of the eyelids, and discharge, which may be watery or pus-like. Photophobia can be a symptom, but it's not as common as in some other conditions like congenital glaucoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Congenital Glaucoma should be suspected in infants presenting with photophobia, excessive tearing, and cloudy, enlarged corneas, as it is due to the abnormal development of the eye's drainage system leading to increased intraocular pressure.</span></p>",
