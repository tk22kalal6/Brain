The more severe form of the condition is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Enzyme immunoassay to detect glutamate dehydrogenase is less specific compared to toxin detection for diagnosis. So a combination of the two can be used for diagnostic confirmation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The condition is most commonly <strong>associated with prolonged antimicrobial use</strong>, which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The <i><strong>most commonly implicated antibiotics are</strong></i> <i><strong>cephalosporins, ampicillin, and clindamycin</strong></i>. The spores are spread by contact with the feces of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins-toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation. The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plagues initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. It contains necrotic leukocytes, fibrin, and cellular debris. The anamnestic IgG response determines which patients develop the disease or remain asymptomatic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. <strong>The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical criteria and detection of toxin or the organism in stool samples. </strong>This can be done by <u>nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PC) or by culture.</u></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Discontinuation of any ongoing antimicrobials and adequate hydration are general measures that are recommended.

B) Hyperpolarization, decrease in neurotransmitter release</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The retina responds to light by initiating a process called phototransduction, which converts light energy into an electrical signal. This process involves the activation of rods and cones, which are the photoreceptor cells in the retina.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In the dark, the cGMP gated channels in the photoreceptor cells are open, allowing a steady release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate. However, when light falls on the retina, a series of biochemical reactions occur, leading to the conversion of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal. This process activates transducin, which is a G protein-coupled receptor with phosphodiesterase activity, resulting in the breakdown of cGMP. As a result of the decrease in cGMP levels, sodium channels close, causing hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hyperpolarization leads to a decrease in glutamate release, which ultimately triggers the formation of an action potential. This process enables the transmission of visual information from the photoreceptor cells to the brain, allowing us to perceive and interpret visual images.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Hyperpolarization, increase in neurotransmitter release: </strong>This is incorrect because hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells leads to a decrease, not an increase, in neurotransmitter release.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Depolarization, decrease in neurotransmitter release: </strong>This is incorrect because light exposure causes hyperpolarization, not depolarization, of photoreceptor cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Depolarization, increase in neurotransmitter release: </strong>This is also incorrect as it suggests the opposite response of photoreceptors to light. Depolarization and increased neurotransmitter release occur in the absence of light (i.e., in the dark).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Light exposure results in the hyperpolarization of photoreceptor cells in the retina, leading to a decrease in the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.

The risk of infection is typically the lowest in clean wounds.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Dirty</strong>: These wounds involve the presence of pus or perforated viscera. This kind of wound shows evidence of a bacterial infection or major contamination prior to surgery. Dirty wounds are at high risk of developing postoperative infections.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Greater auricular nerve</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The greater auricular nerve is a sensory nerve that supplies the skin of the external ear, the area over the parotid gland, and the angle of the mandible. It is a branch of the cervical plexus, specifically arising from the cervical spinal nerves C2 and C3. Any acute inflammation of the gland such as acute sialadenitis results in pain in the preauricular region. The pain is mainly due to stretching of the capsule resulting in stimulation of the greater auricular nerve.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Facial nerve</strong>: The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) traverses through the parotid gland but does not innervate it. Instead, it provides motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression.

Investing layer of deep cervical fascia</strong>: This is a layer of connective tissue that envelops the neck and extends into the face. It surrounds several structures, including the parotid gland.

Auriculotemporal nerve</strong>: This is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3).

IgG2 plays a critical role in the immune system's ability to fight off encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis.

IgG1 is transported most efficiently across the placenta, providing early defense against infection in neonates. IgG2, despite being critical for defense against encapsulated bacteria, has less transplacental movement, which can influence the susceptibility to infections in early infancy before the infant's own immune system fully matures.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Early identification and management of specific immunoglobulin deficiencies are crucial to prevent recurrent infections and their complications in young children.</span></p>",

Dog ears occur when there are unequal wound edges or improper wound closure angles. The procedure involves excising the excess triangular skin fold at a 45-degree angle (as shown in panel 1), then removing the redundant tissue (panel 2), and finally achieving a flat, cosmetically acceptable closure (panel 3). The interrupted sutures shown are typical for this correction. This bunching of tissue resembles a dog's ear, hence the name. The technique ensures a smooth, flat scar without protruding tissue at the wound ends.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_qBRUOuc.png\" width=\"574\" height=\"454\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.
