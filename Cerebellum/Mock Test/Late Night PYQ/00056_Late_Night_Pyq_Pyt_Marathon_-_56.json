FAS is characterized by several key features, including facial anomalies, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and growth deficiencies.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Facial Anomalies:</strong> The classic facial features of FAS include small eye openings (narrow palpebral fissures), a smooth philtrum (the area between the nose and upper lip), and a thin upper lip. Other features may include epicanthic folds, a flattened nasal bridge, a short nose, low-set and unparallel ears, and midfacial hypoplasia.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>CNS Dysfunction:</strong> This includes microcephaly (small head size), mental retardation, and neurobehavioral abnormalities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The presence of microcephaly is a common finding in FAS, reflecting the overall poor brain growth and development.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Thinning of Corpus Callosum:</strong> FAS can lead to structural brain abnormalities such as thinning or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, which is the band of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Holoprosencephaly:</strong> This is a severe brain malformation where the forebrain fails to divide into two hemispheres, which can be seen in more severe cases of FAS.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Macrocephaly (enlarged head size)&nbsp;</strong>is not a feature of FAS.

The core components of KMC include:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Skin-to-skin contact:</strong> The baby is placed between the mother's breasts in an upright position. The baby's hips are abducted and flexed in a \"frog position,\" and the arms are also flexed. This close contact helps regulate the baby's temperature, breathing, and heart rate.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Exclusive breastfeeding:</strong> KMC promotes exclusive breastfeeding, which is crucial for the baby's nutrition and immune protection.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Early discharge and ambulatory care:</strong> KMC supports the early discharge of stable low birthweight infants from the hospital, allowing continued care at home with close follow-up.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">These components are fundamental to the success of KMC, leading to improved survival rates and health outcomes for low birthweight infants.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.
