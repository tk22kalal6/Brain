Once ruptured, the vesicles transform into erosions and ulcers with polycyclic margins, characteristic of herpes labialis.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A history of fever is important as it often triggers these outbreaks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">On a Tzanck smear, the characteristic finding for Herpes labialis is the presence of <strong>multinucleated giant cells and acantholytic cells</strong>. These multinucleate giant cells are formed by the fusion of infected cells, leading to the appearance of multiple nuclei within a single cell.

B) Liver gluconeogenesis increases</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">During prolonged fasting, liver gluconeogenesis actually doesn't increase compared to short-term fasting (12-36 hours). As fasting progresses, the body adapts to spare protein by decreasing the rate of gluconeogenesis. While gluconeogenesis remains active to supply glucose for glucose-dependent tissues, the overall rate doesn't increase because peripheral tissues decrease their glucose demands. The brain increasingly switches to using ketone bodies for energy (up to ~60% of its needs), which reduces the demand for glucose produced by gluconeogenesis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Brain utilization of ketone bodies increases:</strong> This is correct. During prolonged fasting, the brain adapts to using ketone bodies for its energy needs, reducing its dependence on glucose. This is a critical adaptation that helps spare body protein by reducing the need for gluconeogenesis from amino acids.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Urea production rate decreases</strong>: This is correct. As fasting progresses, protein breakdown decreases to conserve vital protein stores. This results in decreased amino acid catabolism, leading to lower rates of urea production and excretion compared to short-term fasting.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option D. Blood glucose production declines</strong>: This is correct. Total glucose production decreases during prolonged fasting compared to short-term fasting. This is due to adaptations including increased ketone body utilization by the brain and other tissues becoming more efficient at using fatty acids as fuel.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">During prolonged fasting, the body prioritizes protein conservation by reducing the rate of gluconeogenesis, while simultaneously increasing ketone body production and utilization, particularly by the brain, leading to an overall decline in glucose production compared to shorter periods of fasting.</span></p>",

Normal vaginal discharge varies throughout the menstrual cycle due to hormonal changes. The discharge increases during specific times such as around ovulation (due to peak rise of estrogen increasing secretory activity of cervical glands) and premenstrually (due to pelvic congestion and increased mucus secretion from hypertrophied endometrial glands). This cyclical pattern is a normal physiological response to hormonal fluctuations.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Foul smelling</strong>: This is incorrect. Normal physiological vaginal discharge is not foul smelling. Foul odor is typically associated with pathological conditions such as bacterial vaginosis which produces a fishy odor (positive whiff test with KOH) or trichomoniasis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Dirty white in color</strong>: This is incorrect. Normal physiological vaginal discharge is described as colorless or white, not dirty white. Dirty white or gray-white discharge is more characteristic of bacterial vaginosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Adherent to the vaginal wall</strong>: This is incorrect. While normal discharge may coat the vaginal walls, discharge that is specifically described as \"adherent to the vaginal wall\" is a characteristic feature of bacterial vaginosis (homogenous white discharge that coats the vaginal walls), not physiological discharge.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Characteristics of Normal Vaginal Discharge</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Normal physiological vaginal discharge is:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Colorless/white</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Non-odorous</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">pH around 4.0 in reproductive age</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cyclical in nature related to menstrual cycle phases</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Contains secretions from vulvar glands, vaginal glands, vaginal transudate and secretions from the cervix, endometrium and fallopian tubes</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Contains normal flora including Lactobacilli, Streptococci, Staphylococci</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Shows desquamated epithelial cells, WBCs and Lactobacilli on microscopy</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Physiological vaginal discharge has a distinct cyclical pattern throughout the menstrual cycle, with increased secretion during ovulation and premenstrual periods, reflecting the normal hormonal fluctuations of the reproductive system.</span></p>",

More than 1000 distinct causative mutations in the FBN1 gene have been found. Fibrillin is secreted by fibroblasts and is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix. These microfibrils serve as scaffolds for the deposition of tropoelastin, an integral component of elastic fibers. The abnormal fibrillin protein acts as a dominant negative, preventing the assembly of normal microfibrils.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

A key finding in this condition is the presence of <strong>hypopyon</strong>, which is the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the eye, settling at the bottom.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Key clinical signs of Acute Anterior Uveitis</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> includes:</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">1.

Loss of myelin sheath</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily characterized by the autoimmune-mediated demyelination of central nervous system neurons. The myelin sheath is crucial for proper and fast electrical conduction along nerve fibers; it facilitates saltatory conduction, which allows the action potential to jump rapidly from one node of Ranvier to the next. The loss of this myelin sheath in MS results in significantly slowed and disrupted nerve signal conduction, which underlies many of the neurological symptoms associated with the disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.
