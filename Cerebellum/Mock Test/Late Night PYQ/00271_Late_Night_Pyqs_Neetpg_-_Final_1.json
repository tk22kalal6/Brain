This specific location is the area of maximum vibration of the cord during phonation, making it subject to maximum trauma. They develop due to vocal abuse or misuse when a person speaks in unnatural low tones for prolonged periods or at high intensities.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Laser therapy is the treatment of choice:</strong> This is incorrect. Early cases of vocal nodules are treated conservatively through voice rest and speech therapy, especially in children. Surgery is only required for large nodules or nodules of long standing in adults. Even when surgery is indicated, it can be performed either with cold instruments or laser - neither being designated as the \"treatment of choice.\"</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Requires excision as it is potentially malignant:</strong> This is incorrect. Singer's nodules are non-neoplastic, benign lesions that form due to trauma from vocal abuse. They have no malignant potential. They develop through a process of submucosal edema and hemorrhage that undergoes hyalinization and fibrosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Most common symptom is pain:</strong> This is incorrect. Hoarseness is the most common complaint in patients with vocal nodules. Vocal fatigue and pain in the neck on prolonged phonation may occur as secondary symptoms, but they are not the primary presenting complaint.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Singer's nodules develop at the junction of anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3 of vocal cords due to vocal abuse, primarily causing hoarseness, and are initially managed with conservative treatment including voice rest and speech therapy.</span></p>",

These unmyelinated fibers create what's known as \"slow\" or \"protopathic\" pain, which is characterized as deep, visceral, aching, and diffuse.

The use of positive pressure from bag and mask ventilation can exacerbate the displacement of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defect, potentially worsening respiratory distress and leading to further compromise of pulmonary function. This method of ventilation can increase the risk of pneumothorax, gastric distention, and further reduce lung volume, which is already compromised in CDH.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is also appropriate in these scenarios to ensure that airway pressure is managed carefully to avoid exacerbating the hernia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intubation</strong>: This is the preferred method for securing the airway in a neonate with a scaphoid abdomen when CDH is suspected.

Opting for intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation instead of bag &amp; mask ventilation is crucial to prevent further complications and stabilize the infant's condition. Properly securing the airway and ensuring adequate ventilation without increasing the risk of further pulmonary or gastrointestinal injury is essential in the initial management of these patients.</span></p>",

These terms describe tissue necrosis with ulceration resulting from prolonged pressure that exceeds capillary occlusion pressure (over 30mmHg), leading to tissue anoxia and breakdown. They occur in areas where bony prominences create sustained pressure against soft tissues, particularly in bedridden or immobile patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Venous ulcer</strong> - Venous ulcers have distinct characteristics, typically appearing above the medial malleolus in the \"Gaiter's area.\" They present as shallow ulcers associated with other signs of venous insufficiency such as hyperpigmentation, dermatitis, and varicosities. Unlike decubitus ulcers, they result from venous hypertension rather than direct pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Arterial ulcer</strong> - Arterial (ischemic) ulcers occur at distal locations like toes and dorsum of foot. They are characteristically deep, severely painful, and associated with signs of peripheral vascular disease including brittle nails, sparse hair, and intermittent claudication. They stem from inadequate arterial perfusion rather than external pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option C. Neuropathic ulcer</strong> - Neuropathic ulcers typically form on weight-bearing areas of the foot with characteristic \"punched out\" edges and surrounding callosity. They develop due to sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy (commonly in diabetic patients) rather than from external pressure. The painless nature of these ulcers distinguishes them from decubitus ulcers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pressure sores (decubitus ulcers) result from sustained pressure exceeding tissue perfusion pressure, causing ischemia and necrosis predominantly at bony prominences like the ischium, greater trochanter, and sacrum in immobile patients.</p>",

While important for oxygen transport, this is distinct from the Haldane effect.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;c.

Key diagnostic features present in this case include: extreme pain in the external ear, otorrhea unresponsive to antibiotics, presence of granulation tissue in the external ear canal, bony erosion, facial nerve palsy, and importantly, a diabetic patient. MOE is primarily caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and occurs most commonly in elderly diabetic patients or immunocompromised individuals.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma</strong>: This typically presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, conductive hearing loss due to eustachian tube dysfunction, and cranial nerve palsies (particularly CN V and VI) from skull base invasion. Primary symptoms would be in the nasopharynx rather than the external ear, and there would not be granulation tissue in the external ear canal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Chronic suppurative otitis media</strong>: This involves a long-standing infection of the middle ear with tympanic membrane perforation and persistent discharge. While it can cause bone erosion and complications like facial palsy, it wouldn't present with granulation tissue in the external ear canal as the primary site of disease is the middle ear. The extreme pain described is also more characteristic of MOE.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Acute suppurative otitis media</strong>: This is an acute infection of the middle ear presenting with otalgia, fever, and sometimes otorrhea if the tympanic membrane ruptures. It doesn't cause bony erosion or facial nerve palsy in its typical presentation, and would generally respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy, unlike the case described.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Malignant otitis externa should be strongly suspected in elderly diabetic patients presenting with severe otalgia, otorrhea unresponsive to therapy, granulation tissue in the ear canal, and complications like facial nerve palsy or evidence of bony erosion.</span></p>",

Cretinism has been almost completely eliminated in developed countries by early diagnosis by newborn screening schemes and iodine supplementation programs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Intermittent breaking of long bones in children is a feature of osteogenesis imperfecta.</span></li></ul>",

The goal is to reduce the harm associated with opioid use, such as the risks of HIV, Hepatitis, and illegal activities related to drug procurement. In OST, opioids like <strong>buprenorphine or methadone</strong> are used to replace more harmful opioids like heroin or morphine. These substitutions help control withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse while allowing the patient to live a more stable life. Buprenorphine, being a partial opioid agonist, is preferred because it reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms without the euphoric effects associated with other opioids, making it an effective substitute in OST.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.
