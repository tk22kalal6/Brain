A fistula in ano is an abnormal connection between the interior of the anal canal and the perianal skin. It often presents as a recurrent swelling or abscess near the anal verge, which may drain spontaneously. The key clues include the location of the swelling near the anal verge and the history of recurrent discharge, making it characteristic of a fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Pilonidal Sinus:&nbsp;</strong>A pilonidal sinus is typically found in the upper part of the natal cleft, far from the anal verge, and is associated with hair follicles in the gluteal region. It commonly affects young men with a hairy back and is located above the coccyx, not near the anus. The key distinction is the location; pilonidal sinuses are not found at the anal verge but higher up in the gluteal cleft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"304\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Fissure in Ano:&nbsp;</strong>A fissure in ano is a linear tear in the lining of the anus, usually caused by trauma or hard stools. It presents with pain during defecation and bright red bleeding but not with a swelling or external opening as seen in fistula in ano. There may be a hypertrophic skin tag covering it (Sentinel pile). Fissures do not have a history of recurrent discharge or a swelling appearance near the anal verge.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120048.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"260\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemorrhoids:&nbsp;</strong>Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus and typically present with painless bleeding, itching, and swelling inside the anal canal or at the anal verge. They do not present with the external openings, recurrent abscesses, or discharging sinuses characteristic of fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120109.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"361\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fistula in Ano should be considered when there is a history of recurrent swelling, abscess formation, or discharge near the anal verge. It is distinguished from pilonidal sinus by its lower location near the anal canal, as opposed to pilonidal sinuses that occur higher up in the natal cleft.</span></p>",

D) Mutation of tRNA</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The correct answer is <strong>Mutation of tRNA</strong>. A suppressor mutation, specifically a <strong>tRNA mutation</strong>, can reverse the effect of an earlier mutation that produced a premature stop codon. In this scenario, the tRNA undergoes a mutation that allows it to recognize the stop codon (UAA in this case) as if it were a normal codon (e.g., serine's codon UCA). This suppressor tRNA can then insert an amino acid at the site of the stop codon, allowing protein synthesis to continue. This compensates for the earlier mutation that would have led to a truncated, non-functional protein, thereby restoring the wild-type phenotype.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/31/whatsapp-image-2024-08-31-at-12858-pm.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"313\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/31/screenshot-2024-08-31-170152.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"274\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Frameshift mutation of coding gene</strong>: This type of mutation typically disrupts the reading frame of the gene, leading to widespread changes in the amino acid sequence from the point of mutation onward. It usually results in a non-functional protein and does not suppress the effects of another mutation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Addition of another normal gene</strong>: While adding a normal gene might help correct a phenotype by introducing a functional version of the gene, it does not qualify as a suppressor mutation. This option does not specifically address the reversal of a mutation at the molecular level in the same way as tRNA mutation does.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Deletion of the mutant gene</strong>: Deleting the mutant gene would remove the mutation but would not revert the phenotype to wild type by itself. It eliminates the gene's effect entirely rather than compensating for the mutation within the gene or another gene.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Suppressor mutations, particularly those in tRNA, can reverse the effects of a previous mutation by allowing protein synthesis to continue even when a premature stop codon is present, thereby restoring the normal (wild-type) phenotype.</span></p>",

This type of visual field loss is consistent with the right visual field information being interrupted after the optic chiasma, which would affect the right visual field in both eyes.The optic tracts carry visual information after it has crossed at the optic chiasma. A lesion in the left optic tract would lead to a loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes (homonymous hemianopia). This is because the left optic tract carries information from the right half of the visual field of each eye.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

This typically occurs with pituitary tumors that compress the chiasma from below.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Optic Radiation</strong>: The optic radiation carries visual information from the thalamus to the visual cortex. A lesion in the optic radiation can also lead to homonymous hemianopia. The specific location within the optic radiation (e.g., Meyer's loop) can lead to more specific deficits like a superior quadrantanopia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Understanding the visual pathway is critical for localizing lesions based on patterns of visual field loss.

Alcohol</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chronic alcohol consumption is the leading cause of chronic pancreatitis. Excessive alcohol intake can lead to repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, eventually resulting in chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of pancreatic function. Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis often presents with pain, malabsorption (leading to steatorrhea), and diabetes mellitus due to the destruction of insulin-producing cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Gallstones: </strong>When they travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they can block the pancreatic duct, leading to inflammation of the pancreas, termed acute pancreatitis. While gallstones are a common cause of acute pancreatitis, they are not the predominant cause of chronic pancreatitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Autoimmune: </strong>Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a type of chronic pancreatitis caused by an autoimmune reaction against the pancreatic tissue. It can be part of the spectrum of IgG4-related disease. The pancreas may become enlarged and look like a tumor on imaging studies. AIP might present with jaundice, weight loss, and the aforementioned pancreatic enlargement. Treatment usually involves corticosteroids to suppress the immune response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Drugs: </strong>Some drugs are known to cause pancreatitis. While the incidence is generally low, drug-induced pancreatitis can turn chronic if the offending medication isn't identified and discontinued. Common culprits include diuretics like furosemide and thiazides, certain antiretroviral drugs, and some antiepileptics like valproic acid, among others.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chronic alcohol consumption is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, leading to repeated inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of pancreatic function over time.</span></p>",

This increased pressure causes the left atrium to dilate. This dilation can be identified on a chest X-ray as enlargement of the left atrial silhouette.
