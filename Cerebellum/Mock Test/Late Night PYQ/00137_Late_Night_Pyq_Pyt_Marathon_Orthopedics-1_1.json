Lisfranc fracture.&nbsp;</strong>A Lisfranc dislocation is a spectrum of injuries involving the tarsometatarsal joints of the foot. The Lisfranc joint is composed of the articulation between the first, second, and third metatarsals&nbsp;bones, and the cuneiform bones. Injury of the joint can range from complete tarsometatarsal displacement with associated fractures and ligamentous tears to partial sprains with no displacement. Lisfranc injuries are uncommon and are often misdiagnosed. Even when recognized and treated promptly, there is still a high risk for chronic disability and complications. There are two main mechanisms of injury: direct, and indirect. A direct mechanism occurs as a crush injury to the joint from motor vehicle collision or industrial accident. An indirect injury is more common and is often associated with sports participation involving a longitudinal force with the foot in plantarflexion with a medial or lateral rotational force. The patient presents with complaint of midfoot pain with weight-bearing, following an acute injury. The pain worsens by forefoot weight bearing, and the patient may describe pain or difficulty with the push-off phases of walking and/or running. There is pain with abduction and eversion of the forefoot. Pain can also commonly be reproduced with passive pronation or supination of the tarsometatarsal joint. Radiographic findings show misalignment of the lateral margin of the first metatarsal base with the lateral edge of the medial cuneiform, misalignment of the medial aspect of the second metatarsal base with the medial edge of the middle cuneiform, and/or small avulsion fragments a one of metatarsal or cuneiform bones. On oblique view, the medial aspect of the cuboid should line up with the medial aspect of the fourth metatarsal base. The dorsal cortex of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform should be aligned on the lateral radiographs.&nbsp;Lisfranc injuries can be managed operatively.&nbsp;Initial treatment includes reduction, splinting, and elevation.&nbsp;After six weeks, if the patient is non-tender and radiographs are negative, then begin weight-bearing and rehabilitation. If there is any tenderness but no displacement, then the patient should be in a boot or cast for at least another four weeks before starting rehabilitation. Any displacement requires surgical fixation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/17/picture1_fqIXgzu.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"292\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Jones fracture.&nbsp;</strong>A&nbsp;<strong>Jones fracture&nbsp;</strong>is a fracture of the proximal metadiaphyseal junction of the fifth&nbsp;metatarsal&nbsp;bone that involves the 4<sup>th</sup>-5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;metatarsal articulation. The fracture occurs as a result of significant adduction force to the forefoot with the ankle in plantar flexion. On a plain radiograph, Jones fracture is located at the metadiaphyseal junction, approximately 2 cm (1.5-3 cm) from the tip of the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;metatarsal and has a predominantly horizontal course. It should not extend distally. Jones fractures are particularly prone to&nbsp;non-union&nbsp;due to being in a vascular watershed zone and take longer than two months to heal. Displacement of the fracture can increase with persistent weight-bearing; therefore, immobilization is important, with a non-weight bearing cast for 6-8 weeks.&nbsp;Indications for non-operative management include undisplaced fractures and fractures in patients with limited activity (i.e. recreational athletes). Operative management is indicated in patients that are elite or competitive athletes or when delayed union has occurred. Management includes either intramedullary screw fixation or open reduction and internal fixation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/17/picture2_enik85f.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"376\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Nutcracker fracture.&nbsp;</strong>A&nbsp;<strong>nutcracker fracture </strong>refers to a&nbsp;cuboid bone fracture&nbsp;with associated navicular avulsion fracture due to compression between the bases of 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;metatarsals and calcaneus bone. The injury usually occurs secondary to the traumatic abduction of the forefoot. This results in loss of the normal lateral column support and excess valgus force upon the medial column that commonly causes rupture of tibialis posterior tendon or avulsion fracture of its attachment onto medial aspect of the tarsal navicular bone. Nutcracker fractures are clinically significant because they can interfere with the medchanical alignment of the foot.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong><u>Educational objective:</u></strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Shint splint or stress fracture of tibia is the most common injury in runners.</span></li></ul>",

Normal Serum Calcium:</strong> In nutritional rickets, vitamin D deficiency initially leads to decreased calcium absorption and a tendency for low serum calcium. This activates the compensatory mechanism of the body. The drop in serum calcium stimulates the parathyroid glands to release more parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH then acts to increase calcium reabsorption in the kidneys, and mobilizes calcium from the bones (resorption). This helps to maintain serum calcium levels within the normal range, at the expense of bone health. So, it is common to see normal serum calcium in many cases of nutritional rickets.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Elevated Parathyroid Hormone:</strong> In rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are frequently increased (secondary hyperparathyroidism) as the body attempts to counteract low calcium levels by enhancing calcium resorption from bones and kidneys. This is a hallmark of nutritional rickets and is the body's attempt to maintain calcium homeostasis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Low Serum Phosphorus:</strong> A key feature of nutritional rickets is decreased serum phosphorus resulting from compromised renal phosphate reabsorption, exacerbated by a deficiency of vitamin D. High levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have a significant effect on phosphate metabolism. PTH causes the kidneys to excrete more phosphate in the urine. This leads to hypophosphatemia, which directly impairs the mineralization of new bone and cartilage, leading to the characteristic bone deformities of rickets.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Nutritional rickets is characterized by low vitamin D, leading to compensatory high PTH, which helps maintain normal serum calcium (often), but causes low serum phosphorus and, importantly, low urine calcium excretion due to renal calcium conservation.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A <strong>low UCa/Cr ratio</strong> is more commonly associated with nutritional rickets.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">However, a <strong>high UCa/Cr ratio</strong> is not entirely uncommon and might reflect specific underlying mechanisms in some cases.</span></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Therefore, the UCa/Cr ratio in nutritional rickets can vary depending on the specific situation.</span></p></li></ul>",

When degenerative changes of the spine occur, the pars interarticularis&nbsp;can be fractured, and the resulting instability can lead to forward translation of the vertebra.&nbsp; Sufficient anterior slippage of one vertebra on the next vertebral segment can narrow the spinal canal, leading to stenosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When the lateral recess and neural foramen are stenosed, symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy may also present.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Classification (anatomic):</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Central stenosis</strong>: caused by hypertrophied ligamentaum flavum anteriorly and bulging disc posteriorly with consequent thecal sac compression</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lateral&nbsp;recess stenosis</strong>: due to facet joint arthropathy with overgrowth of the superior articular facet and osteophyte formation. This results in compression of the descending nerve roots.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Foraminal stenosis</strong>: due to loss of disc height, foraminal disc protrusion, or osteophyte formation with resultant compression of the exiting nerve root.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Extraforaminal stenosis</strong>: due to far lateral disc herniation again with resultant exiting nerve root compression&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Symptoms may be due to inflammation, compression of the nerve(s) or both.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Such symptoms may include:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pain, weakness or numbness in the legs, calves or buttocks, exacerbated by prolonged ambulation, standing, and with lumbar extension, and is relieved by forward flexion and rest.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Neurogenic claudication is an important feature. Symptoms are bilateral, but usually asymmetric. Low&nbsp;back pain,&nbsp;numbness, and tingling are present.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cramping in the calves with walking, requiring frequent short rests to walk a distance</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pain radiating into one or both thighs and legs, similar to the lay term <strong>“sciatica”</strong></span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In rare cases, loss of motor functioning of the legs, loss of normal bowel or bladder function</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pain may improve with bending forward, sitting or lying down.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Walking&nbsp;upstairs&nbsp;being easier than walking downstairs, as the back is forward flexed with stairs climbing.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If patients present with new-onset bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, bilateral&nbsp;lower extremity weakness, and/or increased lower extremity, the patient may have developed cauda equina or conus medullaris syndromes.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Degenerative spondylolisthesis and degenerative scoliosis</strong> are two conditions that may be associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Degenerative spondylolisthesis (slippage of one vertebra over another) is caused by osteoarthritis of the facet joints. Most commonly, it involves the <strong>L4 slipping over the L5 vertebra</strong>. It is usually treated with the same non-surgical (“conservative”) and surgical methods as lumbar spinal stenosis.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Investigations:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">MRI of the lumbosacral spine is the modality of choice for lumbar spinal stenosis, and CT myelography is an option when MRI is contraindicated.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Anteroposterior spinal canal diameters of less than 10 mm are also frequently used for the&nbsp;diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Treatment:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Management for lumbar spinal stenosis aims at&nbsp;reducing&nbsp;symptoms and improving functional status.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Conservative treatment is the first-line treatment for this condition.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Conservative treatment options include physical therapy, oral anti-inflammatory medications, and epidural steroid injections.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The most frequently performed surgical procedure is a laminectomy (Wide pedicle-to-pedicle decompression).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is usually indicated in cases of ongoing pain despite conservative measures for 3-6 months and where there is progressive neurologic deterioration e.g. motor weakness, bowel and/or bladder dysfunction.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Laminectomy with fusion (wide pedicle-to-pedicle decompression with instrumented fusion) is indicated when further stability is required, which is done in patients with concurrent segmental instability e.g. spondylolisthesis (degenerative or isthmic) or degenerative scoliosis.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Vertebral osteoporotic compression fracture.</strong> These are very common fragility fractures of the spine that affect up to 50% of people over 80 years old. The patient complains of pain localized to area of fracture. There is focal tenderness or pain with deep palpation of spinous process. Radiographs will show loss of anterior, middle, or posterior vertebral height by 20% or at least 4mm. Treatment is usually non-operative. If the fracture is less than five days old, calcitonin can be used for four weeks to decrease pain. Bisphosphonates&nbsp;can be given to prevent future risk of fragility fractures. Some patients may benefit from an&nbsp;extension orthosis. Surgical options may include vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, surgical decompression and stabilization.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/05/screenshot-2024-01-05-103338.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"289\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. PIVD.&nbsp;</strong>A herniated disc in the spine is a condition during which a nucleus pulposus is displaced from intervertebral space. It is a common cause of back pain. Herniated disc pain often presents with burning sensation, and may radiate into the lower extremity. Furthermore, in more severe cases, there can be associated with weakness or sensation changes. The disc prolapse can be very painful. Within a few weeks, most cases heal. In many instances, it does not cause that patient any pain. They are often seen on MRI of asymptomatic patients. The initial treatment should be conservative, unless a patient has severe neurological compromise. Surgery is usually the last resort. Physical therapy is the key for most patients.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/05/screenshot-2024-01-05-103349.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"328\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Isthmic spondylolisthesis</strong>. Spondylolisthesis occurs when there is an anterior&nbsp;translation or “slippage” of&nbsp;one vertebral body&nbsp;relative to its caudal vertebral body. In most cases, symptoms associated with spondylolisthesis are chronic. &nbsp;The primary symptom of chronic spondylolisthesis is back pain, with or without leg pain. Isthmic spondylolisthesis refers to a defect in the pars interarticularis that results in anterior subluxation over time, most commonly at L5-S1 followed by L4-5. The resulting anterior subluxation can produce back pain, central canal stenosis, and lateral recess or foraminal stenosis. The most common etiology for isthmic spondylolisthesis is instability of unilateral or bilateral pars interarticularis.&nbsp;The most common symptom of presentation is low back pain, which may be mechanical in nature, depressed deep tendon reflexes, positive straight leg signs, and diminished sensations. Isthmic spondylolisthesis with low back pain should initially be managed conservatively. Surgical treatment options consist of decompression of the neural elements alone versus decompression with internal fixation for bony fusion to prevent further subluxation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/05/screenshot-2024-01-05-103402.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"301\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A back pain that worsens on walking and radiates down the legs within 100m of walking, and that does not occur on climbing up the stairs, is suggestive of lumbar canal stenosis where the pain relieves on forward bending the trunk, as in climbing the stairs.</span></li></ul>",

Bone cavities have been reinforced with autologous bone grafts, allograft, PMMA bone cement, demineralized bone matrix and bone graft substitutes.

Pain is an almost universal complaint of patients.<strong> </strong>In addition to pain, patients also may have fever, erythema, and swelling suggesting osteomyelitis. Laboratory studies may reveal increased WBC count, an elevated ESR, and an elevated CRP. Classically, Ewing sarcoma appears radiographically as a <i>destructive lesion in the diaphysis </i>of a long bone with an “onion skin” periosteal reaction. Ewing sarcoma more often originates in the metaphysis of a long bone, but frequently extends for a considerable distance into the diaphysis. Lung is the most common site of metastases. The worst prognostic factor is the presence of distant metastases<strong>. </strong>Even with aggressive treatment, patients with metastases have only a 20% chance of long-term survival.

Tibial Condyle fracture:</strong>&nbsp;Tibial Plateau fractures are periarticular injuries of the proximal tibia frequently associated with soft tissue injury. Incidence&nbsp;is 1-2% of all fractures. It can be caused in males in age group of 40s due to high energy trauma, and in females of age group of 70s due to low energy falls. Incidence of lateral plateau fracture is 70-80% (due to valgus load), bicondylar is 10-30% (due to axial load), and of medial plateau is 10-20% (due to varus load). In a high energy trauma, there is fracture-dislocation of the medial plateau with soft tissue injuries (meniscus and ACL tear, common peroneal nerve injury). Low energy traumas cause lateral plateau fractures. AP, lateral and oblique radiograph views are helpful; oblique view helps in determining amount of depression. AP view shows depressed articular surface and abnormal joint alignment. Lateral view shows posteromedial fracture lines and abnormal tibial slope.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/07/25/screenshot-2024-07-25-131422.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"236\"></span><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>AP and Lateral view showing tibial condyle/plateau fracture</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong>&nbsp;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that affects approximately 1% of the world population, with approximately 50% of adults being unable to work within 10 years of disease onset. The disease involves synovial joints and leads to progressive joint destruction. The knee joint is commonly involved in RA. Severe destruction of the articular cartilage and menisci is a characteristic feature of RA. Bone marrow edema and bone erosion can both also be found, but are less characteristic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/07/25/screenshot-2024-07-25-131433.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemarthrosis of Knee Joint:</strong>&nbsp;Hemarthrosis is bleeding into a joint cavity. It is best diagnosed with arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis. Traumatic injury is the most common cause of hemarthrosis. Non-traumatic hemarthrosis can be caused by bleeding disorders that are either hereditary or&nbsp;acquired. Hereditary bleeding disorders include hemophilia and inherited coagulation factor deficiency disorders. Examples of acquired bleeding disorders include advanced liver or renal disease, vitamin K deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or anticoagulation medication use.&nbsp;Post-operative recurrent hemarthrosis is frequently associated with total knee arthroplasty. The preferred initial imaging modality is plain film radiology of the involved joint and surrounding bones. If a fracture is not seen but strongly suspected, further evaluation with a CT scan is warranted. MRI may be able to&nbsp;diagnose ligamentous or other soft tissue injuries as the cause of hemarthrosis. Ultrasound (US) can help identify and characterize intra-articular fluid collections. The synovial fluid from a hemarthrosis may appear red, pink, or brown depending on the cause of bleeding. Aspiration of the joint and subsequent analysis can differentiate simple effusion, hemarthrosis, lipohemarthrosis, and septic arthritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/07/25/screenshot-2024-07-25-131447.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The given image shows the comminuted fracture of the patella.</span></li></ul>",

Its maximum incidence is seen in 2nd decade of life. Pain is an almost universal complaint of patients.<strong> </strong>In addition to pain, patients also may have fever, erythema, and swelling suggesting osteomyelitis. Laboratory studies may reveal increased WBC count, an elevated ESR, and an elevated CRP. Classically, Ewing sarcoma appears radiographically as a <i>destructive lesion in the diaphysis </i>of a long bone with an “onion skin” periosteal reaction. Ewing sarcoma more often originates in the metaphysis of a long bone, but frequently extends for a considerable distance into the diaphysis. Lung is the most common site of metastases. The worst prognostic factor is the presence of distant metastases<strong>. </strong>Even with aggressive treatment, patients with metastases have only a 20% chance of long-term survival. The treatment include neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, to treat distant<strong> </strong>metastases<strong>. </strong>Chemotherapy is much more effective and include vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, adriamycin, ifosfamide and etoposide.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>ABCD: A</strong>ctinomycin D /&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>leomycin /&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>yclophosphamide /&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>oxorubicin</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Best results are achieved by Preoperative chemotherapy; then wide excision (or amputation) if tumor is in favorable site and further chemotherapy for 1 year.

All patients report progressive pain. Night pain is also reported in about 25% patients. Characteristic findings are Codman’s triangle and Sunburst periosteal reaction.

Stress fracture of tibia.&nbsp;</strong>A tibial shaft stress fracture is an overuse injury where normal or abnormal bone is subjected to repetitive stress, resulting in microfractures. It is commonly seen in runners. There is linear microfracture in trabecular bone from repetitive loading. The patient have pain directly over the fracture which initially worsen after running.

Most common in Proximal location like <strong>pelvis (most common site)</strong>, proximal femur, and proximal humerus. Most common malignant tumor of bone in hand (although rarely occur). Secondary chondrosarcomas arise at the site of a pre-existing benign cartilage lesion like in case of <strong>multiple enchondromas and multiple hereditary exostoses. </strong>Chondrosarcoma <strong>can produce hyperglycemia</strong> in 85% cases. Metastasis from Chondrosarcoma most commonly goes to lungs (hematogenous). The radiographic appearance is similar to enchondroma, it is a lesion arising in the medullary cavity with irregular matrix calcification. The pattern of Calcification is described as <strong>“Punctate”, “popcorn”, or “comma-shaped”</strong>. It has a more aggressive appearance with Bone destruction, cortical erosions, periosteal reaction, and rarely a soft-tissue mass.

Although these tumors typically are benign, pulmonary metastases occur in approximately 3% of patients. Malignant giant cell tumors represent less than 5% of total GCT. Radiographic findings often are diagnostic. The lesions are eccentrically located in the epiphyses of long bones and usually about the subchondral bone with <strong>soap bubble appearance</strong>. Microscopically, giant cell tumors are composed of many multinucleated giant cells (typically 40-60 nuclei per cell) in a sea of mononuclear stromal cells (malignant cells). Curettage and stripping of the cavity is the treatment of choice.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/06/picture4_LMkxVjy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"240\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Most often, the tumors develop at the ends of the femur, tibia, or humerus. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are more common in males. Although chondroblastomas are not cancerous, they can continue to grow if left untreated. A growing tumor can destroy the surrounding bone, making it painful to move the nearby joint. The cause of chondroblastomas is not known. The tumors are thought to arise from the growth plates at the ends of the bones, near joints. Classic <strong>“chicken wire” </strong>calcification is seen.

Head injury</strong>. Based on the mechanism, head trauma is classified as blunt (the most common mechanism), penetrating (most fatal), and blast. Most severe TBIs result from motor vehicle collisions and falls. A good history concerning the mechanism of injury is important. GCS is used to describe the level of consciousness. A patient with mild head injury may present with swelling from a bump or a bruise, small, superficial cut in the scalp, headache, sensitivity to noise and light, irritability, confusion, dizziness, balance problems, nausea, problems with memory and/or concentration, blurred vision, tinnitus. Moderate to severe head injury symptoms may include any of the above plus loss of consciousness, severe headache that does not go away, repeated nausea and vomiting, loss of short-term memory, such as difficulty remembering the events that led right up to and through the traumatic event, slurred speech, difficulty with walking, weakness in one side or area of the body, sweating, pale skin, seizures, blood or clear fluid draining from the ears or nose, one pupil&nbsp; is dilated, or looks larger, than the other eye and doesn't constrict, or get smaller,&nbsp;when exposed to light&nbsp;, deep cut or laceration in the scalp, open wound in the head, foreign object penetrating the head, coma.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Blunt trauma to chest</strong>. Chest trauma remains a serious problem in high-speed vehicle accidents. Thoracic trauma occurs in approximately 60% patients and has a mortality of 20-25%. The mortality rate in blunt chest trauma may be due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary complications. In the primary survey of chest trauma patients, 6 life-threatening conditions (airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, flail chest, pericardial tamponade) should be immediately investigated and treated. Signs and symptoms of thoracic trauma include cyanosis of fingers, lips or face, dyspnea, tachypnea or bradypnea, contusion, laceration, perforations, distension, hemoptysis, signs of shock (hypoperfusion), tracheal deviation, paradoxical movement of the chest wall, distended jugular veins, decreased or absent breathing sounds, pain, failure of chest expansion in normal inspiration. Respiratory distress is a serious problem and the patients may breathe with nasal flaring, using accessory muscles, intercostal and subcostal retractions, and tachypnea. The patient's lungs may not be equally involved in breathing. Paradoxical respiration can be observed and immediate diagnosis of flail chest can be made.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemorrhagic shock</strong>. Shock refers to the inadequate perfusion of tissues due to the imbalance between the oxygen demand of tissues and the body’s ability to supply it. Blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources.&nbsp;Bleeding may be either external or internal. It occurs due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria are unable to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate which leads to pyruvate production and conversion to lactic acid to maintain some degree of cellular respiration. The body compensates by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Signs and symptoms include blue&nbsp;lips&nbsp;and&nbsp;finger nails, low or no urine output, excessive sweating, shallow breathing, dizziness&nbsp;or&nbsp;loss of consciousness, confusion, chest pain, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, weak pulse.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">History of a road traffic accident, resulting in a fracture of the femur shaft with appearance of symptoms of sudden onset of difficulty breathing, confusion, and small reddish-purple skin rashes over the chest and underarm areas after a period of 12 hours all indicates fat embolism which needs immediate intervention. &nbsp;</span></p></li></ul>",

TB spine.&nbsp;</strong>In pott’s spine, the commonest &amp; usually the 1<sup>st</sup> symptom is back pain, which is usually minimal. Tenderness is the earliest sign. Twist tenderness for Anterior elements is more significant as disease is anteriorly involving the vertebral body (paradiscal). Paravertebral muscle spasm resulting in stiffness in the affected region is a constant early finding. The spine is held rigid. When bending forward, there is flexion at hips and knees and the spine are in extension (Coin test). Earliest sign in patient with neurological deficit is increased deep tendon reflexes or clonus or extensor plantar response (twitching of muscles can be seen even earlier). The Earliest X-ray feature is loss of Curvature due to paravertebral spasm. There is reduction of intervertebral disk space and osteoporosis of two adjacent vertebrae, sometimes with fuzziness of the endplates. Paraspinal abscess appears as fusiform shadows along vertebral column.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture65.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"339\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

More than 80% of people will suffer from low back pain during their lifetime. There is a higher prevalence&nbsp;among women and people ages 40-80 years. Acute mechanical back strains may be triggered by physical or non-physical activity, with lifting being the most commonly recalled event.&nbsp;The patient complaints of axial lumbosacral pain and/or radicular pain into the lower extremity.

The next commonest site&nbsp;of intervertebral disc prolapse is lower cervical spine (C5-C6). Lumbar disc is dehydrated hence more prone. Small herniation of nucleus pulposus produce Schmorl’s nodules. Degenerated disc is extruded posteriorly in three patterns: Central, Paracentral (annulus bulges to one side of posterior longitudinal ligament – most common type and produced unilateral radicular symptoms), and Far lateral disc herniation (bulge is within or just lateral to neural foramina).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The described symptoms of chronic low back pain, early morning stiffness, and bilateral heel pain are suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis which involves the enthesis of the body.</span></li></ul>",

Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as <strong>Trendelenburg sign</strong>). The gait appears <strong>waddling</strong>. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase. This waddling gait pattern can also be caused when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/04/whatsapp-image-2024-01-04-at-180800.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"411\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

Left superior gluteal nerve palsy</strong>. When the patient is standing on one leg, the opposite pelvis should be lifted upwards by abduction of the ipsilateral hip joint, in a normal patient. When the abductors are weak due to superior gluteal nerve paresis, the pelvis will sag, called positive Trendelenburg sign. In a patient with a positive&nbsp;Trendelenburg&nbsp;sign, the pelvis sags toward the normal unsupported side, which is the swing leg. When the left superior gluteal nerve is affected, on standing on the left lower limb, the right side pelvis will drop and when the patient stands on the right leg, the left side pelvis will be lifted up.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Right inferior gluteal nerve palsy</strong>. The inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus muscle. It is therefore, responsible for extending the trunk from a forward bending position and extending the hip from sitting-to-standing or during stair-climbing or rising from a squatted position. The nerve does not confer any sensation. Injury to this nerve is most commonly iatrogenic in origin and is the most at risk nerve during total hip arthroplasty via a posterior approach.&nbsp;Injury typically leads to an altered gait pattern known as <strong>gluteus maximus ‘lurch’. </strong>The sequelae of nerve injury are denervation of the ipsilateral gluteus maximus muscle. The lurching gait results from the weakening or absence of an ipsilateral hip extension. Clinically, patients may also report wasting of the ipsilateral gluteus maximus muscle and loss of the defined shape to the affected buttock.&nbsp;In a normal gait cycle, the gluteus maximus begin to contract at the moment of the ipsilateral heel-strike to initiate ipsilateral hip extension. In inferior gluteal nerve injury, the trunk will extend when the heel strikes on the ground on the affected side to compensate for weak/absent hip extension. This backward trunk lurch is present in the whole stance phase of the gait cycle and locks the hip in extension. In some cases, the hamstrings muscle compensates to an extent. Therefore, in the right inferior gluteal nerve palsy, the right side hip will not extend during the initial heel strike and the trunk will lean backwards/extend.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

An aching sensation in the anterior elbow is seen in 10% of the patients. Majority of the patients with a full thickness distal biceps rupture reports a painful “pop” sensation. Anterior elbow pain, anterior arm and elbow swelling and weakness of elbow flexion and forearm supination are commonly reported symptoms. Activities such as operating a manual screw driver or opening jars are difficult to perform by involved arm. In a torn distal biceps, there would be anterior ecchymosis, swelling and a prominent biceps bulge at the anterior mid-arm level (Popeye the sailor sign).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/04/119.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

Patients tend to be men who practice sports and are from 30 to 50&nbsp;years of age. The triceps lesions are characterised by pain or tenderness and a palpable defect in the tendon, seen proximal to the olecranon. The patient describes an unexpected “pop” or giving way, with subsequent pain and weakness in the extremity. A complete triceps rupture can be expected when the patient is unable to extend his arm against gravity. A palpable defect is not always present, but sometimes can be found in the posterior arm.

Most common in Proximal location like <strong>pelvis (most common site)</strong>, proximal femur, and proximal humerus. Most common malignant tumor of bone in hand (although rarely occur). Secondary chondrosarcomas arise at the site of a pre-existing benign cartilage lesion like in case of <strong>multiple enchondromas and multiple hereditary exostoses. </strong>Chondrosarcoma <strong>can produce hyperglycemia</strong> in 85% cases.&nbsp;Metastasis from Chondrosarcoma most commonly goes to lungs (hematogenous). The radiographic appearance is similar to enchondroma, it is a lesion arising in the medullary cavity with irregular matrix calcification. The pattern of Calcification is described as <strong>“Punctate”, “popcorn”, or “comma-shaped”</strong>. It has a more aggressive appearance with Bone destruction, cortical erosions, periosteal reaction, and rarely a soft-tissue mass. Treatment is by<strong> </strong>Wide local excision/Radical excision.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/03/28.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"304\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after multiple myeloma. It is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. All patients report progressive pain. Night pain is also reported in about 25% patients. Characteristic findings are Codman’s triangle and Sunburst periosteal reaction. It is the most radioresistant bone tumor and treated by chemotherapy followed by limb salvage surgery/amputation followed by chemotherapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/03/picture60.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"182\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Most often, the tumors develop at the ends of the femur, tibia, or humerus. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are more common in males. Although chondroblastomas are not cancerous, they can continue to grow if left untreated. A growing tumor can destroy the surrounding bone, making it painful to move the nearby joint. The cause of chondroblastomas is not known. The tumors are thought to arise from the growth plates at the ends of the bones, near joints. Classic <strong>“chicken wire” </strong>calcification is seen.

Multiple brown tumor.</strong> It has been reported that 2-5% patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have brown tumor (osteitis fibrosa cystica). Bone brown tumor secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is very rare, which is caused by massive secretion of PTH. First, a large amount of bone calcium is mobilized into blood, resulting in fibrous tissue hyperplasia in bone and leaky hemorrhage. Then, macrophage reactive hyperplasia resulted in phagocytosis of red blood cells and a large amount of hemosiderin is produced, thereby forming a brown nodule. The lesions are usually multiple, most commonly seen in ribs, clavicle, pelvis, long bones and mandibles while others are rare. The radiograph of brown tumor is often characterized by osteoporosis, thinning of cortical bone and multiple localized cystic bone destruction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture46.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"313\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C.

Femoral nerve injury:&nbsp;</strong>Femoral nerve damage can occur from an injury or prolonged compression. Typically, damage and dysfunction of the femoral nerve are associated with the leg weakness and sensation changes. Injury of the femoral is uncommon but may be injured by a stab, gunshot wounds, or a&nbsp;pelvic fracture. It can also be damaged during&nbsp;hip replacement, abdominal, and pelvic surgeries. The patient presents with poor flexion of the hip because of paralysis of the iliacus, psoas and sartorius muscles. There is an inability to extend the knee because of paralysis of the quadriceps femoris. There is sensory decline over the anterior and medial aspects of the thigh, medial side of the leg and foot up to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. It does not directly affect the position of the hip or the length appearance of the limb.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Femoral neck fracture:&nbsp;</strong>Femoral neck fractures are a specific type of intracapsular hip fracture. The junctional location makes the femoral neck prone to fracture. It is commonly seen in the elderly due to low energy falls, and in young patients who perform athletics or due to high-energy trauma. The patient complains of pain with a decreased range of motion of the hip. In non-displaced fractures, there may be no deformity. However, displaced fractures may present with a shortened and externally rotated lower limb. The leg appears shortened due to the upward movement of the distal fragment. The key feature is the inability to bear weight and immediate pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/08/screenshot-2024-10-08-174859.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Posterior hip dislocation:&nbsp;</strong>It is the Most common hip dislocation (90%). Patients with a posterior dislocation of the hip generally present with a shortened, internally rotated, adducted limb in slight flexion<strong>. </strong>If the hip is adducted at the time of injury, a pure dislocation occurs, whereas a neutral position or abduction leads to fracture dislocation. It is associated with a fracture of the femoral head or acetabulum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/10/08/screenshot-2024-10-08-175111.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"340\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The limb appears lengthened and in FABER (flexion, abduction, external rotation) deformity in anterior dislocation of the hip following a motor vehicle accident.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Thus, in the given scenario, the patient has anterior dislocation of the hip.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>",
