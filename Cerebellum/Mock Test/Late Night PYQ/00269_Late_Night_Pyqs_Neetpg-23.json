C) Hartnup disease</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Hartnup disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a <strong>defect in the absorption of tryptophan and other neutral amino acids in the</strong> <strong>intestine and renal tubules</strong>. This defect leads to increased excretion of amino acids in the urine, known as <strong>aminoaciduria.</strong> Tryptophan is a precursor for niacin (Vitamin B3) synthesis, and its deficiency can lead to pellagra-like symptoms, including dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia, often referred to as the \"3 D's\" of pellagra.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In this case, the patient presents with pellagra-like eruptions and high aminoaciduria. The normal HIAA levels rule out a carcinoid tumor, which would show elevated levels of 5-HIAA in the urine due to increased serotonin production. The absence of dietary history indicative of niacin or tryptophan deficiency (as seen in nutritional pellagra) further supports Hartnup disease as the diagnosis. Additionally, essential fructosuria is a benign condition and does not cause skin eruptions or pellagra-like symptoms.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Note –</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tryptophan is an aromatic amino acid with a bulky indole ring side chain.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">60 mg of tryptophan converts into 1 mg of niacin</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Best Treatment of Niacin deficiency - Niacin or nicotinamide.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

D) DNA editing</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a powerful tool used for DNA editing. It works by creating double-strand breaks in the DNA at specific locations. The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) component guides the Cas9 endonuclease to the precise cutting site within the genome. Once the DNA is cut, the cell’s natural repair mechanisms are used to add, delete, or replace genetic material at the targeted site, enabling precise editing of the DNA sequence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">CRISPR-Cas9 is derived from a natural immune system in bacteria, which uses this mechanism to defend against bacteriophages by cutting their DNA. In genetic engineering, this system has been harnessed for various applications, including <strong>gene deletion, exogenous gene insertion, and multigene editing, </strong>all of which involve altering the DNA sequence in a targeted manner.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The most common location of intussusception is ileocolic. It is commonly seen in infants during the weaning period following the introduction of new food, vaccination, or upper respiratory tract infection. The currently approved rotavirus vaccines are associated with very minimal risk of intussusception. An area of enlarged submucosal Peyer's patch acts as a lead point for intussusception.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>The clinical scenario&nbsp;</strong>of pain abdomen with a palpable mass in the right lumbar region along with the barium enema showing claw sign is suggestive of intussusception. Some lead points in children are Meckel's diverticulum, intestinal polyp, inflamed appendix, submucosal hemorrhage seen in Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and intestinal duplication cysts. Patients usually present with cramping abdominal pain, palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, vomiting, and passage of red currant jelly stools.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Diagnosis&nbsp;</strong>is confirmed by abdominal ultrasound which shows the target sign bull's eye sign and pseudokidney sign. <strong>Management</strong> of intussusception includes prompt referral to a pediatric surgeon for reduction by air or contrast enema or surgical intervention if there is a failure of non-operative reduction or clinical instability.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Twist tenderness for Anterior elements is more significant as disease is anteriorly involving the vertebral body (paradiscal). Paravertebral muscle spasm resulting in stiffness in the affected region is a constant early finding. The spine is held rigid. When bending forward, there is flexion at hips and knees and the spine are in extension (Coin test). Earliest sign in patient with neurological deficit is increased deep tendon reflexes or clonus or extensor plantar response (twitching of muscles can be seen even earlier). The Earliest X-ray feature is loss of Curvature due to paravertebral spasm. There is reduction of intervertebral disk space and osteoporosis of two adjacent vertebrae, sometimes with fuzziness of the endplates.

Small herniation of nucleus pulposus produce Schmorl’s nodules.

The bicarbonate ion is then exchanged for <strong>chloride through an exchanger protein</strong>. When chloride enters the RBC, water follows due to osmosis, causing the RBCs to swell.

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ans. D) Vaginal</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">The risk of ureteric injury is <strong>least&nbsp;</strong>in vaginal hysterectomy compared to other approaches. This is due to the <strong>anatomical relationship between the ureter and uterine vessels</strong>. The ureter passes underneath the uterine artery <strong>(bridge over water concept</strong>) approximately 1.5-2 cm lateral to the uterus at the level of the isthmus. When performing a vaginal hysterectomy, the operating field and surgical dissection remains close to the uterus, reducing the risk of <strong>encountering and injuring the ureter.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Laparotomy: Incorrect</strong> because in abdominal approach (laparotomy), there is a higher risk of ureteric injury due to wider dissection and direct visualization of the area where ureter crosses under the uterine vessels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Laparoscopy: Incorrect</strong> as laparoscopic approach, despite better visualization, still carries a higher risk of ureteric injury compared to vaginal approach due to the <strong>extensive lateral dissection required.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Robotic: Incorrect</strong> because robotic approach, similar to laparoscopy, involves lateral pelvic dissection which increases risk of ureteric injury.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Risk of ureteric injury in increasing order is:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Vaginal hysterectomy (least risk)</strong></span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Abdominal hysterectomy&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Laparoscopic hysterectomy</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Radical hysterectomy (highest)</strong></span></li></ul>",
