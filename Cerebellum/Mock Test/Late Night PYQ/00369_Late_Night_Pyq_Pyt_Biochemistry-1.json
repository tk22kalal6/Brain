D) Mutation of tRNA</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The correct answer is <strong>Mutation of tRNA</strong>. A suppressor mutation, specifically a <strong>tRNA mutation</strong>, can reverse the effect of an earlier mutation that produced a premature stop codon. In this scenario, the tRNA undergoes a mutation that allows it to recognize the stop codon (UAA in this case) as if it were a normal codon (e.g., serine's codon UCA). This suppressor tRNA can then insert an amino acid at the site of the stop codon, allowing protein synthesis to continue. This compensates for the earlier mutation that would have led to a truncated, non-functional protein, thereby restoring the wild-type phenotype.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/31/whatsapp-image-2024-08-31-at-12858-pm.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"313\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/31/screenshot-2024-08-31-170152.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"274\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Frameshift mutation of coding gene</strong>: This type of mutation typically disrupts the reading frame of the gene, leading to widespread changes in the amino acid sequence from the point of mutation onward. It usually results in a non-functional protein and does not suppress the effects of another mutation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Addition of another normal gene</strong>: While adding a normal gene might help correct a phenotype by introducing a functional version of the gene, it does not qualify as a suppressor mutation. This option does not specifically address the reversal of a mutation at the molecular level in the same way as tRNA mutation does.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Deletion of the mutant gene</strong>: Deleting the mutant gene would remove the mutation but would not revert the phenotype to wild type by itself.

Infants with galactosemia are unable to break down galactose and its accumulation can lead to severe complications. Therefore, breastfeeding is an absolute contraindication for infants with galactosemia, and they require a special galactose-free formula.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>HIV:</strong> This option is incorrect. While HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, the transmission risk can be significantly reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other precautions. In certain situations, such as in resource-limited settings where safe alternatives to breastfeeding are not available, the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks of HIV transmission. However, in areas where safe and affordable alternatives are accessible, avoiding breastfeeding is generally recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Hepatitis B:&nbsp;</strong>This option is incorrect. Breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants born to mothers with hepatitis B. Transmission of hepatitis B through breast milk is considered low, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission. Breastfeeding can generally continue in these cases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Cytomegalovirus infection:</strong> This option is incorrect. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted through breast milk, but the transmission risk can be reduced. In most cases, breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants with CMV infection. Precautions such as pasteurization of breast milk or using frozen breast milk from before the infection occurred can be taken to reduce the risk of transmission.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The question aims to identify conditions where breastfeeding is absolutely contraindicated. Understanding absolute contraindications for breastfeeding is crucial for ensuring the safety and health of both the neonate and the mother. In certain medical conditions, breastfeeding can pose significant health risks to the infant, necessitating alternative feeding methods.</span></p>",

Hepatic Gluconeogenesis: </strong>Hepatic gluconeogenesis is the process by which the liver produces glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors, such as amino acids and glycerol.

In pyrimidine synthesis, UMP is the first pyrimidine nucleotide to be synthesized and other two pyrimidines thymine and Cytosine are synthesized from it. Uracil to cytosine conversion requires amino group addition provided by glutamine. Uracil is converted to thymine by enzyme thymidylate synthase by methylation where methyl group is donated by methyl-THF. So, a deficiency Folate will result in thymine deficiency and may lead to uracil appearing in the DNA in place of thymine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: Harper’s 31<sup>st</sup> ed/pg- 333</strong></span></p>",

Ascorbic Acid:</strong> &nbsp;Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is crucial for collagen synthesis. It acts as a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase, enzymes necessary for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen. Deficiency of Vitamin C leads to scurvy, characterized by weakened collagen and symptoms like bleeding gums and poor wound healing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Copper and Iron:</strong> &nbsp;Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase, an enzyme involved in the cross-linking of collagen fibers, essential for the strength and integrity of collagen. Iron is also involved in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine in collagen synthesis. Deficiencies in these minerals can impair collagen formation and structure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Zinc &amp; Magnesium:</strong> While zinc and magnesium are important for overall health and participate in numerous enzymatic reactions, they are not primarily associated with collagen synthesis or cross-linking in the same direct manner as ascorbic acid, copper, and iron.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Post translational modification of collagen on proline and lysine residue is required for its proper hydrogen bond formation and crosslinking which provide strength to collagen fibers.
