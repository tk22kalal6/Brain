      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. D) Angle closure glaucoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Angle closure glaucoma is a condition where there is a sudden increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) due to the closure of the angle between the iris and the cornea, which obstructs the drainage of aqueous humor. This leads to a rapid rise in IOP, resulting in acute, severe eye pain, headache, nausea, and a sudden loss of vision. A key clinical sign of an acute angle closure glaucoma attack is a mid-dilated, vertically oval, and sluggishly reacting pupil. The vertically oval pupil occurs due to ischemia of the iris sphincter muscles caused by the high IOP.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/27/screenshot-2024-08-27-105538.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"268\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This condition is an ophthalmic emergency, and immediate treatment is necessary to prevent permanent vision loss. The high IOP can cause damage to the optic nerve, leading to irreversible vision loss if not promptly managed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Note - Vogt's triad</strong> is a set of three clinical signs associated with the aftermath of an acute attack of glaucoma. This triad includes sphincter atrophy (damage to the iris sphincter muscle), a mid-dilated pupil that does not react well to light, and glaucoma flecken, which are patches of pigmentation or discoloration on the lens of the eye resulting from the damage caused by the increased intraocular pressure during a glaucoma attack.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. CSR/Macular degeneration</strong>: Central serous retinopathy (CSR) and age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) are conditions that cause a <strong>gradual, painless loss of central vision</strong>. They do not present with acute pain, sudden vision loss, or pupillary abnormalities like a vertically oval pupil.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Cataract</strong>: Cataracts cause a <strong>gradual, painless decrease in vision</strong> due to the clouding of the lens. They do not cause sudden vision loss, pain, or changes in pupil shape.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Optic neuritis</strong>: Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause sudden vision loss and pain, particularly with eye movement. However, it does not cause changes in the shape of the pupil or a vertically oval pupil. The <strong>pain in optic neuritis is typically associated with eye movements</strong> rather than the constant severe pain seen in angle closure glaucoma.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:48px;\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Acute angle closure glaucoma is characterized by sudden, painful vision loss, and a mid-dilated, vertically oval, sluggishly reacting pupil.

Head injury</strong>. Based on the mechanism, head trauma is classified as blunt (the most common mechanism), penetrating (most fatal), and blast. Most severe TBIs result from motor vehicle collisions and falls. A good history concerning the mechanism of injury is important. GCS is used to describe the level of consciousness. A patient with mild head injury may present with swelling from a bump or a bruise, small, superficial cut in the scalp, headache, sensitivity to noise and light, irritability, confusion, dizziness, balance problems, nausea, problems with memory and/or concentration, blurred vision, tinnitus. Moderate to severe head injury symptoms may include any of the above plus loss of consciousness, severe headache that does not go away, repeated nausea and vomiting, loss of short-term memory, such as difficulty remembering the events that led right up to and through the traumatic event, slurred speech, difficulty with walking, weakness in one side or area of the body, sweating, pale skin, seizures, blood or clear fluid draining from the ears or nose, one pupil&nbsp; is dilated, or looks larger, than the other eye and doesn't constrict, or get smaller,&nbsp;when exposed to light&nbsp;, deep cut or laceration in the scalp, open wound in the head, foreign object penetrating the head, coma.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Blunt trauma to chest</strong>. Chest trauma remains a serious problem in high-speed vehicle accidents. Thoracic trauma occurs in approximately 60% patients and has a mortality of 20-25%. The mortality rate in blunt chest trauma may be due to pulmonary and non-pulmonary complications. In the primary survey of chest trauma patients, 6 life-threatening conditions (airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, flail chest, pericardial tamponade) should be immediately investigated and treated. Signs and symptoms of thoracic trauma include cyanosis of fingers, lips or face, dyspnea, tachypnea or bradypnea, contusion, laceration, perforations, distension, hemoptysis, signs of shock (hypoperfusion), tracheal deviation, paradoxical movement of the chest wall, distended jugular veins, decreased or absent breathing sounds, pain, failure of chest expansion in normal inspiration. Respiratory distress is a serious problem and the patients may breathe with nasal flaring, using accessory muscles, intercostal and subcostal retractions, and tachypnea. The patient's lungs may not be equally involved in breathing. Paradoxical respiration can be observed and immediate diagnosis of flail chest can be made.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemorrhagic shock</strong>. Shock refers to the inadequate perfusion of tissues due to the imbalance between the oxygen demand of tissues and the body’s ability to supply it. Blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources.&nbsp;Bleeding may be either external or internal. It occurs due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. As a result, mitochondria are unable to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate which leads to pyruvate production and conversion to lactic acid to maintain some degree of cellular respiration. The body compensates by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Signs and symptoms include blue&nbsp;lips&nbsp;and&nbsp;finger nails, low or no urine output, excessive sweating, shallow breathing, dizziness&nbsp;or&nbsp;loss of consciousness, confusion, chest pain, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, weak pulse.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">History of a road traffic accident, resulting in a fracture of the femur shaft with appearance of symptoms of sudden onset of difficulty breathing, confusion, and small reddish-purple skin rashes over the chest and underarm areas after a period of 12 hours all indicates fat embolism which needs immediate intervention. &nbsp;</span></p></li></ul>",

A) Direct positive</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In obstructive jaundice, the Van den Bergh reaction may show a positive result for direct bilirubin. Direct bilirubin is also known as conjugated bilirubin, and it is water-soluble. Elevated levels of direct bilirubin in the blood can be an indicator of liver or biliary tract dysfunction, which is often seen in obstructive jaundice.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Indirect positive:&nbsp;</strong>Indirect bilirubin, also known as unconjugated bilirubin, is typically associated with hemolytic disorders rather than obstructive jaundice. Therefore, in the context of obstructive jaundice, the Van den Bergh reaction may not show a positive result for indirect bilirubin.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Both positive:&nbsp;</strong>In the context of obstructive jaundice, it's more common for the Van den Bergh reaction to show a positive result for direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin) rather than indirect bilirubin. However, if there is a combination of liver dysfunction and hemolysis, both direct and indirect bilirubin levels may be elevated, resulting in both being positive on the Van den Bergh reaction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Coproporphyrin:&nbsp;</strong>Coproporphyrin is not typically measured using the Van den Bergh reaction. It is a different component related to porphyrin metabolism and is not directly associated with the assessment of bilirubin levels in obstructive jaundice.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Van den Bergh reaction is a chemical reaction used to measure bilirubin levels in blood, specifically amount of conjugated bilirubin in the blood.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Principle: bilirubin reacts with diazotized sulphanilic acid to produce purple colored azobilirubin.

The following are the key characteristics of necrosis:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>1.

Digoxin is a medication used to treat various heart conditions, including atrial fibrillation.

Digoxin is partially metabolized by CYP3A4. When clarithromycin inhibits this enzyme, it can lead to decreased metabolism of digoxin, resulting in elevated digoxin levels and potential toxicity. This interaction can explain the significant increase in the patient&#39;s digoxin levels from 1.5 ng/mL to 3.4 ng/mL.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

Artesunate is typically given for three consecutive days, and the dosage of primaquine is reduced compared to when treating only P. falciparum, where the standard dose would be 7.5 mg.
