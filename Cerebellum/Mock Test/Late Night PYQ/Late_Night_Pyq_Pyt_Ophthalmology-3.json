      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. C. Astigmatism</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Astigmatism&nbsp;</strong>occurs when the cornea or lens has an irregular shape, preventing light from focusing properly on the retina. This leads to blurred or distorted vision at all distances. Common symptoms include eyestrain, headaches, and difficulty seeing at night.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Presbyopia</strong>: This is a common condition associated with aging, where the eye's lens loses its ability to change shape to focus on close objects. Symptoms include difficulty reading small print or having to hold reading material farther away. Presbyopia typically starts to become noticeable in the early to mid-40s.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Myopia (Nearsightedness)</strong>: This condition occurs when the eye is longer than normal or has a cornea that is too curved. As a result, light rays focus in front of the retina instead of on it. This leads to distant objects appearing blurry while close objects are seen clearly. Myopia is often identified in childhood or adolescence and can worsen during periods of rapid growth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hypermetropia (Farsightedness)</strong>: In this condition, the eye is shorter than normal, or the cornea is not curved enough, causing light to focus behind the retina. This makes close objects appear blurry, while distant objects are usually seen clearly. Children often have some degree of hypermetropia, which can decrease as the eye grows and lengthens.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Recognizing and understanding these refractive conditions is essential for early detection and management. Regular eye examinations are crucial, as they allow for the timely prescription of corrective lenses or other treatments. Each condition affects vision in a unique way, and understanding these differences is key in providing effective patient care and guidance.</span></p>",

Eale’s disease:</strong> Eales disease, also known as \"primary retinal periphlebitis\" or \"periphlebitis retinae,\" is a rare inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the blood vessels in the retina of the eye. It was first described by the British ophthalmologist Henry Eales in 1880, and the condition was subsequently named after him.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Eales disease typically occurs in young adults, often males, and is more prevalent in certain regions, including India. The exact cause of Eales disease is not well understood, but it is believed to have an immunological basis. Some theories suggest that it may be related to immune system dysfunction, possibly triggered by an underlying infection or other factors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The main features of Eales disease include:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Retinal Vasculitis: Inflammation of the small blood vessels (veins) in the retina. This can lead to retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and swelling, which can affect vision.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Neovascularization: New, abnormal blood vessels may develop as a response to the damaged retinal vessels. These abnormal vessels can be fragile and prone to bleeding, leading to further vision problems.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Vitreous Hemorrhage:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Retinal Detachment: In some cases, Eales disease can lead to tractional retinal detachment.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The symptoms of Eales disease can vary and may include blurred vision, floaters, and reduced visual acuity. Diagnosis is typically made through a thorough clinical examination, which may include the use of imaging techniques like fundus fluorescein angiography to visualize the areas of capillary non-perfusion, leakage (suggestive of neovascularisation or macular edema).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The treatment of Eales disease aims to control inflammation, prevent or treat complications, and preserve or improve vision. Treatment options may include systemic or local corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and macular edema, intravitreal Anti VEGF injection for macular edema, laser photocoagulation therapy to target abnormal blood vessels, and in some cases, surgical intervention (pars plana vitrectomy) to address complications like retinal detachment and vitreous haemorrhage. The specific treatment plan will depend on the severity of the disease and the individual patient's needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">It's important for individuals with Eales disease to receive ongoing care and follow-up with an ophthalmologist to monitor their condition and manage any potential complications. Causative association with tuberculosis is present and patient needs to be evaluated for TB and AKT may be initiated where indicated.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;C. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)</strong> is a medical condition that occurs when the central retinal artery becomes blocked or narrowed. This blockage results in a sudden and severe loss of vision in the affected eye. CRAO is considered a medical emergency because it can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Common causes and risk factors of central retinal artery occlusion include:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Atherosclerosis: The most common cause of CRAO is atherosclerosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Embolism:</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Giant cell arteritis: This is a condition in which the arteries, including the central retinal artery, become inflamed.

Congenital Glaucoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Congenital Glaucoma&nbsp;</strong>is a rare condition that can occur in babies and young children. It's caused by an abnormal development of the eye's drainage system, leading to increased intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve. Symptoms can include photophobia, excessive tearing (lacrimation), and cloudy, enlarged corneas. Given the symptoms&nbsp; described, congenital glaucoma is a likely diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)</strong>: This is a group of metabolic disorders caused by the absence or malfunctioning of lysosomal enzymes needed to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans. While MPS can affect the eyes, leading to problems like corneal clouding and glaucoma, the key symptoms often include developmental delay, skeletal and joint abnormalities, and coarse facial features. Eye-related symptoms are typically not the first presenting symptoms in MPS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Congenital Cataract</strong>: This refers to a clouding of the lens of the eye that is present at birth. Congenital cataracts can cause a variety of symptoms including a noticeable white, grey, or yellow spot in the pupil, nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movements), and yes, potentially photophobia. However, lacrimation (excessive tearing) is not a typical symptom of cataracts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Ophthalmia Neonatorum</strong>: This condition is a form of conjunctivitis that occurs in newborns. Typically, it's caused by bacteria acquired during passage through the birth canal from an infected mother. The primary symptoms include redness of the eyes, swelling of the eyelids, and discharge, which may be watery or pus-like. Photophobia can be a symptom, but it's not as common as in some other conditions like congenital glaucoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Congenital Glaucoma should be suspected in infants presenting with photophobia, excessive tearing, and cloudy, enlarged corneas, as it is due to the abnormal development of the eye's drainage system leading to increased intraocular pressure.</span></p>",

A lesion in the left optic tract would lead to a loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes (homonymous hemianopia). This is because the left optic tract carries information from the right half of the visual field of each eye.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Right Optic Tract</strong>: Similarly, a lesion in the right optic tract would cause a loss of vision in the left visual field of both eyes. This is also homonymous hemianopia, but on the opposite side of the visual field loss compared to a left optic tract lesion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Optic Chiasma</strong>: A lesion at the optic chiasma can cause various types of visual field defects. The most common is bitemporal hemianopia, which is the loss of the outer (temporal) halves of the visual field in both eyes. This typically occurs with pituitary tumors that compress the chiasma from below.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Optic Radiation</strong>: The optic radiation carries visual information from the thalamus to the visual cortex. A lesion in the optic radiation can also lead to homonymous hemianopia. The specific location within the optic radiation (e.g., Meyer's loop) can lead to more specific deficits like a superior quadrantanopia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Understanding the visual pathway is critical for localizing lesions based on patterns of visual field loss. Lesions at different points along the visual pathway (e.g., optic nerves, chiasma, tracts, or radiations) will produce characteristic visual field defects. This knowledge is used to guide further diagnostic testing and management, which may include imaging studies like MRI or CT scans to visualize the lesion and determine its cause.</span></p>",

Dermoid</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Ocular dermoids are choristomas, containing tissue not normally found in the area. They often appear as round, firm, and sometimes hair-bearing lesions on the surface of the eye or near the eyelids as given in the image. Dermoids can vary in size and may cause astigmatism if they press against the cornea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Pterygium</strong>: This is a benign growth of conjunctival tissue that extends onto the cornea. It often presents as a wedge-shaped, fleshy growth and is usually found on the side closest to the nose. Pterygium is often associated with exposure to sunlight or wind, and its symptoms can include redness, irritation, or a feeling of something in the eye.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Pinguecula</strong>: Similar to a pterygium, a pinguecula is a benign, yellowish growth that occurs on the conjunctiva. It typically appears on the side of the eye nearest to the nose but does not grow onto the cornea. Pingueculae are also associated with long-term sun exposure and can cause irritation or dryness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Dermolipoma</strong>: This is a type of choristoma, like dermoids, but it primarily consists of fatty tissue. Dermolipomas are usually located on the outer corner of the eye and appear as soft, yellowish masses. They are generally benign and asymptomatic, but their size and location can occasionally cause cosmetic or functional concerns.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Recognizing and differentiating between various ocular surface lesions is crucial for appropriate diagnosis and management.

Phacoemulsification is a modern cataract surgery technique that uses ultrasonic vibrations to emulsify the lens, allowing for its removal and replacement with an IOL. This is a common treatment for cataracts that are significantly affecting vision.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Sunflower Cataract with Lens Extraction</strong>: Sunflower cataract is characterized by the presence of a central, sunflower-like opacity on the lens. It is commonly associated with conditions such as Wilson's disease, where copper deposits on the lens. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the cataractous lens (lens extraction), often followed by the implantation of an artificial intraocular lens (IOL).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Rosette Cataract with Control of Blood Sugar Level</strong>: A rosette cataract usually forms a star-shaped pattern and is often associated with trauma.

Understanding the underlying causes, such as diabetes, and recognizing the specific patterns associated with different types of cataracts are crucial for determining the appropriate treatment, which often involves surgery to restore vision. Regular monitoring and management of blood sugar levels are essential in diabetic patients to prevent or slow the progression of diabetic cataracts.</span></p>",

The condition arises from an antigen-antibody interaction, specifically involving antibodies against thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors, which mistakenly cross-react with extraocular muscle proteins. This interaction leads to inflammation, edema, and subsequent enlargement of the muscle belly, sparing the tendons.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The disease process is not directly related to the thyroid hormone status of the patient. Thus, managing the thyroid hormone levels does not directly improve TED. Instead, treatments like steroids and radiation therapy are used to control the inflammation and reduce edema. This is why the statement that TED improves with thyroid status treatment is incorrect.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/20/screenshot-2024-09-20-111537.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"465\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Vision loss may be seen in some cases:</strong> This statement is correct. In TED, the enlarged extraocular muscles within the confined orbital space can compress the optic nerve, leading to compressive optic neuropathy and potential vision loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. 10% may be euthyroid at presentation:</strong> This is true. Even though TED is commonly associated with hyperthyroidism, about 10% of patients can present with normal thyroid hormone levels, or a euthyroid state, because the underlying issue is an immune response rather than hormone levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. NOSPECS classification is used:</strong> Correct. The NOSPECS classification is widely used to grade the severity of thyroid eye disease, ranging from no signs (Class 0) to sight loss (Class 6). This classification helps in assessing and managing the disease progression.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Thyroid eye disease is primarily an immune-mediated condition that does not directly improve with the management of thyroid hormone levels; its treatment focuses on controlling inflammation through immunosuppressive therapies.</span></p>",

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>C) RE suppression</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The Worth 4-dot test is used to evaluate binocular vision and identify suppression of one eye or diplopia. The patient wears red-green goggles where the <strong>R</strong>ed lens is over the <strong>R</strong>ight eye (RE) and the green lens is over the left eye (LE). Normally, a person should see four dots: one red, two green, and one white dot that appears either as red, green, or mixed (brown), depending on which eye is dominant or if both eyes are functioning equally.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If a patient sees only three green dots, it indicates suppression of the right eye (RE). This is because the right eye, which should see the red dot, is not contributing to the vision, leading the patient to perceive only the green dots seen by the left eye.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/20/screenshot-2024-09-20-114619.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"295\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Crossed diplopia:</strong> In crossed diplopia, images from the right eye appear on the left side and vice versa, causing overlapping images. This does not match the scenario where only three green dots are seen.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/20/screenshot-2024-09-20-114636.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"209\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Uncrossed diplopia:</strong> Uncrossed diplopia occurs when images appear on the same side as the eye seeing them. It would involve seeing more dots (double vision) rather than missing a dot due to suppression.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/20/screenshot-2024-09-20-114653.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"218\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. LE suppression:</strong> Left eye suppression would result in the patient seeing only two red dots, as the left eye is not contributing to the vision. This does not match the observed scenario of seeing three green dots.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Seeing three green dots on the Worth 4-dot test indicates right eye suppression (RE suppression), as the right eye is not seeing the red dot.</span></p>",
