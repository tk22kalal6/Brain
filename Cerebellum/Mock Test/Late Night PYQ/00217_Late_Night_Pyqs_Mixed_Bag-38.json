Sevoflurane</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Sevoflurane is a versatile inhalation anesthetic that can be used for both the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Its sweet smell makes it suitable for inhalational induction, especially in pediatric patients and others who might find pungent agents unpleasant. Sevoflurane also provides a smooth transition for endotracheal intubation due to its bronchodilatory effects and stable hemodynamic profile. Additionally, its low blood-gas solubility coefficient allows for rapid induction and emergence from anesthesia, which is beneficial in a surgical setting.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;A. Halothane:</strong> While Halothane can be used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, it has a higher risk of hepatotoxicity and arrhythmias. It is also less commonly used in modern practice compared to Sevoflurane.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;B. Desflurane:</strong> Desflurane is typically used for maintenance rather than induction due to its pungent odor and tendency to cause airway irritation. It also requires a special heated vaporizer due to its high vapor pressure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;D. Isoflurane</strong>: Isoflurane is primarily used for maintenance of anesthesia rather than induction due to its pungent smell and potential to cause airway irritation. It is less suitable for inhalational induction compared to Sevoflurane.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective :</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Sevoflurane is an ideal agent for both the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and is safe for use during endotracheal intubation due to its favorable properties.</span></p>",

CMV esophagitis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">CMV (Cytomegalovirus) esophagitis is an infection of the esophagus caused by the Cytomegalovirus. It predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients. The characteristic endoscopic finding in CMV esophagitis is the presence of large, linear or serpiginous (snake-like) ulcers, often located in the distal esophagus. These ulcers typically have well-defined edges and are surrounded by relatively normal mucosa, which helps to differentiate them from other types of esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Candida Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Candida esophagitis is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans. It is common in immunocompromised patients or those on prolonged antibiotics or inhaled steroids. Endoscopic findings typically show white-yellow plaques or patches that can be scraped off, often described as having a \"cottage cheese-like\" appearance, rather than serpiginous ulcers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Herpetic Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Herpetic esophagitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. It is characterized by odynophagia (painful swallowing) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Endoscopically, herpetic esophagitis usually presents with small, well-circumscribed ulcers that resemble \"volcano-like\" or \"punched-out\" lesions, which are different from the serpiginous ulcers seen in CMV esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Radiation Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Radiation esophagitis is a side effect of radiation therapy, particularly for cancers in the chest area, such as lung cancer. It manifests with symptoms like pain, difficulty swallowing, and a sensation of something stuck in the throat. Endoscopic findings may include mucosal redness, swelling, and non-specific ulcerations, but not the distinct serpiginous ulcers typical of CMV esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Serpiginous ulcers in the esophagus observed during endoscopy are characteristic of CMV esophagitis, especially in immunocompromised patients. This feature helps differentiate it from other forms of esophagitis such as Candida, herpetic, and radiation-induced esophagitis.</span></p>",

Fracture neck of femur.&nbsp;</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Femoral neck fractures are a specific type of&nbsp;intracapsular hip fracture. The junctional location makes the femoral neck prone to fracture. They are associated with low energy falls in the elderly. In younger patients, the cause is usually secondary to high-energy trauma such as a substantial height or motor vehicle accidents.&nbsp;Risk factors include female gender, decreased mobility, and low bone density. Displaced fractures put the blood supply at risk, usually tearing the ascending cervical branches. This may compromise the healing of the fracture, inevitably causing non-union or osteonecrosis. Non-operative management for these fractures is rarely the treatment course. Young patients&nbsp;with femoral neck fractures will require treatment with emergent open reduction internal fixation. Non-displaced fractures are treated typically with percutaneous cannulated screws or a sliding hip screw.&nbsp;With displaced fractures in less active elderly patients, the treatment&nbsp;is given by hemiarthroplasty and with&nbsp;more active individuals, total hip arthroplasty is done.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture81.jpg\" style=\"height:331px; width:300px\" /></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The limb position of flexion, adduction and internal rotation (FADIR) is specific of posterior dislocation of the hip. </span></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>",

A) Bilious vomiting</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pylorus muscle lead to gastric outlet obstruction. This causes <strong>projectile, non-bilious vomiting</strong> because the obstruction is proximal to the bile duct entry into the duodenum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B</strong>. <strong>Visible peristalsis from left to right</strong>: Due to the obstruction caused by CHPS, there's an increase in gastric peristalsis as the stomach tries to push its contents past the hypertrophied pylorus. This can result in visible waves of peristalsis moving from the left side of the abdomen (where the stomach is located) to the right side (towards the pylorus) on giving a feed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C</strong>. <strong>Hypochloremia and hypokalemia</strong>: Persistent vomiting in CHPS can lead to the loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid). This results in hypochloremia due to the loss of chloride ions. The body also tries to compensate for the alkalosis by excreting more potassium in the kidneys, leading to hypokalemia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>D</strong>. <strong>Metabolic alkalosis</strong>: As mentioned earlier, the loss of gastric acid from repeated vomiting results in a state of metabolic alkalosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">CHPS (congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is most commonly seen in infants between 2 to 8 weeks of age.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</span></li></ul>",
