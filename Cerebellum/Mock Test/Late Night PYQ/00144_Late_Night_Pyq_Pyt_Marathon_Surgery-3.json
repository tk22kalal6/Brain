D) Genitofemoral</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) is responsible for referred pain from ureteric colic felt in the groin. This nerve arises from the lumbar plexus and divides into genital and femoral branches. The genital branch innervates the cremaster muscle and skin of the scrotum or labia majora, while the femoral branch supplies skin over the femoral triangle. When there is ureteric colic, the pain is referred along this nerve pathway to the groin area. The genitofemoral nerve is involved in the cremaster reflex, where scratching the inner thigh causes testicular elevation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Option&nbsp;A. Subcostal</strong> - This is a terminal branch of the T12 nerve that supplies the anterior abdominal wall. It doesn't have connections to the ureter that would explain referred pain to the groin.</li><li><strong>Option&nbsp;B. Iliohypogastric -</strong> While this nerve (L1) is situated at the posterior surface of kidney, it primarily supplies the skin of the lower abdomen and hip region. It's not the main pathway for ureteric pain referred to the groin.</li><li><strong>Option&nbsp;C. Ilioinguinal</strong> - This nerve (L1) supplies the inguinal region, upper part of scrotum, and root of penis or mons pubis in females. Though it runs near urological structures, it's not the primary nerve mediating referred ureteric pain to the groin.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) serves as the primary pathway for referred pain from ureteric colic to the groin due to its anatomical course and innervation of genital structures.</span></p>",

The surgeon must use the single layer, extramucosal suture technique.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The single-layer, extramucosal suture technique of Halstead involves using a single layer of sutures to join the two ends of the bowel together, while avoiding the mucosal layer. This technique is less time-consuming than the double-layer technique and reduces the risk of complications such as bleeding, stricture formation, and anastomotic leak.

The surgeon must use chromic catgut: &nbsp;</strong>Chromic catgut is a type of absorbable suture that is made from the collagen found in sheep or goat intestine. Chromic catgut has a relatively short duration of tensile strength, and so it is not recommended for use in areas of high tension or stress, including intestinal anastomosis.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:24px;\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. The surgeon must not include the submucosa in the sutures</strong>: The submucosa is a layer of tissue beneath the mucosal lining of the bowel. It should be included in sutures as it is the toughest layer of the bowel.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:24px;\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. The surgeon must use the single-layer seromuscular suture technique</strong>: The single-layer seromuscular suture technique involves suturing the seromuscular layer of the bowel to join the two ends together. This technique is quick and easy to perform but may not be suitable for all cases as it can increase the risk of anastomotic leakage and stenosis. Therefore, it is important to assess each case individually and choose the appropriate technique based on the specific circumstances.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The single-layer extramucosal suture technique is the preferred method in small bowel anastomosis to reduce complications such as bleeding, strictures, and anastomotic leaks.</span></p>",

This is because the thyroid gland is anatomically located in the neck, and even when a goiter extends behind the sternum into the chest, the neck provides the most direct and least invasive access for surgical removal. The retrosternal portion of the goiter can usually be mobilized and delivered into the neck for excision without the need for more invasive thoracic approaches. The vascular supply of the goiter also predominantly comes from cervical vessels like the inferior thyroid artery, making the neck approach feasible and effective.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Chest:&nbsp;</strong>Surgical approaches through the chest are typically not used for retrosternal goiters. Accessing the thyroid gland through the chest would involve more invasive procedures, such as thoracotomy, and is generally reserved for rare cases with specific indications, such as very large goiters extending deeply into the chest cavity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Median Sternotomy:&nbsp;</strong>Median sternotomy involves cutting through the breastbone (sternum) to access structures within the chest, particularly the heart and major blood vessels. While median sternotomy is common for cardiac surgeries, it is not the primary approach for treating retrosternal goiters, which can typically be addressed via the neck.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D.

C) Aneurysm</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hunterian ligature operation refers to proximal ligation of the feeding artery to treat an aneurysm. This surgical technique was pioneered by John Hunter, who recognized that ligating the artery proximal to the aneurysm could reduce blood flow into the aneurysmal sac, allowing it to thrombose and potentially shrink over time.

Hunterian ligation is not used for varicose veins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B: Arteriovenous fistulae</strong> Incorrect.

It can be particularly helpful in assessing small lesions or stones that might be missed by other imaging modalities. It would be utilised if MRCP/CECT did not yield adequate diagnosis, or for staging of periampullary tumors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography:&nbsp;</strong>This is an invasive procedure where contrast is injected directly into the biliary system through the liver, and then X-rays are taken. It can be diagnostic as well as therapeutic (e.g., for bile duct drainage). However, it's more invasive than MRCP and might not be the first choice for solely diagnostic purposes in a 72-year-old patient.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):&nbsp;</strong>ERCP is both diagnostic and therapeutic. It involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth to the duodenum and injecting contrast into the bile and pancreatic ducts. While ERCP can visualize and treat obstructions, it's invasive and carries risks like pancreatitis, especially if used primarily for diagnostic purposes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Obstructive jaundice is a condition in which there is a blockage of the flow of bile out of the liver.
