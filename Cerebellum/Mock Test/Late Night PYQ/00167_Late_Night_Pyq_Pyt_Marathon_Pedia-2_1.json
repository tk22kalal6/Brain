This results in impaired linear growth, making the child shorter than expected for their age. Height for age is the key indicator used to measure stunting.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Acute Malnutrition (Wasting):&nbsp;</strong>Acute malnutrition, or wasting, is characterized by a rapid loss of weight relative to height. It is usually the result of a recent illness or severe food shortage. Weight for height is the primary measure of wasting, not height for age.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Recent Infection:&nbsp;</strong>While a recent infection can temporarily affect a child's weight or growth velocity, it does not typically lead to chronic stunting unless the child experiences recurrent infections over a long period.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>No Malnutrition:&nbsp;</strong>If a child's height for age is within the normal range, it indicates adequate nutrition and growth.

A) Intussusception</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Intussusception&nbsp;</strong>is a condition where a portion of the bowel is telescoped into an adjacent segment, with the apex of the intussusceptum being more prone to ischemia which leads to gangrene. The most common location of intussusception is ileocolic. It is commonly seen in infants during the weaning period following the introduction of new food, vaccination, or upper respiratory tract infection. The currently approved rotavirus vaccines are associated with very minimal risk of intussusception. An area of enlarged submucosal Peyer's patch acts as a lead point for intussusception.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>The clinical scenario&nbsp;</strong>of pain abdomen with a palpable mass in the right lumbar region along with the barium enema showing claw sign is suggestive of intussusception. Some lead points in children are Meckel's diverticulum, intestinal polyp, inflamed appendix, submucosal hemorrhage seen in Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and intestinal duplication cysts. Patients usually present with cramping abdominal pain, palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, vomiting, and passage of red currant jelly stools.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Diagnosis&nbsp;</strong>is confirmed by abdominal ultrasound which shows the target sign bull's eye sign and pseudokidney sign. <strong>Management</strong> of intussusception includes prompt referral to a pediatric surgeon for reduction by air or contrast enema or surgical intervention if there is a failure of non-operative reduction or clinical instability.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Volvulus:&nbsp;</strong>Volvulus, specifically sigmoid volvulus, shows a characteristic \"coffee bean\" sign on imaging. It involves the twisting of the intestine around itself, which can lead to obstruction and ischemia but presents differently on imaging.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Duodenal Atresia:&nbsp;</strong>Duodenal atresia typically presents with a \"double bubble\" sign on imaging, which results from the dilatation of the stomach and proximal duodenum. This condition leads to bilious vomiting and is evident soon after birth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

B) Ability to compare objects</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When a child transfers an object from one hand to another, it signifies their ability to compare objects. This milestone typically occurs around 5.5 to 6 months of age. At this stage, the child is beginning to understand the differences between objects, which is why they are capable of transferring an object between hands. This action demonstrates the child's growing cognitive ability to recognize and compare different objects, an important part of early development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Visual motor coordination</strong>: Visual motor coordination refers to the ability to use the eyes and hands together to perform tasks, such as reaching for and grasping objects. While this is important for transferring objects, the key developmental significance of transferring an object from one hand to another lies in the child's ability to compare objects.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Ability to handle small objects</strong>: The ability to handle small objects, such as developing a pincer grasp, occurs later, typically around 8 to 9 months of age. This milestone involves more fine motor control and precision, which is different from the broader action of transferring objects between hands.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Voluntary release</strong>: Voluntary release refers to the ability to let go of an object intentionally, which is generally seen after the palmar grasp reflex disappears around 4 to 6 months.
