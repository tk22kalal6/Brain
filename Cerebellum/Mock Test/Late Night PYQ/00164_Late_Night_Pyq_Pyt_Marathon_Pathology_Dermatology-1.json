Think about what's happening here - the patient has anemia (shown by fatigue, pallor, weakness, and low hemoglobin), but interestingly, only the red blood cell line is affected. The white cells and platelets are completely normal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The hallmark of red cell aplasia is that there is a selective reduction in erythroid precursors. The reduced reticulocyte count is also important as it tell us that the bone marrow isn't even trying to compensate for the anemia</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Red cell aplasia can happen for several reasons - parvovirus B19 infection, certain medications, autoimmune disorders, or sometimes associated with thymomas.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A</strong>: Aplastic anaemia If this were aplastic anemia, our patient would be having pancytopenia (low counts across all cell types). Our patient's normal WBC and platelets immediately rule this out.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C</strong>: Iron deficiency anemia; in IDA, the body typically responds by pumping out more reticulocytes to try to compensate. Our patient has reduced Reticulocyte count ruling this out.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D</strong>: Hemolytic anemia would show increased red cell precursors leading to high reticulocyte count.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This question tests knowledge of the differential diagnosis of anemia based on bone marrow findings and cellular indices. Specifically, it assesses the ability to recognize the characteristic pattern of red cell aplasia: selective reduction of erythroid precursors with normal myeloid and megakaryocytic lines, accompanied by anemia and low reticulocyte count. The key distinguishing feature is the selective involvement of only the red cell line, differentiating it from other anemias that show different patterns of cell production or destruction.</span></p>",

Coordinated peristaltic contractions are absent, and functional obstruction occurs, resulting in proximal dilation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel leads to an inability to coordinate peristaltic contractions, resulting in functional obstruction and proximal bowel dilation. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal distension, constipation, and failure to pass meconium shortly after birth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease is made based on a combination of clinical presentation, radiographic findings, and histologic examination of rectal biopsy specimens.

Reactive Arthritis (formerly known as Reiter's syndrome) typically presents with a triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis, often following gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections. Keratoderma blennorrhagicum appears as pustular skin lesions that resemble psoriasis, typically on the palms and soles. It is considered part of the characteristic clinical presentation of reactive arthritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong> - RA is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, morning stiffness, and systemic manifestations. Skin manifestations in RA include rheumatoid nodules, but not keratoderma blennorrhagicum, which is specific to reactive arthritis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Psoriatic Arthritis</strong> - While psoriatic arthritis does have skin manifestations (primarily psoriatic plaques), keratoderma blennorrhagicum specifically refers to the pustular lesions seen in reactive arthritis. Though they can appear similar to pustular psoriasis, they are distinct clinical entities.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Ankylosing Spondylitis</strong> - AS primarily affects the axial skeleton, causing sacroiliitis and spinal fusion. While it shares genetic associations (HLA-B27) with reactive arthritis, keratoderma blennorrhagicum is not a typical manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Keratoderma blennorrhagicum, characterized by pustular skin lesions resembling psoriasis on the palms and soles, is a distinctive cutaneous manifestation of Reactive Arthritis, which typically occurs following gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections.</span></p>",

Blood flows from portal tracts (containing branches of portal vein and hepatic artery) toward the central vein, creating an oxygen gradient. Hepatocytes in the centrilobular region receive blood that has already passed through other zones, making them most susceptible to hypoxia during compromised circulation. Left-sided cardiac failure or shock may lead to hepatic hypoperfusion and hypoxia, causing ischemic coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes in the central region of the lobule (centrilobular necrosis).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Periportal</strong> - The periportal region (Zone 1) is closest to the incoming blood supply from both portal vein and hepatic artery branches. It receives blood with the highest oxygen concentration, making it most resistant to ischemic injury.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Midzonal</strong> - The midzonal region (Zone 2) lies between periportal and centrilobular areas. It has intermediate vulnerability to ischemic injury, becoming affected after the centrilobular region but before the periportal region.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Perihepatic</strong> - This is not a standard term in liver lobular architecture. The liver lobule is divided into centrilobular, midzonal, and periportal regions based on proximity to central veins and portal tracts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The centrilobular region is most vulnerable to ischemic injury due to its location farthest from the blood supply, making it the first area to suffer during hypoxic conditions like cardiac failure or shock.</span></p>",

Normally, there are four alpha globin genes in total (two on each chromosome 16). The silent carrier state results from the deletion of just one alpha globin gene, causing a barely detectable reduction in alpha-globin chain synthesis. Individuals with this condition are completely asymptomatic but might have slight microcytosis (small red cells).

Alpha thalassemia trait</strong> - This is incorrect. Alpha thalassemia trait results from the deletion of two alpha globin genes, either both from the same chromosome (--/αα) or one from each chromosome (-α/-α).

These abnormal inclusions represent accumulations of mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans) within the cytoplasm of these cells. Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by defective degradation of glycosaminoglycans due to enzyme deficiencies, leading to their accumulation in various tissues including blood cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

D) Histamine&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Histamine is involved in the mediation of inflammatory vascular events rather than fever.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fever is defined by an increase in body temperature of 1° to 4°C. It is a prominent manifestation of the acute-phase response, particularly when associated with infection.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pyrogens are substances that cause fever. They can be either exogenous or endogenous.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Endogenous progens include IL-1, TNF, and prostaglandins.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Exogenous pyrogens are bacterial lipopolysaccharides that stimulate leukocytes to release endogenous progens (IL-1 and TNF)</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cytokines increase the activity of cyclooxygenases, which convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. These prostaglandins are produced in the hypothalamic vascular and perivascular cells. They stimulate the production of neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus, which raises the temperature setpoint. This is especially true of PGE2.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Options A. IL-1, B. Prostaglandins&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> C. TNF:</strong> These are all endogenous pyrogens that directly contribute to the fever response by influencing the temperature regulation in the hypothalamus and stimulating the production of prostaglandins that raise the body’s temperature setpoint.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Histamine is involved in mediating the local vascular effects of inflammation and not in the fever response, which is primarily driven by IL-1, TNF, and prostaglandins.</span></p>",
