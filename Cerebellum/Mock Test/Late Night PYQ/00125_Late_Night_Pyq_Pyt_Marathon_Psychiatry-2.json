B) Adjustment disorder</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The patient's symptoms – depressive mood, irritability, and worry about the future – began after a clear stressor, which in this case is the loss of his job. While he has some features of depression, the ability to temporarily feel better, such as when seeing movies with friends, makes a major depressive episode less likely.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This disorder arises within three months of a particular stressor (e.g., job loss) and resolves within six months after the stressor ends or the individual adapts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Mixed anxiety with depression:</strong> This isn’t a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. While the patient has symptoms of both, the clear onset after job loss points more towards adjustment disorder.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;D.

It manifests with emotional or behavioral symptoms which include depressed mood, anxiety, worry, a feeling of inability to cope and some degree of disturbance in individuals daily functioning. The symptoms typically <strong>remit within 6 months</strong> if the stressor has ended. <strong>Treatment of choice is supportive psychotherapy.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Reference: A Short Textbook of Psychiatry, 7th edition, Page No 112.</strong></span></p>",

This condition is typically associated with narcolepsy and does not involve loss of consciousness. The episodes usually last less than 1-2 minutes. During an episode, the person may collapse or fall but remains fully aware of their surroundings.

The goal is to reduce the harm associated with opioid use, such as the risks of HIV, Hepatitis, and illegal activities related to drug procurement. In OST, opioids like <strong>buprenorphine or methadone</strong> are used to replace more harmful opioids like heroin or morphine. These substitutions help control withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse while allowing the patient to live a more stable life. Buprenorphine, being a partial opioid agonist, is preferred because it reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms without the euphoric effects associated with other opioids, making it an effective substitute in OST.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

It may be used to manage withdrawal symptoms during detoxification but does not replace opioids during the maintenance phase.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Naltrexone:&nbsp;</strong>Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, meaning it blocks the effects of opioids rather than substituting them. It can be used in the <strong>maintenance phase</strong> of opioid dependence but is not part of OST because it does not substitute one opioid for another.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Naloxone:&nbsp;</strong>Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used <strong>primarily to reverse opioid overdose</strong>. It is not used in OST because it does not have the substitutive effects needed for maintenance therapy in opioid dependence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Opioid Substitution Therapy involves replacing a harmful opioid with a safer opioid like oral buprenorphine or methadone during the maintenance phase of treatment.</span></p>",
