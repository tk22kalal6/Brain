Immature cataract with Phacoemulsification + IOL implantation</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Immature cataract refers to a cataract that has not yet progressed to cause complete opacity and loss of vision. Phacoemulsification is a modern cataract surgery technique that uses ultrasonic vibrations to emulsify the lens, allowing for its removal and replacement with an IOL. This is a common treatment for cataracts that are significantly affecting vision.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Sunflower Cataract with Lens Extraction</strong>: Sunflower cataract is characterized by the presence of a central, sunflower-like opacity on the lens. It is commonly associated with conditions such as Wilson's disease, where copper deposits on the lens. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the cataractous lens (lens extraction), often followed by the implantation of an artificial intraocular lens (IOL).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Rosette Cataract with Control of Blood Sugar Level</strong>: A rosette cataract usually forms a star-shaped pattern and is often associated with trauma. While controlling blood sugar levels is essential for patients with diabetes to prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy and other complications, it may not reverse the changes already present in the lens.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Zonular Cataract with Lensectomy</strong>: Zonular cataract refers to the opacities that affect the zone or region of the lens. A lensectomy involves the surgical removal of the lens, which can be applied to different types of cataracts, often followed by the placement of an IOL.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective</strong>:&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The diagnosis of cataracts involves a thorough examination of the lens using slit-lamp microscopy or similar diagnostic tools. Understanding the underlying causes, such as diabetes, and recognizing the specific patterns associated with different types of cataracts are crucial for determining the appropriate treatment, which often involves surgery to restore vision. Regular monitoring and management of blood sugar levels are essential in diabetic patients to prevent or slow the progression of diabetic cataracts.</span></p>",

Transiente tachypnea of newborn</strong>: This option is incorrect because transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a self-limited condition seen in term infants caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. It typically resolves without the need for surfactant administration.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

A) Wilson’s disease</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The most probable diagnosis for this patient, based on the clinical presentation and the image showing icterus in the eyes, is Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which leads to abnormal copper metabolism. This results in copper accumulation in various tissues, including the liver, brain, cornea, and kidneys.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The presence of intentional tremors, poor scholastic performance, and hepatomegaly are consistent with Wilson's disease. The eye finding likely represents a Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring, a characteristic feature of Wilson's disease. The KF ring is a brownish or golden ring around the cornea, which is caused by copper deposition in the Descemet's membrane of the cornea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Unlike Wilson's disease, Huntington's chorea does not typically present with hepatomegaly or KF rings.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Glutaric aciduria</strong>: Glutaric aciduria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that usually presents in the first 6 months of life. Clinical features include hypotonia, jitteriness, and progressive hyperkinetic movements (dystonia, choreoathetosis). This disorder does not present with the eye findings seen in the image or the liver involvement typical of Wilson's disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hepatitis A</strong>: Hepatitis A is a viral infection transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route.

PTA with stenting:&nbsp;</strong>PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) involves the insertion of a catheter through the skin and into the obstructed artery. The catheter has a tiny balloon at its tip which, once in place, is inflated to widen the artery and restore blood flow. A stent (a tiny mesh tube) is then placed in the newly opened artery to help keep it open. This minimally invasive procedure is ideal for certain short segment and localized obstructions, but might not be the first choice for larger (as seen in the image) or more complicated obstructions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Femoro-iliac bypass:&nbsp;</strong>This surgical procedure reroutes blood flow around a blocked or narrowed iliac artery by creating a bypass using a graft that connects the femoral artery to the iliac artery.

C) Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare, genetic, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system characterized by a distinctive \"tigroid\" pattern on MRI. This pattern arises from the preservation of perivascular myelin in the brain's white matter, interspersed with areas of demyelination, creating a striped or tigroid appearance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Pantothenate kinase deficiency:&nbsp;</strong>This condition is also known as PKAN (Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration). It typically shows a characteristic MRI feature known as the \"eye of the tiger\" sign, which involves a specific pattern of iron deposition in the basal ganglia. The \"eye of the tiger\" sign appears due to a combination of hyperintense signal surrounded by a region of hypointensity on T2-weighted MRI images, reflecting iron accumulation and gliosis. This is distinct from the tigroid pattern seen in demyelinating diseases.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Neuroferritinopathy:&nbsp;</strong>Neuroferritinopathy is another disorder of iron metabolism that affects the brain, leading to iron accumulation, particularly in the basal ganglia. MRI findings in neuroferritinopathy typically do not include the tigroid pattern but may show abnormalities such as signal changes in the basal ganglia related to iron deposition. The imaging features here are more associated with iron accumulation rather than the patchy demyelination that produces the tigroid appearance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Aceruloplasminemia:&nbsp;</strong>Aceruloplasminemia is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by iron accumulation in various tissues, including the brain. Similar to neuroferritinopathy, the primary MRI findings in aceruloplasminemia are related to iron deposition, particularly in the cerebellum and basal ganglia, and do not typically involve the tigroid pattern. Instead, the imaging might show evidence of iron accumulation without the specific changes associated with demyelination.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a prototypical condition that displays a tigroid pattern on MRI. This appearance is due to the patchy preservation and destruction of myelin in the white matter, creating alternating areas of normal myelin and demyelination. This results in the characteristic striped or tigroid appearance on imaging studies, reflective of the disease’s impact on myelination.</span></p>",
