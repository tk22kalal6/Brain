Dermoid cyst</strong>. A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure.&nbsp;These benign tumors are lined by stratified squamous epithelium with mature skin appendages found on their wall and their lumens filled with keratin and hair.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts are considered to be congenital, but not all of them are diagnosed at birth.&nbsp;Only about 40% of dermoid cysts are diagnosed at birth, while about 60% are diagnosed by five years of age. The dermoid cysts usually present within the first year of life and grow slowly.&nbsp;Dermoid cysts occur most commonly on the head and neck. The etiology of dermoid cysts&nbsp;remains mostly unknown. These occur when skin and skin structures become trapped during fetal development.&nbsp;In the head and neck region, dermoid cysts can most commonly be seen in the frontal, occipital, and supraorbital areas, with the outer third of the eyebrow being the most frequently affected region.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture13_fTE459u.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after multiple myeloma. It is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. All patients report progressive pain. Night pain is also reported in about 25% patients. Characteristic findings are Codman’s triangle and Sunburst periosteal reaction. It is the most radioresistant bone tumor and treated by chemotherapy followed by limb salvage surgery/amputation followed by chemotherapy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture14_3f4Ne5o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"182\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Chondroblastoma.</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chondroblastoma is a rare type of benign tumor that grows at the ends of the long bones, close to the joints. Most often, the tumors develop at the ends of the femur, tibia, or humerus. They typically occur in children and young adults, and are more common in males. Although chondroblastomas are not cancerous, they can continue to grow if left untreated. A growing tumor can destroy the surrounding bone, making it painful to move the nearby joint. The cause of chondroblastomas is not known. The tumors are thought to arise from the growth plates at the ends of the bones, near joints. Classic <strong>“chicken wire” </strong>calcification is seen. Epiphysis + calcification + upper end humerus = Chondroblastoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/01/02/picture16_KKxJopm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"316\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tumor of distal end radius is always GCT until proven otherwise.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Mc site of giant cell tumor is lower end femur.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Lower end femur is Mc site for:</strong></span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Giant cell tumor</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteosarcoma</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteomyelitis</span></li></ul></li></ul>",

In PUJO, the obstruction occurs at the junction between the renal pelvis and the ureter, causing the pelvis to become disproportionately dilated compared to the calyces. This results in significant thinning of the renal tissue, which is evident in the image.

Hyperkalemia can cause a shift in the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value, increased cell excitability, and impairments in membrane potential changes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Hyperkalemia can affect the resting membrane potential of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, in the following ways:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons. However, in hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration can lead to an increased positive charge outside the cell. This positive charge tends to depolarize the cell membrane, shifting the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Altered Excitability: The increased resting membrane potential caused by hyperkalemia can make the cell more excitable. It reduces the threshold required for an action potential to be initiated, making the cell more likely to depolarize and generate an action potential even in response to weaker stimuli.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Impaired Membrane Potential Changes: Hyperkalemia can interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to depolarize and repolarize properly during an action potential. It reduces the electrochemical gradient for sodium (Na+) entry during depolarization and decreases the driving force for potassium (K+) exit during repolarization. This can result in slower and less efficient propagation of action potentials.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;Disrupted Ionic Balance: Elevated potassium levels can disrupt the balance of other ions, such as sodium and calcium, which are essential for normal cell function. The altered ionic balance can interfere with the proper functioning of ion channels and other membrane proteins involved in generating and regulating action potentials.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. No change:</strong> Incorrect. Changes in extracellular potassium concentrations directly impact the resting membrane potential.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Becomes more negative:</strong> Incorrect. An increase in extracellular potassium concentration results in depolarization (more positive resting membrane potential), not hyperpolarization.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. First becomes more positive, then negative:</strong> Incorrect. While complex fluctuations can occur under dynamic conditions, primarily, hyperkalemia causes a persistent depolarization (more positive shift) without an initial opposite change.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In hyperkalemia, as seen in patients with severe muscle injury, the resting membrane potential becomes more positive due to decreased potassium efflux, leading to increased excitability of nerve and muscle cells. This can affect the normal function of these cells, potentially leading to complications such as muscle weakness or cardiac arrhythmias.</span></p>",

These medications work synergistically to inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent thrombus formation within the stent.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">The patient is already on aspirin 75 mg daily, so the addition of a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is necessary to complete the DAPT regimen. This combination has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of stent thrombosis and other cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Guidelines on the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) &ndash; </span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Drug-Eluting Stents (DES)</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: A minimum of 6 months of DAPT is recommended.
