      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Correct Answer: A. Cellular swelling</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cellular swelling is not a feature of apoptosis. In fact, the opposite occurs in apoptosis - cells undergoing apoptosis demonstrate cell shrinkage rather than swelling. Apoptosis is characterized by reduction in cell size (shrinkage) and the formation of membrane-bound fragments called apoptotic bodies. This is in contrast to necrosis, where cellular swelling is a prominent early feature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The morphologic features of apoptosis include cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation (nuclear compaction), formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies, and maintenance of an intact plasma membrane until late in the process. These features allow for the orderly disposal of cellular contents without triggering inflammation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Nuclear compaction</strong> - This is a characteristic feature of apoptosis. Chromatin condensation or compaction is one of the most characteristic features of apoptosis, where the chromatin aggregates peripherally under the nuclear membrane into dense masses of various shapes and sizes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intact cell membrane</strong> - This is a feature of apoptosis. Unlike necrosis where there is early loss of membrane integrity, in apoptosis the plasma membrane remains intact throughout most of the process. This prevents leakage of cellular contents and thus prevents inflammation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cytoplasmic eosinophilia</strong> - This is a feature of apoptosis. The cytoplasm of apoptotic cells appears more eosinophilic (red) when stained with H&amp;E due to increased protein density as the cell shrinks and becomes more compact. Apoptotic cells are often described as having a rounded or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Apoptosis features cell shrinkage (not swelling), intact plasma membrane, nuclear compaction, and increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, representing a regulated form of cell death that avoids inflammation, in contrast to necrosis which is characterized by cellular swelling and membrane rupture.</span></p>",

The <strong>toxin produced by the organism acts on GM1 ganglioside receptors</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Vibrio cholerae is a comma-shaped, gram-negative bacillus with darting motility. It has <u>a single</u> <u>polar flagellum.</u> It causes cholera, an acute diarrheal disease. It is marked by painless, profuse, watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (rice water stools) associated with effortless vomiting. Pulmonary edema and arrhythmias are some of the complications.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infection is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food and water. The organisms produce an enterotoxin known as cholera toxin (CT). It has 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B subunit (binding units) fixes to the GM1 ganglioside receptors on jejunal epithelial cells. The A subunit dissociates into the A2 fragment, which attaches the A1 fragment to the B subunit. This results in prolonged <strong>accumulation of cAMP,</strong> which causes an outpouring of large amounts of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. Ultimately, it results in profuse watery diarrhea.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In addition to the cholera toxin, additional toxins such <u>as zona occludes toxin and accessory</u> <u>cholera toxin are also produced</u>. The former alters intestinal permeability by its action on intestinal epithelial cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The characteristic <strong>darting mobility</strong> and its hindrance by antiserum can be used for rapid microscopic diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Fluid resuscitation by rice-based ORS is recommended</strong>.

A) Maternal inheritance</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The mitochondrial genome is inherited maternally, which means it is passed down from the mother to her offspring. This is because mitochondria are typically inherited from the cytoplasm of the egg cell. Sperm contributes very little, if any, mitochondria to the zygote, and paternal mitochondria are usually degraded after fertilization.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;B. Low Rate of Mutation: False </strong>Mitochondrial DNA is known to have a relatively high mutation rate compared to nuclear DNA. This higher mutation rate is partly due to the lack of protective histones and efficient DNA repair mechanisms in mitochondria. As a result, mutations in mitochondrial DNA can accumulate over time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;C. Single-stranded DNA: False </strong>Mitochondrial DNA is double-stranded, just like nuclear DNA. It forms a circular double-stranded DNA molecule. This structure is distinct from the single-stranded DNA found in some viruses and certain cellular processes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option&nbsp;D. Paternal Inheritance: False </strong>Mitochondrial DNA is not inherited from the father; it is exclusively maternally inherited. Paternal mitochondria are generally not passed on to the offspring during fertilization.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Mitochondrial DNA and RNA:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">There is a dichotomy on the mitochondrial metabolism. Some of the mitochondrial protein synthesis is under the control of mitochondrial DNA; but <strong>important proteins of the outer membrane of the mitochondria are synthesized under the influence of nuclear DNA.</strong></span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The <strong>mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is circular</strong>, has about <strong>16,500 nucleotides</strong>. The mtDNA has information for synthesis of 2 ribosomal RNAs, <strong>22 tRNAs</strong> and <strong>13 proteins</strong>. All of them are components of electron transport chain. It has 37 genes that encode 13 protein subunits of the respiratory chain (total of 67 i.e., <strong>about 20%).</strong> However, most of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and synthesized in the cytoplasm.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Maternal inheritance: Since, the mitochondria are inherited cytoplasmically, the mtDNA is inherited from the mother. Mother transmits mtDNA through oocyte.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">There are hundreds of copies of mtDNA in each cell (nuclear DNA has only 2 copies).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Heteroplasmy&nbsp;</strong>is defined as the presence of normal and mutant mtDNA in different proportions in different cells.

The Lyon hypothesis (X-chromosome inactivation) actually explains why some heterozygous females can be affected by G6PD deficiency, though typically less severely than males. During early embryonic development, one X chromosome in each female cell is randomly inactivated. If a higher proportion of cells have the normal X chromosome inactivated, these females can express symptoms of G6PD deficiency. This variable inactivation creates a mosaic pattern in heterozygous females rather than contradicting the hypothesis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

G6PD deficiency is indeed an X-linked recessive disorder, which places males at much higher risk for symptomatic disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. More severe in males</strong> - This is correct. Since males have only one X chromosome, if they inherit the defective G6PD gene, they will express the disorder fully, making the condition typically more severe in males.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. May affect heterozygous females</strong> - This is correct. Heterozygous females can be affected due to random X-inactivation, where some cells express the defective G6PD gene, potentially leading to clinical manifestations.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that follows the principles of the Lyon hypothesis, with males being more severely affected, while heterozygous females may show variable expression depending on X-chromosome inactivation patterns.</span></p>",

Secondary dissemination to the liver</strong> - While Nocardia can disseminate to various organs from primary pulmonary infection, liver involvement is not specifically identified as a characteristic or common site of Nocardia infection. The brain, skin, kidneys, bone, and muscle are more typical sites of dissemination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Colonic diverticulosis</strong> - This is incorrect because colonic diverticulosis is not an infectious condition caused by Nocardia or any other microorganism.

This creates a concentration gradient where the sodium concentration is higher outside the cell.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter: The sodium gradient generated by the sodium-potassium pump is utilized by a specific protein called the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT). This cotransporter binds both sodium ions and glucose molecules on the outer surface of the cell.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Co-transport of Sodium and Glucose: As sodium ions bind to the SGLT protein, their movement into the cell down the concentration gradient provides the necessary energy for the simultaneous movement of glucose against its concentration gradient. Glucose is &quot;dragged&quot; along with the sodium ions as they enter the cell.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Glucose Transporter: Once inside the epithelial cell, glucose is transported across the basolateral membrane (the inner surface of the cell) and into the bloodstream by facilitated diffusion through a specific glucose transporter called GLUT2.</span></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Overall, the energy stored in the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump is used to actively transport both sodium and glucose into the intestinal epithelial cells. This secondary active transport mechanism allows for the absorption of glucose from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream efficiently, even when the concentration of glucose is higher inside the cell than in the lumen.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/05/27/screenshot-2024-05-27-093516.png\" style=\"height:451px; width:700px\" /></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

Facilitated diffusion</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: Incorrect as this method does not involve the active transport of glucose against its concentration gradient; it only allows movement along the gradient.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option C. Simple diffusion</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">: Incorrect because simple diffusion does not involve any transport proteins and occurs only along the concentration gradient, which is not sufficient for glucose absorption in the intestine.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Educational Objective:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Glucose absorption in the intestine occurs via secondary active transport, utilizing the energy from the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium ATPase to transport glucose against its concentration gradient.
