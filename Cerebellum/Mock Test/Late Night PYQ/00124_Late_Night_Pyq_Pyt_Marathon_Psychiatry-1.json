While they can occur in organic conditions like severe intoxications or delirium, they are most commonly observed in mental health disorders such as schizophrenia or severe depression.

Starvation leads to a drop in GnRH, which lowers FSH and LH levels, resulting in decreased estrogen and subsequent menstrual irregularities or absence. While amenorrhea was once a diagnostic criterion in DSM-IV and ICD-10, it is no longer required in DSM-5 or ICD-11—but it remains a common clinical feature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The repeated exposure of teeth to stomach acid leads to enamel erosion and caries—less typical in the restricting subtype of anorexia<strong>.</strong></span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Antisocial Behavior:&nbsp;</strong>Neither disorder is primarily associated with antisocial traits. However, bulimia nervosa has stronger links to impulsivity and emotion dysregulation. In contrast, anorexia nervosa is often marked by control, rigidity, and perfectionism.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Craving for Food:&nbsp;</strong>Intense food cravings, particularly those leading to binge eating, are more characteristic of bulimia nervosa. While people with anorexia may think obsessively about food, they usually resist these urges rather than act on them.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Amenorrhea is a hallmark physiological consequence of the nutritional and hormonal imbalances seen in anorexia nervosa. Recognizing this and other subtle distinctions between anorexia and bulimia can help guide both diagnosis and management.</span></p>",
