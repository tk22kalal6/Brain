The key characteristic feature of scorpion bite is autonomic storm, and sometimes cholinergic storm. This subject is having the features of both storms as described below.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">Scorpion </span><span style=\"background-color:white;color:#212121;font-size:12.0pt;\">Toxins affect various ion channels. By acting on sodium (excitation) and potassium (blocking) channels, the toxin prolongs depolarization at postsynaptic postganglionic nerve terminals of ANS. This cause a massive release of sympathetic and parasympathetic mediators, resulting in mixed neuroexcitatory syndrome.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Clinical Manifestations of Scorpion bite:&nbsp;</strong>Main manifestation of scorpion bite is adrenergic (autonomic storm). Sometimes Cholinergic (muscarinic) storm occurs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"background-color:white;color:#212121;font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Adrenergic Storm:&nbsp;</strong>Overstimulation of sympathetic system result in “adrenergic storm” which consists of cardiac (tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, hypertension, diaphoresis), metabolic (hyperthermia, hyperglycaemia), urogenital (urinary retention), respiratory (bronchial dilation, tachypnea), and neuromuscular (mydriasis, tremor, agitation, convulsions).</span></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:48px;\">&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"background-color:white;color:#212121;font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Cholinergic syndrome:&nbsp;</strong>Overstimulation of parasympathetic system result in a hypersecretion syndrome (salivation, sweating, vomiting, urinary incontinence, bronchial hypersecretion, and diarrhea), abdominal pain, miosis, bronchospasm, bradycardia with hypotension and, in the male, priapism.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Management:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Prazosin–</strong>a post-synaptic alpha1, adreno-receptor antagonist–is the first line of management. It suppresses sympathetic outflow and activates K channels.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><i><strong>Scorpion Antivenom:&nbsp;</strong></i>Scorpion venom act very fast. Anti-venom has to be given within 30 minutes of sting to be effective. So anti-venom is useful only in limited cases which present very early.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A) Anti-snake venom:&nbsp;</strong>Not useful in scorpion bite</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B) Methylprednisolone:&nbsp; </strong><i>Steroids are not useful in scorpion bite, and </i>moreover steroids might enhance the necrotizing effects of catecholamines on myocardium.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D) Adrenaline:</strong> It will further worsen autonomic storm</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Prazosin</strong> is the first-line treatment for scorpion envenomation due to its ability to suppress sympathetic outflow and mitigate the effects of the autonomic storm.</span></p>",

Additionally, vitamin C is essential for the post-translational modification of collagen, where proline is converted to hydroxyproline and lysine to hydroxylysine. This modification strengthens collagen fibers; without sufficient vitamin C, collagen becomes weak, leading to symptoms such as bleeding gums due to fragile blood vessels.

These catecholamines are metabolized in the body, and one of the metabolites is vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA). Elevated levels of VMA in urine can be indicative of pheochromocytoma.

D) Pyruvate dehydrogenase</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Congenital lactic acidosis occurs when there is an accumulation of lactic acid in the body from birth, often due to a metabolic defect. In normal metabolism, glucose is converted to pyruvate through glycolysis. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria, where it is converted into acetyl-CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. Acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs cycle to produce energy in the form of ATP.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When there is a deficiency or defect in the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme, pyruvate cannot be converted to acetyl-CoA.

The Warburg effect is characterized by cancer cells utilizing glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis), leading to the production of lactate. This metabolic shift is a hallmark of many cancer cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Makes cancer cells immortal:&nbsp;</strong>This statement is not true. The Warburg effect is a metabolic phenomenon observed in many cancer cells where they preferentially use glycolysis to generate energy, but it does not make cancer cells immortal. Immortality of cancer cells is typically associated with mutations that allow them to evade normal cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Produce more ATP:&nbsp;</strong>This statement is not true in the context of the Warburg effect. While glycolysis is less efficient at producing ATP compared to oxidative phosphorylation (which occurs in the mitochondria), cancer cells under the Warburg effect primarily generate ATP through glycolysis, which is less efficient but provides other metabolic advantages to rapidly dividing cancer cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Decrease glucose uptake:</strong> This statement is not true. Cancer cells under the Warburg effect often increase their glucose uptake to meet their high energy demands through glycolysis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Warburg effect</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This effect occurs in cancerous cells.
