Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign tumors of the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being the most frequent site. These tumors are encapsulated and exhibit a mixed cellular composition, leading to a variable consistency, which is reflected in their name \"pleomorphic.\" Clinically, they present as painless, slow-growing masses. The characteristic lift of the earlobe due to the swelling is a classic sign of a parotid gland tumor. Untreated pleomorphic adenomas may undergo malignant transformation, hence surgical excision is typically recommended.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/09/25/histopathology_of_pleomorphic_adenoma.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"461\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.

While they can cause facial asymmetry, they are usually centered around the bones and are not typically located in the parotid gland region. These tumors tend to be hard and lack the variable consistency described in the clinical presentation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Dermoid cyst:&nbsp;</strong>Dermoid cysts are benign cystic tumors containing skin appendages (such as hair follicles), and sometimes hair, teeth, or sebum. They are typically congenital and found on the face, neck, or ovary. While they can appear on the face or neck, the described clinical presentation is less suggestive of a dermoid cyst compared to a pleomorphic adenoma. Dermoid cysts often show indentation due to putty material.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Sebaceous cyst:&nbsp;</strong>Also known as an epidermal cyst, a sebaceous cyst is a benign growth arising from blocked sebaceous glands, often containing a thick, cheese-like material. Sebaceous cysts can appear almost anywhere on the body where sebaceous glands are found, including the face, and often show a black punctum. However, the described clinical presentation and duration better match a pleomorphic adenoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands, typically presenting as a painless, slow-growing mass with variable consistency and often lifting the earlobe due to its location in the parotid gland.</span></p>",

Due to increasing mammography, there occurs over-diagnosis of breast carcinoma</strong>: This is true. Mammography is an essential tool in the early detection of breast cancer, but it has been associated with over-diagnosis. As a result, some women might receive unnecessary treatment for non-life-threatening tumors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. Oral cancer screening is done by visual inspection</strong>: This is true. Visual inspection of the oral cavity can detect precancerous lesions or early signs of oral cancer. Regular dental check-ups often include a visual check for signs of oral cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>3. Cervix cancer screening is done by a pap smear</strong>: This is true. A Pap smear (or Pap test) is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women. The test involves collecting cells from the cervix to be examined under a microscope to detect abnormalities that can turn into cervical cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Option:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>4. Colon cancer screening is done by digital rectal examination</strong>: This statement is not entirely accurate. While a digital rectal examination (DRE) can detect some abnormalities or tumors in the rectum, it is not the primary method for colon cancer screening. The primary methods for colon cancer screening include fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Screening for common cancers using relatively non-invasive tests is expected to lead to early diagnosis, allow more conservative surgical therapies with decreased morbidity, and potentially improve surgical cure rates and overall survival rates.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate colon cancer screening for the average-risk population beginning at age 50 years. Recommended procedures include yearly fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)/fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or FOBT/FIT and flexible sigmoidoscopy.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Visual inspection of the oral cavity has been widely used for screening oral cancer. The target population for oral cancer screening includes those aged 30 years and older who use tobacco and/or alcohol. Advantages of visual inspection include its feasibility, safety, acceptability, accuracy to detect oral precancerous and cancerous lesions, and efficacy and cost-effectiveness in reducing oral cancer mortality.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Screening should begin at age 21 years. For women aged between 21-29 years, screening should be done every 3 years with Pap smear examination. For women aged between 30-65 years, screening should be done every 5 years with both HPV and the Pap co-test.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Using mammography as a routine screening tool in women has been reported to reduce mortality from breast cancer. The United Kingdom recently established an independent expert panel to estimate the benefits and harms associated with screening women in its national screening program. The panel estimated that breast screening resulted in a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality. The panel also noted over-diagnosis of breast carcinoma but concluded that breast screening confers significant benefits and should be continued.</span></li></ol>",

Ultrasound guidance can enhance the accuracy of the procedure by allowing direct visualization of the abscess, ensuring that the needle is correctly positioned to access the abscess cavity. This method is less invasive than incision and drainage (I&amp;D), making it a preferred option if it can effectively manage the abscess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Incision and Drainage:&nbsp;</strong>Incision and drainage is generally considered if aspiration fails repeatedly or if the abscess is too large. While effective, it is not typically the immediate next step after a single failed aspiration attempt. It is more invasive than aspiration and usually reserved for cases where less invasive methods are unsuccessful.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Continue antibiotics only:&nbsp;</strong>Antibiotics are crucial in managing breast abscesses by treating the underlying infection. However, they alone might not suffice for large or dense abscesses. The pus trapped within the abscess often needs to be physically removed to expedite healing and provide symptom relief. Continuing antibiotics without addressing the abscess can lead to prolonged infection and discomfort.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Stop antibiotics as no aspirate was collected:&nbsp;</strong>This option is not recommended. The failure to collect aspirate does not imply the absence of infection. The antibiotics were prescribed based on the clinical diagnosis of a breast abscess, and stopping them prematurely could allow the infection to worsen. Continuation of antibiotics is important until the course is complete or unless indicated otherwise by a physician.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">If the initial aspiration attempt for a breast abscess fails, the next step should be to attempt aspiration again, preferably under ultrasound guidance, before considering more invasive procedures like incision and drainage. This approach ensures accurate access to the abscess and minimizes invasiveness.</span></p>",

Injury during thyroid surgery can lead to voice changes, particularly affecting the pitch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Submandibular excision - Hypoglossal nerve</strong>:&nbsp;The <strong>Hypoglossal nerve</strong> is the twelfth cranial nerve and supplies the muscles of the tongue. Injury to this nerve during excision of the submandibular gland can lead to tongue deviation towards the side of the injury due to the unopposed action of the tongue muscles on the unaffected side.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Thymectomy - Vagus nerve</strong>:&nbsp;The <strong>Vagus nerve</strong>, or the tenth cranial nerve, has a wide range of functions including supplying parasympathetic fibers to many organs in the thorax and abdomen. Injury during thymectomy, a surgical procedure to can have multiple effects, including voice changes due to its role in innervating the larynx. However, it's worth noting that the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, is also at risk during a thymectomy.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In summary, during surgical procedures, it's imperative to be aware of the nearby nerves and their courses to prevent unintended nerve injury, as this can lead to significant postoperative complications</span></p>",

Alcohol</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chronic alcohol consumption is the leading cause of chronic pancreatitis. Excessive alcohol intake can lead to repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, eventually resulting in chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of pancreatic function.

While gallstones are a common cause of acute pancreatitis, they are not the predominant cause of chronic pancreatitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Autoimmune: </strong>Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a type of chronic pancreatitis caused by an autoimmune reaction against the pancreatic tissue. It can be part of the spectrum of IgG4-related disease. The pancreas may become enlarged and look like a tumor on imaging studies. AIP might present with jaundice, weight loss, and the aforementioned pancreatic enlargement. Treatment usually involves corticosteroids to suppress the immune response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Drugs: </strong>Some drugs are known to cause pancreatitis. While the incidence is generally low, drug-induced pancreatitis can turn chronic if the offending medication isn't identified and discontinued. Common culprits include diuretics like furosemide and thiazides, certain antiretroviral drugs, and some antiepileptics like valproic acid, among others.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Chronic alcohol consumption is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, leading to repeated inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of pancreatic function over time.</span></p>",

The first step in evaluating this patient is to perform urine microscopy and cytology, which are non-invasive and effective in detecting malignant cells in the urine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Rationale:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Urine microscopy and cytology: This is a highly specific non-invasive test for detecting bladder cancer. It has a sensitivity of 40%-60% but a high specificity of over 90%, making it the preferred initial test for hematuria in patients with risk factors like smoking.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">X-ray KUB: While useful for detecting stones and certain structural abnormalities, it is not sensitive or specific enough for detecting bladder cancer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Ultrasound KUB: This imaging modality can detect structural abnormalities, but it may miss small or early bladder tumors.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">DTPA scan: Primarily used for evaluating renal function, it is not appropriate for detecting bladder tumors.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.</strong> <strong>X-ray KUB:</strong> Less sensitive and specific for bladder tumors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C</strong>.<strong> Ultrasound KUB</strong>: May miss smaller bladder lesions; not the first-line investigation for suspected bladder cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.
