A) Ectopic ureter</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The clinical presentation described is most consistent with an <strong>ectopic ureter</strong>. An ectopic ureter is a congenital anomaly where the ureter does not insert into the bladder at the normal location (the trigone). Instead, it may insert outside the bladder, such as into the urethra, vagina, or other structures in females. This abnormal insertion leads to continuous dribbling of urine because the urine bypasses the bladder's normal storage function.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Key Points:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Continuous Urine Dribbling:&nbsp;</strong>The hallmark symptom of an ectopic ureter, particularly in females, is constant urinary dribbling or incontinence despite normal voiding. This is because the ureter drains urine directly into a location outside the bladder, where it cannot be stored.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Normal Voiding:&nbsp;</strong>The girl still voids normally because she likely has a second, normally positioned ureter that drains into the bladder, allowing for regular voiding alongside the continuous leakage from the ectopic ureter.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Ureterocele:&nbsp;</strong>A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the distal ureter as it enters the bladder, which can cause obstruction and lead to urinary symptoms. However, it does not typically cause continuous dribbling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Congenital megaureter:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to an abnormal dilation of the ureter, usually associated with some degree of obstruction or reflux, but it does not typically present with continuous dribbling of urine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR):&nbsp;</strong>VUR is the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and possibly the kidneys.

This may involve positioning the child, providing oxygen, and, if necessary, securing the airway with advanced airway management techniques.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. IV Lorazepam:&nbsp;</strong>Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are the first-line treatment for status epilepticus due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in terminating seizures. Lorazepam is typically administered intravenously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. IV Fosphenytoin:&nbsp;</strong>If seizures continue after the administration of a benzodiazepine, IV fosphenytoin (or phenytoin) is used as a second-line agent. It helps to stabilize neuronal membranes and prevent further seizure activity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Midazolam, Propofol, Thiopentone:&nbsp;</strong>These agents are used if seizures persist despite initial treatments.

B) Dried spot sample for HIV DNA PCR</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In the given clinical scenario, it is important to establish or rule out a diagnosis of HIV infection before evaluating for secondary infections. Therefore, the next best step is to obtain a dried spot sample for HIV DNA PCR. AIDS enteropathy, a syndrome of malabsorption with partial villous atrophy not associated with a specific pathogen, has been postulated to be a result of direct HIV infection of the gut.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The diagnosis of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers is done using various methods, including HIV proviral DNA or RNA PCR, HIV culture, or HIV p24 antigen. The national program now uses an HIV total nucleic acid (RNA + proviral DNA) PCR test on dried blood spot samples. All positive tests need to be confirmed with an HIV PCR test on another sample.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Infants born to HIV-positive mothers should be exclusively breastfed or fed with replacement feeds exclusively until 6 months of age. Infants should also receive AR prophylaxis with syrup nevirapine or zidovudine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">It is common for HIV-infected infants to experience gastrointestinal tract involvement, with bacteria (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Mycobacterium avium complex), protozoa (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Isospora, microsporidia), viruses (CMV, HSV, rotavirus), and fungi (Candida) being common pathogens.

First, the diagnosis of HIV infection should be established before treating secondary infections.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Antibody tests for HIV:&nbsp;</strong>Antibody tests for HIV are not useful in establishing the diagnosis of HIV infection in infants. This is because all infants born to HIV-infected mothers test antibodies positive at birth due to the passive transfer of maternal HIV antibodies across the placenta. It can be used as a diagnostic tool after 18 months of age.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

The Tokyo guidelines recommend early cholecystectomy within 5-7 days for mild cases (Tokyo I).

Once symptomatic complications occur, definitive surgical management is required to prevent recurrent attacks, which can be more severe and lead to additional complications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Elective cholecystectomy after inflammation subsides</strong> - This approach represents delayed surgery scheduled weeks to months after discharge, which is now considered an outdated practice. It increases the risk of recurrent episodes during the waiting period and can lead to more difficult surgery due to scarring and adhesions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Urgent open cholecystectomy</strong> - Open cholecystectomy is not the first-line approach unless laparoscopic surgery is contraindicated.

When the appendix is positioned below the cecum, it can extend inferiorly toward the pelvic brim. Inflammation in this position may spread downward, causing irritation to pelvic structures and resulting in suprapubic discomfort. This anatomical relationship explains why subcaecal appendicitis can present with symptoms similar to pelvic appendicitis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A.</strong> <strong>Pre-ileal</strong> - When the appendix is anterior to the terminal ileum, it typically presents with classic right iliac fossa pain at McBurney's point, not suprapubic discomfort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B.</strong> <strong>Post-ileal</strong> - Post-ileal appendicitis typically causes ill-defined tenderness immediately to the right of the umbilicus and may present with features of diarrhea and retching rather than suprapubic pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D.</strong> <strong>Retrocecal</strong> - The most common position (74%), retrocecal appendicitis typically causes deep tenderness in the loin with possible psoas irritation, manifesting as flank or back pain rather than suprapubic discomfort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The anatomical positioning of a subcaecal appendix allows for extension toward the pelvic region, making it most likely among the given options to cause suprapubic symptoms when inflamed.</p>",

While the condition is generally self-limiting and resolves within 4-6 weeks, the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intussusception warrants the use of steroids.
