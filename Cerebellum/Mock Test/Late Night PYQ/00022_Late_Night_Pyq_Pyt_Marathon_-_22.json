This combination is effective against Burkholderia cepacia, a pathogen known for its resistance to many standard antibiotics. The standard regimen includes Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), which has broad-spectrum bacterial coverage, combined with a 3rd generation cephalosporin such as ceftazidime or cefoperazone-sulbactam to cover for the pathogen's unique resistance profiles and aggressive infection nature, especially in immunocompromised patients or those with existing cardiac issues.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

While colistin could still be effective, the resistance to aminoglycosides limits this combination's usefulness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Carbapenems and 3rd generation cephalosporin:</strong> Incorrect because the combination of carbapenems with cephalosporins is generally not recommended. They both share a similar mechanism of action, inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, and could potentially compete for the same binding sites, thus reducing their effectiveness.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cefepime and tigecycline:</strong> Incorrect because tigecycline is not particularly effective against Burkholderia cepacia.

D) Intravenous fluids with I.V. regular insulin</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In a patient presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the immediate management involves <strong>FLIP Therapy (fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy and Potassium management)</strong>. This patient's blood glucose is significantly elevated, and the presence of ketones indicates DKA, which is a medical emergency.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>1. Fluids</strong>: The initial step is to administer intravenous (IV) fluids to correct dehydration and stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status. The typical approach involves giving isotonic saline (0.9% sodium chloride) at a <strong>rate of 10-20 mL/kg/hr (2-3L) for the first 2-3 hours</strong>. This helps to correct hypovolemia, improve perfusion, and begin to lower blood glucose levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Criteria for fluid management</strong>: After the initial two to three hours of treatment, switch from initial fluids (typically normal saline) to half normal saline for ongoing maintenance.&nbsp;If capillary blood glucose (CBG) drops below 300 mg/dL, and specifically if it falls below 250 mg/dL, add 5% dextrose water to the regimen.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The purpose of adding dextrose is to maintain a target CBG range of 200 to 300 mg/dL. This range helps prevent hypoglycemia, which is a critical concern in the management process.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. Insulin</strong>: Insulin therapy is crucial to halt ketogenesis and reduce blood glucose levels. After 1 hr of fluid start insulin. The <strong>recommended protocol for DKA involves IV regular insulin</strong> because of its rapid onset and short duration of action. The insulin regimen follows a fixed dose insulin infusion (FDII) approach. This helps to normalize blood glucose and ketone levels efficiently.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">First option: Continuous infusion at 0.15 units/kg/hour.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Second option (<strong>more commonly used</strong>): Administer a 0.1 units/kg bolus, followed by a 0.1 units/kg/hour infusion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>IV regular insulin</strong> is preferred over subcutaneous (SC) insulin in emergency settings like DKA due to its predictable absorption and ability to be titrated easily based on frequent blood glucose monitoring.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Adjustments Based on Blood Glucose Levels</strong>: Monitor capillary blood glucose (CBG). If CBG drops below 300 mg/dL, reduce the insulin infusion to half the dose (0.05 units/kg/hour).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Criteria for Stopping Insulin Infusion</strong>: Insulin infusion can be stopped ONLY when the patient tolerates oral feeds without vomiting or abdominal pain. Other criteria include resolution of ketoacidosis, negative or trace positive plasma ketones, and an <strong>anion gap less than 12</strong>, pH more than 7.3 and serum bicarbonate more than 18.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Transition to subcutaneous insulin upon meeting these criteria.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Potassium</strong> Management: Potassium addition is tailored based on serum potassium levels.

It is commonly associated with conditions such as malignancies (especially small cell lung cancer), pulmonary diseases, and medications like antidepressants and antipsychotics.

The elevated pCO2 of 60 mmHg (normal: 35-45 mmHg) points to a respiratory cause of the acidosis, specifically respiratory acidosis. In COPD patients, chronic CO2 retention is common, leading to increased bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels as a compensatory mechanism. However, in acute respiratory acidosis, the metabolic compensation is typically inadequate, as seen by the HCO3- level of 28 mEq/L (normal: 22-28 mEq/L). The inadequate compensation suggests an acute exacerbation rather than a chronic condition, as chronic respiratory acidosis would have a more elevated bicarbonate level (&gt;30 mEq/L).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

The presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGO) with small cystic changes, particularly in the perihilar regions on HRCT, is highly characteristic of PCP. The clinical presentation of dyspnea, non-productive cough, fever, and weight loss aligns with PCP, which is typically a subacute process. PCP often occurs in patients with weakened immune systems, such as those with uncontrolled diabetes, making this diagnosis the most likely.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-IN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option </span></strong><strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-IN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">A) Bacterial Pneumonia:</span></strong><span dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"EN-IN\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"> Bacterial pneumonia generally presents with lobar or patchy infiltrates on imaging rather than diffuse ground-glass opacities and cystic changes.

This increased pressure causes the left atrium to dilate. This dilation can be identified on a chest X-ray as enlargement of the left atrial silhouette.

Acute Pancreatitis</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">A gasless abdomen is seen in acute pancreatitis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Acute pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, which can be caused by gallstones, alcohol consumption, and other factors. It can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and increased heart rate. A gasless abdomen is seen in acute pancreatitis. Other signs include sentinel loop, renal halo and colon cut-off.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Other causes of gasless abdomen on Xray include:</span><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">A paucity of small bowel gas may be a normal finding in some adults</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Bowel ischemia</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Intestinal atresia</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Ascites</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Gastroenteritis</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Large abdominal mass - due to displacement</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Ulcerative Colitis: </strong>Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the innermost lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Symptoms include diarrhea, often with blood or pus, abdominal pain, and rectal pain. In children, it may affect growth. A gasless abdomen on X-ray is not a typical feature of ulcerative colitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Intussusception: </strong>Intussusception is a condition in which a segment of the intestine \"telescopes\" into another, leading to bowel obstruction. This can cut off the blood supply to the affected portion of the intestine. It is one of the most common abdominal emergencies affecting children under two. Classic symptoms include intermittent abdominal pain, \"currant jelly\" stools, and a palpable \"sausage-shaped\" mass in the abdomen. While it can lead to changes in an abdominal X-ray like dilated small bowel loops, a gasless abdomen is not the primary diagnostic feature of intussusception.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Crohn's Disease: </strong>Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from mouth to anus. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people. Unlike acute pancreatitis, a gasless abdomen is not a primary feature seen with Crohn's disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">A gasless abdomen on X-ray is commonly associated with acute pancreatitis in children presenting with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. This condition should be considered when evaluating similar clinical presentations.</span></p>",
