Bridging veins</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The image demonstrating a bleed over the arachnoid layer but beneath the dura suggests a subdural hemorrhage. It is most commonly caused by the shearing of cortical bridging veins.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A subdural hemorrhage is a type of intracranial hemorrhage, which is bleeding within the skull. It occurs when blood accumulates between the dura mater (the tough outermost layer of the meninges) and the arachnoid mater (the middle layer of the meninges) surrounding the brain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Subdural hemorrhages are usually caused by trauma to the head, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents, which can tear the veins that bridge the dura and arachnoid layers. The bleeding can create pressure on the brain, leading to neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, dizziness, seizures, and in severe cases, coma or death.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The symptoms of a subdural hemorrhage can develop immediately or may take hours or even days to appear, depending on the severity of the bleeding. In some cases, a small subdural hemorrhage may resolve on its own without treatment, while larger or more severe bleeds may require surgery to relieve pressure on the brain and stop the bleeding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Factors that can increase the risk of a subdural hemorrhage include advanced age, alcohol or drug abuse, blood-thinning medications, and medical conditions that affect blood clotting or increase the risk of falls.

They make up a portion of the posterior surface of the spinal canal and primarily consist of elastic tissue. Because it contains a lot of elastin, it can be stretched by 80% without suffering any harm. The ligamentum flava helps with extension back to the anatomical position by helping to prevent laminae separation during flexion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Type 1 collagen:</strong> Collagen is the primary structural protein, among the different types of collagen, Type 1 collagen is the most abundant. It's found in many tissues including skin, tendons, internal organs, and the organic part of bones. Its primary function is to provide tensile strength to these tissues. It forms strong fibers and is responsible for the strength of the tissue. However, while present in many areas of the body, Type 1 collagen is not the predominant component of the ligamentum flavum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Type 2 collagen:</strong> Type 2 collagen is primarily found in cartilaginous tissues. Its main function is to provide resistance against intermittent pressure, making it ideal for cartilaginous structures like the intervertebral discs, hyaline cartilage, and the vitreous humor of the eye. Given that ligamentum flavum is not a cartilaginous structure, Type 2 collagen is not its predominant component.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Reticular fibers:</strong> Reticular fibers are a type of fiber in connective tissue composed of Type 3 collagen. These fibers form a mesh-like framework in various organs such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. They provide a supportive framework for these and other organs. While they are present in various parts of the body, they are not the main component of the ligamentum flavum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The ligamentum flavum, which connects the laminae of adjacent vertebrae, contains a high concentration of elastin fibers, which allows the ligament to stretch during spine flexion and then return to its original shape when the spine is extended.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This characteristic helps maintain the stability and alignment of the vertebral column.

Peroneus longus</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The peroneus longus is a muscle of the lateral compartment of the leg. It originates from the head and upper two-thirds of the fibula, and it has a long tendon that wraps behind the lateral malleolus and extends to the medial side of the foot, inserting into the base of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform. When the peroneus longus contracts, it everts the foot and also plantarflexes the ankle.

Tibialis anterior:</strong> The tibialis anterior is a muscle of the anterior compartment of the leg. It originates from the lateral surface of the tibia and inserts into the medial cuneiform and first metatarsal bones of the foot. When this muscle contracts, it dorsiflexes the ankle (pulls the foot upwards, towards the shin) and inverts the foot. Therefore, the tibialis anterior plays a role in foot inversion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Tibialis posterior:</strong> The tibialis posterior is located in the deep compartment of the leg. It originates from the posterior surfaces of the tibia and fibula and inserts into various bones in the foot, including the navicular, cuneiforms, and metatarsals. When the tibialis posterior contracts, it plantarflexes the ankle (points the foot downward) and also inverts the foot. Like the tibialis anterior, the tibialis posterior is involved in foot inversion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Extensor hallucis longus:</strong> The extensor hallucis longus is another muscle of the anterior compartment of the leg. It originates from the anterior surface of the fibula and the interosseous membrane and inserts into the distal phalanx of the big toe. Its primary action is to dorsiflex the big toe. While it plays a role in dorsiflexion of the ankle, its contribution to inversion or eversion is minimal compared to the other muscles listed. However, it can assist in inversion to a minor extent when combined with other inverters.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Peroneus longus muscle is not involved in the inversion of the foot.

Three Layers of the Cerebellar Cortex</strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Molecular Layer</strong>: This is the outermost layer and contains stellate and basket cells. The dendrites of Purkinje cells also extend into this layer. The axons of granule cells, called parallel fibers, run horizontally in this layer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Purkinje Cell Layer</strong>: This layer contains the large, flask-shaped Purkinje cells, which are the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex. Purkinje cells have a single axon that travels to the deep cerebellar nuclei and extensive dendritic trees that extend into the molecular layer. They are inhibitory neurons that use GABA as their neurotransmitter.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Granule Cell Layer</strong>: The innermost layer contains numerous small granule cells, along with Golgi cells. Granule cells are excitatory neurons that use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. Their axons ascend into the molecular layer where they bifurcate and run as parallel fibers, synapsing with Purkinje cell dendrites.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>2. White Matter</strong>: Beneath the cerebellar cortex is the cerebellar white matter, which consists of myelinated axons. These axons form the afferent and efferent connections of the cerebellum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>3. Deep Cerebellar Nuclei</strong>: Within the white matter are four pairs of deep cerebellar nuclei: the fastigial, globose, emboliform (these last two are collectively called the interposed nuclei), and the dentate nuclei. These nuclei receive inhibitory input from Purkinje cells and excitatory input from cerebellar afferents and provide the primary output from the cerebellum to other brain regions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>4. Afferent and Efferent Fibers</strong>: The cerebellum receives input (afferent fibers) mainly from the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex and sends output (efferent fibers) to the deep cerebellar nuclei and then out to various parts of the brain, primarily the vestibular nuclei and the thalamus.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>5. Bergmann Glia</strong>: These are specialized astrocytes found in the cerebellum. They have long processes that extend through the Purkinje cell layer into the molecular layer, providing support for neurons and playing a role in neurotransmission.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>6. Foliation</strong>: Grossly, the cerebellum exhibits a series of folia (folds) which are a result of the convolution of the cerebellar cortex.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A: Vestibular nuclei&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Option C: Basal ganglia</strong> are not directly influenced by Purkinje cells.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B: Anterior horn of spinal</strong> is involved in motor neuron activity, unrelated to Purkinje cell output.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">Purkinje cells in the cerebellum play a vital inhibitory role on the deep cerebellar nuclei, crucial for coordinating and refining motor movements and cognitive processing related to movement.</span></p>",

It is located deep within the cerebral hemispheres and separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the putamen and the globus pallidus. The internal capsule contains axon tracts that serve as major pathways for communication between different parts of the brain, including the cortex, thalamus, and various subcortical nuclei.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The internal capsule is often subdivided into three parts: the anterior limb, genu (knee), and posterior limb. Each limb contains different types of nerve fibers that transmit motor, sensory, and other information between the cerebral cortex and other brain regions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">The internal capsule consists of several parts and is V-shaped when cut horizontally, in a&nbsp;transverse plane.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">the bend in the V is called the&nbsp;genu</span></li><li><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">the <strong>anterior limb or&nbsp;crus anterius</strong>&nbsp;is the part in front of the genu, between the head of the&nbsp;caudate nucleus&nbsp;and the&nbsp;lenticular nucleus</span></li><li><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">the <strong>posterior limb or&nbsp;crus posterius</strong>&nbsp;is the part behind the genu, between the thalamus and lenticular nucleus</span></li><li><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">the&nbsp;<strong>retrolenticular portion</strong>&nbsp;is caudal to the lenticular nucleus and carries the&nbsp;optic radiation&nbsp;(from medial part of lateral geniculate nucleus) also known as the&nbsp;geniculocalcarine tract.&nbsp;The fiber from lateral part of lateral geniculate nucleus is carried through the&nbsp;retrolenticular portion.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\">the&nbsp;<strong>sublenticular portion</strong>&nbsp;is beneath the lenticular nucleus and are tracts involved in the auditory pathway from the&nbsp;medial geniculate nucleus&nbsp;to the&nbsp;primary auditory cortex&nbsp;(Brodmann areas 41 and 42)</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Lesions or damage to the internal capsule can result in various neurological deficits, including motor and sensory impairments.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Option:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. External Capsule</strong>: The external capsule is another white matter structure located in the brain, but it is less well-known than the internal capsule. It is located lateral to the putamen and globus pallidus and is considered part of the deep gray matter of the basal ganglia. The exact function and significance of the external capsule are still a subject of ongoing research, and its role in brain function is not as well-defined as that of the internal capsule.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Caudate Lobe</strong>: The caudate lobe, also known as the caudate nucleus, is a part of the basal ganglia. It is a C-shaped structure located within each cerebral hemisphere. The caudate nucleus is involved in various functions, including motor control, cognition, and emotional processing. It is interconnected with other basal ganglia nuclei and plays a role in regulating movement. Lesions or dysfunction in the caudate nucleus can lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Globus Pallidus</strong>: The globus pallidus is another component of the basal ganglia. It is divided into two segments: the external segment (GPe) and the internal segment (GPi). The globus pallidus is involved in motor control and plays a role in modulating motor signals sent from the cortex to the thalamus. Dysfunctions of the globus pallidus can result in movement disorders, including dystonia and Parkinson's disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/07/20/untitled-1100_0rCUWGW.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"477\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/07/20/untitled-1101.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"342\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:white;color:#0d0d0d;font-size:12.0pt;\">The internal capsule's strategic location and structure facilitate critical communication pathways in the brain, making its integrity vital for normal motor and sensory functions.
