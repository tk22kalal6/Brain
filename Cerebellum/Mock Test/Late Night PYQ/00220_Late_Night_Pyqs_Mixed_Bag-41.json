The use of positive pressure from bag and mask ventilation can exacerbate the displacement of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defect, potentially worsening respiratory distress and leading to further compromise of pulmonary function.

Opting for intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation instead of bag &amp; mask ventilation is crucial to prevent further complications and stabilize the infant's condition. Properly securing the airway and ensuring adequate ventilation without increasing the risk of further pulmonary or gastrointestinal injury is essential in the initial management of these patients.</span></p>",

Uric acid: </strong>Uric acid stones form when the urine is persistently acidic, which can occur in conditions like gout or diseases that cause rapid cell turnover like tumor lysis syndrome. A diet high in purines, certain types of medications, and some genetic factors can contribute to uric acid stone formation. However, these stones are not typically associated with laxative abuse.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Struvite: </strong>Struvite stones, also known as infection stones, are associated with urinary tract infections caused by certain bacteria. These bacteria can produce urease, which splits urea in to ammonia, that makes the urine more alkaline, which can lead to struvite stone formation. They are not directly associated with laxative abuse.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Calcium oxalate: </strong>Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stone. Factors that increase the urine concentration of these constituents can contribute to stone formation. The absorption of oxalate might increase with chronic diarrhea (a potential consequence of laxative abuse), which can contribute to the formation of calcium oxalate stones, however this is not a common feature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Laxative abuse can lead to metabolic alkalosis, which creates an alkaline urinary environment, predisposing to the formation of ammonium urate stones.</span></p>",

A) Cervical cancer</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tandem radiotherapy, also known as <strong>intracavitary brachytherapy</strong>, is a specialized form of radiation treatment used primarily for cervical cancer. This technique involves the placement of radioactive sources directly into the cervix and uterus using a device called a tandem and ovoid applicator. The tandem is a metal rod that is inserted into the uterine cavity, and the ovoids are placed in the lateral fornices of the vagina. This allows for high doses of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/08/29/screenshot-2024-08-29-184528.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Intracavitary brachytherapy is often combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for the effective management of cervical cancer.

This nerve runs through the inguinal canal, where it provides sensory innervation to the skin of the upper thigh, base of the penis, and scrotum in males, and the mons pubis and labia majora in females. Due to its anatomical position, it is prone to injury or entrapment during surgical procedures in this area, leading to postoperative pain or numbness in its distribution.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Other Options:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">Option A.

This is because fructose is metabolized differently, primarily in the liver, and leads to a slower and lower rise in blood glucose levels compared to glucose.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.&nbsp;Sucrose:</strong> Sucrose, or table sugar, is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. Its glycemic index is lower than that of pure glucose because the presence of fructose moderates the overall blood sugar response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.&nbsp;Sugar Alcohols:</strong> Sugar alcohols, such as xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol, generally have lower glycemic indices than glucose. They are absorbed more slowly and incompletely in the intestine, leading to a lesser impact on blood sugar levels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Glycemic index (GI)</strong>- This is the increase in blood glucose after the test dose of a carbohydrate compared with that of an equivalent amount of glucose.

Also, lactose is broken down to glucose and galactose, so has high GI. This is because glucose and galactose are absorbed from intestine via SGLT-1, which is active transport and absorbs all of glucose &amp; galactose, even against the concentration gradient.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Fructose and sugar alcohols</strong>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<strong>less glycemic index</strong>&nbsp;because they are not absorbed completely (because glucose transporter is GLUT-5, which absorbs fructose only down the concentration gradient).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup)- 58% glucose, Sucrose (50% glucose) gets split into glucose, so have high GI (HFCS &amp; Sucrose has fructose as the other component).</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2023/12/21/screenshot-2023-12-21-095902.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"172\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>GI of Glucose</strong>&nbsp;= 100 % or 1</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>GI of Fructose</strong>&nbsp;= 25 %</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>GI of Sucrose</strong>&nbsp;= 65 %</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ref: Harper’s Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd edition Page no. 528</strong></span></p>",

B) Osteoid osteoma</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The X-ray shows a lesion in the diaphysis of the bone, consistent with an osteoid osteoma. This is characterized by a small, benign, and painful tumor usually found in the cortex of long bones, such as the femur or tibia.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Osteoid osteomas are typically less than 2 cm in size and can cause significant pain, often worse at night, which is relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>A. Osteochondroma</strong>: A common benign bone tumor that usually arises near the growth plate of a long bone. These tumors manifest as a cartilage-capped bony projection on the surface of the bone and do not typically present as a central diaphyseal lesion.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>B. Giant Cell Tumor (GCT)</strong>: This tumor often occurs near the end of the bone and extends to the joint. It usually affects adults between 20 and 40 years old and may be more aggressive than an osteoid osteoma.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>C. Unicameral Bone Cyst (Simple Bone Cyst)</strong>: This is a fluid-filled bone cavity typically found in the metaphysis of long bones in children and young adults. It generally does not cause significant pain unless there is a pathological fracture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective </strong>:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">When encountering a patient with localized bone pain and a small radiolucent lesion in the cortex of the bone, consider osteoid osteoma in the differential diagnosis. Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to effective treatment, primarily with NSAIDs or surgical excision, providing significant symptom relief.</span></li></ul>",
