If a mother is IgG positive for CMV, it indicates a past infection and a lower risk of transmitting the virus to the fetus compared to a primary infection. This is because maternal IgG antibodies can provide some protection to the fetus. However, there remains a small risk of reactivation of the virus or reinfection during pregnancy, which could lead to congenital CMV infection in the fetus.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

This condition leads to enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle as they handle increased blood volume. However, the left atrium is not typically enlarged in uncomplicated cases of ASD because the blood is shunted away from it, reducing its workload rather than increasing it. Enlargement of the left atrium may occur in advanced stages such as with the development of Eisenmenger's syndrome, where a reversal of the shunt occurs, but this is not the initial presentation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option </strong></span><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>A.

C) Increased urine bilirubin</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Increased urine bilirubin is the least likely finding in newborns with Rh incompatibility. Rh incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh-negative, and the baby is Rh-positive, leading to hemolysis of the baby's red blood cells. This hemolysis releases hemoglobin, which is broken down into biliverdin and then into unconjugated bilirubin. This unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and cannot be excreted directly in the urine because it needs to be conjugated by the liver to become water-soluble. However, the enzyme required for this conjugation (glucuronyl transferase) is immature in newborns, especially in those with Rh incompatibility, leading to an accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Unconjugated bilirubin is not excreted in the urine; instead, it is converted to urobilinogen and stercobilinogen in the intestines by bacteria, which are then excreted in the urine and feces, respectively. This process is why increased fecal urobilinogen and stercobilinogen are likely findings in Rh incompatibility. The lack of mature enzyme activity in the liver of a newborn prevents significant conjugation and excretion of bilirubin in the urine, making increased urine bilirubin an unlikely finding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

This enlargement is visible on the X-ray.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Narrow vascular pedicle:</strong> The \"string\" appearance of the mediastinum is due to a narrow vascular pedicle, which is a common radiographic finding in TGA.
