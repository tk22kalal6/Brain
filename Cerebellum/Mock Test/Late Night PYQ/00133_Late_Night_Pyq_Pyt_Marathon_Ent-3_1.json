B) Tumor vessel lack contractility</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Based on the provided CT image and the clinical context of recurrent bleeding, the most accurate statement is Tumor vessels lack contractility, which contributes to the propensity for bleeding in tumorous growths.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>\"Tumor vessel lack contractility</strong>\" is a true statement about tumor vessels.

This can lead to areas of necrosis within tumours.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Bleeding is from the adjacent invading vessels:</strong> Implies that the normal vessels adjacent to the tumor are the source of bleeding. However, the bleeding associated with tumors is usually due to the tumor vessels themselves because they are prone to rupture, not the adjacent normal vessels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Lacks capsule:</strong> May or may not be true depending on the type of tumor. Some benign tumors have a well-defined capsule, while malignant tumors often lack a capsule.

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. A) Tracheostomy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">A tracheostomy involves creating an opening through the neck into the trachea, which may become complicated when the trachea is deviated. In cases of tracheal deviation, the trachea is not in its usual midline position, which can make locating the correct spot for incision more challenging. This difficulty is increased because the trachea's position may not be easily palpable or visible due to its displacement, which can complicate the procedure and increase the risk of complications.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_aEVEcW6.png\" width=\"367\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Laryngeal airway:</strong> A laryngeal airway (LMA) is inserted above the larynx at the supraglottic level. Since this procedure does not involve the trachea directly, a deviated trachea does not affect the placement of an LMA, making it relatively easy to perform.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_T5agVaS.png\" width=\"306\" height=\"231\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Endotracheal intubation:</strong> While endotracheal intubation may become slightly more difficult with tracheal deviation, it usually remains manageable. The main challenge might be encountering some resistance or needing to adjust the angle of the tube. However, with careful maneuvering, the endotracheal tube can still be guided into the trachea.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_f8aYTbB.png\" width=\"443\" height=\"342\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cricothyroidotomy:</strong> This procedure involves making an incision through the cricothyroid membrane, located above the trachea at the level of the larynx. Because the tracheal deviation occurs below this point, it does not directly impact the cricothyroidotomy, making it a viable option even with tracheal deviation.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/image_H46wIa0.png\" width=\"594\" height=\"386\"></p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tracheostomy can be more challenging in cases of tracheal deviation due to the altered position of the trachea, making the precise location for incision difficult to identify.</span></p>",

When a patient has their larynx removed, typically due to cancer, they lose their natural voice. A Blom-Singer prosthesis is a one-way valve inserted between the trachea and the esophagus that allows air to be diverted into the esophagus to produce sound, enabling the patient to speak.

It is used to treat recurrent middle ear infections (acute otitis media) or to relieve chronic fluid accumulation in the middle ear (otitis media with effusion). Grommets help reduce the frequency of ear infections and improve hearing by allowing the continuous drainage of fluid and equalizing the pressure between the middle ear and the external atmospheric pressure.</span></p>",

The patient's symptoms of unilateral hearing loss and ear fullness strongly suggest eustachian tube dysfunction. The eustachian tube opening is located at the torus tubarius on the lateral nasopharyngeal wall. Obstruction or dysfunction of this opening leads to negative middle ear pressure and conductive hearing loss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Fossa of Rosenmuller:</strong> While this is the depression posterior to the torus tubarius and is a critical anatomical landmark (being the most common site for nasopharyngeal carcinoma), isolated pathology here wouldn't typically cause eustachian tube symptoms without adjacent involvement.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Toluidine blue has a high affinity for DNA and RNA, making it effective in highlighting areas with high cellular activity, such as cancerous growths. This stain is particularly useful for detecting early cancerous changes in the vocal cords, as it is absorbed more by cells with high nucleic acid content, indicating a proliferative or carcinomatous state.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

The affected cord vibrates at a different frequency when compared with the normal cord which vibrates at its regular frequency. This is because vibrational characteristics of affected cord gets changed due to structural changes caused by the lesion. Hence 2 cords, vibrating at 2 different frequencies, will produce 2 different sounds.

Heavy vocal cords require more effort by the vocal muscles to move them. Hence this extra effort of muscles causes pain and early vocal fatigue to the patient. Management involves addressing the underlying causes, surgical intervention, and supportive therapies like voice rest and speech therapy.</span></p>",

Notch at 2000Hz is indicative of Noise Induced hearing loss:</strong> A notch at 2000Hz on bone conduction is known as Carhart's notch, which is indicative of otosclerosis, not noise-induced hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss typically presents a notch at 4000Hz. Hence, this statement is incorrect.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Associated Ménière's disease is not a contraindication for stapes surgery:</strong> Ménière's disease is indeed a contraindication for stapes surgery. The presence of Ménière's disease can lead to complications such as irritation of the saccule during the surgery, causing vertigo and giddiness.
