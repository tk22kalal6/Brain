      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. B) Pain in intermittent claudication comes at first step of walking.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Intermittent claudication is characterized by muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue), classically in the calf muscle, which occurs during exercise and is relieved by a short period of rest (&lt; 5 minutes). The pain does not typically start with the first step but develops after a predictable distance of walking.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Rest pain is seen more in the night:&nbsp;</strong>True. Rest pain is a more severe symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). It typically indicates more advanced disease than intermittent claudication. This pain occurs when the limb is at rest, often at night due to the decreased perfusion that results from the horizontal position of the limb. It often awakens the patient from sleep and can be relieved by hanging the leg over the bed or walking.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Most common cause is atheroma:&nbsp;</strong>True. The most common cause of intermittent claudication is atherosclerosis (plaque or atheroma formation) in the peripheral arteries. This reduces blood flow to the muscles during activity, causing pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. The clinical stem does not reflect the site of peripheral arterial obstruction:&nbsp;</strong>True. The site of pain (e.g., calf, thigh) does not always directly correlate with the level of arterial obstruction. For instance, while calf pain is often due to femoropopliteal disease, it can also be caused by aortoiliac disease. However, the location of claudication pain can provide a clue to the level of disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The incorrect statement among the provided options is that pain in intermittent claudication occurs at the first step of walking.</span></p>",

IV fluids for resuscitation:&nbsp;</strong>While fluid resuscitation is vital in the management of trauma patients, the priority in this scenario, given the clinical findings suggestive of tension pneumothorax, is to relieve the trapped air. While IV fluids can support the circulatory system, they won't address the primary problem, which is the tension pneumothorax. The priority in trauma management follows the Airway -&gt; Breathing -&gt; Circulation (ABC) protocol.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intubation and positive pressure ventilation:&nbsp;</strong>Intubation and positive pressure ventilation can be dangerous in a patient with tension pneumothorax. Positive pressure ventilation can exacerbate the tension pneumothorax by forcing more air into the pleural space, which can lead to rapid cardiovascular collapse. Addressing the tension pneumothorax with needle decompression or chest tube insertion should be prioritized before considering intubation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. e-FAST (extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma):&nbsp;</strong>While e-FAST is a valuable tool in the trauma setting to quickly evaluate for the presence of free fluid (e.g., blood) in the peritoneal, pericardial, or pleural spaces, it may not be the immediate choice when a patient presents with clear signs and symptoms of a tension pneumothorax and is hemodynamically unstable. Immediate intervention to relieve the tension is essential, and while ultrasound can confirm the presence of pneumothorax, in an unstable patient, clinical judgment and prompt action are crucial.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">In cases of suspected tension pneumothorax, immediate needle decompression in the 5th intercostal space is the priority to relieve trapped air and stabilize the patient before further interventions.</span></li></ul>",

Splenic angiography and embolization are also used for non-surgical management.

Multiple focal lesions with a characteristic distribution are typical of diffuse axonal injury, and <strong>CT scans may appear normal</strong>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), is the preferred imaging modality for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury, and can reveal small regions of susceptibility artifact or hemorrhage. Subdural hemorrhage, extradural hemorrhage, and cerebral contusion are other potential traumatic brain injuries that can present with different imaging features and may require different treatments.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a type of traumatic brain injury that results from the shearing forces during rapid deceleration or rotational head trauma.

This surgical technique was pioneered by John Hunter, who recognized that ligating the artery proximal to the aneurysm could reduce blood flow into the aneurysmal sac, allowing it to thrombose and potentially shrink over time.

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Ans. B. Inserted tube along the lower border of upper rib</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">An intercostal drainage (ICD) tube should be inserted along the upper border of the lower rib, not the lower border of the upper rib. This is to prevent damage to the neurovascular bundle, which runs along the lower border of each rib (comprising the intercostal vein, artery, and nerve). Inserting the tube along the lower border of the upper rib increases the risk of injuring these critical structures.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A. Identified 5th intercostal space anterior to mid axillary line to place the tube:&nbsp;</strong>The 5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line is a commonly selected site for the insertion of an ICD. This location is within the \"triangle of safety,\" which is bounded by the lateral border of the pectoralis major anteriorly, the latissimus dorsi posteriorly, and the horizontal level of the nipple below. This area minimizes the risk of injuring important structures, including the long thoracic nerve and vessels.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Directed tube posteriorly to prevent injury:&nbsp;</strong>Directing the tube posteriorly initially helps ensure that it enters the pleural space without injuring the lung. Once inside the pleural cavity, the direction of the tube may be adjusted based on the specific indication for the ICD, such as draining an effusion versus a pneumothorax.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Incised and digitally explored:&nbsp;</strong>After making a skin incision, blunt dissection and digital exploration are performed to ensure that there are no obstructions or adhesions and to create a safe pathway for the tube. Digital exploration helps confirm that the tube enters the pleural space properly and safely.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:48px;\">&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">When inserting an intercostal drainage tube, it is crucial to place the tube along the upper border of the lower rib to avoid damaging the neurovascular bundle that runs along the lower border of the upper rib.</span></p>",
