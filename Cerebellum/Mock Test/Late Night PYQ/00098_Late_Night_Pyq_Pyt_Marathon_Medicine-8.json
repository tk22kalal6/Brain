This inflammatory response is due to the infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Additionally, there is usually an elevated protein concentration in the CSF due to the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the presence of inflammatory proteins. The glucose level in the CSF is typically low because the bacteria consume glucose and the inflammatory response disrupts glucose transport. Therefore, the combination of pleocytosis with high protein and low sugar is characteristic of pneumococcal meningitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Paralysis of the tongue</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) results from occlusion of the vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), affecting the lateral medulla. Key features include ipsilateral cerebellar signs (ataxia), Horner's syndrome, and sensory deficits with a classic crossed pattern (ipsilateral face and contralateral body). Dysphagia and dysarthria occur due to involvement of the nucleus ambiguus (9th, 10th cranial nerves). However, tongue paralysis (hypoglossal or 12th nerve dysfunction) is notably absent because the hypoglossal nucleus lies medially in the medulla and is not affected in this lateral syndrome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A.
