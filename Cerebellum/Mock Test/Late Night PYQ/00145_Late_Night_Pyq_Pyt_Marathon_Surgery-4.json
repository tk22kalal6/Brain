A fistula in ano is an abnormal connection between the interior of the anal canal and the perianal skin. It often presents as a recurrent swelling or abscess near the anal verge, which may drain spontaneously. The key clues include the location of the swelling near the anal verge and the history of recurrent discharge, making it characteristic of a fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Pilonidal Sinus:&nbsp;</strong>A pilonidal sinus is typically found in the upper part of the natal cleft, far from the anal verge, and is associated with hair follicles in the gluteal region. It commonly affects young men with a hairy back and is located above the coccyx, not near the anus. The key distinction is the location; pilonidal sinuses are not found at the anal verge but higher up in the gluteal cleft.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"304\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Fissure in Ano:&nbsp;</strong>A fissure in ano is a linear tear in the lining of the anus, usually caused by trauma or hard stools. It presents with pain during defecation and bright red bleeding but not with a swelling or external opening as seen in fistula in ano. There may be a hypertrophic skin tag covering it (Sentinel pile). Fissures do not have a history of recurrent discharge or a swelling appearance near the anal verge.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120048.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"260\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hemorrhoids:&nbsp;</strong>Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus and typically present with painless bleeding, itching, and swelling inside the anal canal or at the anal verge. They do not present with the external openings, recurrent abscesses, or discharging sinuses characteristic of fistula in ano.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><img src=\"https://cerebellum-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/public/images/2024/09/13/screenshot-2024-09-13-120109.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"361\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Fistula in Ano should be considered when there is a history of recurrent swelling, abscess formation, or discharge near the anal verge.

Patients often experience a sensation of food getting stuck in the chest while eating and may need to drink fluids or change their body position to help food pass into the stomach.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Regurgitation:&nbsp;</strong>As a result of the esophageal emptying problems, patients with achalasia may also experience regurgitation of undigested food, often occurring at night when lying down.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Chest Pain:&nbsp;</strong>Some individuals with achalasia may experience chest pain or discomfort, often due to the accumulation of food and fluids in the esophagus.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Achalasia is typically diagnosed through tests such as esophageal manometry, which measures the pressure within the esophagus, and barium swallow studies, which show the narrowing of the esophagus and the delayed emptying of contrast material.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Treatment options for achalasia include:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Heller Myotomy:&nbsp;</strong>This surgical procedure involves cutting the muscles of the LES to allow for improved passage of food and liquids into the stomach. It is the primary surgical treatment for achalasia.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Pneumatic Dilation:&nbsp;</strong>In this non-surgical procedure, a balloon is inflated within the LES to stretch and disrupt the muscle fibers, making it easier for food to pass.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Botulinum Toxin Injection:&nbsp;</strong>Injecting botulinum toxin directly into the LES can help relax the muscle temporarily. However, this treatment may need to be repeated periodically.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the patient's age, overall health, and the severity of the condition. Effective management of achalasia can alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for individuals with this disorder.</span></p>",

B) Pain in intermittent claudication comes at first step of walking.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Intermittent claudication is characterized by muscle pain (ache, cramp, numbness or sense of fatigue), classically in the calf muscle, which occurs during exercise and is relieved by a short period of rest (&lt; 5 minutes). The pain does not typically start with the first step but develops after a predictable distance of walking.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Rest pain is seen more in the night:&nbsp;</strong>True. Rest pain is a more severe symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). It typically indicates more advanced disease than intermittent claudication. This pain occurs when the limb is at rest, often at night due to the decreased perfusion that results from the horizontal position of the limb. It often awakens the patient from sleep and can be relieved by hanging the leg over the bed or walking.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Most common cause is atheroma:&nbsp;</strong>True. The most common cause of intermittent claudication is atherosclerosis (plaque or atheroma formation) in the peripheral arteries. This reduces blood flow to the muscles during activity, causing pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. The clinical stem does not reflect the site of peripheral arterial obstruction:&nbsp;</strong>True. The site of pain (e.g., calf, thigh) does not always directly correlate with the level of arterial obstruction. For instance, while calf pain is often due to femoropopliteal disease, it can also be caused by aortoiliac disease. However, the location of claudication pain can provide a clue to the level of disease.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The incorrect statement among the provided options is that pain in intermittent claudication occurs at the first step of walking.</span></p>",

Based on the available evidence, there is no indication of muscle invasion or advanced cancer, suggesting that the most probable pathological stage is pTa - low grade non-muscle invasive cancer, for which TURBT followed by intravesical chemotherapy is the recommended treatment. TURBT is performed to pathologically stage the tumor and determine the appropriate course of treatment. Intravesical therapy using chemotherapy or immunotherapy is administered after TURBT to eradicate any residual cancer cells in the bladder lining, but it is not effective against cancers that have spread to muscle layers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">This is the correct answer. TURBT is a standard initial procedure for diagnosing and treating visible tumors, especially for low-grade, noninvasive disease. It involves removing the tumor from the bladder wall via the urethra. The stage of the bladder cancer can be determined by examining the sample removed during a TURBT, which aids in further treatment decisions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Resection with ileal conduit</strong>: This is a more invasive surgery typically used for muscle invasive bladder cancers (radical cystectomy). An ileal conduit is a urinary diversion technique where urine is redirected through a piece of the intestine and out to a stoma on the abdomen.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Partial cystectomy with bladder reconstruction</strong>: This involves removing a part of the bladder affected by cancer. It's reserved for select patients where the tumor is localized and not near the urethral or ureteral openings. It might not be the first line of treatment for a 2x2 cm low-grade tumor.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy</strong>: This refers to chemotherapy given before a primary treatment in advanced cancers. In the case of bladder cancer, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy might be used before a surgery to shrink the tumor size or improve outcomes. However, for a low-grade, small tumor, it is not typically the first line of treatment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Non-muscle invasive bladder tumors (pTa/pT1): TUR-BT + Intravesical chemotherapy</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Muscle invasive (pT2/pT3 and some pT4): Radical cystectomy + Ileal conduit</strong></span></p>",

C) Diffuse axonal injury</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The patient's clinical presentation suggests the possibility of diffuse axonal injury, which occurs when the brain experiences shearing forces, often from rotational acceleration within the skull. This can result in damage to the subcortical parasagittal white matter, cerebellum, fornix, and internal and external capsule, leading to disruption of axons and microvasculature.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;Automobile accidents are the most common cause of diffuse axonal injury, and patients often remain unconscious from the moment of impact until death. Multiple focal lesions with a characteristic distribution are typical of diffuse axonal injury, and <strong>CT scans may appear normal</strong>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), is the preferred imaging modality for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury, and can reveal small regions of susceptibility artifact or hemorrhage. Subdural hemorrhage, extradural hemorrhage, and cerebral contusion are other potential traumatic brain injuries that can present with different imaging features and may require different treatments.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a type of traumatic brain injury that results from the shearing forces during rapid deceleration or rotational head trauma.
