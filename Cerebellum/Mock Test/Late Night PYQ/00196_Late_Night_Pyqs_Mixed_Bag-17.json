Increase flow rate to 15 L/min: </strong>The non-rebreather mask (NRB) is designed to deliver high concentrations of oxygen (up to 90%). Increasing the flow rate may slightly improve the fraction of delivered oxygen, but it may not result in significant improvement in oxygenation, especially if the cause of hypoxia isn't just a low FiO2. Therefore, merely increasing the flow rate may not be sufficient to address the patient's respiratory distress.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Endotracheal intubation: </strong>Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are invasive interventions, reserved for patients who are in respiratory failure and cannot maintain adequate oxygenation and/or ventilation with less invasive means. While this patient is hypoxic, jumping straight to intubation without trialing intermediate steps like HFNC might be premature, especially since the patient is alert and responsive.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D.

Outer hair cells are in 3-4 rows and modulate the function of inner hair cells</strong>: This is correct. Outer hair cells are indeed arranged in 3-4 rows.

Though adhesions could be the reason, the presence of air in biliary tree makes a diagnosis of gallstone ileus more likely.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, occurring due to the impaction of gallstones in the gastrointestinal tract. This occurs due to chronic gall bladder inflammation and formation of cholecysto-duodenal fistula (GB to duodenum). Through the communication, a gall stone may pass into the duodenum and then into small bowel.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Small gallstones may pass through the intestines spontaneously, but larger stones (2-5 cm) are more likely to cause obstruction, usually at the terminal ileum or ileocecal valve.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Symptoms may include acute, intermittent, or chronic episodes of gastrointestinal obstruction, abdominal distension and tenderness, high-pitched bowel sounds, and obstructive jaundice.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Diagnosis is typically made with a plain abdominal radiograph, which may show signs of obstruction, Pneumobilia (air within the biliary tree), and a gallstone in the intestines (RIGLER’S TRIAD).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Treatment involves surgical intervention, with a longitudinal incision made on the antimesenteric border to remove the gallstone.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>&nbsp;Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option B</strong>. <strong>Adhesive intestinal obstruction: </strong>This results from the formation of adhesions (bands of scar tissue) that can develop after surgery, which then bind the intestines together. These adhesions can pull the intestines out of place or create a kink or twist. The patient's history of an abdominal hysterectomy is suggestive of this, as post-surgical adhesions are a common cause of intestinal obstruction. However, the presence of air in the biliary tree does not fit with this diagnosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option C</strong>. <strong>Ischemic enterocolitis: </strong>Refers to inflammation of the intestine due to reduced blood supply, often caused by blockage or constriction of the blood vessels that serve the intestines.

While ischemic processes can cause pain and altered bowel sounds, the presence of pneumobilia on imaging is not consistent with ischemic enterocolitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Option D</strong>. <strong>Diverticulitis</strong>: Diverticulitis is the inflammation of one or more diverticula, which are small pouches that can form in the walls of the colon. Symptoms include lower left-sided abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits. While diverticulitis can lead to complications like abscesses, fistulas, or bowel obstructions, the specific presentation of vomiting bile and air within the biliary tree on imaging is not consistent with a primary diagnosis of diverticulitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis characterized by the presence of air within the biliary tree, obstructive symptoms, and the formation of a cholecysto-duodenal fistula.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:18px;\">It typically presents with signs of gastrointestinal obstruction and is diagnosed through imaging, revealing pneumobilia and a gallstone in the intestines.</span></li></ul>",

When the patient takes a bath with 40-degree Celsius water, which is lukewarm and not hot, the warm sensation should not normally cause pain. This temperature is considered a non-painful, or innocuous, thermal stimulus. In this scenario, the innocuous thermal receptors, which usually respond to non-painful stimuli, are activated. However, due to the skin's heightened sensitivity after sunburn, this harmless stimulus results in a painful sensation.
