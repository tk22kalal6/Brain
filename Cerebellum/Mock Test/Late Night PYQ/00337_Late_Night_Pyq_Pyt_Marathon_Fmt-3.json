C) 1, 3, 5 are true</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">This situation involves multiple aspects: legal, ethical, and medical considerations are paramount. Here's why each statement is addressed as true or false in this context:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>1. Document informed refusal:</strong> True. It is essential for medical practitioners to document any refusal of examination or treatment, particularly in sensitive cases involving minors. Documentation should include detailed information about what was explained to the patient and the guardian, and their reasons for refusal, to ensure clarity and legal safeguarding.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>3. Counsel the mother and daughter:</strong> True. The role of a gynecologist includes providing medical counseling, especially when it involves minors and sensitive issues such as sexual activity. Counseling should aim to educate about the health implications of the sexual activity, the benefits of medical examination, and the legal aspects considering the age of consent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>5. Inform the police:</strong> True. According to laws in many jurisdictions, including India, any sexual activity with a minor, regardless of consent, is considered statutory rape. Medical professionals are mandated reporters, which means they are legally obligated to report such cases to law enforcement to ensure the safety of the minor and adhere to legal statutes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>2. Do not inform the police:</strong> False. The gynecologist has a mandatory obligation to report cases of suspected statutory rape, as non-reporting could be considered a failure of duty and legal non-compliance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>4. Examine with necessary force:</strong> False. It is illegal and unethical to perform a medical examination against a patient's will, especially in the case of a minor. The patient's autonomy must be respected, and no examination should proceed without consent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Examination of a victim of sexual assault should be done only after the consent of the victim. It is the accused who can be examined without consent, not the victim. Whether the victim agrees for examination or not, the police always have to be informed as there is an allegation of crime of rape (as sex even with consent with a girl &lt;18 years of age will be considered rape)</span></p>",

The presence of <strong>basophilic stippling</strong> in the red blood cells, as observed in the peripheral blood smear, is a hallmark feature of lead poisoning. Basophilic stippling represents <strong>aggregates of ribosomal material</strong> that remain in red blood cells due to the disruption of <strong>heme synthesis</strong> caused by lead toxicity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Lead interferes with the activity of several enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway, leading to defective red blood cell maturation and characteristic basophilic stippling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Viral infection affecting erythropoiesis, causing aberrant RNA synthesis: </strong>Incorrect. While viral infections can affect erythropoiesis, they do not typically lead to the basophilic stippling seen in lead poisoning.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Lead poisoning leading to abnormal iron metabolism, causing intracellular iron accumulation within red blood cells: </strong>Incorrect. Lead poisoning does not cause intracellular iron accumulation but affects heme synthesis, leading to the formation of ribosomal aggregates within red blood cells, which is reflected as basophilic stippling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, caused by the production of autoantibodies against red blood cell antigens: </strong>Incorrect. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia typically causes hemolysis and spherocytes in the blood smear but does not result in basophilic stippling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Students should recognize <strong>basophilic stippling</strong> as a key feature of <strong>lead poisoning</strong>, resulting from the disruption of heme synthesis and the accumulation of <strong>ribosomal material</strong> in red blood cells. This is important in diagnosing children exposed to lead, which can lead to significant anemia and other systemic effects</span></p>",

The syndrome consists of acute Wernicke's encephalopathy and chronic Korsakoff's psychosis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Bariatric Surgery:</strong> This is a valid cause of thiamine deficiency due to malabsorption following surgical alteration of the gastrointestinal tract. The reduced absorption surface and altered anatomy directly impact thiamine absorption.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Chronic Alcoholic:</strong> Alcoholism is a major cause of thiamine deficiency due to poor dietary intake, impaired absorption, and increased metabolism of thiamine. Chronic alcohol use interferes with thiamine uptake and utilization.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Chronic Use of Diuretics:</strong> Loop diuretics especially can cause thiamine deficiency by increasing its urinary excretion. This is particularly significant in patients on long-term diuretic therapy for conditions like heart failure.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a consequence rather than a cause of thiamine deficiency. Understanding this distinction is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment of thiamine deficiency states.</span></p>",

Brain Mapping</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Brain mapping is based on the principle that if a suspect has prior knowledge of an event or activity, it will be reflected in their brain wave responses. This technique involves measuring electrical brain wave responses (P300) to familiar stimuli, such as words, phrases, or pictures, presented on a computer screen. The P300 wave is an event-related potential (ERP) component elicited in the process of decision-making and is used to detect the recognition of familiar information. When a suspect recognizes the stimuli related to the event or activity, their brain produces a distinct response that can be measured and analyzed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option A. Truth Serum:</strong> Truth serum refers to drugs used to make a person more likely to divulge truthful information. These drugs work by depressing the central nervous system to the point where the subject is less capable of resisting questioning and less likely to lie. It does not rely on physiological responses to prior knowledge.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B. Polygraph:</strong> The polygraph test measures physiological responses such as heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity to determine if a person is lying. It is based on the theory that deceptive answers will produce physiological changes due to the emotional responses associated with lying, such as fear or anxiety. However, it does not specifically rely on the prior knowledge of events or activities.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option C. Hypnosis:</strong> Hypnosis involves putting a subject into a trance-like state where they may be more open to suggestions and potentially recall forgotten details. It does not rely on physiological responses related to prior knowledge and is not primarily used for detecting deception based on prior knowledge of events.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Brain mapping detects recognition of familiar stimuli through brain wave responses, reflecting a suspect's prior knowledge of events&nbsp;or&nbsp;activities</span></p>",
