From the given options, only two are actual gluconeogenic enzymes. Pyruvate carboxylase converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria, requiring ATP and biotin as cofactor. This is the first step in bypassing the pyruvate kinase reaction. Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the final step, converting glucose-6-phosphate to free glucose, which allows glucose release from liver and kidney cells.

B) Zn (Zinc)</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a critical role in numerous biological functions, including growth, immune function, and reproduction. Zinc deficiency is associated with several clinical manifestations, among which hypogonadism and delayed sexual maturation are prominent. Hypogonadism refers to a condition where the body does not produce enough sex hormones, which can lead to delayed puberty, underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics, and infertility.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The deficiency of zinc impairs the normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to decreased production of testosterone in males and estrogen in females. This hormonal imbalance is directly linked to the symptoms of sexual maturation defects observed in zinc-deficient individuals.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Zinc also plays a significant role in wound healing, immune function, and DNA synthesis. Its deficiency can lead to delayed wound healing, impaired immune response, and chronic diarrhea, further exacerbating the clinical picture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. Selenium</strong>: Selenium deficiency is primarily associated with oxidative stress-related conditions, such as Keshan disease (a type of cardiomyopathy) and Kashin-Beck disease (a type of osteoarthropathy). It is not typically associated with hypogonadism or sexual maturation defects.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Cu (Copper)</strong>: Copper deficiency can lead to anemia, neutropenia, and neurological issues but is not linked with hypogonadism or delayed sexual maturation. Copper is involved in iron metabolism and the functioning of several enzymes but does not directly impact the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Iron</strong>: Iron deficiency is well-known for causing anemia, particularly microcytic hypochromic anemia, and can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. While severe iron deficiency can impact overall growth and development, it is not specifically associated with hypogonadism or sexual maturation defects.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Zinc deficiency is directly linked to hypogonadism and delayed sexual maturation, along with other symptoms such as impaired wound healing, decreased immunity, and chronic diarrhea. Recognizing and correcting zinc deficiency is crucial for preventing these clinical outcomes.</span></p>",

Glycosylation is a process where sugars are added to proteins or lipids, but it occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, primarily during and after translation, not during post-transcriptional modifications. Post-transcriptional modifications occur to RNA molecules after they have been transcribed from DNA but before they are translated into proteins.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

For example, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the RNA to protect it from degradation and assist in ribosome binding during translation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Endonuclease cleavage</strong>: This is part of the splicing process where introns are removed from the pre-mRNA. Endonucleases cut within the nucleotide sequence, helping to remove non-coding sequences (introns) from the RNA transcript.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Capping</strong>: This process involves adding a modified guanine nucleotide (7-methylguanosine) to the 5' end of the RNA.

D) DNA editing</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a powerful tool used for DNA editing. It works by creating double-strand breaks in the DNA at specific locations. The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) component guides the Cas9 endonuclease to the precise cutting site within the genome.
