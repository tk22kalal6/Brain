It predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients. The characteristic endoscopic finding in CMV esophagitis is the presence of large, linear or serpiginous (snake-like) ulcers, often located in the distal esophagus. These ulcers typically have well-defined edges and are surrounded by relatively normal mucosa, which helps to differentiate them from other types of esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Candida Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Candida esophagitis is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans. It is common in immunocompromised patients or those on prolonged antibiotics or inhaled steroids. Endoscopic findings typically show white-yellow plaques or patches that can be scraped off, often described as having a \"cottage cheese-like\" appearance, rather than serpiginous ulcers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Herpetic Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Herpetic esophagitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. It is characterized by odynophagia (painful swallowing) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Endoscopically, herpetic esophagitis usually presents with small, well-circumscribed ulcers that resemble \"volcano-like\" or \"punched-out\" lesions, which are different from the serpiginous ulcers seen in CMV esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option D. Radiation Esophagitis:&nbsp;</strong>Radiation esophagitis is a side effect of radiation therapy, particularly for cancers in the chest area, such as lung cancer. It manifests with symptoms like pain, difficulty swallowing, and a sensation of something stuck in the throat. Endoscopic findings may include mucosal redness, swelling, and non-specific ulcerations, but not the distinct serpiginous ulcers typical of CMV esophagitis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">Serpiginous ulcers in the esophagus observed during endoscopy are characteristic of CMV esophagitis, especially in immunocompromised patients.

Achalasia cardia</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Heller's operation, also known as Heller myotomy, is a surgical procedure designed to treat achalasia. During this procedure, the surgeon makes a series of cuts into the thickened muscle of the LES to allow it to relax and improve the passage of food into the stomach. So, Heller's operation is indeed done for achalasia cardia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Carcinoma esophagus: </strong>Carcinoma of the esophagus refers to cancer that starts in the esophagus. While surgeries are often performed for esophageal cancer, Heller's operation specifically is not one of them. Instead, procedures like esophagectomy (removal of all or part of the esophagus) are performed for esophageal cancer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Esophageal stricture: </strong>An esophageal stricture is a narrowing of the esophagus, which can lead to difficulty swallowing. It can result from various causes, including acid reflux or injuries to the esophagus. Esophageal dilatation (stretching of the esophagus using dilators) is commonly done for esophageal strictures.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: </strong>Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a condition in infants where the muscle at the junction between the stomach and the small intestine (the pylorus) becomes enlarged, leading to obstruction. The treatment for this condition is a surgery called pyloromyotomy, where the thickened muscle is split to relieve the obstruction.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>In conclusion, among the given options, Heller's operation is specifically done for achalasia cardia (Option A).</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Heller's myotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat achalasia cardia by cutting the lower esophageal sphincter muscle to relieve obstruction and improve swallowing.</span></p>",

This type of ulcer is typically neuropathic or trophic due to nerve damage caused by leprosy, leading to decreased sensation and subsequent injury. The first and most crucial step in managing such ulcers is debridement and proper dressing.

Proper dressing keeps the ulcer protected and aids in healing by maintaining an optimal moisture balance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Subsequent steps after debridement include appropriate foot care, offloading pressure from the affected area, and limb rehabilitation to prevent recurrence.

C) Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid has the least likelihood of lymph node metastasis among the given options. Follicular carcinoma typically presents as a solitary thyroid nodule with a strong tendency for hematogenous spread rather than lymphatic spread. While it commonly metastasizes to bones (particularly thoracic vertebrae and skull) via blood vessels, lymph node involvement is rare, except in the Hurthle cell variant which may show lymph node metastases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option A. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid</strong> - Incorrect because papillary carcinoma has a high propensity for lymph node metastasis. It frequently spreads to Level VI (central compartment) lymph nodes, and lymph node involvement is often present even in early disease. In fact, enlarged cervical lymph nodes may be the presenting feature of papillary carcinoma in some cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid</strong> - Incorrect because medullary carcinoma frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes. Involvement of lymph nodes occurs in 50-60% of cases of medullary carcinoma. This tumor, which arises from parafollicular C cells, also commonly spreads hematogenously, with the liver being the most common site of distant metastasis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Option D. Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid</strong> - Incorrect because anaplastic carcinoma is characterized by rapid growth, extensive local invasion, and early lymph node metastasis. Being the most aggressive thyroid malignancy, it shows infiltration of surrounding structures including lymph nodes early in its course, along with distant metastases typically to the lungs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid primarily spreads hematogenously to bones rather than via lymphatics, making it unique among thyroid carcinomas in having a relatively low rate of lymph node metastasis.</p>",

This surgical approach involves using a graft from the buccal mucosa (inner cheek lining) to replace or augment the narrowed segment of the urethra, thereby restoring normal urine flow. Buccal mucosal grafts are favored due to their durability, excellent tissue characteristics, and high success rates in reconstructive urology.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Pilonidal sinus:&nbsp;</strong>A pilonidal sinus is a small cyst or abscess that occurs in the cleft at the top of the natal cleft. It often contains hair and skin debris. Common symptoms include pain, redness, and swelling in the area of the buttocks crease, and sometimes it can release pus. Given that the patient's symptoms are around the anus and involve recurrent discharge and pain for several years, a pilonidal sinus, which primarily occurs in the cleft of the buttocks, is less likely.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option B. Carbuncle:&nbsp;</strong>A carbuncle is an infective gangrene seen on the back or chest wall. Carbuncles can lead to the formation of an abscess, and symptoms might include a lump filled with pus, which might weep or ooze. While carbuncles can form on any part of the body, their acute and more widespread nature differs from the chronic, recurrent discharge around the anus described by the patient.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option C. Boil:&nbsp;</strong>A boil, or furuncle, is a skin infection that starts in a hair follicle or oil gland. It typically starts as a reddened and tender area, which becomes hard and then softens as it fills with pus. Boils can occur anywhere on the body, but they're more common on the face, neck, armpits, buttocks, and thighs. Again, given the chronic and recurrent nature of the patient's symptoms specifically around the anus, a singular boil wouldn't match this presentation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">A fistula in ano is an abnormal tract that typically develops between the anal canal and the perianal skin, usually due to a previously untreated or inadequately treated abscess.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\">The chronic and recurrent nature of symptoms like discharge and pain around the anus is a hallmark of this condition.</span></li></ul>",

In elderly patients with a history of trauma, a sub-acute subdural hematoma often presents with symptoms that develop gradually over weeks due to slow venous bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped (banana-shaped) hyperdense area, which is characteristic of a subdural hematoma. The chronic nature of the subdural hematoma is suggested by the time course (3 weeks’ post-trauma) and is more common in the elderly due to brain atrophy, which increases the risk of bridging vein tears leading to SDH.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

      "solution": "<p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Ans. B) Duodenum</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The clinical scenario indicates a diagnosis of macrocytic anemia due to vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency. The resection of the duodenum is least likely to cause this condition. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the terminal ileum, and intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach is necessary for its absorption. Vitamin B12 is derived from animal products such as red meat, dairy, and eggs. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia with a peripheral smear showing macro-ovalocytes and a hypersegmented neutrophil. In contrast, the jejunum is mainly used in folic acid absorption, and the stomach and ileum are involved in the absorption of vitamin B12.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">While the duodenum contributes to overall nutrient absorption, vitamin B12 absorption is mainly absorbed in the ileum. So, resection of the duodenum alone might not as severely impact vitamin B12 absorption.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong>Option A.</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Jejunum</strong>: Resection of the jejunum can potentially lead to malabsorption of folic acid, as this is primarily absorbed in the jejunum or ileum.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Ileum:&nbsp;</strong>The ileum is a significant site for the absorption of vitamin B12 and is also involved in folic acid absorption. Resection of the ileum can severely disrupt the absorption of these nutrients, leading to macrocytic anemia.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Stomach:&nbsp;</strong>The stomach is the site for production of intrinsic factor, required for B12 absorption.</span></p>",
