Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that is not found in plant sources, making it a potential deficiency for strict vegetarians. As a result, the newborn of this mother is likely to experience a deficiency in vitamin B12.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\">While vitamin D is another nutrient that lacks plant sources, it can be synthesized in the skin through exposure to sunlight.
