A) Applanation Tonometry</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Applanation tonometry is specifically based on the Imbert-Fick Law (P=F/A), where pressure equals force divided by area. This principle states that the pressure inside an ideal sphere equals the force necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area of flattening. In applanation tonometry, the instrument's footplate flattens the cornea, and the pressure required for this flattening directly correlates with intraocular pressure. Fluorescein dye is used during the procedure, viewed under cobalt blue light to identify when the mires juxtapose each other, indicating the measurement endpoint.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Indentation Tonometry:</strong> This method, exemplified by the Schiotz tonometer, works on a different principle where a plunger indents the cornea. It depends on the relationship between the depth of corneal indentation and intraocular pressure, and is affected by scleral rigidity. It does not utilize the Imbert-Fick Law.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Dynamic Contour Tonometry:</strong> This is a more recent technique using a contoured tip that matches the shape of the cornea to minimize distortion. It uses a pressure sensor to directly measure intraocular pressure rather than applying the Imbert-Fick principle.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Rebound Tonometry:</strong> This technique involves propelling a small probe toward the cornea and analyzing its rebound characteristics. The deceleration of the probe upon corneal impact correlates with IOP. It works on principles of motion dynamics rather than the Imbert-Fick Law.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The Imbert-Fick Law (P=F/A) is the fundamental principle behind applanation tonometry, where the force required to flatten a specific area of cornea directly correlates with intraocular pressure - making it the gold standard for IOP measurement.</span></p>",

This X-linked inheritance pattern explains why the condition predominantly affects males.

This is termed \"aerobic glycolysis\" because it occurs under aerobic conditions, yet results in lactate production (which normally happens under anaerobic conditions).

C) Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> </p><p> </p><p>Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid has the least likelihood of lymph node metastasis among the given options. Follicular carcinoma typically presents as a solitary thyroid nodule with a strong tendency for hematogenous spread rather than lymphatic spread. While it commonly metastasizes to bones (particularly thoracic vertebrae and skull) via blood vessels, lymph node involvement is rare, except in the Hurthle cell variant which may show lymph node metastases.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Option A. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid</strong> - Incorrect because papillary carcinoma has a high propensity for lymph node metastasis. It frequently spreads to Level VI (central compartment) lymph nodes, and lymph node involvement is often present even in early disease. In fact, enlarged cervical lymph nodes may be the presenting feature of papillary carcinoma in some cases.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Option B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid</strong> - Incorrect because medullary carcinoma frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes. Involvement of lymph nodes occurs in 50-60% of cases of medullary carcinoma.

Cellular swelling</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Cellular swelling is not a feature of apoptosis. In fact, the opposite occurs in apoptosis - cells undergoing apoptosis demonstrate cell shrinkage rather than swelling. Apoptosis is characterized by reduction in cell size (shrinkage) and the formation of membrane-bound fragments called apoptotic bodies. This is in contrast to necrosis, where cellular swelling is a prominent early feature.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">The morphologic features of apoptosis include cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation (nuclear compaction), formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies, and maintenance of an intact plasma membrane until late in the process.

Chromatin condensation or compaction is one of the most characteristic features of apoptosis, where the chromatin aggregates peripherally under the nuclear membrane into dense masses of various shapes and sizes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intact cell membrane</strong> - This is a feature of apoptosis. Unlike necrosis where there is early loss of membrane integrity, in apoptosis the plasma membrane remains intact throughout most of the process. This prevents leakage of cellular contents and thus prevents inflammation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Cytoplasmic eosinophilia</strong> - This is a feature of apoptosis. The cytoplasm of apoptotic cells appears more eosinophilic (red) when stained with H&E due to increased protein density as the cell shrinks and becomes more compact. Apoptotic cells are often described as having a rounded or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Apoptosis features cell shrinkage (not swelling), intact plasma membrane, nuclear compaction, and increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, representing a regulated form of cell death that avoids inflammation, in contrast to necrosis which is characterized by cellular swelling and membrane rupture.</span></p>",

Rather, barrier methods like condoms provide contraception without altering tubal anatomy or function. While there are numerous documented risk factors for ectopic pregnancy including various contraceptive methods, condoms do not appear among these established risk factors.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP)</strong>: Incorrect. Use of progestin-only pills or postcoital estrogen preparations increases the chance of tubal pregnancy, likely due to impaired tubal motility. OCPs can alter tubal function, potentially increasing risk when contraception fails.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Intrauterine device (IUD)</strong>: Incorrect. IUDs are associated with increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. While they effectively prevent intrauterine pregnancy, they prevent tubal implantation to a lesser extent. There is a relative increase in tubal pregnancy (7 times more) should pregnancy occur with an IUD in situ. The relative risk varies by IUD type: Progestasert > LNG-IUD > Copper IUD.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Tubal ligation</strong>: Incorrect. This is a significant risk factor. There is a 15-50% chance of pregnancy being ectopic if conception occurs after sterilization failure. Tubal surgery (either for sterilization or fertility restoration) represents one of the highest risk factors for ectopic pregnancy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">While barrier methods like condoms have no effect on ectopic pregnancy risk, hormonal contraceptives, IUDs, and surgical procedures involving the fallopian tubes significantly increase the risk of ectopic implantation due to their effects on tubal function, anatomy, or motility.</span></p>",

A) Rubra-Serosa-Alba</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Lochia (vaginal discharge following delivery) progresses through three distinct stages in a specific sequence. The first type is lochia rubra which appears during days 1-4 post-delivery and is red in color. This is followed by lochia serosa, which is yellowish-brownish or pink or pale brownish in color and occurs during days 5-9 post-delivery. Finally, lochia alba appears, which is pale white in color and lasts from days 10-15. This progression reflects the healing process of the uterine cavity after placental separation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Option B.

This susceptibility helps differentiate S. pyogenes from other beta-hemolytic streptococci. The test is performed by placing a bacitracin disk on a culture plate and observing for a zone of inhibition around the disk, which indicates susceptibility.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Option A. Catalase positivity</strong> - This is incorrect because streptococci, including Group A Streptococcus, are catalase negative. The catalase test helps differentiate staphylococci (catalase positive) from streptococci (catalase negative). Finding catalase positivity would actually point away from streptococcal infection and toward staphylococcal infection.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Option B. Optochin sensitivity</strong> - This is incorrect because optochin sensitivity is specifically used for identifying Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci), not Group A streptococci. S. pneumoniae is highly sensitive to optochin, while other streptococci including Group A are typically resistant.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Option C. Bile solubility</strong> - This is incorrect because the bile solubility test is used primarily for identifying Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococci are soluble in bile whereas other streptococci, including Group A Streptococcus, are not bile soluble. This test would not help confirm a Group A streptococcal infection.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Bacitracin sensitivity testing is the key diagnostic test for the provisional identification of Group A Streptococcus from clinical specimens, with sensitivity to bacitracin being a distinctive characteristic that helps differentiate it from other beta-hemolytic streptococci.</p>",

Phenothiazines</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Miosis refers to pupillary constriction, often described as \"pinpoint pupils\" in severe cases. Phenothiazines, which include chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic medications, produce mydriasis (pupillary dilation) rather than miosis due to their antagonistic effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. This anticholinergic activity blocks the parasympathetic stimulation of the pupillary sphincter muscles, preventing constriction and allowing for pupillary dilation.</p><p> </p><p>In toxicological assessment, pupillary examination is critical because it often provides immediate diagnostic clues. The classic triad of opioid toxidrome includes respiratory depression, CNS depression, and miosis. This characteristic pinpoint pupil appearance has high diagnostic value, particularly when unresponsive to light in severe intoxication. Pupillary changes usually persist even in comatose states, making them valuable signs when patients cannot provide history.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Option A. Clonidine</strong> - Produces miosis through its alpha-2 adrenergic agonist effects. This centrally-acting antihypertensive consistently causes pupillary constriction that can be distinguished from opioid-induced miosis by its responsiveness to light.</li><li><strong>Option B. Morphine</strong> - Causes significant miosis by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. The miosis is often extreme and unreactive to light stimuli in significant overdose, making it a cardinal sign in opioid toxicity.</li><li><strong>Option C. Meperidine</strong> - As with other opioids, it produces pupillary constriction through mu-receptor activation. This effect is dose-dependent and remains present even when other symptoms fluctuate.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Pupillary examination provides rapid diagnostic information in toxicology cases - miosis indicates opioids, organophosphates or clonidine, while mydriasis suggests anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, or phenothiazines like chlorpromazine.</p>",

Late distal tubule and collecting duc</strong>t</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">In central diabetes insipidus, there is a deficiency of ADH (vasopressin) secretion from the posterior pituitary.

This causes the already dilute fluid entering from the distal tubule to remain hypotonic without the normal water reabsorption that would concentrate it. In diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality can be extremely low (50-100 mOsm/L) due to this lack of water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

Closing of the mitral valve</strong> The mitral valve closes at the beginning of ventricular systole, not during the falling phase of aortic pressure.

Specifically, the middle fibers of the deltoid are powerful abductors of the arm at the shoulder joint. The deltoid is a triangular muscle that covers the shoulder joint and gives the shoulder its rounded contour. It is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5, C6). The multipennate arrangement of its acromial fibers allows for strong abduction force, making it the main muscle for this movement range.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Option a) Supraspinatus</strong> - While controversial, the supraspinatus is traditionally thought to initiate abduction (0°-15°) rather than being the primary muscle for 15°-90° abduction.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: A. Long thoracic nerve of Bell</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Winging of the scapula occurs due to paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle, which is supplied by the long thoracic nerve of Bell (C5-C7). When damaged, the medial border of the scapula protrudes from the posterior chest wall, especially when the patient pushes against resistance. The person is unable to perform pushing or punching movements, and overhead abduction of the arm is affected. The serratus anterior normally holds the scapula against the thoracic wall, and its paralysis leads to this characteristic deformity where the inferior angle of the scapula becomes prominent.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Option B. Ulnar nerve</strong>: Supplies intrinsic hand muscles and causes ulnar claw hand when injured. It has no relation to the scapular muscles or position.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Option C. Lower subscapular nerve</strong>: Supplies the teres major and part of the subscapularis muscles. Its injury would affect shoulder rotation but not cause scapular winging.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Option D. Thoracodorsal nerve</strong>: Supplies the latissimus dorsi muscle. Injury to this nerve affects extension, adduction, and medial rotation of the arm but does not cause winging of the scapula.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Education Objective:</strong> </p><p> </p><p>Winging of the scapula is pathognomonic of serratus anterior paralysis due to long thoracic nerve (Bell's nerve) injury, making it impossible for the patient to press against a wall without the medial border of scapula becoming abnormally prominent.</p>",

During a fugue, individuals often appear well-groomed and behave in a seemingly normal, goal-directed way, which reflects preserved self-care and orientation. However, once the fugue ends, they usually experience amnesia for what occurred during the episode. While in the fugue state, they might not even recognize anything is wrong and may deny memory issues. These episodes can last from minutes to months, and some individuals may have recurrent fugues. In DSM-5, dissociative fugue is considered a specifier of dissociative amnesia.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

Schizophrenia:</strong> People with schizophrenia may wander, but it’s typically disorganized or bizarre rather than purposeful. There are other signs also  like hallucinations, delusions, or negative symptoms. The person’s well-groomed appearance and coherent behavior is  against this diagnosis.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Dementia:</strong> Wandering can happen in dementia, but the onset is usually gradual, and the person often appears disheveled or confused. Dementia-related wandering stems from memory loss and impaired judgment, not dissociation. Plus, the sudden nature described in this case doesn't fit with how dementia typically presents.</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">If someone suddenly leaves home and ends up in a new place with intact self-care, normal-seeming behavior, and later has no memory of it, it must be dissociative fugu<strong>e</strong>—especially if there are no psychotic or neurocognitive symptoms present.</span></p>",

Starvation leads to a drop in GnRH, which lowers FSH and LH levels, resulting in decreased estrogen and subsequent menstrual irregularities or absence. While amenorrhea was once a diagnostic criterion in DSM-IV and ICD-10, it is no longer required in DSM-5 or ICD-11—but it remains a common clinical feature.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><ul><li><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

C) Excess Melanin</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by decreased melanin, not excess melanin. PKU is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to increased levels of phenylalanine in the blood and decreased levels of tyrosine. Since tyrosine is a precursor for melanin synthesis, patients with PKU have decreased melanin production, resulting in characteristic physical features including blonde hair, fair skin, and blue eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option A.

A) Tullio Phenomenon</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tullio phenomenon refers to the development of vertigo and nystagmus in response to loud sounds. This occurs due to a pathological connection between the sound-conducting system and the vestibular apparatus. Loud sounds cause abnormal stimulation of the vestibular system, resulting in vestibular symptoms. This phenomenon is seen in conditions like superior semicircular canal dehiscence, perilymphatic fistula, and advanced otosyphilis where there is an abnormal communication between the inner ear fluid compartments.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Hennebert's Sign</strong>: This refers to the development of vertigo and nystagmus on applying pressure to the external auditory canal (positive fistula test) in the absence of a demonstrable fistula (false positive). It is typically seen in congenital syphilis due to the presence of fibrous adhesions between the stapes footplate and the membranous labyrinth. Unlike Tullio phenomenon which is triggered by sound, Hennebert's sign is elicited by pressure changes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option C. Roll-over Phenomenon</strong>: This is seen in retrocochlear hearing loss (e.g., acoustic neuroma). It refers to a decrease in speech discrimination scores as the intensity of sound is increased beyond a certain level. Unlike Tullio phenomenon, it does not involve vertigo and is related to hearing discrimination rather than vestibular function.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Recruitment Phenomenon</strong>: This is the abnormal growth of loudness perception seen in cochlear hearing loss. Patients with cochlear lesions have difficulty hearing soft sounds, but as intensity increases, they perceive loudness as rapidly growing to normal or even uncomfortable levels. This phenomenon affects hearing rather than balance and does not cause vertigo.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\"><strong>Educational Objective:</strong> </span></p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Tullio phenomenon specifically describes the vestibular symptoms (vertigo and nystagmus) induced by loud sounds due to pathological communication between the sound-conducting and vestibular systems of the inner ear.</span></p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: D. Tofacitinib</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Tofacitinib is a synthetic non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that acts as a JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor. It specifically inhibits JAK-3 and JAK-1 kinases, interfering with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and DNA transcription. Tofacitinib inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokine release. It's classified among the conventional DMARDs as an inhibitor of JAK, along with baricitinib (which is also used in COVID-19).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Option A. Etanercept</strong> - This is a biological DMARD that works by inhibiting TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha). It's administered through subcutaneous route and is categorized among the TNF-α inhibitors including Adalimumab, Certolizumab, Etanercept, Infliximab, and Golimumab.</li><li><strong>Option B. Tocilizumab</strong> - This is a biological DMARD that acts as an IL-6 receptor antagonist. It was the first IL-6 targeted monoclonal antibody and is approved for treatment of cytokine release syndrome as well.</li><li><strong>Option C. Abatacept</strong> - This is a biological DMARD classified as a co-stimulation inhibitor. It functions by inhibiting the interaction between T-cells and Antigen Presenting Cells (APC).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong> </p><p> </p><p>Tofacitinib represents a distinct class of DMARDs that targets intracellular signaling via JAK inhibition, whereas biological DMARDs like etanercept, tocilizumab, and abatacept target specific extracellular cytokines or cell-surface interactions.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Answer: C. NK1 receptor antagonist</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> </p><p> </p><p>Aprepitant is a selective, high-affinity NK1 receptor antagonist that blocks the emetic action of substance P. It works by specifically binding to neurokinin-1 receptors in the central nervous system, particularly in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). This mechanism is distinct from the more common 5-HT3 receptor antagonists used as antiemetics.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Option A. RANK ligand inhibitor</strong> - This mechanism belongs to drugs affecting bone metabolism like denosumab, not to antiemetic medications.</li><li><strong>Option B. NMDA antagonist</strong> - This mechanism relates to certain anesthetics and analgesics, not to aprepitant or other antiemetics.</li><li><strong>Option D. 5-HT3 antagonist</strong> - While this is the mechanism for ondansetron, granisetron, and palonosetron, aprepitant specifically works through NK1 receptors with minimal effect on 5-HT3 receptors.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong> </p><p> </p><p><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;\">Aprepitant's unique NK1 receptor antagonism makes it particularly valuable for preventing delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting when combined with 5-HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone, providing superior control over the complete course of CINV.</span></p>",
