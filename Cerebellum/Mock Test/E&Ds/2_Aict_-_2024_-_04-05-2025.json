Symptoms had developed insidiously over months, remained unchanged for many years and were not associated with trauma or injury. The symptoms were intermittent, but ascending and descending stairs, rising from a chair, sitting for longer than 30 minutes and walking were consistently painful. Symptoms eased with rest, providing he didn’t sit for longer than 30 minutes with his knees in a flexed position. Prior to developing the knee pain, the patient participated in a variety of sports activities, which he gradually withdrew from over the following 6 years. Observation of the patient revealed mild to moderate retro-patellar pain towards the end of physiological flexion. Following the examination process, it was felt that the patient’s signs and symptoms were consistent with Patello-Femoral Pain (PFP). He complained of pain when the patellofemoral joint was loaded. The patellar tendon was not painful when palpated and he reported signs of fear and anxiety of movement and physical activity. The patient was taught to perform exercises twice daily, one uncomfortable/painful exercise as part of his rehabilitation programme. All the following will cause PFP except?</span></p>",

There was no history suggestive of chest, abdominal, facial, head, or spinal injury, ear, or nose bleeding. The vital signs were stable, and the main complaints were pain, gross swelling and painful restriction of movements of knee joints. Clinical examination on admission revealed a healthy male, who was fully conscious and oriented with a GCS score of 15. Clinical examination of the head and neck, chest, abdomen and spine, and pelvis showed normal results. The lower limb examination revealed grossly swollen knee joints with abrasions over both knees. There was a transverse lacerated wound in the right knee that was stitched at the primary health centre where the patient took first aid after trauma before being referred to our institute. Distal circulation and neurology in both lower limbs were normal. X-rays on bilateral knee joints showed transverse fracture of right patella and comminuted fracture of left patella. Which of the following statements is true pertaining to the above case?</span></p>",
