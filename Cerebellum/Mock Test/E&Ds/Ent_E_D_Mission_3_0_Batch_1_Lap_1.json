A) Incomplete fusion between the first and second branchial arches</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>tragus</strong> develops from the <strong>first branchial arch</strong>, whereas the <strong>rest of the auricle (pinna)</strong> develops from the <strong>second branchial arch</strong>. Improper fusion between these two arches during embryogenesis results in the formation of a <strong>preauricular sinus or pit</strong>. These are usually located anterior to the tragus and may become infected, causing recurrent abscesses. <strong>Surgical excision</strong> of the entire tract is the treatment of choice for recurrent infections, while asymptomatic cases can be observed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B. Persistent second branchial cleft:&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. A <strong>second branchial cleft cyst or sinus</strong> presents as a <strong>fluctuant swelling along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle</strong>, usually in the <strong>lateral neck</strong>, not near the ear. It does not cause preauricular sinus formation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option C.

This would lead to <strong>atresia or stenosis</strong> of the external auditory canal, often associated with <strong>conductive hearing loss</strong>, not a preauricular sinus.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D. Remnant of the first pharyngeal pouch:&nbsp;</strong>Incorrect. The <strong>first pharyngeal pouch</strong> gives rise to the <strong>Eustachian tube, middle ear cavity, and mastoid air cells</strong>.

The <strong>greater auricular nerve</strong> (from the <strong>cervical plexus, C2–C3</strong>) supplies the <strong>medial surface and posterior portion of the lateral surface</strong> of the auricle, including the area over the mastoid region.

It is not used for tympanic membrane repair.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.

It is indicated when the ossicles are diseased or disrupted (e.g., in chronic suppurative otitis media with ossicular necrosis). Since this patient has an intact ossicular chain, myringoplasty alone is sufficient.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option D.

C) True negative fistula test indicates late stages of Ménière’s disease</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">In <strong>late-stage Ménière’s</strong>, fibrosis may fix the labyrinth, but sometimes residual fibrous attachments between the <strong>membranous labyrinth and footplate</strong> can mimic a <strong>false positive</strong> (Hennebert’s sign).</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Hence, <strong>true negative</strong> is <i>not typical</i> for late-stage Ménière’s — the labyrinth may still respond abnormally (false positive).</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">The <strong>fistula test</strong> is used to detect <strong>perilymphatic fistula</strong> or <strong>labyrinthine erosion</strong>, particularly over the <strong>lateral semicircular canal</strong>, as in <strong>cholesteatoma</strong>.</span></p><p><br><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Pressure over the <strong>tragus</strong> or via <strong>Siegel’s pneumatic speculum</strong> changes middle ear pressure; if this stimulates the labyrinth (abnormally connected), the patient experiences <strong>vertigo and nystagmus</strong> — a <strong>positive fistula sign</strong>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Other Options:</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option A. True positive fistula test indicates perilymph fistula:</strong> True.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">A <strong>true positive</strong> result occurs when there is a <strong>real perilymphatic communication</strong>, e.g., due to <strong>cholesteatoma erosion of the lateral semicircular canal</strong>.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Mechanism: Pressure → perilymph movement → cupula deflection → vertigo &amp; nystagmus.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\">Also called <strong>circumscribed labyrinthitis</strong> when limited to one canal.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.0pt;\"><strong>Option B.
