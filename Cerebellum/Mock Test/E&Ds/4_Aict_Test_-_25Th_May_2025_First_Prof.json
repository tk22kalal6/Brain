On physical examination, the heart rate is 120 bpm, blood pressure is 120/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 30 breaths/min. Examination also reveals abrasions on abdominal wall surface and no signs or presence of blood on external urethral meatus. Palpation reveals generalized tenderness over the entire abdominal region. In addition, the patient shows particular discomfort when stability of the pelvis is assessed by placing hands over his pubic symphysis and laterally applying pressure over the iliac blades. He does not have full hip extension and rotation in supine lying. Rectal exam is negative for gross blood, and the patient has a normally placed prostate. X-Rays of the pelvis in 3 planes (AP, lateral, and oblique views) was ordered to determine if the patient has a fractured pelvis and a flat plate of the abdomen to determine if the patient has free air in his abdomen. A diagnostic supraumbilical peritoneal lavage turns out negative. The patient was diagnosed with a pelvic fracture, complicated by internal bleeding. Angiography showed a laceration of the internal pudendal artery, and a selective embolization is performed. External fixation of the pelvis is performed after the bleeding has been stabilized.

She had a history of gastric ulcer which had been treated previously with medication, but on questioning, she admitted that she had been so busy recently that she had forgotten to refill her prescription and had not taken her medication in some time. As a result of the history and physical findings, the physician suspected that she was suffering from a perforated gastric ulcer. Gastroscopy was performed which confirmed the diagnosis. When the surgeon examined the patient’s stomach during the surgery, she found a small perforation on the posterior aspect of the body of the stomach near the lesser curvature. The perforation was repaired and, in addition, a vagotomy was performed. During the vagotomy, the surgeon found it necessary to cut the left gastric artery and ligate it.
