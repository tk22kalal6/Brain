This degree of hyperlipidemia, especially with a family history of coronary artery disease, suggests familial hypercholesterolemia and confers a very high risk for cardiovascular events.&nbsp; <strong>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors</strong> (statins) are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia and have been proven to reduce the risk of cardiac events.&nbsp; The statins are structural analogs of HMG-CoA and competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis.</p><p>Serious side effects of statins include <strong>myopathy</strong> and <strong>hepatitis</strong>.&nbsp; Although mild elevations of liver enzymes are common, significant liver injury (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase levels more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) is seen in less than 1% of patients and is usually reversible if the medication is discontinued.&nbsp; <strong>Liver function tests</strong> are recommended before starting statin therapy; otherwise, routine monitoring is not necessary unless symptoms of hepatic injury develop (eg, fatigue, malaise, anorexia).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B) is a structural protein found in atherogenic lipoprotein particles.&nbsp; Each lipoprotein particle contains only a single Apo-B molecule, so measurement of Apo-B levels can quantify the LDL particle count.&nbsp; Patients with increased LDL particle counts are at greater risk for cardiovascular events.&nbsp; However, measurement is of limited clinical utility and would not change management in this case.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Statin medications do not cause any significant hematologic toxicity.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Lipoprotein lipase deficiency can cause familial hypertriglyceridemia (heterozygous deficiency) and chylomicronemia (homozygous deficiency) syndromes.&nbsp; These conditions present with elevated serum triglyceride levels but do not cause elevation in LDL levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Because cholesterol is a precursor in the synthesis of adrenocortical and gonadal steroid hormones, statin medications can, in theory, cause hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism.&nbsp; Clinically, however, there are no significant alterations in serum cortisol or gonadal steroid levels unless patients are also on other adrenal enzyme inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide).</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Statins have no significant renal side effects.&nbsp; In rare instances, they can cause rhabdomyolysis, which can precipitate acute renal failure; however, this occurs less commonly than hepatic dysfunction and would be associated with myalgias and myoglobinuria.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Common side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) include muscle and liver toxicity.&nbsp; Hepatic transaminases should be checked prior to initiating therapy and repeated if symptoms of hepatic injury occur.</p>",

HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; it helps to remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transports it to the liver for metabolism.&nbsp; This is accomplished through 2 different pathways.&nbsp; In the direct pathway, HDL delivers cholesterol esters directly to the liver via a scavenger receptor (SCARB1) on the hepatocyte cell membrane.&nbsp; In the indirect pathway, the cholesterol in HDL is transferred to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein.</p><p>Nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation help to raise HDL levels and have significant cardiovascular benefits.&nbsp; In contrast, use of medications to raise HDL levels does <strong>not</strong> improve cardiovascular outcomes.&nbsp; Pharmacologic treatment of patients with low HDL levels should focus on lowering LDL cholesterol with <strong>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors</strong> (statins), as these are the most effective lipid-lowering drugs for preventing cardiovascular events.&nbsp; Statins are indicated for secondary prevention in all patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, <strong>regardless</strong> of baseline lipid levels.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, but evidence for reduction in cardiovascular events is mixed, and benefits over statin monotherapy are likely minimal.&nbsp; It may be considered for patients who cannot take statins due to significant hepatotoxicity or myopathy, or who have very high LDL levels despite statin therapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cationic exchange resins (eg, cholestyramine) decrease LDL cholesterol by interfering with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.&nbsp; Bile acid binding resins can significantly increase triglyceride levels in patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia.&nbsp; In addition, cationic exchange resins have not been proven to prevent cardiac events.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Omega-3 essential fatty acids are sometimes used for hyperlipidemia treatment.&nbsp; They cause a decrease in serum triglycerides and a slight increase in HDL concentration but do not appear to significantly reduce cardiovascular events.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Niacin (vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font>) given in pharmacologic doses is the most effective agent for raising HDL levels, but does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and is associated with adverse effects (eg, flushing, hyperglycemia).&nbsp; It is primarily used for patients who have failed other lipid-lowering drugs.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Fibrates activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha, a transcription factor that increases lipoprotein lipase activity.&nbsp; Fibrates decrease triglyceride levels and raise HDL levels.&nbsp; However, fibrates are inferior to statins for reducing cardiovascular events and are primarily used to prevent pancreatitis in patients with very high triglyceride levels.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Although low HDL concentration is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, the use of medications to raise HDL levels does not improve cardiovascular outcomes.&nbsp; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) lower total cholesterol and LDL levels.&nbsp; Statins are the most effective lipid-lowering drugs for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline lipid levels.</p>",

Several days later, her abrupt-onset dyspnea and hypotension were most likely due to <strong>left ventricular (LV) free wall rupture</strong>, a potential mechanical complication of transmural MI.</p><p>LV free wall rupture usually occurs within 5 days but can occur up to 2 weeks following MI.&nbsp; During this time, the infarcted myocardial wall is substantially weakened by coagulative necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and enzymatic lysis of myocardial connective tissue and may be unable to withstand the shear stress generated by the high-pressure left ventricle.&nbsp; <strong>Delayed reperfusion</strong> (or absent reperfusion as in this patient), increases myocardial damage, further weakening the LV wall and <strong>increasing the risk of rupture</strong>.</p><p>With LV rupture, blood abruptly fills the pericardial space, resulting in hemopericardium and <strong>acute cardiac tamponade</strong> with rapidly <strong>increased intrapericardial pressure</strong>.&nbsp; At onset, patients may experience dyspnea, diaphoresis, and sometimes chest discomfort.&nbsp; Diastolic filling of the relatively low-pressure right-sided heart chambers is abruptly restricted (causing jugular venous distension), and blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to the left side of the heart drops precipitously (the <strong>lungs remain clear</strong>).&nbsp; Cardiac output profoundly decreases, resulting in <strong>hypotension</strong> and <a href=\"38617\">obstructive shock</a> that rapidly leads to cardiac arrest.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Papillary muscle rupture, causing acute mitral regurgitation, and interventricular septum rupture, causing a ventricular septal defect, can occur acutely or within 5 days of MI.&nbsp; Both defects typically cause a new holosystolic murmur and lead to LV failure with pulmonary edema.&nbsp; <a href=\"17984\">Cardiogenic shock</a> with hypotension commonly develops, but lung crackles would be expected on examination.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Ischemic reperfusion injury can occur when blood flow is abruptly restored to infarcted myocardium, and it may rarely lead to cardiac arrest (via precipitation of ventricular fibrillation or profound myocardial contractile dysfunction).&nbsp; However, it is extremely unlikely in this patient who received no reperfusion therapy.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; LV aneurysm formation is typically a delayed mechanical complication of MI, occurring after several weeks or months.&nbsp;
