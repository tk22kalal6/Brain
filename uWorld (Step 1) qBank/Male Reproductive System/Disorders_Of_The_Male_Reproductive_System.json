Regardless of lung or pancreas function, virtually all adult men with CF have <strong>azoospermia</strong> and <strong>infertility</strong>.&nbsp; Although spermatogenesis is usually normal, almost all males with CF are unable to secrete semen due to <strong>congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD)</strong>.&nbsp; <strong><em>CFTR</em> mutations</strong> are likely responsible for abnormal development of Wolffian structures, resulting in vasal agenesis and defective sperm transport.</p><p>A diagnosis of CF can be based on <strong>elevated sweat chloride levels</strong>.&nbsp;

Although, primary ciliary dyskinesia (eg, Kartagener syndrome) can cause recurrent pulmonary infections and digital clubbing, infertility in Kartagener syndrome is usually due to immotile spermatozoa.&nbsp;
