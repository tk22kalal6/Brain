These fibers primarily use <strong>oxidative phosphorylation</strong> (OP) to allow for sustained and efficient production of ATP.&nbsp; Therefore, they have a <strong>high content</strong> of <strong>lipids</strong> (fatty acids are a primary energy source for OP), <strong>myoglobin</strong> (to supply oxygen), and <strong>mitochondria</strong> (the cellular location of OP).&nbsp; The high myoglobin content gives these fibers a red color.</p><p><strong>Type II fibers</strong> (fast-twitch fibers) primarily specialize in rapid bursts of strength; they generate <strong>high force</strong> per contraction but <strong>quickly fatigue</strong>.&nbsp; These fibers produce ATP primarily via <strong>anaerobic&nbsp;glycolysis </strong>and have <strong>high glycogen</strong> levels.&nbsp; Therefore, they have low quantities of mitochondria and myoglobin (giving them a pale red or white color).</p><p>Targeted physical training stimulates specific phenotypic adaptations in skeletal muscle fibers to improve skeletal muscle function.&nbsp; <strong>Endurance training</strong> (eg, distance running, sustained light-to-moderate weightlifting) <strong>promotes</strong> the characteristics of <strong>type I fibers</strong> (eg, increased size and quantity of mitochondria) and also increases capillary density.&nbsp; In contrast, resistance training (eg, heavy weightlifting) amplifies the characteristics of type II fibers while also stimulating increased muscle mass.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Anaerobic glycolytic enzymes will decrease and aerobic oxidative enzymes will increase with endurance training.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp;

Endurance training amplifies the phenotypic characteristics of existing type I fibers; however, the total quantity of muscle fibers (myocytes) or the proportion of each type of muscle fiber does not significantly change with training.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Type I muscle fibers (slow-twitch or red fibers) primarily use oxidative phosphorylation and contain high quantities of lipids, myoglobin, and mitochondria.&nbsp; They specialize in sustained, low force contraction, and their function is amplified by endurance training.&nbsp; Type II muscle fibers (fast-twitch or white fibers) primarily use glycolysis and specialize in rapid bursts of high force contraction.&nbsp;

The symptoms are characteristically worse with rest (eg, in the morning, overnight) and improve with stretching and warm showers.&nbsp; AS is most common in men age &lt;40, and inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) are usually elevated.</p><p>AS is characterized by simultaneous erosion of bone and new bone formation, unlike rheumatoid arthritis in which only erosions occur.&nbsp; The initial pathogenesis is driven in part by inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, IL-17), which cause activation of osteoclast precursor cells and <strong>bony erosions</strong>.&nbsp; This occurs primarily in the vertebral bodies and results in destruction of the trabecular microarchitecture, increasing the risk for secondary osteoporosis and compression fractures.</p><p>Once inflammation subsides, the reparative process leads to <strong>excessive new bone formation</strong>, especially in areas where fat metaplasia fills previously eroded sites; in contrast to erosion, bone formation occurs primarily at the periosteum-cartilage junction and manifests as <a href=\"26826\">bridging syndesmophytes</a> in the vertebral column.&nbsp; This leads to <strong>spinal rigidity</strong>, postural alterations, and increased risk of fracture.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"62036\">Paget disease</a> of bone is characterized by excessive and disordered bone formation, with focal thickening of trabecular and cortical bone.&nbsp; Features include bone pain, fractures, and arthritis of adjacent joints.&nbsp; However, it is uncommon at age &lt;50, and this patient&#39;s inflammatory back pain is more consistent with AS.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"62037\">Fibrous dysplasia</a> (FD) is a benign tumor characterized by focal bone dysplasia (ie, failure of normal differentiation) and shows irregular trabeculae of immature bone in a fibrous stroma with spindle cells.&nbsp; It is typically asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging (eg, <a href=\"62038\">ground glass lesion</a>), commonly in the femur and tibia.&nbsp; FD is usually seen in children and is not an inflammatory condition (ie, normal ESR).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Intervertebral disc protrusion and thickening of the ligamentum flava can lead to <a href=\"62039\">spinal stenosis</a>.&nbsp; The pain in this disorder typically radiates to the posterior thighs and legs and is relieved by sitting and flexion of the spine, not activity.&nbsp; Spinal stenosis is usually seen at age &gt;60, and ESR is normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"44780\">Multiple myeloma</a> is characterized by plasmacytic infiltrates in the bone marrow.&nbsp; Patients often have <a href=\"37315\">lytic bone lesions</a> throughout the axial skeleton and back pain at night and during rest, but stiffness is less prominent.&nbsp; Multiple myeloma is uncommon before age 50.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy characterized by simultaneous erosion of bone and new bone formation.&nbsp; Bone erosions occur primarily in vertebral bodies; however, new bone formation typically occurs at the junction of the periosteal margin and adjacent cartilage, leading to bridging syndesmophytes and ankylosis.&nbsp; This causes spinal rigidity, postural alterations, and increased risk of fracture.</p>",
