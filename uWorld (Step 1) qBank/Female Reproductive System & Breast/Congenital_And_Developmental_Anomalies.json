During <a href=\"1536\">sexual differentiation</a> in females (XX), the <strong>m&uuml;llerian (paramesonephric) ducts</strong> give rise to the <strong>fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix</strong>, and <strong>upper vagina</strong>; the urogenital sinus gives rise to the lower vagina; and the wolffian (mesonephric) ducts degenerate in females from lack of hormonal stimulation by testosterone.</p><p><strong>M&uuml;llerian agenesis</strong> (ie, vaginal agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser syndrome) results in hypoplasia/aplasia of the m&uuml;llerian structures (ie, uterus/cervix/upper vagina/fallopian tubes), leading to <strong>variable uterine development</strong> (eg, rudimentary uterus) with <strong>no upper vagina</strong> (eg, shortened vagina with blind vaginal pouch).&nbsp; Because the uterus is absent or hypoplastic, the patient cannot menstruate (ie, <strong>primary amenorrhea</strong>).</p><p>Patients with m&uuml;llerian agenesis have <strong>normal ovaries</strong>, which arise embryologically from the genital ridge.&nbsp; Therefore, patients have normal, female-range levels of estrogen and testosterone and <strong>regular development of secondary sexual characteristics</strong> (eg, breast development, axillary/pubic hair).&nbsp;

Patients with <a href=\"1535\">androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)</a> are 46,XY males with androgen receptor defects.&nbsp; Patients appear phenotypically female (ie, no external male genitalia but breast development due to peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen); however, they have minimal axillary or pubic hair due to androgen resistance (unlike this patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics).&nbsp; In addition, patients with AIS have cryptorchid testes that actively secrete antim&uuml;llerian hormone, leading to complete regression of all m&uuml;llerian structures with an absent (not rudimentary) uterus.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"2154\">Kallmann syndrome</a> occurs due to decreased synthesis of GnRH in the hypothalamus (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).&nbsp; Although female patients are rarely affected, they can have primary amenorrhea but typically do not develop secondary sexual characteristics.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp;
