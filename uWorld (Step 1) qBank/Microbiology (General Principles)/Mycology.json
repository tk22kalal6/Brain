TNF-alpha is a crucial cytokine of the cell-mediated immune response that aids in macrophage activation, phagolysosome function, and the formation and maintenance of <a href=\"14990\">granulomas</a>.&nbsp; Blockade of TNF-alpha <strong>increases the risk of infection</strong> with pathogens controlled by the cell-mediated immune response such as intracellular bacteria (eg, <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>), viruses, and granulomatous fungi.</p><p>This patient&#39;s pulmonary and reticuloendothelial (eg, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly) findings and positive urine fungal antigen test raise&nbsp;strong suspicion for infection with <em><strong>Histoplasma capsulatum</strong></em>, a dimorphic fungus endemic to the <strong>Ohio</strong> and Mississippi River Valleys.&nbsp; <em>H capsulatum</em> is a mold that is inhaled from contaminated soil and converts to a yeast form in the lungs.&nbsp; Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages does not result in destruction of the organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome acidification.&nbsp; Therefore, for the first several weeks of infection, <a href=\"16063\"><em>H capsulatum</em></a> is able to <strong>proliferate within macrophages</strong> in an unchecked fashion.</p><p>Eventually, the cell-mediated immune response controls the infection in most healthy patients.&nbsp; However, those with impaired immunity (as in this case) are at high risk for life-threatening <strong>disseminated disease</strong>.&nbsp; The lungs, reticuloendothelial system, and mouth (oral ulcers) are most commonly affected.&nbsp; Urine <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen testing is often used to quickly confirm the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em> is a monomorphic mold that can cause invasive disease in those who are immunocompromised.&nbsp; This organism is inhaled into the lungs and can invade the vascular endothelial lining, leading to dissemination through the bloodstream.&nbsp; However, patients usually have fever, chest pain, and hemoptysis.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Candida</em> species are part of the endogenous human flora, but overgrowth can occur in those with immunocompromisation and lead to mucocutaneous (eg, thrush) or invasive (pneumonia, fungemia) disease.&nbsp; Invasive <em>Candida</em> infections are generally diagnosed by blood culture or biopsy with histopathology, not urine antigen testing.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em> is a yeast with a thick, antiphagocytic, polysaccharide capsule that primarily causes infections in those who are immunocompromised (particularly patients with advanced AIDS).&nbsp; Although pulmonary infection can occur, disseminated disease is usually marked by meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, confusion, altered mental state).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Malassezia</em> is a dimorphic fungus that is part of normal skin flora.&nbsp; Conversion from yeast form to the pathogenic mycelial form results in tinea versicolor, which is associated with the characteristic spaghetti and meatballs appearance on microscopy (ie, both hyphae and yeasts seen).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Tumor necrosis factor&ndash;alpha inhibitors are associated with impairments to the cell-mediated immune response and increase the risk of infection with intracellular bacteria and granulomatous fungi (eg, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>).&nbsp; <em>Histoplasma</em> replicates within the intracellular space of macrophages and can spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes and the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow).</p>",
