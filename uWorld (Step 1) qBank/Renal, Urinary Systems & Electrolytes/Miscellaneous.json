Administration of either agent initially results in natriuresis.&nbsp; However, continued use leads to significant volume depletion that counteracts the diuretic effect by decreasing glomerular filtration pressure.&nbsp; Reduced pressure natriuresis also decreases distal tubule Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> delivery, which is sensed by the macula densa and causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.&nbsp; Aldosterone then acts on the collecting tubule to enhance Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> reabsorption and promote K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> and H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> loss.&nbsp; Therefore,<strong> loop and thiazide diuretics</strong> cause <strong>hypokalemia</strong> and <strong>metabolic alkalosis </strong>secondary to volume contraction.</p><p>Loop diuretics function by inhibiting the absorption of solutes within the thick ascending limb of Henle&#39;s loop, a process that is critical for maintenance of the corticomedullary concentration gradient.&nbsp; As a result, patients on loop diuretics are unable to maximally concentrate their urine and thus lose substantial amounts of both salt and water in the urine.&nbsp; In contrast, patients taking thiazides have a normal corticomedullary concentration gradient and are better able to retain free water in response to increased vasopressin levels. &nbsp;Thus, patients taking <strong>thiazide diuretics</strong> are more likely to retain free water and develop <strong>hyponatremia</strong>.</p><p><strong>Thiazide diuretics</strong> can also lead to <strong>hypercalcemia</strong> secondary to increased proximal and distal tubule Ca<font size=\"2\"><sup>2+</sup></font> reabsorption.&nbsp; In contrast, loop diuretics decrease Ca<font size=\"2\"><sup>2+</sup></font> reabsorption in the thick ascending limb and can cause hypocalcemia <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Acetazolamide induces a mild degree of natriuresis by inhibiting bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule.&nbsp; The loss of bicarbonate in the urine also causes metabolic acidosis in addition to inducing natriuresis.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; Amiloride and spironolactone are potassium-sparing diuretics that induce a mild degree of natriuresis.&nbsp; By decreasing Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> reabsorption in the cortical collecting tubule, they reduce the luminal electronegative gradient, a major driving force for K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> and H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion by principal and intercalated cells, respectively. &nbsp;As a result, potassium-sparing diuretics can cause hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Thiazide and loop diuretics cause significant volume depletion, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can lead to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.&nbsp; Thiazide diuretics are more likely to cause hyponatremia and hypercalcemia; loop diuretics cause hypocalcemia.</p>",
