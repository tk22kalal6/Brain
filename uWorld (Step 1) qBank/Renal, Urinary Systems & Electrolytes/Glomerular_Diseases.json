Evidence for HCV infection includes multiple sexual partners and elevated aminotransferases.&nbsp; HCV-infected patients often produce cryoglobulins against <strong>exogenous</strong> HCV antigens that form <strong>circulating ICs</strong>, which activate complement, causing hypocomplementemia.&nbsp; These circulating ICs can deposit in small vessels (&#x22;cryoglobulinemic vasculitis&#x22;) affecting the kidney (eg, membranoproliferative GN), skin (eg, palpable purpura), and joints (eg, arthralgias).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; Antibodies targeting glomerular antigens, whether intrinsic (eg, membranous nephropathy) or deposited (eg, poststreptococcal GN), form ICs within the kidney; this typically results in <em>renal-limited disease</em>.&nbsp; Anti-GBM disease is an exception because the antibodies are directed against type IV collagen, which is also present in alveoli resulting in alveolar hemorrhage.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s fever, arthralgias, and rash indicate a <em>systemic process</em> characteristic of circulating immune complex deposition.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Antibodies targeting neutrophil antigens (myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3) can activate neutrophils, causing ANCA-associated GN and SVV (without significant IC deposition).&nbsp; Although the skin and joints can be affected, the respiratory tract and nerves are typically involved, and hypocomplementemia is unusual.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Preformed circulating ICs against endogenous antigens are the cause of IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis.&nbsp; IgA nephropathy is more common in children following upper respiratory infections; serum complement is usually normal because IgA fixes complement poorly.&nbsp; Lupus nephritis is associated with arthralgia, vasculitis, and hypocomplementemia; however, this patient&#39;s presentation (eg, male sex, sexual risk factors) is more suggestive of underlying hepatitis C infection.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Immune glomerular injury results from immune complexes (ICs) or neutrophil activation.&nbsp; IC formation in the kidney typically produces renal-limited disease (except anti&ndash;glomerular basement membrane disease).&nbsp; Preformed circulating IC deposition is usually associated with small vessel vasculitis and hypocomplementemia.</p>",

Misfolding results from increased production, decreased clearance, inherited mutations, or age-related deposition of protein subunits.&nbsp; Structural transformation of precursor proteins into <strong>beta-pleated sheets</strong> leads to aggregation and polymerization into amyloid fibrils.&nbsp; Resistant to degradation, amyloid <strong>accumulates in extracellular tissues</strong>, causing organ dysfunction.&nbsp; Each precursor protein generates specific amyloid fibrils predisposed to particular organs.</p><p>In DRA, <strong>beta2-microglobulin</strong> (beta2-m) is the precursor protein and a component of major histocompatibility class I molecules on all nucleated cells.&nbsp; Continuously shed in plasma, beta2-m has near-total clearance by normal kidneys.&nbsp; However, in end-stage renal failure, it is <strong>inadequately eliminated despite dialysis</strong> and deposited in tissue as beta2-m amyloid.&nbsp; Disease most often involves <strong>osteoarticular structures</strong> as connective tissue components (eg, glycosaminoglycans, type-1 collagen) stabilize beta2-m amyloid fibrils and inhibit their depolymerization.&nbsp; Typical manifestations include:</p><ul><li>Scapulohumeral periarthritis (pain/hypertrophy from rotator cuff infiltration)</li><li>Carpal tunnel syndrome (<a href=\"35920\">median neuropathy</a> from carpal tunnel deposition)</li><li>Flexor tenosynovitis (contractures from involvement of flexor tendons)</li><li>Bone cysts (possible pathologic fractures)</li></ul><p>DRA prevalence increases with age and dialysis duration.&nbsp; Although improved dialysis membranes provide better clearance of beta2-m, its prevalence remains significant.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Free immunoglobulin light chains are produced in excess by clonal expansion of plasma cells in multiple myeloma and deposited as AL amyloid.&nbsp; AL amyloid typically results in nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy.&nbsp; Macroglossia and periorbital purpura are less common but characteristic.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Serum amyloid A is an acute phase protein excessively produced due to elevated cytokines in chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions (eg, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis).&nbsp; Accumulation produces AA amyloid, which deposits primarily in the kidneys, liver, and spleen.&nbsp; This patient has no chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Transthyretin is a protein named for its function (<em>trans</em>ports <em>thy</em>roxin and <em>retin</em>ol).&nbsp; Inherited mutation or age can cause its deposition as amyloid with prominent cardiac involvement.</p><p><strong>Educational objective</strong>:<br>Beta2-microglobulin is renally cleared and poorly dialyzed.&nbsp; It accumulates as amyloid in dialysis patients, increasing in prevalence with dialysis duration, and has a predilection for osteoarticular surfaces.&nbsp; Shoulder pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are common.&nbsp; Bone cysts and pathologic fractures may also occur.</p>",
