This pattern is consistent with <strong>hyperosmotic volume contraction</strong>, caused by loss of electrolyte-free water.&nbsp; Water loss begins in the ECF (from renally filtered plasma), decreasing ECF volume and increasing its osmolarity.&nbsp; Elevated ECF osmolarity subsequently draws water from the ICF until osmolarities are equal (but higher than baseline).</p><p>Free water loss may stem from nonrenal causes (eg, water deprivation, excessive sweating) or renal mechanisms.&nbsp; <strong>Excessive renal water excretion</strong> occurs due to impaired secretion or action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) [ie, antidiuretic hormone (ADH)].&nbsp; Causes include AVP resistance or deficiency, formerly known as nephrogenic and central diabetes insipidus, respectively.&nbsp; <strong>AVP deficiency</strong> frequently occurs following severe motor vehicle collisions (eg, unrestrained passengers) due to blunt head trauma that disrupts AVP (ADH) secretion.</p><p>Elevated osmolarity rapidly triggers thirst, and increased water consumption typically normalizes ECF/ICF volumes and osmolarity.&nbsp; However, hospitalized patients who are unable to drink may develop hyperosmotic volume contraction (as in this patient).&nbsp; Treatment involves AVP analogues such as <strong>desmopressin</strong> (in AVP deficiency) to prevent further water loss.&nbsp; In addition, exogenous free water administration (eg, IV dextrose with water) may be required to replace free water losses.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1889\">Acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage</a> (or diarrhea) causes loss of fluid from the ECF that has the same osmolarity (isosmotic) as the rest of the ECF (ie, isosmotic volume contraction).&nbsp; ICF volume and osmolarity are unaffected because there is no osmotic gradient to shift water between compartments.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1891\">Hypertonic saline</a> contains a higher sodium concentration than plasma, leading to an increase in ECF osmolarity following infusion.&nbsp; The added fluid volume also increases the ECF.&nbsp; Elevated ECF osmolarity pulls water from the ICF, decreasing ICF volume and further increasing ECF volume.&nbsp; The net result is increased osmolarity of both compartments, with expansion of the ECF volume and decreased ICF volume (ie, hyperosmotic volume expansion).</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1890\">Primary adrenal insufficiency</a> is characterized by a deficiency in aldosterone and cortisol (due to adrenal failure).&nbsp; Aldosterone loss causes urinary sodium excretion, which reduces ECF volume and causes hypotension.&nbsp; Concurrent cortisol deficiency exacerbates hypotension (by impairing vascular tone).&nbsp; Hypotension triggers ADH release (volume stimulus), promoting water retention with decreased ECF osmolarity.&nbsp; Low ECF osmolarity shifts fluid into the ICF, increasing ICF volume (although combined volume is reduced).&nbsp; This shift leads to the ICF osmolarity decreasing until it matches ECF osmolarity.&nbsp; The net result is hyposmotic volume contraction (ECF loss exceeds ICF gain).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"1892\">Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion</a> leads to excess free water retention, resulting in effects that are directly opposite those of AVP deficiency/resistance.&nbsp; Water is first retained in the ECF (into the plasma), increasing ECF volume and lowering its osmolarity.&nbsp; Reduced ECF osmolarity drives water into the ICF until osmolarities are equal (but lower than baseline).&nbsp; The net result is decreased osmolarity and increased volumes of both compartments (ie, hyposmotic volume expansion).&nbsp; Over time, compensatory mechanisms&mdash;including suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and secretion of natriuretic peptides&mdash;promote sodium excretion, restoring euvolemia.&nbsp; However, inappropriate ADH secretion maintains a hyposmotic state (ie, euvolemic hyponatremia).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hyperosmotic volume contraction is caused by the loss of electrolyte-free water, which results in decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF) volumes.&nbsp; Because of the loss of free water, osmolarity is increased in both the ECF and ICF.&nbsp; Clinically, this is seen in patients with excess renal water excretion due to arginine vasopressin deficiency or resistance (formerly diabetes insipidus).</p>",
