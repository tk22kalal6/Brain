<strong>Hereditary breast cancer</strong> should be suspected in patients diagnosed at a young age, patients with &#8805;2 primary breast and/or ovarian cancers, and individuals with multiple family members affected by early-onset breast or ovarian cancer.&nbsp; Most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are associated with mutations in the tumor suppressor genes <em><strong>BRCA1</strong></em> and <em><strong>BRCA2</strong></em>.&nbsp; Tumor suppressor genes are involved in multiple processes, including:</p><ul><li><strong>DNA repair</strong></li><li>Cellular differentiation</li><li>Checkpoint control of the cell cycle</li><li>Transcription factor regulation</li></ul><p><em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> are involved in repair of <strong>double-stranded DNA breaks</strong>.&nbsp; Mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> result in genetic instability, predisposing cells to an increased risk of malignant transformation.&nbsp; Both <em>BRCA</em> mutations are inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> manner with variable penetrance.&nbsp; Affected women have a <strong>70%-80% lifetime risk</strong> for developing breast cancer.&nbsp; Moreover, their lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is also increased by up to 40%, although the <em>BRCA2</em> gene is less likely to lead to ovarian cancer.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Angiogenesis is an essential factor in the growth of tumors due to their rapid rate of division and high metabolic demands.&nbsp; Although they stimulate angiogenesis by increasing production of substances such as vascular endothelial growth factor, tumors frequently outgrow their blood supply and become necrotic in the center.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Apoptosis refers to programmed cell death in response to irreparably damaged DNA or misfolded proteins.&nbsp; Malignant cells in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma upregulate the protooncogene <em>BCL2</em>, which stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, thereby preventing cytochrome C leakage, caspase activation, and apoptotic death.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Intercellular adhesion is impaired in the majority of malignant tumors, which allows portions of the tumor to break off and metastasize.&nbsp; Adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin are also responsible for transduction of growth signals important for normal tissue growth and regeneration; disruption of intercellular adhesion signaling can promote unchecked cellular proliferation.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; A large number of malignancies are associated with aberrant signal transduction.&nbsp; For example, overexpression of <em>HER2</em> (a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in growth signal transduction) causes the development of certain types of aggressive breast cancer.&nbsp; Unlike <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>, <em>HER2</em> mutations are acquired, not inherited.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hereditary breast cancer is most commonly associated with mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>.&nbsp; These tumor suppressor genes are involved in DNA repair, and their mutations increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.</p>",
