<em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> is a gram-negative diplococcus transmitted via aerosolized respiratory droplets.&nbsp; Close living conditions (eg, college <strong>dormitories</strong>, prisons, military barracks) promote its spread.</p><p><em>N meningitidis</em> has several virulence factors, including a polysaccharide capsule (impairs phagocytosis of the bacteria), lipo-oligosaccharide (induces cytokine production, leading to circulatory collapse), pili (permit bacterial attachment to the respiratory mucosa), and IgA protease (cleaves secretory IgA that would otherwise inactivate the pili).&nbsp; Antibodies against the <strong>polysaccharide capsule</strong> confer immunity to <em>N meningitidis</em>.</p><p>The meningococcal <strong>vaccines</strong> available in the United States are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Quadrivalent conjugate vaccine:&nbsp; <strong>Capsular polysaccharide antigens</strong> (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) are fused to a diphtheroid toxin carrier, which allows the polysaccharides to be displayed on the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells.&nbsp; This results in stimulation of T-cells and provides a stronger, more lasting immunologic response.</p></li><li><p>Serogroup B vaccine:&nbsp; Capsular polysaccharides from serogroup B are very similar to human neural cell adhesion molecules.&nbsp; This molecular mimicry prevented a polysaccharide vaccine due to difficulty in generating an immune response without increasing the risk of autoimmunity.&nbsp; A vaccine against this serogroup is now available that uses <strong>recombinant proteins</strong> instead of capsular polysaccharides.</p></li></ul><p>In the United States, the quadrivalent vaccine is part of routine immunizations; the serogroup B vaccine is recommended for specific high-risk populations (eg, those with asplenia or complement deficiency).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; The influenza vaccination typically contains three or four strains of inactivated virus.&nbsp; Although influenza is often associated with rapid-onset malaise, headache, myalgia, and fever, the presence of nuchal rigidity and purpuric skin rash make meningococcemia more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The diphtheria toxoid is used in conjugate vaccines because it allows the polysaccharide antigen to be displayed on the major histocompatibility complex of antigen presenting cells.&nbsp; The toxoid is not the primary antigenic component of conjugate vaccines.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; The measles-mumps-rubella vaccination contains live attenuated versions of these viruses.&nbsp; <a href=\"64988\">Measles</a> is associated with the 3 C&#39;s (coryza, conjunctivitis, cough) and a maculopapular rash, mumps is associated with salivary gland swelling, and <a href=\"63802\">rubella</a> is associated with a diffuse maculopapular rash.&nbsp; A purpuric rash and nuchal rigidity would be atypical.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Virus-like particles are multiprotein structures that elicit a strong B- and T-cell response but contain no viral genetic material, so they are not infectious.&nbsp; Virus-like particles are used in the hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> provide immunity against this pathogen.&nbsp; Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides from major serotypes (A, C, Y, and W) of <em>N meningitidis</em>.&nbsp; Serotype B vaccinations use recombinant proteins.</p>",
