He reports worsening pain despite an increased drug dose.&nbsp; No new structural explanation for increased pain was revealed on medical evaluation (ie, unchanged spine imaging and physical examination).&nbsp; Therefore, the loss of opioid analgesic efficacy is likely due to <strong>drug tolerance</strong>: higher doses of drugs are required to achieve the same clinical effect.</p><p>A distinction is drawn between pharmacokinetic versus pharmacodynamic tolerance:</p><ul><li><p>Pharmacokinetic tolerance (ADME):&nbsp; The plasma level of the active drug is decreased due to impaired <strong>A</strong>bsorption (eg, short bowel syndrome), increased tissue <strong>D</strong>istribution (eg, plasma protein binding, adiposity), increased <strong>M</strong>etabolism (eg, P450 cytochrome induction), or increased <strong>E</strong>xcretion.</p></li><li><p>Pharmacodynamic tolerance:&nbsp; The plasma level of the active drug is unchanged (ie, normal pharmacokinetics).&nbsp; However, the action of the drug on target cells is blunted (eg, <strong>receptor downregulation</strong>, decreased intracellular signaling), reducing the overall pharmacologic effect.</p></li></ul><p>In both cases, tolerance can be innate or acquired.&nbsp; Innate tolerance refers to inborn differences in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic) or receptor structure/expression (pharmacodynamic).&nbsp; Innate tolerance is apparent from the first dose, which elicits an unexpectedly weak effect.&nbsp; This patient experienced a good analgesic response initially, arguing against the presence of innate tolerance <strong>(Choice A)</strong>.</p><p>Acquired tolerance is defined as a decreased pharmacologic response following prolonged drug exposure.&nbsp; <strong>Acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance</strong> is the primary form of chronic opioid tolerance, characterized by downregulation and decreased responsivity (eg, GRK/beta-arrestin phosphorylation) of the mu opioid receptor system compared to the opioid-na&iuml;ve state.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The kappa and delta opioid receptors bind to endogenous opioid-like neuropeptides (dynorphin and enkephalins, respectively) to mediate analgesia.&nbsp; Like mu receptors, they are also downregulated by chronic opioid administration, contributing further to acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; In acquired <em>pharmacokinetic</em> tolerance, altered ADME results in lower plasma drug levels.&nbsp; Higher rates of metabolism (eg, P450 enzyme autoinduction) can accelerate the inactivation/elimination of many medications (eg, methadone, carbamazepine).&nbsp; However, lower rates of excretion (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency) would raise the plasma drug concentration, leading to potential overdose rather than tolerance.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Adiposity (eg, increasing obesity) can contribute to <em>pharmacokinetic</em> tolerance by raising the apparent volume of distribution, thereby lowering the plasma drug concentration.&nbsp; However, equilibration between plasma and extravascular compartments is complete within 5 drug half-lives, occurring long before this patient&#39;s development of tolerance after 3 months.&nbsp; Furthermore, adipose partitioning is primarily a concern for highly lipophilic drugs (eg, fentanyl, not oxycodone).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Chronic opioid therapy leads to the development of acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance via downregulation and decreased responsiveness of opioid receptor systems.</p>",
