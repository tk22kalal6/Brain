<em>C perfringens</em> is an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming, <strong>gram-positive rod</strong> found in soil.&nbsp; Most cases develop following the introduction of spores into tissue during <strong>penetrating injury</strong> (eg, knife wound, puncture wound); significant vascular damage is generally required to create the <strong>anaerobic environment</strong> necessary for vegetative bacterial proliferation.</p><p><em>C perfringens</em> classically causes <strong>gas gangrene</strong> (eg, necrosis, gas in tissue) <strong>within hours</strong> of infection.&nbsp; This is primarily mediated by the generation of <strong>alpha toxin</strong> (lecithinase), a potent phospholipase C mimetic that <strong>splits host phospholipids</strong>.&nbsp; This compound hydrolyzes lecithin-containing lipoprotein complexes in cell membranes, which causes cell lysis, tissue necrosis, and edema.&nbsp; It also mediates intravascular aggregations of platelets, neutrophils, and fibrin, which results in vascular occlusion and further promotes the anaerobic environment required for bacterial proliferation.&nbsp; Although <em>C perfringens</em> produces a vast array of other cytotoxins, alpha toxin is thought to mediate its most devastating effects.</p><p><em>C perfringens</em> uses <strong>carbohydrates</strong> for energy; its rapid metabolism of muscle tissue carbohydrates produces significant amounts of <strong>gas</strong>, which can be seen on plain radiographs or CT scans <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Actin depolymerization is mediated by <em>Clostridioides</em> (formerly <em>Clostridium</em>) <em>difficile</em> cytotoxin B, which primarily causes infectious diarrhea.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Inactivation of elongation factor 2 through ribosylation is the mechanism of action for diphtheria toxin.&nbsp; Cutaneous diphtheria is generally marked by nonhealing ulcers; it does not typically cause rapid-onset necrosis and gas formation.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Plasminogen activators such as streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator convert plasminogen to plasmin.&nbsp; Of these 3 enzymes, only streptokinase, an exotoxin released by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (group A <em>Streptococcus</em>), is a bacterial product.&nbsp; Streptococcal skin infection is usually marked by spreading, nonpurulent cellulitis, not gas gangrene.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release is the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, which primarily causes cranial neuropathy and descending paralysis.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Certain <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>&ndash;produced toxins act as superantigens by hyperstimulating T cells and causing massive cytokine production.&nbsp; Examples include enterotoxin, which causes food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome toxin.&nbsp; <em>S aureus</em> can cause purulent cellulitis, but rapid-onset gas gangrene is atypical.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the main toxin produced by <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>.&nbsp; It degrades lecithin, a component of cellular phospholipid membranes, which leads to membrane destruction, cell death, and widespread necrosis and hemolysis.</p>",
