The process is a <strong>mixed cell-mediated and antibody-mediated</strong> response and can occur anytime from <strong>several months to years</strong> posttransplantation.</p><p>Following transplant, T cells are activated and recipient antibodies are created against graft HLA and other antigens.&nbsp; The activated T cells can initially cause cell-mediated acute rejection, which is generally reversible via an increase in immunosuppression (eg, high-dose glucocorticoids).&nbsp; Chronic rejection represents progression of cell-mediated and antibody-mediated inflammation (eg, via activation of complement and recruitment of neutrophils) to the point that <strong>irreversible</strong> renal damage takes place; the kidney grossly decreases in size, and histopathology shows <strong>obliterative vascular wall thickening</strong> with <strong>tubular atrophy</strong> and <strong>interstitial fibrosis</strong>.</p><p>Due to increased sodium retention, declining renal function in chronic rejection is also commonly accompanied by new or worsening <strong>hypertension</strong>.&nbsp; Chronic rejection is the most common cause of renal graft failure following transplant.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; A dense, interstitial, mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is characteristic of acute allograft rejection, which is most often a primarily T cell&ndash;mediated process.&nbsp; Acute rejection typically occurs &lt;6 months after transplant but can occur later in a patient in whom posttransplant immunosuppression has been stopped.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Glomerular injury in chronic rejection is predominantly ischemic, and crescent formation is not typically observed.&nbsp; Crescents develop mainly in anti&ndash;glomerular basement membrane antibody&ndash;mediated, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody&ndash;associated, or immune complex&ndash;mediated glomerulonephritis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Muddy brown casts can be seen with acute tubular necrosis, which usually manifests as acute (rather than gradual) kidney injury.&nbsp; Tubular hypertrophy may be present during the recovery phase.&nbsp; These findings are not typical of chronic rejection.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Vascular fibrinoid necrosis with capillary thrombotic occlusion occurs in hyperacute rejection, which is a rapid and profound form of antibody-mediated rejection caused by <em>preformed</em> antibodies to graft antigens.&nbsp; Chronic rejection is a more gradual antibody-mediated process resulting from sensitization that occurs after a transplant has taken place.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Chronic renal allograft rejection manifests months to years after a transplant and presents with worsening hypertension and a gradual decline in renal function.&nbsp; It involves a chronic cell-mediated and antibody-mediated response against donor antigens and leads to obliterative vascular wall thickening, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.&nbsp; The process is usually irreversible and eventually leads to graft failure.</p>",
