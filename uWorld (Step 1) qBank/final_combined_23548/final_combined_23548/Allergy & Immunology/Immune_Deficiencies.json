The presence of a large number of intact bacteria inside the neutrophils suggests <strong>chronic granulomatous disease</strong> (CGD), an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency marked by <strong>impaired NADPH oxidase</strong> activity.</p><p>NADPH oxidase resides on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and is incorporated into the membrane of the phagolysosome during phagocytosis; it catalyzes the formation of <strong>superoxide free radicals</strong>, which subsequently destroy engulfed pathogens (eg, fungi, bacteria) as part of the <a href=\"5908\">oxidative burst</a>.&nbsp; Because patients with CGD have impaired NADPH oxidase activity, they are not able to efficiently destroy bacteria and fungi following <a href=\"56623\">phagocytosis</a>; therefore, microscopy will often reveal <strong>intact microbes</strong> in the neutrophil phagolysosome during active infection.</p><p>Patients with CGD are most susceptible to <strong>catalase-positive organisms</strong>, particularly <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Burkholderia</em>, <em>Serratia</em>, <em>Nocardia</em>, and <em>Aspergillus</em>.&nbsp; Catalase degrades hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, which reduces oxidative damage and protease activation by reactive oxygen species.&nbsp; Although most pathogenic bacteria and fungi produce catalase, catalase-positive organisms pose a particular risk to patients with CGD because they require higher levels of free radicals (ie, greater NADPH oxidase function) for effective killing.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <em>S aureus</em> produces coagulase, which binds to prothrombin and increases conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.&nbsp; Fibrin subsequently coats the exterior of the organism, which helps it evade phagocytosis.&nbsp; Although patients with CGD are at elevated risk for <em>S aureus</em>, most of the other common pathogens in CGD do not produce coagulase.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the major virulence factor of <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>; it causes hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, activating inflammatory pathways that increase platelet and leukocyte aggregation in the adjacent microvasculature, leading to vasoocclusion and ischemic necrosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Lipopolysaccharide, a major virulence factor in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, is not present in the gram-positive bacteria (eg, <em>S aureus</em>, <em>Nocardia</em>) and fungal organisms (eg, <em>Aspergillus</em>) that usually infect patients with CGD.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp;

It is caused by a variety of mutations in different genes that result in impaired T and B cell development and function.&nbsp; This leads to compromised cell-mediated and humoral immunity with the eventual development of <strong>severe viral and bacterial infections</strong> as maternal immunity wanes.&nbsp; Other common features include mucocutaneous candidiasis, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive.&nbsp; Laboratory studies show very low or <strong>absent CD3+ T cells</strong> and <strong>hypogammaglobulinemia</strong>.&nbsp; Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia is another common finding in infants with SCID due to severe T cell deficiency.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogenous condition caused by B and T cell dysfunction and characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia.&nbsp; It presents with recurrent infections in adults and children (after the neonatal period).&nbsp; While not entirely unaffected, cell-mediated immunity is not as impaired as in SCID and thymic aplasia is unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) classically presents with craniofacial abnormalities, conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia resulting from parathyroid hypoplasia.&nbsp; Immunodeficiency can also occur and is related to the degree of thymic hypoplasia.&nbsp; Although complete DGS (&lt;1% of cases) is a form of SCID, the absence of other characteristic findings makes DGS a less likely diagnosis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; In Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, functioning of both T and B cells is impaired due to abnormal cytoskeletal functioning.&nbsp; Patients experience recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal infections that generally worsen with age.&nbsp; However, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome also typically causes bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and eczema.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; X-linked (Bruton&#39;s) agammaglobulinemia is an immunodeficiency syndrome caused by insufficient production of mature B cells, which predisposes mainly to recurrent infections with encapsulated pyogenic bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Hemophilus influenzae</em> type B).&nbsp; The quantity and functioning of T cells is generally not affected, so an absent thymic shadow is unlikely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Severe combined immune deficiency is characterized by combined T and B cell dysfunction.&nbsp; It is a life-threatening condition that presents in infancy with severe bacterial and viral infections; mucocutaneous candidiasis; persistent diarrhea; and failure to thrive.&nbsp; Laboratory findings include absent T cells and hypogammaglobulinemia.&nbsp; The thymic shadow is not usually present due to severe T cell deficiency.</p>",
