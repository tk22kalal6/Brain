MDS is a <strong>clonal hematologic malignancy</strong> associated with the development of driver mutations due to <strong>advanced age</strong>, previous <strong>chemo-/radiotherapy</strong>, or exposure to environmental toxins.</p><p>MDS is marked by the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>&#8805;1 cytopenias:</strong>&nbsp; normal hematopoiesis is impaired due to neoplastic cell replication in the bone marrow; therefore, patients usually present with symptoms of &#8805;1 cytopenia such as fatigue/dyspnea on exertion (anemia), bleeding/bruising (thrombocytopenia), or infections (leukopenia).&nbsp; Because erythrocyte production is impaired, <strong>reticulocyte count will be low</strong> despite significant anemia.&nbsp; However, significant extramedullary hematopoiesis does not occur, so <strong>hepatosplenomegaly is rare</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dysplasia of erythrocytes and neutrophils</strong>:&nbsp; peripheral blood smear usually shows normocytic or macrocytic erythrocytes with a variety of abnormalities (eg, <strong>oval macrocytes</strong>).&nbsp; Neutrophils are typically <a href=\"41583\">hypolobulated and hypogranular</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Bone marrow biopsy typically reveals a <strong>hypercellular</strong> marrow with <strong>dysplasia</strong> of &#8805;1 cell lines.&nbsp; <strong>Myeloblasts are increased</strong> (but &lt;20% of total cells), and granulocytes show evidence of <strong>impaired maturation</strong> such as abnormalities in size, granulation, or lobulation.&nbsp; Erythrocytes also show signs of abnormal development, including large size and nuclear lobation/budding.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Metastatic adenocarcinoma (atypical gland-forming cells) can infiltrate the bone marrow, leading to pancytopenia.&nbsp; Although reticulocytes would be diminished, peripheral blood smear would not show signs of abnormal granulocyte development (eg, hyposegmentation).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Hypercellular marrow with sheets of plasma cells is seen in multiple myeloma.&nbsp; Although it occasionally causes pancytopenia (anemia alone is more common), peripheral smear shows rouleaux formation due to increased monoclonal proteins; dysmorphic granulocytes would not be seen.&nbsp; In addition, multiple myeloma is not strongly associated with chemotherapy exposure.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Anemia of chronic disease is associated with increased retention of iron in reticuloendothelial macrophages.&nbsp; Although low reticulocyte count is common, patients usually have normocytic anemia and relatively normal peripheral smear findings (eg, no dysplasia).&nbsp; In contrast, MDS can be associated with ringed sideroblasts (iron-laden erythrocyte precursors) in the bone marrow.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Collagen deposition in the bone marrow is associated with myelofibrosis, a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that causes anemia and variable platelet/leukocyte counts.&nbsp; However, patients typically have marked splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Myelodysplastic syndrome is a clonal hematologic neoplasm marked by &#8805;1 cytopenias and cellular dysplasia (eg, oval macrocytic erythrocytes, hyposegmented granulocytes).&nbsp; Bone marrow evaluation usually reveals a hypercellular marrow, a mild or moderate increase in myeloblasts (&lt;20% of total cells), and dysplastic erythrocytes/granulocytes.</p>",
