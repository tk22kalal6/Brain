It is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis; however, it may occur sporadically.</p><p>Cholangiocarcinoma is often clinically silent until late in the disease course, when the tumor obstructs bile drainage, leading to a characteristic <strong>cholestatic pattern</strong> of liver injury (elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia).&nbsp; Progressive weight loss, <strong>RUQ pain</strong>, <strong>jaundice</strong>, and <strong>hepatomegaly</strong> are typical, and occasionally, the gallbladder is palpable (Courvoisier sign).</p><p>Intraductal malignancies are often difficult to visualize radiographically but usually demonstrates <strong>dilated bile ducts</strong> in the absence of an obstructing gallstone.&nbsp; The most frequently involved site is at the <strong>confluence of the right and left hepatic bile ducts</strong> (Klatskin tumors), which may be visible as nonunion of the bile ducts (as in this patient).&nbsp; Most <a href=\"38099\">cholangiocarcinomas</a> are <strong>adenocarcinomas</strong> characterized histologically by columnar epithelial cells with prominent nucleoli arranged in <strong>glandular structures</strong> with <strong>mucin</strong> production and significant desmoplasia (reactive fibrous tissue surrounding a malignant mass).</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"38100\">Focal nodular hyperplasia</a> is a <em>benign</em>, nonencapsulated liver tumor that typically occurs in women.&nbsp; It is characterized by fibrous septa encasing normal hepatocytes and a central stellate scar, which is visible both histologically and radiographically.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"21954\">Hepatic adenomas</a> are <em>benign</em> lesions that develop most commonly in women taking oral contraceptives.&nbsp; Jaundice and weight loss are unexpected, and an abdominal CT scan usually demonstrates a solitary lesion in the hepatic parenchyma, not the biliary tree.&nbsp; Histology reveals relatively uniform hepatocytes arranged in thin cell plates without atypia.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"38101\">Hepatocellular carcinoma</a> is a malignant liver mass that most often develops in patients with cirrhosis.&nbsp; Microscopy demonstrates polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"33008\">Metastatic colon cancer</a> is characterized by adenocarcinoma with gland formation; however, it usually causes multiple hepatic masses, which are not seen on this patient&#39;s CT scan.&nbsp; In addition, the location of the mass at the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct is characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignancy of the bile duct epithelium that eventually obstructs biliary drainage, resulting in cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyperbilirubinemia) with jaundice, weight loss, pain in the right upper quadrant, and hepatomegaly.&nbsp; Imaging often demonstrates dilated bile ducts in the absence of an obstructive gallstone, and biopsy reveals an adenocarcinoma with columnar cells, mucin production, and a significant desmoplastic reaction.</p>",
