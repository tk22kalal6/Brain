Sulfonylureas <strong>inhibit</strong> the ATP-sensitive <strong>potassium channel</strong> on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization with opening of L-type calcium channels (ie, increased Ca<font size=\"2\"><sup>2+</sup></font> influx), <strong>stimulating insulin release</strong>.&nbsp; Sulfonylurea-induced stimulation of beta cells is <strong>independent of blood glucose</strong> and occurs even when blood glucose levels are normal, increasing the risk for hypoglycemia.</p><p>The <strong>risk for hypoglycemia</strong> associated with sulfonylureas is increased in the setting of skipped meals (as in this patient), in excessively high medication doses, and with concurrent renal or hepatic disease (which decreases drug metabolism and clearance).&nbsp; Although hypoglycemia can occur with any sulfonylurea medication, the risk is highest with longer-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial enzymes required for gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased hepatic glucose production and lower circulating glucose levels.&nbsp; It also increases peripheral glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.&nbsp; Metformin does not increase endogenous insulin secretion and therefore is not associated with hypoglycemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) decrease insulin resistance by binding to peroxisome proliferator&ndash;activated receptor gamma, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the intestine in response to food intake and slows gastric emptying and increases glucose-dependent insulin release.&nbsp; GLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) act through cell surface receptors that are coupled with a G protein&ndash;adenylyl cyclase system.&nbsp; Because the effects of GLP-1 agonists are glucose dependent (eg, occur primarily in the presence of food), these medications are not typically associated with hypoglycemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp;

In a patient with chronic, poorly controlled <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>, this is likely a <strong>neuropathic ulcer</strong> due to underlying peripheral <strong>sensory neuropathy</strong>.&nbsp; Chronic hyperglycemia promotes nerve injury and impairs nerve repair in distal sensory fibers, causing decreased sensation of pain, pressure, and proprioception.</p><p>Loss of these protective senses can cause individuals to not recognize an injury due to minor trauma, friction, or <strong>pressure</strong>.&nbsp; Areas that are particularly susceptible are points of localized pressure created by a shoe or weight-bearing bones of the foot (eg, plantar surface of the <strong>first metatarsal head</strong>).&nbsp; A wound in this area often goes unnoticed (due to lack of pain sensation and being hidden by socks or shoes) and can develop into a nonhealing <a href=\"51846\">foot ulcer</a>.</p><p>Loss of proprioception and an increase in ligamentous laxity can also cause chronic pressure-induced joint/skin damage in the feet of patients with diabetic neuropathy, which can lead to calluses or foot deformities (eg, <a href=\"51847\">Charcot foot</a>, <a href=\"17887\">hammer toe</a>).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Although diabetic patients (especially those who smoke) often have comorbid arterial insufficiency, arterial ulcers are typically painful, sharply demarcated, and located at the tips of the toes.&nbsp; This patient has full distal pulses, which makes clinically significant atherosclerotic disease unlikely to be the primary cause of the ulcer.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bacterial infection may delay ulcer healing, especially if there is underlying osteomyelitis, but it is not the inciting cause of neuropathic ulcers.&nbsp; In addition, although diabetic ulcers are often colonized by bacteria, this patient has no fever, erythema, or purulent drainage to suggest serious infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"36164\">Irritant contact dermatitis</a> presents with pruritic or painful erythema in areas of exposed skin (eg, hands).&nbsp; It can occasionally cause small vesicles or fissures, but ulcers are not typical.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Systemic vasculitic disorders (eg, polyarteritis nodosa) are an uncommon cause of skin ulcers.&nbsp; Vasculitic ulcers are usually painful and associated with other skin (eg, purpura, nodules) and systemic (eg, fever, fatigue) symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Ulcers caused by <a href=\"51848\">venous insufficiency</a> are most common over the tibias or proximal to the medial malleolus.&nbsp; They present as irregular ulcerations in the setting of stasis dermatitis and/or varicose veins.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Neuropathic foot ulcers can occur in diabetic patients when loss of pain sensation and proprioception delays recognition of injury due to trauma, friction, or sustained pressure (on plantar surface of foot bones).&nbsp; The risk is greatest in patients with longstanding diabetes who have poor glycemic control.</p>",
