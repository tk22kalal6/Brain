Appropriate pharmacologic management is important in such patients because it has been shown to reduce mortality.&nbsp; Much of this <strong>mortality benefit</strong> is likely related to a <strong>reduction</strong> in deleterious <strong>cardiac remodeling</strong>.</p><p>Neurohormonal pathways involving norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone all have a demonstrated role in cardiac remodeling.&nbsp; In particular, elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone levels increase pathologic cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and stimulate collagen deposition by fibroblasts (cardiac fibrosis).&nbsp; Accordingly, <strong>ACE inhibitors</strong> (eg, lisinopril), <strong>angiotensin-receptor blockers</strong> (eg, losartan), and <strong>mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists</strong> (eg, spironolactone, epleronone) reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF via a reduction in angiotensin II&ndash;mediated (and downstream aldosterone-mediated) cardiac remodeling.</p><p><strong>Beta blockers</strong> (eg, metoprolol, carvedilol) also reduce mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF, likely through similar inhibition of neurohormonal mechanisms.&nbsp; Potentiation of the natriuretic peptide neurohormonal pathway with <strong>angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor</strong> therapy (eg, sacubitril-valsartan) has also demonstrated mortality benefit in these patients.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Blood pressure control is important for patients with heart failure because it slows the progression of coronary artery disease and may reduce cardiac remodeling that is triggered by increased left ventricular pressure load.&nbsp; However, aside from the benefit of blood pressure reduction, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) provide no additional mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Digoxin is used as an adjunctive therapy in patients with HFrEF.&nbsp; It improves symptoms, thereby reducing the rate of hospitalization, but does not improve mortality.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) can depress cardiac contractility and are usually contraindicated in patients with HFrEF.</p><p><strong>(Choices D and E)</strong>&nbsp; Loop (eg, furosemide) and thiazide (eg, metolazone) diuretics reduce cardiac preload and are useful for symptomatic management of patients with HFrEF; however, these drugs do not provide a clear mortality benefit.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Although potassium-sparing diuretics that function via blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors have shown mortality benefit for HFrEF, those that act via blockade of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (eg, triamterene, amiloride) have minimal neurohormonal effects and no demonstrated benefit.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Neurohormones (eg, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone) play a large role in the deleterious cardiac remodeling that occurs in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.&nbsp; ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, beta blockers, and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors reduce mortality in these patients by reducing neurohormonal-mediated cardiac remodeling.</p>",

<strong>Phenylephrine</strong> is a <strong>selective alpha-1 agonist</strong> with no effect on alpha-2 receptors or beta receptors; it causes peripheral vasoconstriction, resulting in&nbsp;<strong>increased systemic vascular resistance</strong> (SVR) and <strong>increased blood pressure</strong>, but it has <strong>no direct effect on the heart</strong>.&nbsp; Drugs that increase blood pressure by increasing SVR are called <strong>pressors</strong> and are most useful in treating <a href=\"17981\">septic shock</a>.</p><p>Phenylephrine has indirect effects on the heart mediated via the <strong>baroreceptor reflex</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"33814\">Increased blood pressure</a> stimulates firing of aortic and carotid baroreceptors.&nbsp; In response, the CNS&nbsp;increases parasympathetic output and&nbsp;decreases&nbsp;sympathetic output, which causes&nbsp;<strong>decreased heart rate</strong> and myocardial contractility.&nbsp; These reflexive changes slightly attenuate the initial increase in blood pressure and lead to overall reduced cardiac output.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and D)</strong>&nbsp; Dobutamine is primarily a beta-1 agonist with partial activity on&nbsp;beta-2 receptors&nbsp;and minimal effect on alpha receptors.&nbsp; It increases heart rate and myocardial contractility (via beta-1 stimulation) and causes mild vasodilation (via beta-2 stimulation)&nbsp;to decrease SVR.&nbsp; Milrinone is not an adrenergic agonist, but it inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 to increase&nbsp;myocardial contractility and cause peripheral vasodilation (decreases SVR).&nbsp; The combination of increased myocardial contractility (ie, inotropic effect) and reduced SVR induced by these drugs is most useful in treating <a href=\"17984\">cardiogenic shock</a>.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Dopamine stimulates dopamine-1 (located primarily in the renal arterioles), beta-1, and alpha-1 receptors, with the relative effects being dose dependent.&nbsp; High-dose dopamine primarily stimulates alpha-1 receptors to increase SVR and blood pressure; ongoing beta-1 receptor stimulation offsets the reflex&ndash;mediated decrease in heart rate, leaving the heart rate relatively unchanged.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Epinephrine stimulates beta-1, beta-2, and alpha-1 receptors with dose-dependent effects.&nbsp; Low-dose epinephrine primarily stimulates beta-1 receptors, resulting in increased cardiac output due to increased heart rate and contractility.&nbsp; At low doses, the vasodilative beta-2&ndash;mediated effects are greater than the vasoconstrictive alpha-1&ndash;mediated effects, leading to a slight reduction in SVR.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-1 agonist with no effect on alpha-2 or beta receptors.&nbsp;
