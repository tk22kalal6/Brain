When <a href=\"33814\">carotid sinus baroreceptors</a> detect increased blood pressure, the brainstem responds by increasing parasympathetic tone (slows the heart rate) and reducing sympathetic tone (induces vasodilation).&nbsp; In some individuals, especially <strong>elderly men</strong>, the carotid sinus baroreceptors become <strong>overly sensitive to tactile stimulation</strong>, triggering an <strong>exaggerated vasovagal response</strong> with marked peripheral vasodilation (ie, <strong>decreased systemic vascular resistance</strong>).&nbsp; This can cause a transient reduction in cerebral perfusion that manifests as presyncope (eg, faintness, lightheadedness) or syncope.&nbsp; As with other etiologies of syncope, cerebral perfusion quickly returns and symptoms resolve within 1-2 minutes.</p><p>In addition to shaving, rubbing of a shirt collar while dressing or turning the head is another common cause of syncope due to CSH.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>&nbsp; Cardiac tachyarrhythmias are a serious cause of syncope due to reduced cardiac output and loss of cerebral perfusion.&nbsp; Spontaneous resolution of the arrhythmia within 1-2 minutes allows for return of cerebral perfusion (if spontaneous resolution does not occur, the arrhythmia may cause sudden death rather than syncope).&nbsp; Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia rarely causes syncope as it usually affects young patients who can tolerate rapid heart rates.&nbsp; Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) typically results from delayed ventricular repolarization (ie, congenital or medication-induced QT interval prolongation) and can cause syncope in patients of any age.&nbsp; Syncope due to tachyarrhythmia usually occurs suddenly with no warning symptoms (eg, faintness, lightheadedness) other than sometimes palpitations.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) obstructs pulmonary blood flow and increases pulmonary vascular resistance.&nbsp; Some cases of acute PE present with syncope, but acute PE is unlikely to explain recurrent episodes of syncope.&nbsp; In addition, chronic pulmonary hypertension typically presents with exertional symptoms.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; The exaggerated vagal response in reflex syncope causes transient sinus bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction block, whereas syncope due to age-related degeneration of the AV node usually involves sustained and advanced AV block (eg, third-degree, Mobitz type II second-degree).&nbsp; This patient&#39;s recurrent episodes during shaving make reflex syncope due to CSH more likely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a common cause of syncope associated with tactile stimulation of the carotid sinus (eg, shaving).&nbsp; The syncope results from an exaggerated vagal response stimulated by the carotid baroreceptors, which leads to slowed heart rate and marked peripheral vasodilation with a resulting transient loss of cerebral perfusion.</p>",

It primarily functions as a <strong>class III antiarrhythmic</strong> by <strong>inhibiting</strong> the rapid component of the delayed rectifier <strong>potassium current</strong>, which is responsible for ventricular repolarization.&nbsp; This prolongs action potential duration and the effective refractory period, suppressing electrical foci that stimulate atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.&nbsp; It also <strong>prolongs the QT interval</strong> on ECG, which increases the risk of torsade de pointes; however, compared to other class III antiarrhythmics (eg, dofetilide, ibutilide), the risk of torsade de pointes with amiodarone is low.</p><p>Amiodarone also has the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Class I effect: Amiodarone somewhat <strong>inhibits</strong> the <strong>fast sodium channels</strong> responsible for cardiomyocyte depolarization (phase 0).&nbsp; This slows ventricular depolarization to suppress arrhythmogenic foci, and it <strong>prolongs QRS complex duration</strong> on ECG.</p></li><li><p>Class II and IV effects: Amiodarone has beta-blocking properties that inhibit sympathetic stimulation of the conduction system.&nbsp; The drug also <strong>inhibits</strong> the <strong>slow L-type calcium channels</strong> responsible for depolarization of the sinus node and atrioventricular node.&nbsp; Both effects prolong the refractory period of the conduction system to suppress arrhythmogenic foci and in doing so contribute to a <strong>decreased sinus rate</strong> (ie, slowed heart rate) and a <strong>prolonged PR interval</strong> on ECG.</p></li></ul><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Both class II (ie, beta blockers) and class IV (ie, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) antiarrhythmics slow the sinus rate and prolong the PR interval, but have no effect on QRS duration or the QT interval.</p><p><strong>(Choices C, D, and E)</strong>&nbsp; Class I antiarrhythmics inhibit fast sodium channels to slow depolarization and prolong QRS duration.&nbsp; However, the effects of class IB antiarrhythmics (eg, lidocaine) occur only at rapid heart rates, and no change in QRS duration is seen on resting ECG.&nbsp; Class IA antiarrhythmics (eg, procainamide) also inhibit the delayed rectifier potassium current to prolong the QT interval.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Amiodarone primarily functions as a class III antiarrhythmic, inhibiting the delayed rectifier potassium current to slow ventricular repolarization and prolong the QT interval.&nbsp;
