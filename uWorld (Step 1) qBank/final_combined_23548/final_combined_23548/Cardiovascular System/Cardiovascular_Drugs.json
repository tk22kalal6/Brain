<strong>Norepinephrine</strong>, an adrenergic agonist, is the preferred pharmacologic treatment for <strong>septic shock</strong> as it predominately stimulates a1, a2, and B1 receptors, with little influence on B2 receptors.&nbsp; This leads to the following clinical effects:</p><ol><li><p>Stimulation of <strong>&#945;1 adrenoreceptors</strong> leads to <strong>vasoconstriction</strong> in the skin and viscera, resulting in increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure with decreased renal and hepatic blood flow.&nbsp; &#945;1-mediated vasoconstriction occurs via the <a href=\"3434\">IP<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font>-second messenger pathway</a>.</p></li><li><p>Stimulation of <strong>&#946;1 adrenoreceptors</strong> within the heart increases <strong>cAMP</strong> concentrations through <a href=\"3435\">G<font size=\"2\"><sub>s</sub></font>-mediated receptor coupling</a>, which leads to increased <strong>cardiac contractility</strong>, <strong>conduction</strong>, and <strong>heart rate</strong>.&nbsp; However, the direct effect of norepinephrine on heart rate is counteracted by an indirect, baroreceptor-mediated reflex bradycardia that occurs following the increase in peripheral resistance.&nbsp; The combined result of these effects is often an unchanged or even decreased heart rate.</p></li><li><p>Stimulation of &#945;2 adrenoreceptors causes a decrease in cAMP in pancreatic &#946; cells and in the intestines, resulting in decreased insulin secretion and reduced intestinal motility.&nbsp; Central &#945;2 adrenoreceptors are not stimulated by intravenous administration of norepinephrine as the molecule does not cross the blood-brain barrier.</p></li></ol><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Stimulation of &#946;2 adrenoreceptors in bronchial smooth muscle cells leads to increased, rather than decreased, cAMP synthesis, resulting in bronchodilation.&nbsp; Regardless, norepinephrine does not significantly stimulate &#946;2 adrenoreceptors.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and D)</strong>&nbsp; Norepinephrine-mediated stimulation of &#945;1 adrenoreceptors increases, rather than decreases, IP<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font> (increased calcium release) and DAG concentrations in vascular smooth muscle cells.&nbsp; cAMP is increased after &#946;2 adrenoreceptors are stimulated; however, because norepinephrine does not significantly stimulate &#946;2 adrenoreceptors, cAMP concentrations in vascular smooth muscle are not increased.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp;

Stimulation of &#946;2 receptors in the skeletal muscle vasculature produces vasodilation and decreased diastolic blood pressure, while activation of &#945;1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the skin and viscera increases peripheral resistance and raises diastolic blood pressure.&nbsp; At <strong>low doses</strong>, &#946;2-mediated <strong>vasodilation predominates</strong>, whereas at high doses &#945;1-induced vasoconstriction becomes more pronounced.</p><p>In this experiment, low-dose epinephrine by itself caused <strong>increased heart rate</strong> (&#946;1 response) and <strong>decreased diastolic blood pressure</strong> (&#946;2 response).&nbsp; However, after pretreatment with drug A, the heart rate <em>fails</em> to increase and there is a marked <em>rise</em> in diastolic blood pressure.&nbsp; These effects are best explained by pretreatment with a <strong>nonselective beta antagonist</strong> such as propranolol.&nbsp; When administered alone, propranolol produces peripheral vasoconstriction (&#946;2 antagonism) without significantly increasing blood pressure (due to concomitant &#946;1 blockade).&nbsp; However, in combination with epinephrine, propranolol will counteract epinephrine&#39;s &#946;2-mediated vasodilation and &#946;1-mediated heart rate increase while leaving the &#945;1 effect (vasoconstriction) intact.&nbsp;

If this were drug A, blood pressure would have decreased further in the pretreatment group and the rise in heart rate would have been exacerbated.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Phenylephrine is a selective &#945;-adrenergic agonist.&nbsp;
