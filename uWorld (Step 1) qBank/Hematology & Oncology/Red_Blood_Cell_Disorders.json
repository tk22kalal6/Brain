Most cases arise in those with <strong>chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines</strong> due to underlying rheumatologic disease (eg, SLE), chronic infection, or malignancy.&nbsp; Although a number of inflammatory cytokines contribute to the development of ACD, the primary mediator is <strong>hepcidin</strong>, a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation.</p><p>Hepcidin binds to and inactivates iron channels (ferroportin) on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, which results in reduced iron absorption in the gut and <strong>increased iron sequestration </strong>in the reticuloendothelial system.&nbsp; Because <strong>reticuloendothelial macrophages</strong> recycle senescent erythrocytes and provide &gt;95% of daily iron for erythrocytosis, sequestration of iron in the reticuloendothelial system dramatically <strong>reduces serum iron concentration</strong>.&nbsp; This limits the amount of iron available for the generation of new erythrocytes and typically results in a normocytic (or slightly microcytic) anemia with a low reticulocyte response.&nbsp; In ACD, <strong>total iron-binding capacity</strong> is generally <strong>normal or slightly reduced</strong> due to cytokine-mediated suppression of transferrin.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with SLE can develop immune-mediated hemolysis due to the generation of autoantibodies against the erythrocyte membrane; however, this typically results in extravascular hemolysis, which increases the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase.&nbsp; The presence of <em>normal lactate dehydrogenase</em> in this case makes hemolysis less likely.&nbsp; Patients with SLE also sometimes develop gastrointestinal bleeding from serositis (or chronic NSAID use), which can lead to iron deficiency anemia.&nbsp; However, iron deficiency anemia is typically associated with <em>microcytic anemia</em> and a <em>high total iron-binding capacity</em> (because transferrin levels are markedly increased).</p><p><strong>(Choices B and C)</strong>&nbsp; Conditions associated with rapid cell turnover can result in folate deficiency due to increased folate use during the generation of new cells.&nbsp; Intrinsic factor antibodies are a common cause of vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> deficiency.&nbsp; However, folate and vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> deficiency are generally marked by macrocytic anemia with a normal or <em>high serum iron level</em>.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Anemia of chronic disease is a consequence of chronically elevated inflammatory cytokines, most importantly hepcidin.&nbsp; This peptide inactivates&nbsp;iron channels on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, leading to reduced iron absorption and reduced iron release from the reticuloendothelial system.&nbsp; The net result is normocytic or slightly microcytic anemia with low reticulocyte response, low serum iron level, and normal or low total iron-binding capacity.</p>",

This condition presents with <strong>fever and chills</strong>, hypotension, dyspnea, <strong>chest and/or back pain</strong>, and <strong>hemoglobinuria</strong> (red- to brown-colored urine).&nbsp; Patients may also develop disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure.&nbsp; Acute hemolytic reactions occur within <strong>minutes to hours</strong> of starting a blood transfusion and are most often due to ABO incompatibility between the donor and recipient (usually due to an error in labeling or administration).&nbsp; These reactions can be fatal and require <strong>immediate cessation</strong> of the transfusion when the diagnosis is suspected.</p><p>Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are an example of an <a href=\"57112\">antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity</a> reaction.&nbsp; Anti-ABO antibodies (mainly IgM) in the recipient bind the corresponding antigens on transfused donor erythrocytes, leading to complement activation.&nbsp; Anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) cause vasodilatation and symptoms of shock, while formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9) leads to <strong>complement-mediated cell lysis</strong>.&nbsp; Hemolytic disease of the newborn due to Rh-incompatibility is another example of type II hypersensitivity.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Cytotoxic CD8<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> T-lymphocytes are responsible for destroying cells infected with intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses).&nbsp; Recognition of an antigen-MHC class I complex by the T-cell receptor activates CD8<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> lymphocytes, which then initiate apoptosis of the infected cell.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; TNF-&#945; is produced by macrophages in response to bacterial endotoxin and causes symptoms of septic shock (eg, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia) when released in large amounts.&nbsp; Transfusion transmitted bacterial infection could cause septic shock, but it would not result in hemoglobinuria.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Allergic transfusion reactions are <a href=\"57072\">IgE-mediated (type I) hypersensitivity</a> reactions against plasma proteins found in transfused blood.&nbsp; They can be mild (urticaria, itching) or result in severe anaphylaxis (most common in IgA-deficient patients with anti-IgA antibodies).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Vascular deposition of immune complexes is an example of <a href=\"57051\">type III hypersensitivity</a>.&nbsp; In conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, antigen-antibody complexes deposit in various tissues and activate complement, causing tissue inflammation and destruction.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is an antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity reaction caused by pre-existing anti-ABO antibodies that bind antigens on transfused donor erythrocytes.&nbsp; Subsequent complement activation results in erythrocyte lysis, vasodilation, and symptoms of shock.&nbsp; Common findings include fever, hypotension, chest and back pain, and hemoglobinuria.</p>",

Loss of G6PD limits production of reduced glutathione (an antioxidant), which impairs the ability of erythrocytes to handle <strong>oxidative stressors</strong>.&nbsp; Therefore, patients with G6PD deficiency are at risk for acute hemolysis following exposure to oxidative insults (eg, acute infection, oxidizing foods such as fava beans) or medications (eg, <strong>fluoroquinolones</strong>, dapsone, primaquine).</p><p>Manifestations of G6PD deficiency begin 2-5 days after exposure to oxidative insults and frequently include signs of anemia (eg, dyspnea on exertion, pallor, fatigue) and hemolysis (eg, jaundice).&nbsp; Laboratory assessment usually reveals an acute drop in hemoglobin and signs of increased circulating erythrocytic products such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated bilirubin, and low haptoglobin (protein that binds free heme).&nbsp; The drop in hemoglobin causes the bone marrow to release young erythrocytes, which results in <strong>reticulocytosis</strong>.&nbsp; Peripheral smear shows hemoglobin precipitation (eg, <strong>Heinz bodies</strong>) and <strong>bite cells</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Antibiotics (eg, chloramphenicol) can injure hematopoietic stem cells and impair erythropoiesis, leading to acute anemia.&nbsp; However, the reticulocyte count would be low and jaundice is not usually seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Aplastic anemia, a rare complication of acute viral hepatitis, would result in anemia, but the reticulocyte count would be low due to ineffective erythropoiesis; multiple cytopenias would be expected.&nbsp; In addition, the diarrhea from infectious hepatitis is typically noninflammatory, unlike this patient&#39;s history of bloody, mucoid stools.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Patients with infectious colitis due to Shiga toxin&ndash;producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> infection are at risk for hemolytic uremic syndrome, a thrombotic microangiopathy.&nbsp; Toxin-mediated damage to glomerular endothelium would cause impaired kidney function (eg, increased creatinine).&nbsp; Endothelial damage leads to platelet consumption (thrombocytopenia) with hemolysis from erythrocyte shearing in the microvasculature (schistocytes).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> or folate deficiency can cause anemia due to impaired nucleic acid synthesis, which prevents proper growth of nuclei during hematopoiesis.&nbsp; However, the reticulocyte count would be low because new erythrocytes would not be produced efficiently.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that limits the availability of antioxidants in erythrocytes.&nbsp;

Pancytopenia is caused by hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction, bone marrow infiltration, or peripheral destruction of mature blood cells.&nbsp; Important clues in this case include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Low reticulocyte count:</strong>&nbsp; Patients with severe anemia usually have increased reticulocytes due to enhanced bone marrow erythropoiesis.&nbsp; The presence of pancytopenia with an <strong>inappropriately low</strong> reticulocyte count usually indicates the <strong>bone marrow is impaired</strong> and is unable to adequately generate new cells despite strong growth signals (eg, increased erythropoietin).</p></li><li><p><strong>Macrocytosis:</strong>&nbsp; Although macrocytosis can be seen in a wide range of pathologies, the presence of pancytopenia plus macrocytosis usually indicates a vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font>, folate) or a medication (eg, hydroxyurea) is <strong>impairing DNA synthesis</strong> in hematopoietic cells.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Hydroxyurea </strong>inhibits <strong>ribonucleoside reductase</strong>, an enzyme that generates deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for <strong>DNA synthesis/repair</strong>.&nbsp; A lack of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates slows erythrocyte nuclear development, leading&nbsp;to decreased cellular division with an overall increase in erythrocyte size.&nbsp; High doses of hydroxyurea also impair nuclear development in precursors of leukocytes and thrombocytes, leading to pancytopenia.</p><p>Hydroxyurea is the major disease-modifying medication in SCD; it reduces production of the mutated beta globulin gene and increases production of the fetal hemoglobin gene, which increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF).&nbsp; Because HbF functions normally, erythrocytes with increased HbF are less likely to sickle in the microvasculature.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with high (not low) reticulocytes due to increased erythropoiesis.&nbsp; Because reticulocytes are larger (MCV 125-135 &micro;m<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>) than mature erythrocytes, reticulocytosis can cause macrocytosis; however, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia would not be seen.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Folate is a methyl group donor for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.&nbsp; Folate deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, which can lead to pancytopenia and macrocytosis.&nbsp; However, this patient is taking folic acid, making deficiency unlikely.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells marked by lack of <a href=\"3628\">complement inhibitor</a> on the erythrocyte surface.&nbsp; Hemolytic anemia is the primary manifestation; reticulocytosis is common, and pancytopenia rarely occurs.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; SCD can cause hypersplenism due to splenic congestion with damaged erythrocytes.&nbsp; Although this can occasionally cause pancytopenia, patients with hypersplenism usually have splenomegaly and normocytic (not macrocytic) anemia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin production, which reduces erythrocyte sickling in patients with sickle cell disease.&nbsp; It also inhibits ribonucleoside reductase, which decreases deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA synthesis; this leads to macrocytosis and, with high doses, pancytopenia.</p>",

A number of underlying processes can cause anemia, but the differential diagnosis can usually be narrowed by concurrent clinical data.&nbsp; In this case, the peripheral blood smear demonstrates <strong>hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes</strong> and a variety of erythrocyte shapes <strong>(poikilocytosis)</strong>, raising strong suspicion for severe <a href=\"35429\">iron deficiency anemia</a> (IDA).&nbsp; Young women often develop IDA from heavy menstruation.</p><p>Patients with severe IDA do not have enough iron to generate adequate hemoglobin for each erythrocyte, which results in low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (hypochromia) and small erythrocyte size (microcytosis).&nbsp; Interstitial fibroblasts in the peritubular capillaries and proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney detect the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (mild tissue hypoxia) and <strong>increase erythropoietin release</strong> to drive the generation of new erythrocytes.&nbsp; However, new erythrocytes cannot be produced at a level to compensate for the anemia due to insufficient serum iron; therefore, patients typically have <strong>minimal reticulocytes</strong> and <strong>low red blood cell counts</strong> in the peripheral blood.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Transferrin is a serum protein that binds free iron.&nbsp; The concentration of transferrin is increased in IDA (to maximize free iron scavenge), but the amount of iron bound to it is reduced, leading to a low transferrin saturation on laboratory evaluation.</p><p><strong>(Choices B, C, and E)</strong>&nbsp; Hepcidin is a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation.&nbsp; It binds to and inhibits iron channels on the surface of enterocytes and on reticuloendothelial macrophages, which reduces iron absorption in the gut and reduces iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (the primary site of iron recycling).&nbsp; Because IDA is not mediated by inflammation, hepcidin levels are typically low; this increases gastrointestinal iron absorption and iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (eg, splenic macrophages).&nbsp; In contrast, anemia of chronic disease is associated with very high levels of hepcidin (and other inflammatory cytokines), which reduces iron availability for erythrocytosis despite adequate total body stores of iron.&nbsp; Patients with anemia of chronic disease typically have normocytic anemia and normochromia (not hypochromia).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Patients with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) typically have evidence of hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear with poikilocytosis.&nbsp; Laboratory studies will reveal low red blood cell count, low hepcidin, and high transferrin.&nbsp; Although erythropoietin is markedly elevated in IDA, there is not enough iron to efficiently generate erythrocytes; therefore, reticulocyte count is low.</p>",
