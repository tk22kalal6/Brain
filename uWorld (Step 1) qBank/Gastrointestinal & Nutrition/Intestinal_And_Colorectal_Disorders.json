The administration of <strong>antibiotics</strong> (eg, <strong>clindamycin</strong>, fluoroquinolones, broad-spectrum penicillin) that are lethal to other commensal gut organisms can result in <em><strong>C difficile</strong></em>&nbsp;<strong>colitis</strong> due to an unchecked replication of pathogenic strains of <em>C difficile</em>.</p><p>These strains produce <strong>toxin A</strong> and <strong>toxin B</strong>, which act synergistically, although toxin B is significantly more virulent.&nbsp; The toxins bind specific receptors on intestinal mucosal cells and are internalized, allowing them to inactivate the Rho-regulatory proteins involved in the maintenance of actin cytoskeletal structure.&nbsp; The result is <strong>loss of cytoskeleton integrity</strong>, leading to cell rounding/retraction, disruption of intercellular tight junctions, and increased paracellular intestinal fluid secretion (eg, watery diarrhea).&nbsp; Both toxins also have <strong>inflammatory effects</strong> (eg, neutrophil recruitment) and can induce apoptosis, resulting&nbsp;<strong>pseudomembrane</strong> formation.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Apical ion transport is most directly affected by the cholera toxin (main exotoxin of <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>) through activation of adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased salt reabsorption and increased transport of sodium and chloride out of the gut mucosal cell.&nbsp;

Mitochondria are the primary source of ATP in human cells.&nbsp; Cyanide and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are examples of drugs associated with mitochondrial toxicity.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp;

These toxins cause inflammatory diarrhea (eg, fever, pain, blood) 3-4 days after the ingestion of contaminated food or water.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pathogenic <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> can proliferate due to loss of commensal gut flora following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, clindamycin).&nbsp;
