In conjunction with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, this presentation suggests <strong>ureterolithiasis</strong> due to <a href=\"18114\">hyperparathyroidism</a>.&nbsp; Most kidney stones are made up of calcium salts and are idiopathic, but conditions that increase calcium excretion increase the risk of stone formation.&nbsp; Primary hyperparathyroidism leads to increased bone resorption, decreased urinary phosphate reabsorption, and increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation, all of which result in <strong>hypercalcemia </strong>and <strong>hypophosphatemia</strong>.&nbsp; Despite the increased fractional reabsorption of calcium induced by PTH, net urinary <strong>calcium excretion is elevated</strong> due to the increased filtered calcium load, raising the risk for stone formation.</p><p>Pain from ureterolithiasis, which occurs when the stone <a href=\"18115\">obstructs renal drainage</a>, typically waxes and wanes.&nbsp; Obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction normally presents with flank or upper abdominal pain, whereas an obstructing stone at the ureterovesical junction usually presents with lower abdominal or groin pain.&nbsp; Other common symptoms include hematuria, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; Appendicitis presents with acute periumbilical or right lower quadrant pain and tenderness, but it would not usually cause recurrent symptoms.&nbsp; Acute diverticulitis can cause recurrent lower abdominal symptoms but is much more common on the left and typically occurs in older (age &gt;60) patients.&nbsp; Neither of these conditions are associated with hematuria or hypercalcemia.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Glomerulonephritis is a category of kidney disorders characterized by hematuria, typically with red cell casts.&nbsp; Common associated features include hypertension, oliguria, and acute renal failure.&nbsp; Patients with various nephritic syndromes may have moderate flank pain, but acute, severe lower abdominal pain is not consistent with glomerulonephritis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Ovarian torsion can present with acute, severe lower abdominal or pelvic pain.&nbsp; It can be recurrent but would not cause hematuria.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Renal cell cancer can cause hematuria and hypercalcemia; however, pain (if present) typically presents in the flank rather than the lower abdomen.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Renal infarction typically occurs due to acute obstruction of the renal arteries (eg, cardiac thromboembolism, aortic dissection).&nbsp; Patients often develop abdominal pain and hematuria but also typically have fever and marked hypertension (due to renin release).&nbsp; In addition, renal infarction is not associated with hypercalcemia or hypophosphatemia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Most kidney stones are made of calcium salts and are idiopathic, but conditions that increase renal calcium excretion can increase the risk of stones.&nbsp;

Symptoms are usually related to the underlying infection (eg, fever, mild costovertebral pain, hematuria); renal colic (ie, severe flank/groin pain) is uncommon because large stones are unable to pass into the ureter and cause acute obstruction.&nbsp; Over time, the affected <strong>kidney can atrophy</strong> due to recurrent infection and chronic obstructive nephropathy.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Trace or weakly positive (eg, 1 or 2+) proteinuria can be seen in a variety of disorders (eg, hematuria due to kidney stones, urinary tract infection) due to disruption of the urothelium;

Patients typically have a rash, fever, and acute kidney injury, but this condition is not associated with staghorn calculi.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Red cell casts and dysmorphic red blood cells form when erythrocytes traverse the renal tubules and indicate a glomerular bleeding source (eg, glomerulonephritis).&nbsp;

Kidney stones most commonly form in concentrated urine (eg, &gt;1.015), which results in supersaturation of salts and crystal precipitation.&nbsp; A specific gravity of &#8804;1.003 indicates dilute urine, and it is unlikely that a patient with an acute stone would have such a low specific gravity.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp;

The pain associated with nephrolithiasis (renal colic) is often severe and, although it may wax and wane, is generally not positional.&nbsp; The pain commonly radiates to the groin, especially as the stone passes down the ureter to the ureterovesical junction.&nbsp; Nausea and vomiting are common, and bowel sounds are often diminished due to an associated ileus.&nbsp; Hematuria is usually present but may not be grossly visible.</p><p>Most kidney stones are calcium-based (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate).&nbsp; But regardless of chemical composition, low fluid intake can lead to <strong>supersaturation</strong> of urine with crystalline material and promote stone formation.&nbsp; <strong>Increasing fluid intake</strong> can reduce the risk of all types of stones.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Excessive alcohol intake can trigger acute pancreatitis.&nbsp; The pain associated with pancreatitis is typically located in the epigastric area rather than the flank and radiates to the back rather than the groin.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Recurrent infections of the upper urinary tract with urease-producing organisms (eg, <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus</em>) can lead to formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones.&nbsp; These stones are often large and may fill the renal pelvis.&nbsp; Although patients may have mild flank pain due to recurrent infection, acute renal colic is uncommon as these large stones do not travel down the ureter.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; A high-fiber diet is associated with a decreased risk of diverticulitis.&nbsp; This condition typically presents over a few days (not suddenly, as in this patient) with lower abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Calcium passively follows the reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules.&nbsp; Increased dietary sodium intake leads to reduced sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and lowers calcium reabsorption (leading to hypercalciuria).</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Dietary calcium binds oxalate in the gut to form unabsorbable calcium oxalate.&nbsp; Low-calcium diets lead to increased absorption of free oxalate, which is then excreted in the urine; the resulting hyperoxaluria promotes the formation of calcium oxalate stones.&nbsp; Low-calcium diets are therefore paradoxically associated with increased risk of stone formation.</p><p><strong>(Choice G)</strong>&nbsp; Untreated infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, presenting with lower abdominal pain and fever.&nbsp; Examination findings include mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervical motion tenderness.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Urine supersaturation is the main mechanism underlying all types of renal stones.&nbsp; Low fluid intake increases the concentration of stone-forming agents, thereby promoting stone formation.&nbsp; All patients with nephrolithiasis should be advised to maintain adequate fluid intake.</p>",
