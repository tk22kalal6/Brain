RCC, particularly the <strong>clear cell subtype</strong>, is strongly associated with deletion, nonsense, and frameshift mutations involving the <strong>von Hippel-Lindau (<em>VHL</em>)</strong> gene at chromosome 3p.<em>&nbsp; </em>The majority of RCCs are sporadic and develop as single tumors; these are typically associated with somatic mutations in the <em>VHL</em> gene.&nbsp; Germline <em>VHL</em> mutations also occur and are responsible for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by clear cell renal carcinomas (often multifocal and bilateral), cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma.</p><p><em>VHL</em> encodes a protein that normally inhibits hypoxia-inducible factors; <em>VHL</em> mutations lead to constitutive activation of these proteins, resulting in overexpression of multiple <strong>angiogenic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>growth factors</strong> (eg, VEG-F, PDG-F) that stimulate tumor proliferation.&nbsp; As a result, tumors harboring VHL mutations are highly sensitive to <strong>angiogenesis inhibitors</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; <em>c-MYC</em> is an oncogene located on chromosome 8.&nbsp; Mutations are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <em>NF-1</em> is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17.&nbsp; Mutations of this gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp;
