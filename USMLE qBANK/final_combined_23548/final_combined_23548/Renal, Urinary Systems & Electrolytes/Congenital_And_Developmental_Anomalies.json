When serum osmolality rises (eg, water deprivation, dehydration), there is increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) which activates V2 receptors to reabsorb water into the systemic circulation.&nbsp; Water reabsorption leads to concentrated urine (low urinary volume, high urine osmolality) and lower serum osmolality.</p><p><strong>Mutations </strong>that impair normal V2 receptor function result in nephrogenic DI (<strong>ADH resistance</strong>).&nbsp; Following water deprivation, the collecting ducts are unable to reabsorb water despite high circulating ADH levels, leading to ongoing urinary water losses.&nbsp; Therefore, nephrogenic DI manifests with large volumes of abnormally <strong>dilute urine</strong> (ie, polyuria with low urine osmolality), <strong>high serum osmolality</strong> (ie, hypernatremia), and dehydration.</p><p>High serum osmolality, polyuria, and dilute urine also occur in central DI, which is caused by deficient ADH production by the hypothalamus.&nbsp; As with nephrogenic DI, urine remains abnormally dilute after water deprivation.&nbsp; However, <strong>challenge with desmopressin</strong> (an analogue of ADH) can differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI:</p><ul><li>In nephrogenic DI, desmopressin cannot correct the underlying ADH resistance.&nbsp; Therefore, <strong>urine osmolality remains unchanged</strong> (eg, low).</li><li>In <strong>central DI</strong>, desmopressin corrects the underlying ADH deficiency.&nbsp; Therefore, <strong>urine osmolality increases</strong> following administration <strong>(Choice C)</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; High baseline serum osmolality and high urine osmolality can be seen in states of marked hyperglycemia with glucosuria (ie, solute diuresis).&nbsp; Although polyuria can occur, the ADH response remains intact, so urine osmolality will be high with water deprivation.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)&nbsp;</strong> Primary polydipsia can also result in polyuria with dilute urine.&nbsp; However, unlike DI, serum osmolality and sodium are low (due to excess water intake), and dilute urine represents an appropriate physiologic response.&nbsp; ADH response is intact, so urine osmolality is appropriately high following water deprivation.&nbsp; No additional change is seen with desmopressin because maximum ADH levels are reached with water deprivation.</p><p><strong>(Choices E and F)</strong>&nbsp; This patient has visible signs of dehydration and hypernatremia; because sodium is a major determinant of serum osmolality, a high serum osmolality is expected.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Vasopressin-2 receptor mutations are a cause of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition in which renal resistance to antidiuretic hormone results in excessive urinary water losses.&nbsp; Expected findings include high baseline serum osmolality (typically with hypernatremia), persistently dilute urine after water deprivation (low urine osmolality), and lack of response to desmopressin.</p>",
