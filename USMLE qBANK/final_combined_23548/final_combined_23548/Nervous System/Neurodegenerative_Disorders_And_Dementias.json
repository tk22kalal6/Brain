This paraneoplastic syndrome is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer as well as breast, ovarian, and uterine malignancies.&nbsp; Patients exhibit <strong>progressively worsening dizziness, limb and truncal ataxia, dysarthria, and visual disturbances</strong> (eg, diplopia, oscillopsia).&nbsp; Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is due to an immune response against tumor cells that <strong>cross-reacts with Purkinje neuron antigens</strong>, leading to acute-onset rapid degeneration of the cerebellum.&nbsp; <strong>Anti-Yo, anti-P/Q, and anti-Hu</strong> are the most common antibodies detected in the serum.&nbsp; Antibodies are not always detectable; thus, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is diagnosed clinically after excluding other conditions.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Some paraneoplastic syndromes occur due to the production of hormone-like substances from tumor cells, but these would not cause the neurological findings described in this case.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Acute cerebellitis (post-viral cerebellar ataxia) occurs most often in children 2-3 weeks following varicella, measles, or Epstein-Barr virus infection.&nbsp; It presents with cerebellar symptoms (eg, ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria) that usually resolve completely within 3 weeks.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Cerebellar metastasis can cause progressively worsening subacute cerebellar symptoms.&nbsp; Additional findings such as headaches or decreased consciousness are often present due to significant mass effect from the tumor.&nbsp; However, autopsy would show metastatic cancer cells with surrounding inflammation as opposed to Purkinje cell degeneration.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Adverse effects from systemic chemotherapy can include a wide range of neurologic complications.&nbsp; However, this patient&#39;s symptoms began before the lung mass was identified and his autopsy findings are more specific for subacute cerebellar degeneration.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Cerebellar infarction presents with vertigo, nystagmus, ipsilateral limb ataxia, and truncal lateropulsion (falling toward the lesion).&nbsp; Although repeated vascular events could result in a stepwise progressive loss in neurologic function, this process would most likely occur over several years and affect multiple vascular territories throughout the brain (causing a wide range of neurologic deficits).&nbsp; Autopsy would show areas of liquefactive necrosis (acute infarcts) and glial scarring (chronic infarcts).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Paraneoplastic syndromes can occur due to the production of hormone-like substances from tumor cells.&nbsp; They can also result from immune reactions against tumor cells that cross-react with normal cells, causing dysfunction and/or damage to healthy organs and tissues.&nbsp; Neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration) are an autoimmune phenomenon.</p>",

the diagnosis can be confirmed with a baseline <strong>erythrocyte transketolase activity</strong> that is <strong>low</strong> but increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate.&nbsp; Treatment involves thiamine supplementation with glucose; glucose administration alone may precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy due to rapid thiamine consumption.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is necessary for production of NADPH and proper functioning of the erythrocyte antioxidant system.&nbsp; Decreased G6PD levels cause intermittent hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress.</p><p><strong>(Choices C and E)</strong>&nbsp; The metabolism of ethanol to acetyl-CoA consumes NAD<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> and increases NADH/NAD<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>;
