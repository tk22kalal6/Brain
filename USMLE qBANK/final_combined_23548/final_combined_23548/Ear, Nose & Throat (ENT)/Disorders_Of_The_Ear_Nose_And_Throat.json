Because the thymus is the site of T-cell maturation, patients with abnormal development of the third pharyngeal pouch often develop recurrent viral and fungal infections due to <strong>T-cell dysfunction</strong>.</p><p>The most common cause of pharyngeal pouch pathology is <strong>DiGeorge syndrome</strong>, which results from a chromosome 22q11 microdeletion.&nbsp; This condition affects both the third and the fourth pharyngeal pouches, causing variable <strong>immunodeficiency</strong>, depending on the degree of thymic hypoplasia (eg, recurrent sinopulmonary infections vs severe combined immunodeficiency).&nbsp; Patients also have <strong>hypocalcemia</strong> from parathyroid gland hypoplasia, as well as other anomalies (eg, conotruncal cardiac defects, craniofacial abnormalities).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; A <a href=\"15360\">branchial cleft cyst</a> is a lateral neck mass anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.&nbsp; It results from incomplete involution of the second pharyngeal cleft; it is not a pharyngeal pouch malformation.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; The thyroid gland <a href=\"3995\">descends in utero</a> from the base of the tongue to its anatomic position in the neck, and abnormal migration can result in ectopic thyroid tissue along this path.&nbsp; The thyroid gland develops independently of the third pharyngeal pouch.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Impaired auditory conduction can occur with disrupted development of the first pharyngeal arch (gives rise to incus/malleus) and second pharyngeal arch (gives rise to stapes), as well as the first pouch and cleft, which contribute to middle and outer ear structures.&nbsp; The third pharyngeal pouch does not give rise to any structures of the ear.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Mandibular hypoplasia (micrognathia) is related to disrupted development of the first pharyngeal arch, which gives rise to the mandible.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Derivatives of the third pharyngeal pouch include the thymus and inferior parathyroid glands.&nbsp; Disrupted development of the third pharyngeal pouch (eg, DiGeorge syndrome) leads to thymic hypoplasia/aplasia with impaired T-cell development and immunodeficiency.</p>",
