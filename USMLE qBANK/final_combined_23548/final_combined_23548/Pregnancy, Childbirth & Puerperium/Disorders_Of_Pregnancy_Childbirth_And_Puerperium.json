A <strong>complete mole</strong> is composed of multiple cystic, <strong>edematous hydropic villi</strong> and has the macroscopic appearance of a <a href=\"43089\">bunch of grapes</a> as a result of trophoblast proliferation.&nbsp; Microscopy would reveal <a href=\"48376\">large, edematous villi</a> with decreased blood vessels, proliferation of the villous trophoblastic lining, and no fetal tissue.&nbsp; Ultrasound confirms lack of the fetal pole and amniotic sac, along with diffuse echogenic material in the uterus (eg, <a href=\"3116\">snowstorm pattern</a>).&nbsp; Immunohistochemical stain <strong>p57 is negative</strong> in complete moles because of the absence of a maternal genome (the corresponding gene is paternally imprinted).</p><p>Classic clinical findings of a complete mole include first-trimester <strong>vaginal bleeding</strong> and an enlarged uterine size out of proportion to gestational age.&nbsp; <strong>Hyperemesis gravidarum</strong> can occur from increased &#946;-hCG secretion by the proliferating trophoblast.&nbsp; Excessive amounts of &#946;-hCG also stimulate ovarian growth and can cause the formation of <strong>theca lutein cysts</strong>.&nbsp; Preeclampsia, anemia, and hyperthyroidism can also be present with complete moles.</p><p><strong>&#946;-hCG</strong> levels must be monitored after uterine evacuation due to a significant risk of <strong>malignant transformation</strong>; rising or persistently elevated levels are a red flag for neoplastic conversion (eg, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; An elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in a pregnant woman may suggest a fetal neural tube defect.&nbsp; Other possible causes include underestimation of gestational age, twin gestation, and abdominal wall defects.&nbsp; AFP is also a marker of yolk sac tumors of the ovaries and testes.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Carcinoembryonic antigen is a marker followed in patients with colorectal carcinoma and is not elevated in GTD.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; CA-125 is an ovarian tumor marker and is not used for the evaluation of GTD.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s ovarian cysts are likely theca lutein cysts.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Vaginal cytology can be used to diagnose sarcoma botryoides (ie, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), which can occur in young girls (usually age &lt;5 years).&nbsp; It has a jelly-like cystic appearance (ie, bunch of grapes) and arises from the bladder or vaginal mucosa.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s pathology is from the trophoblastic tissue in the uterus.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>A complete hydatidiform mole is composed of multiple cystic edematous hydropic villi resulting from trophoblast proliferation.&nbsp; Serial measurements of &#946;-hCG should be performed following evacuation of a hydatidiform mole.&nbsp; Persistently elevated or rising levels may signify the development of an invasive mole or choriocarcinoma.</p>",
