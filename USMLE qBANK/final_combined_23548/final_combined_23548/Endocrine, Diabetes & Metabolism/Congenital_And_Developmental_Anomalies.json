Excess 17-OHP is shunted away from cortisol synthesis toward androgen production.&nbsp; <strong>ACTH increases</strong> due to the decline in cortisol levels and has a trophic effect on adrenal cortical cells, causing <strong>adrenal cortical hyperplasia</strong>.</p><p>Depending on the residual enzyme activity, 21-hydroxylase deficiency can present as 3 distinct clinical syndromes of differing severity.&nbsp; This patient most likely has the <strong>classic, non&ndash;salt-wasting</strong> (ie, simple virilizing) form of the disease.&nbsp; Because 21-hydroxylase is not completely absent (as in the most severe form), sufficient mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids are maintained to avoid salt wasting such that patients have normal blood pressure and electrolytes.&nbsp; Due to <strong>adrenal androgen overproduction</strong>, girls with this variant are often identified at birth due to ambiguous genitalia.&nbsp; <strong>Boys</strong> appear normal at birth and typically present around <strong>age 2-4</strong> with <strong>early virilization</strong> (eg, body odor, pubic/axillary hair).&nbsp; Exposure to high levels of sex hormones also induces an early pubertal growth spurt that manifests as <strong>accelerated linear growth</strong> at a young age.</p><p>In all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, patients have <strong>increased 17-OHP</strong> and androgen levels.&nbsp; Adrenal androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione) undergo peripheral conversion to testosterone, which explains this patient&#39;s <strong>high testosterone</strong> level.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a precursor lesion for pheochromocytoma characterized by increased catecholamine production.&nbsp; Presenting signs include hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating (not virilization).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Leydig cell tumors produce excess testosterone and can present with precocious puberty in young boys (eg, early testicular/phallic enlargement).&nbsp; A testicular mass is typically palpated on examination.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Production of excess LH and FSH by pituitary adenomas can lead to increased testosterone but not increased 17-OHP levels.&nbsp; Pituitary adenomas producing excess ACTH can lead to excess adrenal androgen production; however, symptoms of excess cortisol production (Cushing syndrome) such as growth deceleration and weight gain would predominate.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; A seminoma is a testicular tumor most commonly found in adolescents and adults.&nbsp; These tumors are derived from the seminiferous tubules and present with a testicular mass, not virilization and elevated testosterone.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes adrenal cortical hyperplasia due to excess stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.&nbsp; The classic, non&ndash;salt-wasting form presents in boys age 2-4 with early virilization, accelerated linear growth, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens.</p>",

The enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase is active in the adrenal glands and gonads and is responsible for converting pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone.&nbsp; Deficiency of this enzyme <strong>impairs synthesis of sex hormones</strong> (eg, testosterone, estradiol) and cortisol but <strong>does not inhibit mineralocorticoid production</strong>.</p><p>Due to the absence of androgens in utero, genetic males (46,XY) with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency have undervirilized, ambiguous genitalia.&nbsp; In severe cases, they appear <strong>phenotypically female</strong> but lack internal female genitalia, as in this case.&nbsp; In contrast, genetic females (46,XX) develop normal internal and external genitalia.&nbsp; At puberty, impaired synthesis of sex hormones in the gonads leads to <strong>absent secondary sexual characteristics</strong> in both sexes and primary amenorrhea in girls.</p><p>Excess mineralocorticoid production results in <strong>hypertension</strong> and <strong>hypokalemia</strong> that are usually detected around the expected time of <strong>puberty</strong>.&nbsp; Low cortisol provides positive feedback to increase ACTH production, further stimulating the mineralocorticoid pathway.&nbsp; This allows for the excess production of weak glucocorticoids (ie, corticosterone), preventing the detrimental effects of low cortisol.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"2162\">5 alpha-reductase deficiency</a> prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for male external genitalia development.&nbsp; Affected genetic males have ambiguous genitalia at birth but develop normal secondary sexual characteristics (eg, increased muscle mass, phallus enlargement) at puberty because these features are testosterone dependent.&nbsp; Blood pressure and electrolytes are unaffected.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"382\">11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency</a> causes decreased glucocorticoid synthesis and increased production of adrenal androgens.&nbsp; Because the production of 11-deoxycorticosterone (weak mineralocorticoid) is also increased, individuals with this deficiency have features of mineralocorticoid excess (eg, hypertension, hypokalemia).&nbsp; However, genetic males appear phenotypically normal.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; 20,22-desmolase (side chain cleavage enzyme) deficiency results in impaired synthesis of all steroid hormones with accumulation of cholesterol esters in the adrenal glands and gonads.&nbsp; Complete deficiency is lethal, and partial deficiency typically presents in infancy with signs of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension, hyperkalemia).</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; The most common form of CAH is <a href=\"678\">21-hydroxylase deficiency</a>.&nbsp; It causes decreased glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis and increased adrenal androgen production.&nbsp; In contrast to this patient, genetic males with 21-hydroxylase deficiency appear phenotypically normal.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Deficiency of 17 alpha-hydroxylase is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia characterized by impaired synthesis of androgens, estrogens, and cortisol with excess production of mineralocorticoids.&nbsp;
