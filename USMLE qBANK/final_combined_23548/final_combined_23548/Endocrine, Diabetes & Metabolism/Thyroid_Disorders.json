This patient was previously breastfeeding well and has no hepatomegaly.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Hirschsprung disease is caused by abnormal migration of neural crest cells into the rectosigmoid colon.&nbsp; The lack of ganglion cells in this colon segment impedes gastrointestinal motility, resulting in failed meconium passage and bilious emesis in a newborn.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Phenylketonuria is most commonly caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia.&nbsp;
