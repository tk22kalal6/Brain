This reaction occurs in patients who were <strong>previously exposed</strong> to a foreign, <strong>minor red blood cell (RBC) antigen</strong> (non-ABO) via mechanisms such as pregnancy, prior transfusion, or intravenous drug use.&nbsp; During the first exposure, only a low, typically undetectable, antibody response is initially mounted.&nbsp; On <strong>reexposure</strong> via transfusion, the patient&#39;s memory B cells produced a larger surge of antibodies, resulting in detectable hemolysis.&nbsp; This is known as an <strong>anamnestic response</strong>.</p><p>DHTR is usually <strong>mild</strong> and develops <strong>&gt;24 hours after transfusion</strong>, most commonly after 1-2 weeks.&nbsp; Most patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed only after findings of a newly positive direct antibody <strong>(+ Coombs</strong>) test and antibody screen.&nbsp; Additional laboratory findings include anemia with compensatory reticulocytosis and evidence of hemolysis (eg, &#8593; indirect bilirubin, &#8593; lactate dehydrogenase).</p><p><strong>(Choices A and B)</strong>&nbsp; Mild hemolysis can result from the transfusion of plasma products (eg, fresh frozen plasma, platelets), which can contain donor antibodies that target ABO or minor antigens on recipient RBCs.&nbsp; This reaction does not typically occur with the transfusion of packed RBCs, which this patient received, because RBCs are removed from the plasma layer and washed during the blood-separation process.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is caused by ABO incompatibility (eg, due to clerical error).&nbsp; Patients naturally have preformed antibodies against foreign ABO antigens (eg, anti-B antibodies in a type A patient) that will attack antigens on mismatched donor RBCs (eg, type B donor blood).&nbsp; Massive hemolysis occurs within minutes to hours of transfusion, causing fever, flank pain, and hemoglobinuria.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Anaphylactic transfusion reactions occur within minutes of transfusion initiation and present with wheezing, angioedema, and hypotension, findings not seen in this patient.&nbsp; This reaction can occur in patients with IgA deficiency due to the reaction of recipient anti-IgA antibodies against donor IgA.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are usually mild, hemolytic reactions that occur &gt;24 hours after blood transfusion.&nbsp;
