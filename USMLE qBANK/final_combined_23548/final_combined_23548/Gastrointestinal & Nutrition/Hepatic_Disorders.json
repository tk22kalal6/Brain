Hepatic encephalopathy refers to a reversible decline in neurologic function that occurs due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products such as ammonia.&nbsp; Ammonia is normally produced by the GI tract as a result of enterocytic catabolism of glutamine and colonic bacterial catabolism of dietary protein.&nbsp; GI bleeding causes <strong>increased nitrogen delivery</strong> to the gut in the form of hemoglobin, which is then converted into ammonia and absorbed into the bloodstream.&nbsp; The ammonia then enters the liver through the portal vein and is detoxified to urea.</p><p>In chronic liver failure, hepatocyte dysfunction and the shunting of blood through portosystemic collaterals impair the liver&#39;s detoxification ability.&nbsp; This leads to <strong>accumulation of ammonia</strong> and other neurotoxins in the circulation, causing altered amino acid transport across the blood-brain barrier, impaired neurotransmitter metabolism, and depressed cerebral glucose metabolism.&nbsp; These and other factors result in <strong>increased inhibitory neurotransmission</strong> (eg, &#947;-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) and <strong>impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release</strong> (eg, glutamate, catecholamines).</p><p>In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, lowering of blood ammonia levels is typically accomplished with oral administration of a disaccharide (eg, <strong>lactulose</strong>).&nbsp; Bacterial action on lactulose results in acidification of colonic contents, which then converts absorbable ammonia into nonabsorbable ammonium ions, trapping it in the stool and thereby increasing fecal nitrogen excretion.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Accumulation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is suggestive of renal failure, heart failure, or dehydration.&nbsp; In healthy patients, GI bleeding can also cause a rapid increase in BUN.&nbsp; However, this patient has cirrhosis, which is associated with decreased BUN because ammonia cannot be efficiently converted to urea by the failing liver.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bacterial meningitis presents with altered mental status, fever, nuchal rigidity, headache, and photophobia.&nbsp; In addition, asterixis (flapping tremor) is specific for metabolic encephalopathies.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; The altered mental status seen in hepatic encephalopathy is due to increased (not decreased) activity of the GABA neurotransmitter system.&nbsp; This enhanced activity is caused by increased GABA receptor affinity and alterations in neurosteroid synthesis rather than increased GABA production.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and the one most commonly involved in cerebrovascular accidents.&nbsp; This patient&#39;s presentation is suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy rather than stroke.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by increased levels of ammonia and other neurotoxins in the circulation that lead to increased inhibitory neurotransmission and impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release.&nbsp; Hepatic encephalopathy is frequently precipitated by a stressor (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection) that increases blood ammonia levels.</p>",
