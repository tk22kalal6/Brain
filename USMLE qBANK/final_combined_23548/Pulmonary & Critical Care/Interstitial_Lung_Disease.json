HP is an exaggerated immunologic response to an inhaled antigen; common offending agents include mold, bacteria, animal protein, and chemicals.&nbsp; The condition has variable presentation that is largely dependent on the dose and chronicity of antigen exposure:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acute HP</strong> involves abrupt-onset and often recurring episodes of fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue that coincide with intermittent high-dose antigen exposure.&nbsp; Leukocytosis is often present.&nbsp; Chest x-ray may be normal or show scattered micronodular opacification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chronic HP</strong> involves persistent and <strong>gradually progressive symptoms</strong> (as in this patient) resulting from long-term, moderate-dose antigen exposure.&nbsp; Patients usually have symptoms of cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and <strong>weight loss</strong> for several months or more.&nbsp; Lung auscultation usually reveals <strong>fine crackles</strong>, and chest x-ray shows <strong>interstitial reticular opacities</strong> consistent with the development of pulmonary fibrosis.</p></li></ul><p>The diagnosis of HP can be aided by pulmonary function testing that reveals a <strong>restrictive pattern</strong>; the restriction is worse with chronic HP and is accompanied by more severe impairments in gas exchange (eg, <strong>hypoxemia</strong>, low DLCO).&nbsp; Biopsy in both acute and chronic disease reveals<strong> lymphocytic infiltrate </strong>with poorly formed <strong>noncaseating granulomas</strong> created by the walling off of inhaled antigens.&nbsp; Chronic HP is associated with progressive&nbsp;<strong>alveolar septal fibrosis</strong>.&nbsp; Removal of antigen exposure usually resolves acute disease; however, the fibrosis occurring in chronic disease is often irreversible.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp;
