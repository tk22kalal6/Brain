This presentation is concerning for <strong>adenocarcinoma</strong> of the lung, the <strong>most common lung cancer</strong> in the general population, <strong>women</strong>, and <strong>nonsmokers</strong>.&nbsp; Although tobacco is the most significant risk factor, the etiology in nonsmokers is thought to be multifactorial.&nbsp; Risk factors include environmental exposures (eg, radon, second-hand smoke) and underlying lung disease.&nbsp; In addition, certain molecular alterations are seen more commonly in nonsmokers; these &#x22;driver mutations&#x22; are thought to be responsible for the development of the malignancy and include epidermal growth factor receptor <strong>(EGFR) mutations</strong> and <strong><em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements</strong>.&nbsp; <em>KRAS</em> mutations, another driver in the formation of adenocarcinoma, are seen more commonly in smokers.</p><p>Adenocarcinoma typically presents with cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis.&nbsp; Changes to the distal extremities, including <strong>clubbing</strong> (<a href=\"51595\">increased curvature</a> of the nail plate) and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (proliferation of the bones, skin, and nails of the fingers), may occur and are thought to be due to tumor-derived growth factors.&nbsp; The tumor tends to be <strong>located peripherally</strong> (as in this patient) and may present as a nodule, mass, or obstructive pneumonia.&nbsp; Like all malignancies, metastatic disease to the pleura can cause pleural effusions.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bronchial carcinoid is a rare malignancy that tends to be located centrally, within or adjacent to large bronchi.&nbsp; It typically presents with wheezing due to bronchial obstruction and occasionally also causes carcinoid syndrome (ie, episodic diarrhea, flushing, bronchospasm).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Mesothelioma most commonly arises from the mesothelium lining the pleural cavity; tumors are pleural based (ie, pleural mass with associated pleural effusion, pleural thickening), rather than intraparenchymal.&nbsp; In addition, it is extremely rare in nonsmokers with no history of asbestos exposure.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Small cell carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking; only 1% of cases occur in nonsmokers.&nbsp; It arises from the basal cells of the bronchial epithelium and displays some neuroendocrine features.&nbsp; Small cell carcinoma usually occurs in major bronchi.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Squamous cell carcinoma is also strongly associated with smoking.&nbsp; It usually affects larger bronchi (centrally located) and arises from areas of squamous bronchial metaplasia.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer in the general population, women, and nonsmokers.&nbsp; Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and <em>ALK</em> gene rearrangements are seen more commonly in nonsmokers and thought to contribute to disease formation in this subgroup.&nbsp; Adenocarcinoma is typically located peripherally and may be associated with clubbing or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.</p>",
