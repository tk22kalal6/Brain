Most cases of lung abscess present with several weeks of fever, malaise, weight loss, and leukocytosis.&nbsp; Cough with copious production of greenish, <strong>foul-smelling</strong> sputum is also common.</p><p>Lung abscess usually forms due to the <strong>aspiration of oropharyngeal bacteria</strong>.&nbsp; Risk is greatest in patients with &#8805;1 of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Periods of altered consciousness</strong> (eg, alcohol use disorder, seizures, dementia)</li><li><strong>Impaired swallowing</strong> (eg, nasogastric tube, dysphagia)</li><li>Periodontal disease, particularly gingivitis</li></ul><p>Most lung abscesses are polymicrobial and feature a mixture of oral <strong>anaerobic</strong> (eg, <em>Fusobacterium</em>, <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Bacteroides</em>) and aerobic bacteria.&nbsp; Infections are most common in dependent areas of the <strong>right lung</strong> because the right bronchus is straighter than the left bronchus; aspiration that occurs in the upright position usually leads to an abscess in the basal segment of the right lower lobe, whereas aspiration that occurs while supine often causes abscess in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe or the superior segment of the right lower lobe.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Aspiration of gastric acid causes chemical pneumonitis (acidic damage to alveoli), which typically results in severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates within hours of an aspiration event.&nbsp; It does not usually present with weeks of productive cough or a cavitary lesion.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Right-sided infective endocarditis may result in the development of multiple lung abscesses due to septic emboli.&nbsp; It is most often seen in intravenous drug use.&nbsp; This patient with alcohol use disorder has a single lung abscess in a dependent portion of the right lung, which is most likely due to aspirated oropharyngeal bacteria.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Cavitary tuberculosis (TB) is usually due to reactivated (not primary) mycobacterial infection.&nbsp; In addition, TB cavities do not typically have air-fluid levels and are most common in the upper portions of the lung.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; An aspergilloma (fungal ball) usually colonizes an already existing lung cavity, typically in the presence of TB, lung cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&nbsp; Aspergillomas generally occur in the upper lobes.&nbsp; Unlike chronic aspergillosis, simple aspergillomas are not associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, hemoptysis).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Lung abscess usually occurs in individuals with episodes of impaired consciousness (eg, alcohol/substance use disorder, dementia) or decreased ability to swallow (eg, esophageal strictures).&nbsp; They are generally caused by aspiration of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria from the oral cavity into the lower respiratory tract.</p>",

DAMPs explain how sterile insults (eg, massive trauma) induce systemic inflammation (and ARDS).</p></li></ul><p>In this patient with local cellulitis (ie, an infection <strong>distant from the lung</strong>), PAMPs (eg, from <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>) and DAMPs (eg, from damaged soft tissue) are released into the circulation.&nbsp; They are highly immunogenic and engage pattern recognition receptors such as <strong>toll-like receptors</strong>.&nbsp; Stimulation of these receptors results in increased <strong>endothelial permeability</strong> in the pulmonary circulation along with <strong>neutrophil recruitment</strong> into the alveolar tissue.&nbsp; Subsequent release of cytokines (eg, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) causes inflammatory lung injury.&nbsp; Widespread endothelial involvement can also lead to more generalized sepsis.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Although local lipopolysaccharide production (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em> pneumonia) can cause direct alveolar <em>epithelial</em> damage, lipopolysaccharide entering the circulation from a distant site (eg, perforated bowel) causes <em>endothelial</em> damage and indirect lung injury.&nbsp; Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide is produced by gram-negative bacteria; this patient has a group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (gram-positive) infection.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; <a href=\"14990\">Granulomatous inflammation</a> involves proliferation of macrophages driven by T cells, such as with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.&nbsp; These conditions typically cause chronic lung disease developing over months (rather than acute respiratory distress) and present with nodules and lymphadenopathy (not diffuse alveolar infiltrates).</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Mast cell degranulation contributes primarily to bronchoconstriction (eg, asthma, anaphylaxis) due to release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandins).&nbsp; Patients typically have wheezing (rather than crackles) and clear lungs (rather than diffuse alveolar infiltrates) on chest imaging.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; The <a href=\"18329\">fibrotic phase of ARDS</a> involves chronic (eg, weeks to months) replacement of damaged alveoli by fibroblasts and collagen driven by profibrotic cytokines (eg, TGF-beta).&nbsp; It occurs after the acute inflammatory exudative response has subsided, which is ongoing in this patient.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Pattern recognition receptors on innate immune cells (eg, neutrophils) respond to molecules produced by pathogens (eg, bacterial cell wall components) and damaged host tissue (eg, extracellular histones) to drive far-reaching inflammatory responses (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome).</p>",

The infection causes the alveoli to fill with inflammatory, neutrophil-rich exudate (pus); alveolar filling with any kind of fluid (eg, pus, edema, blood) creates <strong>alveolar consolidation</strong>.</p><p>Alveolar consolidation leads to a number of characteristic physical examination findings.&nbsp; Sound travels faster and more efficiently through liquids than gases; therefore, fluid-filled alveoli transmit higher intensity sound than those filled with air.&nbsp; As a result, <strong>breath sounds</strong> and <strong>tactile fremitus </strong>(vibration) are <strong>more prominent</strong><strong> </strong>over areas of alveolar consolidation.&nbsp; <strong>Bronchophony</strong>, a phenomenon in which a patient&#39;s spoken words (eg, &#x22;ninety-nine,&#x22; &#x22;toy boat&#x22;) are <strong>heard more loudly and clearly</strong> when auscultated over an area of consolidation compared to normal lung, is also present.&nbsp; The higher density of fluid-filled alveoli also creates relative <strong>dullness to percussion</strong> compared to the resonant sound created on percussion of air-filled alveoli.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Accumulation of interstitial fluid within the pleural space (pleural effusion) insulates breath sounds and vibrations that originate in the airways of the lungs.&nbsp; Consequently, tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity are decreased.&nbsp; The fluid in the chest cavity creates dullness to percussion over the affected area.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Pulmonary embolism typically has minimal effect on physical examination findings for the lungs.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; As in pleural effusion, accumulation of air in the pleural space (pneumothorax) insulates sounds and vibrations that originate in the lungs, and breath sound intensity and tactile fremitus are decreased.&nbsp; In contrast to pleural effusion, the relatively low density of the air in the pleural space creates hyperresonance to percussion.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; A mass in a proximal bronchial airway (eg, malignancy, mucus plug) can cause airway obstruction and consequent collapse (atelectasis) of distal alveoli.&nbsp; Breath sounds and tactile fremitus are decreased, and dullness to percussion is created due to the absence of air.</p><p><strong>(Choice F)</strong>&nbsp; Transudation of interstitial fluid into the alveoli occurs in heart failure and can create alveolar consolidation with physical examination findings similar to bacterial pneumonia.&nbsp; However, in heart failure the findings are typically similar bilaterally.&nbsp; Pneumonia, with accumulation of inflammatory exudate, is more likely in this patient with low-grade fever and evidence of unilateral alveolar consolidation.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Alveolar consolidation occurs when the alveoli become filled with fluid (eg, inflammatory exudate in bacterial pneumonia).&nbsp; The increased compactness of the alveolar fluid (compared to air) causes sound to travel faster and more efficiently, resulting in bronchophony, increased tactile fremitus (vibration), and increased intensity of breath sounds over the affected area.&nbsp;

disease.&nbsp; Legionnaires&#39; disease should be suspected in patients with recent exposure to <strong>contaminated water</strong> (sporadic cases or common-source outbreaks in cruise ships, spas, hospitals, or air-conditioned hotels), radiographic evidence of pneumonia (typically patchy infiltrates that may progress to consolidation), <strong>high fever</strong> (&gt;39 C [102.2 F]) sometimes associated with <strong>relative bradycardia</strong>,<strong> neurologic</strong> symptoms (eg, confusion, headache), and <strong>gastrointestinal </strong>(GI) symptoms (eg, diarrhea).&nbsp; Risk groups include the elderly or immunocompromised, smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>Because <em>Legionella pneumophila</em> is a faintly staining gram-negative bacillus that is facultatively intracellular, Gram stain typically shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.&nbsp; <em>Legionella</em> is often diagnosed by urinary antigen testing; it grows on selective medium (buffered charcoal yeast extract [BCYE]).&nbsp; The most common laboratory abnormality is <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, frequently associated with <em>Legionella</em> but not other causes of pneumonia.&nbsp; The hyponatremia may be related to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and/or renal tubulointerstitial disease impairing sodium reabsorption (possibly due to either direct effect of <em>Legionella</em>, cytokines, or natriuretic peptides).&nbsp; Elevated transaminases are also common.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; This patient does not have asthma, making allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (pulmonary infiltrates/bronchiectasis with eosinophilia and elevated IgE and anti-<em>Aspergillus</em> antibody titers) unlikely.&nbsp; Some helminthic infections are associated with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia (L&ouml;ffler).&nbsp; However, high fever, neurologic symptoms, and concurrent GI and pulmonary symptoms are unusual.</p><p><strong>(Choices B and D)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain) is the most common overall cause of community-acquired pneumonia.&nbsp; Lobar consolidation is classic.&nbsp; Patients with influenza A typically experience the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise that gradually improve over 2-5 days, with a subset developing secondary bacterial pneumonia (exacerbation of fever and respiratory symptoms after initial improvement).&nbsp; However, dry cough, GI and neurologic symptoms, and interstitial infiltrates in the setting of a recent cruise make <em>Legionella</em> more likely.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> infection can result in cold agglutinin formation.&nbsp; However, <em>M pneumoniae</em> predominantly affects young adults and is more likely to cause tracheobronchitis than pneumonia.&nbsp; Clinical presentation is typically mild with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray appearing more severe than expected based on clinical findings.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br><em>Legionella pneumophila</em> is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacillus that can cause a systemic infection.&nbsp; Symptoms frequently include high fever, cough, confusion, and diarrhea.&nbsp; The most common laboratory abnormality seen with <em>Legionella</em> pneumonia is hyponatremia, and sputum Gram stain often shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.</p>",
