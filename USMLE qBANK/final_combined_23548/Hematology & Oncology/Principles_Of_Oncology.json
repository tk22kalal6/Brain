It is caused by both peripheral and central mechanisms, as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acute-phase CINV</strong> (&lt;24 hours after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by the release of <strong>serotonin</strong> from intestinal enterochromaffin cells that have been damaged by chemotherapy.&nbsp; Serotonin stimulates vagal afferent fibers (5-HT3 receptors) in the bowel wall, which project to the brainstem and stimulate the vomiting reflex.&nbsp; Therefore, <strong>serotonin receptor antagonists</strong> (eg, ondansetron) can be used for treatment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delayed-phase CINV</strong> (1-5 days after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by increased levels of <strong>substance P</strong> in the brainstem due to chemotherapy-associated emetic stimuli in the cerebrospinal fluid and bloodstream.&nbsp; Substance P binds to and activates the <strong>neurokinin-1</strong> (NK1) <strong>receptor</strong> in areas of the brainstem that mediate vomiting (eg, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema).&nbsp; Therefore, <strong>NK1 receptor antagonists</strong> (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant) are often used for treatment.</p></li></ul><p>Most patients who undergo chemotherapy associated with a high risk of vomiting (eg, cisplatin) receive a combination of serotonin receptor antagonists and NK1 receptor antagonists (often with other antiemetics) to prevent both types of CINV.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Malignancy-related anorexia is the loss of muscle and fat caused by elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines.&nbsp; Progesterone analogs (eg, megestrol acetate) are the first-line treatment; corticosteroids and cannabinoids are also frequently used.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Malignancy-related hypercalcemia is typically treated with bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid), which reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Opioid-induced constipation occurs due to opioid-mediated effects on the bowel wall, which reduce peristalsis.&nbsp; Methylnaltrexone, an opioid antagonist that has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (it does not trigger withdrawal), can be used as treatment.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Patients who have highly aggressive lymphomas and leukemias are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with chemotherapy.&nbsp; Its primary manifestation is renal damage from elevated uric acid levels (catabolism of nucleic acids released from tumor cells increases uric acid).&nbsp; Rasburicase, a drug that breaks down uric acid, is used to prevent TLS in high-risk patients.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is mediated by peripheral and central mechanisms.&nbsp; It can be treated with serotonin receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) to prevent serotonin stimulation of afferent vagal fibers in the bowel wall (peripheral cause) and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant) to prevent the effects of substance P in the brainstem (central cause).</p>",
