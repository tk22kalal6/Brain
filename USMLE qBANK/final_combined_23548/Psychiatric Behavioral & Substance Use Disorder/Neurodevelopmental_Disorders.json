At <strong>age 18 months</strong>, a child should be able to walk well, finger-feed, imitate others, and follow a 1-step command without a gesture (eg, retrieve an object when asked).&nbsp; An 18-month-old should also say <strong>&#8805;3 words</strong> in addition to &#x22;mama&#x22; and &#x22;dada.&#x22;&nbsp; This patient has appropriate motor and social skills but babbles and says only 1 word (&#x22;mama&#x22;); these findings are suggestive of an isolated <strong>language delay (Choice E)</strong>.</p><p>Language is the most commonly delayed developmental milestone, and any child with language delay should have an <strong>audiology evaluation</strong> to assess for hearing loss as a potential contributing factor.&nbsp; Infants and toddlers with developmental delays should also be referred for early intervention; although many children with isolated language delay will catch up in preschool, early initiation of <strong>speech therapy</strong> results in improved and more rapid acquisition of skills <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Selective mutism is a failure to speak in a specific social situation (eg, school) but not in others (eg, home).&nbsp; It is often associated with anxiety, especially social phobia.&nbsp; This child&#39;s language impairment is not specific to a certain situation.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by impaired social communication/interactions and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests typically presenting by age 2.&nbsp; Although language delay can be the first sign of autism, the diagnosis is unlikely in this child who has age-appropriate social interactions with her family (eg, showing father her drawing, imitating a phone call).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Failure to say &#8805;3 words in addition to &#x22;mama&#x22; and &#x22;dada&#x22; at age 18 months is indicative of language delay.&nbsp; Initial evaluation includes audiology testing to assess for potential hearing loss.</p>",
