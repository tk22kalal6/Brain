mRNA production rate is determined by the binding of transcription factors.&nbsp; Genetic changes (eg, alterations in promoter sequence) and epigenetic modifications that affect chromatin openness (eg, histone methylation or acetylation) can also affect the rate of gene transcription by altering access and binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase.&nbsp;

After the gene is transcribed, the pre-mRNA undergoes further processing and regulation.&nbsp; Posttranscriptional control regulates the rate of mRNA decay.&nbsp; Examples of posttranscriptional control include polyadenylation and RNA interference (eg, endogenous microRNAs).&nbsp; The poly(A) tail protects eukaryotic mRNA from digestion by endogenous ribonucleases.&nbsp; Therefore, truncation of the poly(A) tail leads to increased mRNA degradation and lower mRNA abundance <strong>(Choice C)</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Posttranslational:&nbsp; After translation of mRNA, the polypeptide product undergoes <strong>posttranslational modifications</strong> (PTMs), which can affect both protein abundance and activity.&nbsp; One of the most widespread modifications is <strong>ubiquitination</strong> (by ubiquitin ligases, typically on lysine residues), which tags the protein for destruction in the <strong>proteasome</strong> (ie, lowering the protein half-life).&nbsp; Therefore, decreased ubiquitination often leads to increased protein abundance <strong>despite unchanged mRNA levels</strong>, as seen with galectin-3.&nbsp; Another common PTM is protein phosphorylation (by kinases, typically on serine/threonine residues), which regulates the activity (ie, on/off switching) of proteins independently of their abundance <strong>(Choice E)</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Most proteins undergo ubiquitination at some point in their lifespans.&nbsp; Therefore, even isolated alterations of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (eg, loss of a single E3 ubiquitin ligase function) have been implicated in the broad dysregulation of protein levels, which may contribute to elusive conditions (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Posttranslational modifications can alter protein abundance and activity despite unchanged levels of corresponding mRNA.&nbsp; Ubiquitination targets a protein for proteasomal destruction, lowering its half-life, thereby lowering its abundance.</p>",
