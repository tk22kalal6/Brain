THs are likely due to sensitization of peripheral nociceptors leading to increased perception of myofascial pain.&nbsp; Patients typically develop mild to moderate, achy, or pressure-like pain that is often <strong>bilateral</strong> and may involve the occipitonuchal, temporal, or frontal regions of the head.&nbsp; Pericranial <strong>muscle tenderness</strong> (eg, head, neck, shoulder) is common.</p><p>THs are not associated with other neurologic symptoms or nausea/vomiting and are often precipitated by <strong>stress</strong> and fatigue.&nbsp; They may persist for days, months, or even years but (unlike migraines and cluster headaches) do not typically limit a patient&#39;s ability to perform daily functions.&nbsp; Treatment is typically with <strong>simple analgesics</strong> (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen).</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Chronic sinusitis can cause facial pain and tenderness but is often associated with nasal congestion and mucopurulent nasal drainage.&nbsp; A reduced sense of smell and taste is also common.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Cluster headaches most commonly affect men and present as severe, unilateral, orbital or temporal pain with associated autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis).&nbsp; The headaches are typically brief (15-180 minutes), debilitating, and may awaken patients from sleep.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Giant cell arteritis is associated with an acute headache that is typically accompanied by scalp tenderness, visual symptoms, and jaw claudication.&nbsp; It occurs exclusively in older patients (age &#8805;50) and is often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Brain tumors typically cause nausea, vomiting, and headaches that worsen with changes in body position.&nbsp; In addition, the presence of other focal neurologic signs would be expected due to compression of surrounding brain structures by the expanding tumor.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Migraine headaches are characterized by often debilitating, episodic, unilateral, pulsatile headaches typically associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia.&nbsp; Some patients have focal neurologic symptoms that precede or accompany the headache (ie, aura).</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Tension headaches are the most common form of headache.&nbsp; They are characterized by an achy or pressure-like pain that is often bilateral and associated with pericranial muscle tenderness.&nbsp; Tension headaches are not associated with other neurologic symptoms and do not typically limit a patient&#39;s ability to perform daily functions.</p>",
