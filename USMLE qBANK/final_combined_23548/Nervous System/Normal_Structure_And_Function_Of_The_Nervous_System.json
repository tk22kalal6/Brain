<strong>Very long chain fatty acids</strong> (VLCFAs) and certain <strong>branched-chain fatty acids</strong> (eg, phytanic acid) cannot undergo mitochondrial beta-oxidation; these fatty acids are metabolized by a special form of beta-oxidation (VLCFAs) or by alpha-oxidation (branched-chain fatty acids) within peroxisomes.&nbsp; In peroxisomal disorders, these fatty acids build up in various tissues.&nbsp; Accumulation in neuronal cell membranes leads to <strong>neurologic defects</strong> due to improper neuronal migration, myelination, and degeneration.</p><p>This infant most likely has <strong>Zellweger syndrome</strong>, which is caused by defective peroxisomal biogenesis.&nbsp; It typically presents in early infancy with craniofacial abnormalities (eg, widened sutures, large anterior fontanelle), hepatomegaly, and profound neurologic defects (eg, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay).&nbsp; Death usually occurs within months of initial presentation.</p><p>Another common peroxisomal disease is <strong>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy</strong>, which is characterized by defective transport of VLCFAs into peroxisomes.&nbsp;
