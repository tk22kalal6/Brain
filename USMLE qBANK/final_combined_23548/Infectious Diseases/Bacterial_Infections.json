Females are at increased risk because the urethra is shorter and closer to the anus.&nbsp; Bacterial growth of a single pathogenic organism on urine culture is typically diagnostic.&nbsp; However, <strong>urine dipstick</strong> is usually performed initially because it rapidly assesses for UTI pending culture results.</p><p>The <strong>most specific</strong> dipstick finding for bacterial UTI is <strong>nitrites</strong>.&nbsp; Pathophysiology involves production of nitrate reductase by certain bacteria (eg, <em>E coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Proteus</em>); this bacterial enzyme reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>&#8722;</sup></font>) to nitrite (NO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>&#8722;</sup></font>).&nbsp; The level of nitrites <strong>correlates</strong> with the <strong>incubation time of bacteria</strong> in the bladder.</p><p>In patients with UTI caused by nitrate reductase&ndash;producing bacteria, dipstick analysis performed on the <strong>first voided urine</strong> in the morning is usually <strong>positive</strong> due to prolonged overnight bacterial incubation (&gt;4 hr), allowing nitrites to accumulate.&nbsp; In contrast, specimens obtained <strong>during the day</strong> may show <strong>false negative</strong> results, as in this patient&#39;s initial sample, because of the shorter duration of urine in the bladder and urinary frequency.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; A first-morning void is typically more (not less) concentrated than a sample obtained during the day.&nbsp; Detection of urinary nitrites is more likely in concentrated than in dilute urine; this is likely related to relatively decreased oral intake of fluids, and therefore urinary frequency as well, leading to a prolonged duration of bacteria in the bladder.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Leukocyte esterase, another common dipstick finding in UTIs, is released by lysed neutrophils/macrophages and is a marker of white blood cell activity and inflammation.&nbsp; However, nitrite production is not related to white blood cell activity.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Antibiotic-resistant organisms can lead to persistent abnormalities on urine studies despite empiric antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; However, resistance would not affect bacteria&#39;s ability to produce nitrate reductase, and therefore does not explain this patient&#39;s new finding of nitrites.</p><p><strong>(Choice E)</strong>&nbsp; Bacterial contaminants can alter culture results due to the prolonged incubation time of the test.&nbsp; However, the short duration between urine collection and dipstick analysis is insufficient for nitrite production from contaminants.&nbsp; Moreover, contaminants that can produce nitrites are typically from the stool, not the skin.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Nitrites on dipstick are highly specific for urinary tract infections.&nbsp; False negative results can occur when the incubation time of nitrate reductase&ndash;producing bacteria in the bladder is insufficient (eg, frequent urination) to allow for accumulation of bacterial metabolites.</p>",

<em>S aureus</em> produces large colonies and demonstrates beta-hemolysis.&nbsp; Like <em>S pyogenes</em>, <em>S aureus</em> can also cause monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; <em>S agalactiae</em> (group B <em>Streptococcus</em>) is a coagulase- and catalase-negative, PYR negative, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.&nbsp; Colonies produce a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis that enhances when plated perpendicular to <em>S aureus</em> (positive CAMP&nbsp;test).&nbsp; <em>S agalactiae</em> can cause skin and soft tissue infections, as well as newborn sepsis and meningitis.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe infection of the subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia and is a surgical emergency.&nbsp; The infection is often polymicrobial, but monomicrobial cases due to <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (group A <em>Streptococcus</em>) can also occur.&nbsp; <em>S pyogenes</em> is a PYR-positive, beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.</p>",
