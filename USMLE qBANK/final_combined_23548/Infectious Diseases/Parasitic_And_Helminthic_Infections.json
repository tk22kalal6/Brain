Exposure occurs when humans swim or bathe in freshwater that contains <strong>contaminated snails</strong> (the intermediate host).&nbsp; Cercariae from the snails penetrate human skin and migrate to the <strong>liver</strong>, where they mature into adult worms.&nbsp; Adult worms then travel through the portal circulation to the <strong>mesenteric</strong> venules (<em>S mansoni</em> and <em>S japonicum</em>) or the venous plexus of the <strong>bladder</strong> (<em>S haematobium</em>).</p><p>Adult worms release eggs through host tissue to be excreted in feces or urine.&nbsp; Although most patients are asymptomatic, eggs can trigger a significant <strong>granulomatous inflammatory response</strong>, leading to manifestations in the <strong>gastrointestinal tract</strong> (eg, diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia, anemia), bladder (eg, terminal hematuria), or periportal system (eg, portal hypertension, splenomegaly).&nbsp; <strong>Eosinophilia</strong> is common early in the disease course as eosinophils release granules that are toxic to adult worms.</p><p>Diagnostic confirmation requires the identification of <strong>round/oval eggs</strong> with a characteristic terminal (<em>S. haematobium</em>) or lateral (<em>S. mansoni</em>) <a href=\"31217\">spine</a> on stool/urinary testing or tissue biopsy.&nbsp; Treatment with <strong>praziquantel</strong>, which alters parasite digestion and calcium transport, is generally curative.</p><p><strong>(Choice A)</strong>&nbsp; Artemisinin-based combination therapy is used for chloroquine resistant malaria.&nbsp; <a href=\"31218\">Malaria</a> can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but patients are usually acutely ill (eg, fever, chills, myalgia, headache).&nbsp; Giemsa-stained blood smear generally reveals intraerythrocytic ring-shaped trophozoites, not eggs with a spine.</p><p><strong>(Choice B)</strong>&nbsp; Bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract is common when traveling to countries with poor sanitation and water control systems.&nbsp; Ciprofloxacin is sometimes used for treatment.&nbsp; However, most cases are brief in duration, eosinophilia is not generally seen, and eggs would not be present.</p><p><strong>(Choice C)</strong>&nbsp; Ganciclovir can treat <a href=\"41742\">cytomegalovirus colitis</a>, which frequently causes diarrhea and abdominal pain.&nbsp; However, most cases arise in patients that are severely immunocompromised.&nbsp; Furthermore, fever is usually present and biopsy would show intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions, not eggs.</p><p><strong>(Choice D)</strong>&nbsp; Metronidazole plus paromomycin is used to treat <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, which is a common cause of dysentery (eg, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain) in travelers.&nbsp; However, the presence of several months of symptoms, eosinophilia, and eggs on biopsy make this diagnosis unlikely.</p><p><strong>Educational objective:</strong><br>Schistosomiasis is a blood fluke infection that occurs when humans bathe or swim in freshwater that contains contaminated snails.&nbsp; Adult worms mature in the liver, lodge in the mesenteric venules or vesicular venous plexus, and secrete eggs into feces or urine.&nbsp; Eggs can trigger&nbsp;granulomatous inflammation, leading to symptoms in the gastrointestinal, urinary, or periportal tract.&nbsp; Diagnosis is typically made when round or oval eggs with a terminal or lateral spine are identified in urine, feces, or biopsy.</p>",

Most individuals do not become ill, but a minority develop fatal meningoencephalitis after <em>N fowleri</em> penetrates the olfactory mucosa, crosses the cribriform plate, and invades the olfactory bulb.</p><p>Patients with PAM usually develop acute confusion, high fever, photophobia, and meningeal symptoms (eg, neck stiffness, headache).&nbsp; Lumbar puncture opening pressures are often markedly elevated, and CSF analysis typically reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis, high protein, and low glucose.&nbsp; Suspicion is usually raised when CSF testing is negative for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.&nbsp;

Humans acquire schistosomiasis via contact with infected freshwater.&nbsp; Infection is not possible in the United States due to absence of the specific <strong>freshwater snails</strong> that incubate the infectious larvae.</p><p>Once released into the environment, the larvae can penetrate <strong>intact human skin</strong> and subsequently travel to the <strong>liver</strong> where they mature into adults over a period of several weeks.&nbsp; After maturation, the adult worms migrate to specific destinations: the mesenteric venules of the <strong>intestine</strong> (<em>S japonicum</em> and <em>S mansoni</em>) or the <strong>urinary bladder</strong> venous plexus (<em>S haematobium</em>).&nbsp; The adult worms remain in these blood vessels for life (5-30 years), adhering to the vessel wall with suckers and releasing eggs into circulation.&nbsp; Eggs released by <em>S japonicum</em> and <em>S mansoni</em> have a tendency to penetrate the bowel wall and be excreted in the feces.&nbsp; They also frequently traverse the portal venous system and lodge in the liver.&nbsp; <em>S haematobium</em> eggs tend to pierce the vesical and ureteral walls and be expelled in the urine.&nbsp; On exposure to freshwater, these eggs release larvae that can infect snails and perpetuate the life cycle.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis result from a <strong>T<font size=\"2\"><sub>H</sub></font>2-mediated</strong> granulomatous response directed against the eggs that is composed of infiltrating T<font size=\"2\"><sub>H</sub></font>2 cells, eosinophils, and M2 macrophages.&nbsp; This ultimately leads to the development of marked fibrosis and <strong>ulceration and scarring of the bowel or bladder/ureters</strong> (depending on the species).&nbsp; Eggs that settle into the presinusoidal radicals of the portal vein can cause <strong>periportal &#x22;pipestem&#x22;
