However, she does not acknowledge the adverse effects of obesity and voices no readiness to institute behavioral changes (eg, diet, exercise).&nbsp; Counseling of patients with obesity and other lifestyle-related disorders (eg, smoking, alcohol abuse) can often be tailored to the individual patient by using a stages of change model; this patient is considered to be in the <strong>precontemplation stage</strong>.</p><p>Patients in the precontemplation stage are not ready to explore lifestyle change options or implement specific behavioral interventions.&nbsp; However, it is often beneficial to explore the patient&#39;s <strong>current understanding</strong> of their condition and how it can affect their <strong>future health</strong>.&nbsp; Patients with obesity frequently understand much about the potential health consequences;

Providers working with patients in the precontemplation stage should avoid recommending specific actions but instead discuss patients&#39; understanding of their condition and its effect on their future health.&nbsp;
