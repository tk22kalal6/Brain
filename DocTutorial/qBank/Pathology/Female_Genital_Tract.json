While pleomorphic RMS is seen in adults, the spindle cell/sclerosing type can affect all age groups.</li>\n<li>Pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma frequently occurs in regions without typical skeletal muscle, such as the <strong>genitourinary tract</strong>, <strong>head and neck</strong>, suggesting it originates from undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells.</li>\n<li>Embryonal RMS typically presents as a <strong>soft, gray, infiltrative mass</strong> composed of <strong>primitive round</strong> and <strong>spindle cells</strong> in a myxoid background, often showing cross-striations in rhabdomyoblasts.</li>\n<li>A variant known as <strong>sarcoma botryoides</strong> arises in hollow viscera like the bladder and vagina, forming grape-like polypoid masses.</li>\n<li><strong>Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma</strong> is marked by fibrous septa dividing uniform, round tumor cells into nests, resembling pulmonary alveoli.</li>\n<li><strong>Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma</strong> contains bizarre, eosinophilic, often multinucleated tumor cells requiring immunohistochemistry (e.g., myogenin) to confirm diagnosis.</li>\n<li><strong>Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma</strong> shows fascicles or storiform arrangements of spindle cells, with occasional rhabdomyoblasts and dense sclerotic stroma, more common in adults.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanations of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Leiomyoma (Option A): </strong>Leiomyoma is the most frequently occurring <strong>benign mesenchymal tumor</strong> in the bladder, though such tumors overall are quite rare. They typically present as well-circumscribed, <strong>encapsulated masses </strong>that are located within the bladder wall (intramural or submucosal). Morphologically, these tumors appear oval to spherical in shape and can reach several centimeters in diameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Interstitial cystitis (Option C): </strong>Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder condition of unknown cause, predominantly affecting women. It presents as <strong>pelvic pain</strong> or pressure perceived to be linked to the bladder, along with <strong>urinary symptoms</strong> such as frequency, urgency, hematuria, and dysuria lasting over six weeks without any identifiable infection. Cystoscopy may show <strong>mucosal fissures </strong>and <strong>pinpoint hemorrhages</strong> called glomerulations. Histologically, there are no specific findings, but increased mast cells are often noted in the submucosa, though their role is unclear. Some patients develop<strong> chronic mucosal ulcers </strong>(Hunner ulcers), marking the late ulcerative stage, and in advanced cases, <strong>fibrosis</strong> can cause the bladder to contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Malakoplakia (Option D): </strong>Malakoplakia is a unique chronic inflammatory disorder that arises due to <strong>impaired phagocytic function</strong>, typically in response to long-standing bacterial infections, most often caused by E. coli.. It tends to occur more frequently in immunocompromised individuals, including those who have undergone renal transplantation.On cystoscopic examination, it presents as soft, slightly elevated yellow plaques measuring approximately 3 to 4 cm. Histologically, the lesion is made up of clusters of large foamy macrophages, sometimes accompanied by multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes. A hallmark feature is the presence of <strong>Michaelis-Gutmann bodies</strong> which are laminated, calcified structures found within enlarged lysosomes of macrophages.</p>",

Morphologically, C. trachomatis urethritis presents as a <strong>mucopurulent discharge</strong> rich in neutrophils, without visible organisms on Gram stain.</p>\n<p><strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Option C): </strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the second most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) after Chlamydia trachomatis. In males, the infection primarily causes urethritis, whereas in females, it is <strong>often silent</strong> and may lead to<strong> pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</strong>, raising the risk of infertility and ectopic pregnancy if untreated. On gram stain, it appears as <strong>gram-negative diplococci</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Trichomonas vaginalis (Option D): </strong>Trichomonas vaginalis is a large, <strong>flagellated</strong>, ovoid protozoan primarily transmitted through sexual contact. While some individuals remain asymptomatic, others may present with yellow, <strong>frothy vaginal discharge</strong>, vulvovaginal irritation, painful urination (dysuria), and discomfort during intercourse (dyspareunia).

PSTT typically manifests as a uterine mass with either abnormal bleeding or amenorrhea and moderately increased hCG levels. Histologically, the malignant cells diffusely infiltrate the <strong>endomyometrium</strong>. PSTTs may occur <strong>after</strong> a normal pregnancy, abortion, or molar pregnancy.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The given clinical scenario of an ovarian mass in a post-pubertal female with <strong>well-differentiated unilocular cyst </strong>suggests a diagnosis of <strong>dermoid cyst</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Teratomas</strong> are germ cell tumors classified into three types: mature (benign), immature (malignant), and monodermal or specialized variants.</li>\n<li><strong>Mature teratomas</strong>, also known as dermoid cysts, are commonly unilateral but may be bilateral in 10 -15% of cases.</li>\n<li>They typically appear as <strong>unilocular cysts</strong> filled with <strong>hair </strong>and <strong>sebaceous material</strong>, lined by a thin, gray-white, wrinkled epidermal wall, often showing hair shafts, calcifications, and even recognizable tooth structures.</li>\n<li>Microscopically, the wall is composed of <strong>stratified squamous epithelium</strong> with sebaceous glands and adnexal structures. Other elements from <strong>all three germ layers</strong> such as cartilage, bone, thyroid, and neural tissue are frequently present.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Serous cystadenoma (Option B): </strong>Serous cystadenomas commonly present as multicystic lesions with <strong>fibrous walls</strong> lined by papillary epithelium or as <strong>surface projections</strong> on the ovary.</p>\n<p><strong>Granulosa cell tumor (Option C): </strong>Granulosa cell tumors are typically <strong>unilateral</strong> and can range from small microscopic foci to large, <strong>solid</strong>, or cystic <strong>encapsulated masses</strong>. Tumors with hormonal activity often appear yellow due to <strong>lipid accumulation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dysgerminoma (Option D): </strong>Dysgerminomas are usually unilateral tumors that range from small <strong>nodules</strong> to large masses and have a <strong>soft, fleshy appearance </strong>with a yellow-white to gray-pink cut surface.</p>",
