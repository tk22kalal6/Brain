      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The given images show the breast tissue negatively stained for all three, i.e., ER, PR and HER2neu.</li>\n<li>This profile <strong>(ER- /PR- /HER2-)</strong> defines <strong>triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)</strong>, which accounts for ~10-15% of invasive carcinomas and is typically high grade and aggressive with a <strong>poor prognosis.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>TNBC</strong> frequently aligns with the basal-like molecular subtype, characterised by <strong>CK5/6 and/or EGFR positivity</strong>, a high incidence of <strong>BRCA1 germline mutations</strong>, a tendency for<strong> early visceral metastases</strong>, and <strong>peak recurrence risk within the first 3-5 years</strong> after diagnosis.</li>\n<li>The <strong>absence of hormone receptors and HER2 overexpression eliminates the use of endocrine therapies or HER2-targeted agents (trastuzumab).</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Management,</strong> therefore, relies on <strong>multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy, with PARP inhibitors</strong> (in BRCA1/2-mutated cases) and immune checkpoint inhibitors emerging as promising options.</li>\n<li>Overall, TNBC carries significantly <strong>lower disease-free and overall survival rates </strong>compared to other molecular subtypes of breast cancer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Triple-negative breast cancers</strong> are <strong>ER- /PR- /HER2-</strong>, high grade, often BRCA1-associated, and have a poor prognosis due to a lack of targeted therapies.</li>\n<li>Treatment is primarily <strong>chemotherapy</strong>, with investigational use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated patients and immunotherapies.</li>\n</ul>",
