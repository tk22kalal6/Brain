This malignancy typically affects<strong> older men</strong>.</li>\n<li>Both environmental and genetic influences contribute to the development of prostate cancer. The incidence varies with ethnicity and geography. Environmental risks include exposure to <strong>carcinogens</strong>, inflammation, and a diet rich in animal fats.</li>\n<li>Genetic factors involve mutations in genes like <strong>BRCA2</strong>, HOXB13, and genes regulating MYC. Tumors often develop through a sequence starting from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), which shares molecular abnormalities with cancer, including <strong>TMPRSS2-ERG fusions</strong> and PTEN loss.</li>\n<li>Androgens, particularly <strong>dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</strong>, promote cancer cell growth and survival by activating androgen receptors (AR). Tumors may later become androgen-independent, often due to AR amplification or mutations enabling ligand-independent activity. Additionally, epigenetic silencing of genes like GSTP1 increases susceptibility to carcinogens.</li>\n<li>Prostatic adenocarcinomas typically arise in the <strong>peripheral zone</strong>, particularly posteriorly, making them palpable on digital rectal exam.</li>\n<li>Grossly, they appear firm and gritty. Microscopically, malignant glands are small, crowded, and<strong> lined by a single cell layer with large nucleoli</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Basal cells are absent</strong>, which aids in distinguishing malignant from benign glands using immunohistochemical stains like AMACR.</li>\n<li>Approximately 80% of cases also display PIN. <strong>Perineural invasion</strong> and metastasis, especially to bone, are common in advanced disease.

The most common site is the axial skeleton, particularly the <strong>lumbar spine</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Gleason grading system</strong> stratifies tumors into five prognostic grade groups based on glandular architecture.</li>\n<li>Early-stage cancers are usually asymptomatic, detected via PSA testing or rectal exam. Later stages can cause urinary obstruction, especially if centrally located. PSA levels, though widely used for screening and monitoring, have limitations due to overlaps with benign conditions like BPH.</li>\n</ul>",

The tumor often arises through a precursor lesion known as <strong>prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Androgens, especially <strong>dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</strong>, play a pivotal role by activating androgen receptors (AR), stimulating tumor growth and survival.</li>\n<li>These tumors usually originate in the <strong>peripheral zone</strong> of the prostate, particularly the posterior region, making them accessible to digital rectal examination.</li>\n<li>On gross examination, they feel firm and gritty. Histologically, they are composed of tightly packed, <strong>small malignant glands</strong> lined by a <strong>single layer of cells </strong>with enlarged nucleoli.</li>\n<li>The<strong> absence of basal cells</strong> helps distinguish cancerous glands from benign ones, and markers like <strong>AMACR</strong> are commonly used for confirmation.</li>\n<li>Advanced disease often shows perineural invasion and metastasis, particularly to bone. The metastatic lesions are usually<strong> osteoblastic </strong>in nature, favoring the axial skeleton, especially the<strong> lumbar spine</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acute prostatitis (Option A): </strong>Acute prostatitis is a sudden inflammation of the prostate usually caused by bacteria similar to those responsible for urinary tract infections. The most frequent pathogen is <strong>Escherichia coli</strong>, along with other gram-negative rods, enterococci, and staphylococci. Infection often occurs via reflux of contaminated urine from the posterior urethra or bladder, though hematogenous spread from distant sites can also occur. It may also follow<strong> instrumentation</strong> or procedures involving the urethra or prostate, such as catheterization or cystoscopy. Clinically, it presents with <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>chills</strong>, dysuria, and a tender, boggy prostate on digital rectal examination. Diagnosis is based on <strong>urine culture</strong> and clinical signs. Biopsy is avoided in suspected cases to prevent the risk of sepsis.</p>\n<p><strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (Option B): </strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) commonly presents with <strong>urinary obstruction symptoms</strong> such as difficulty initiating urination, weak stream, nocturia, increased frequency, overflow dribbling, and in severe cases, acute urinary retention requiring catheterization. Histologically, BPH is characterized by <strong>hyperplastic nodules </strong>composed of <strong>proliferating stromal </strong>and glandular elements, with glands lined by an inner secretory columnar cell layer and an outer flattened basal cell layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (Option D): </strong>Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is made up of structurally normal-appearing, large, branching prostatic glands that are<strong> lined by atypical epithelial cells</strong> with prominent nucleoli, which can appear cytologically similar to cancer cells. However, unlike invasive carcinoma, PIN lesions <strong>still maintain at least a partial layer of basal cells</strong> and preserve an<strong> intact basement membrane</strong>.</p>",
