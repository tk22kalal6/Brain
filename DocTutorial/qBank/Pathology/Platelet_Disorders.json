It is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by reduced factor VIII activity. It primarily affects males. Much less commonly, excessive bleeding occurs in heterozygous females, presumably due to preferential inactivation of the X chromosome carrying the normal factor VIII gene (unfavourable lyonization).</li>\n<li>Approximately 30% of cases are caused by new mutations; in the remainder, there is a positive family history. Severe hemophilia A is observed in people with marked deficiencies of factor VIII (activity levels &lt; 1% of normal). Milder deficiencies may only become apparent in the face of trauma or other hemostatic stresses. The varying degrees of factor VIII deficiency are explained by the existence of many different causative mutations, including deletions, inversions, and splice junction mutations.</li>\n<li>Clinical Features:\n<ul>\n<li>Easy bruising</li>\n<li>Massive hemorrhage after trauma or surgery</li>\n<li>Spontaneous hemorrhages in high-stress tissues (especially joints)</li>\n<li>&rarr; Leads to hemarthroses and progressive joint deformities</li>\n<li>Petechiae absent</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Specific assays for factor VIII are used to confirm the diagnosis of hemophilia A. Typically, patients with hemophilia A have a prolonged PTT that is corrected by mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma. Specific factor assays are then used to confirm the deficiency of factor VIII.</li>\n<li>In approximately 15% of those with severe hemophilia A, replacement therapy is complicated by the development of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII, probably because factor VIII is seen by the immune system as a 'foreign' antigen. In these persons, the PTT fails to correct in mixing studies.</li>\n</ul>",
