Two main precursor lesions that lead to invasive urothelial carcinoma are <strong>noninvasive papillary tumors</strong> and <strong>flat noninvasive carcinoma in situ (CIS)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Noninvasive papillary tumors stem from <strong>urothelial hyperplasia </strong>and show a range of atypia, classified by their biological behavior.

This adaptive mechanism allows the new cell type to better tolerate the altered environment. A classical example is found in <strong>Barrett esophagus</strong>, where chronic acid reflux damages the native squamous lining, which is then replaced by glandular epithelium (either gastric or intestinal type) that is more suited to withstand the acidic surroundings. Though this replacement may be initially protective, metaplastic cells carry a risk of undergoing malignant transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>Dysplasia (Option B): </strong>Dysplasia is a precancerous condition typically seen in epithelial tissues. It is characterized by <strong>cellular atypia</strong>, including pleomorphism (variation in cell shape and size), prominent hyperchromatic nuclei with an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and architectural disarray of the epithelial layer. In dysplastic epithelium, there is often a failure of orderly cell maturation, as seen in squamous epithelium where the normal progression of cells from the basal layer to the surface is disrupted.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyperplasia (Option D): </strong>Hyperplasia refers to an<strong> increase in the number of cells </strong>within a tissue or organ, occurring in response to a specific stimulus.

Grossly, kidneys can be <strong>normal in appearance</strong> or appear<strong> shrunken </strong>in advanced stages due to ischemic injury from <strong>amyloid-induced vascular narrowing</strong>. Histologically, amyloid deposits accumulate in the <strong>glomerular mesangium</strong> and along basement membranes, causing narrowing of capillary lumens and distortion of the glomerular tuft. As the disease advances, the capillary lumens are progressively obliterated, and the glomerular architecture is replaced by dense, confluent amyloid material that may appear as <strong>interlacing broad ribbon</strong>s.

In addition, as in other causes of nephrotic syndrome, the podocytes show effacement of foot processes.

Lung lesions can <strong>cavitate</strong> and become radiographically visible, with <strong>hemorrhage</strong> and fibrosis occurring in advanced stages.</li>\n<li>Renal manifestations range from focal necrosis to crescentic glomerulonephritis.</li>\n<li>Clinically, the disease more commonly affects men around the age of 40 and additional features include rash, joint and nerve involvement, and fever.</li>\n<li>Untreated GPA has a high fatality rate, but aggressive therapy using <strong>corticosteroids</strong>, cyclophosphamide, TNF blockers, and B-cell-directed therapy can convert it into a relapsing-remitting condition.<strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanations of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aspergillosis (Option A): </strong>Aspergillosis can trigger hypersensitivity reactions like <strong>allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis</strong> in healthy individuals while colonizing aspergillosis, or <strong>aspergilloma</strong>, typically arises in lung cavities from previous diseases like TB or bronchiectasis, forming fungus balls with minimal tissue invasion but potential for hemoptysis. In contrast,<strong> invasive aspergillosis </strong>causes <strong>necrotizing pneumonia </strong>with sharply demarcated lesions, often spreading hematogenously to the heart and brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Polyarteritis nodosa (Option B): </strong>Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized muscular arteries, <strong>sparing pulmonary vessels</strong>, that presents with variable systemic symptoms and potentially fatal organ ischemia but responds well to immunosuppressive therapy. Around one-third of cases are linked to chronic hepatitis B virus due to immune complex deposition.</p>\n<p><strong>Renal carcinoma metastatic to lung (Option C): </strong>The lungs are the most common site for metastatic spread. Morphologically, the usual manifestation involves numerous discrete, rounded nodules, often referred to as \"<strong>cannonball lesions\"</strong>, dispersed throughout all lobes, especially near the lung periphery. However, metastasis can also present as a single nodule, infiltrative growths along bronchi or pleura, consolidation resembling pneumonia, or combinations of these patterns.</p>",

Clinically, FSGS presents with <strong>proteinuria</strong> that may be in the nephrotic or non-nephrotic range, often accompanied by <strong>microscopic hematuria</strong>, hypertension, and varying degrees of azotemia. The onset may be subtle or subacute.</li>\n<li>FSGS is classified into several forms: idiopathic (primary), secondary to other conditions like HIV infection, heroin use, sickle cell disease, or obesity, as an adaptive response in conditions like <strong>reflux nephropathy</strong> or <strong>unilateral renal agenesis</strong>; and in hereditary forms involving mutations in genes like <strong>NPHS1</strong> (nephrin), <strong>NPHS2 </strong>(podocin), ACTN4 (&alpha;-actinin 4), or TRPC6. These mutations affect components of the <strong>slit diaphragm</strong> or podocyte structure and function.</li>\n<li>Pathologically, FSGS is marked by focal podocyte injury, with <strong>effacement of foot processes</strong>, plasma protein entrapment, and extracellular matrix accumulation leading to hyalinosis and sclerosis.</li>\n<li>Morphologically, lesions are patchy and may be missed on biopsy.
