Of the causes of death listed, the most likely is hepatic vein thrombosis.</li>\n<li>Other common sites of thrombosis include the inferior vena cava and cerebral veins. The other conditions listed are not common causes of death for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria <strong>(Option A, C , D ruled out)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hemolytic anaemia that stems from acquired mutations in <strong>PIG-A</strong>, a gene required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG), which serves as a membrane anchor for many proteins. Because PIG-A is X-linked, normal cells have only one active PIG-A gene, a mutation of which is sufficient to cause PIG-A deficiency.</li>\n<li>The pathogenic mutations in PNH occur in an early hematopoietic progenitor that is capable of giving rise to red cells, leukocytes, and platelets. Progeny of the PIG-A mutated clone lack the ability to make \"PIG-tailed\" proteins, including several that limit the activity of complement.</li>\n<li>As a result, red cells derived from PIGA-deficient precursors are inordinately sensitive to lysis by the complement C5b-C9 membrane attack complex.</li>\n<li>Leukocytes share the same deficiency but are less sensitive to complement than are red cells, and so red cells take the brunt of the attack.</li>\n<li>The nocturnal hemolysis that gives PNH its name occurs because complement fixation is enhanced by the decrease in blood pH that accompanies sleep (owing to CO2 retention).</li>\n<li>The most feared complication of PNH is thrombosis, which often occurs within abdominal vessels such as the portal vein and the hepatic vein. The prothrombotic state is also somehow related to excessive complement activity, as Eculizimab, an antibody that binds C5 and inhibits the assembly of the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex, greatly lessens the incidence of thrombosis as well as the degree of intravascular hemolysis.</li>\n</ul>",

The cellular proliferation in the marrow often causes bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull resembling a \"crewcut\" in radiographs.</li>\n<li>Extramedullary hematopoiesis may appear in the liver and spleen. In childre,n there is moderate splenomegaly (splenic weight up to 500 g) due to red pulp congestion caused by entrapment of sickled red cells. However, chronic splenic erythrostasis produces hypoxic damage and infarcts, whic,h with tim,e reduce the spleen to a useless nubbin of fibrous tissue. This process, referred to as auto-splenectomy, is complete by adulthood.</li>\n<li>Gamna-gandy bodies are small yellow-brown splenic/hepatic nodules composed of Fibrotic tissue, Hemosiderin and Calcium deposits seen in conditions with Chronic splenic congestion and Hemosiderosis. Causes include Portal hypertension, Chronic Hemolytic anaemia, Chronic malaria and Schistosomiasis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incorrect options:</strong></p>\n<p>Options A, B , C: G6PD Deficiency, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hereditary Spherocytosis do not present with these findings.</p>",
