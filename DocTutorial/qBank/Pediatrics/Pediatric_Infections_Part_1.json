Only about 10% are symptomatic, with signs like petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, IUGR, microcephaly, and chorioretinitis. So, 25-30% asymptomatic is an underestimate.</p>\n<p><strong>Confirmation can be done by urine culture or PCR after 4 weeks of age (Option C): </strong>Urine or saliva culture/PCR is valid only if done within the first 3 weeks of life. After 3 weeks, positive results may reflect postnatal acquisition, not congenital infection. Therefore, after 4 weeks, these tests cannot confirm congenital CMV.</p>\n<p><strong>In developing countries, primary maternal infection can lead to congenital CMV (Option D): </strong>While primary maternal infection carries the highest risk (25-30%) of transmission, in developing countries (like India), most women are already CMV-seropositive.
