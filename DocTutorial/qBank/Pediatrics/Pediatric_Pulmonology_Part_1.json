      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:<br /> </strong>Foreign body aspiration (FBA) is a common emergency in young children, especially those aged 1&ndash;3 years. The presentation is often acute, following a choking episode or while playing/eating.</p>\n<p>In this case, <strong>sudden onset respiratory distress</strong> in a previously healthy child, with <strong>unilateral hyperinflation on chest X-ray</strong>, strongly suggests a <strong>partially obstructing foreign body</strong>. This occurs due to a <strong>ball-valve mechanism</strong>, where air enters during inspiration but cannot escape during expiration, leading to air trapping and <strong>hyperinflation</strong>. <strong>(Option D ruled out)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds</strong>, especially with hyperresonance, further supports this diagnosis. This is a classic radiological and clinical clue pointing to foreign body aspiration, particularly in the <strong>right bronchial tree</strong>, which is more vertical and wider.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250906333e7bce-3e42-4375-a9fb-290b3e02dc03.png\">\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Possibility of laryngotracheobronchitis should be considered (Option A): </strong>Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) typically presents with <strong>barking cough, stridor, and fever</strong>, which are not present here.
