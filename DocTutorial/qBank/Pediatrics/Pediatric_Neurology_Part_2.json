The first signs often appear when the child begins to crawl.

BECTS is most commonly associated with GRIN2A gene mutations, which affect an NMDA receptor subunit.</p>\n<p><strong>Otahara syndrome (Option C): </strong>Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy presents within the first 2 months of life, characterised by a burst-suppression pattern on EEG and tonic seizures.

However, CECT head is preferred in this setting as it:\n<ul>\n<li>Rapidly detects features of raised ICP (e.g., dilated ventricles, midline shift).</li>\n<li>Can show meningeal enhancement suggestive of meningitis</li>\n<li>Faster and more widely available modality than MRI in emergencies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Transcranial USG (Option B): </strong>In a 3-year-old, the anterior fontanelle is already closed, limiting ultrasound penetration and image quality. As a result, its sensitivity for detecting raised ICP or intracranial pathology is poor, making it unsuitable in this scenario.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>MRI Brain (Option D): </strong>MRI with contrast is the most sensitive for meningitis. It provides a more detailed view of the anatomy without exposing the patient to ionising radiation. But it is time-consuming and can only be done in a stable patient, not in someone with acutely elevated ICP.</p>",
