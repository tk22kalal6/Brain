This translates to (600/3000) X 100= <strong>20% weight loss</strong></li>\n<li>Any <strong>weight loss &gt;10% </strong>in <strong>term </strong>and <strong>more than 15% in preterm babies is pathological.</strong></li>\n<li>Most common cause of pathological weight loss in the <strong>early neonatal period is Dehydration, owing to inadequate breast feeds.</strong></li>\n<li>Ensuring adequate breastfeeds can easily take care of this condition.</li>\n<li>Regarding other options, remember<strong>that CCF due to PDA will cause weight gain</strong> in neonates due to<strong> Na/H20 retention, not weight loss.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Metabolic disorder</strong>is unlikely without symptoms like vomiting or lethargy.</li>\n</ul>",
