The key finding is the specific ring-like structure, not generalized cardiac enlargement.</p>\n<p><strong>Implantable pacemaker (Option D):</strong> An implantable pacemaker would show <strong>radiopaque leads in the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV)</strong>. The image depicts a <strong>ring-like structure</strong>, which is indicative of a prosthetic valve, not pacemaker leads.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The presence of a <strong>ring-like radiopaque structure between the left atrium and left ventricle</strong> on the chest X-ray, along with left atrial enlargement, is diagnostic for a <strong>prosthetic mitral valve</strong>.</p>",
