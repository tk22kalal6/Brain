It occurs as a result of inflammation of the plantar aponeurosis at its attachment on the tuberosity of the calcaneum.</p>\n<p><strong>Ledderhose disease (Option C): </strong>Refers to plantar fibromatoses, characterised by firm nodules of fibroblasts and collagen that develop in the plantar fascia. The nodules and fascia become hypertrophic, producing contractures.</p>\n<p><strong>Bunion (Option D): </strong>It's a swelling over the medial side of the first metatarsal head and is common in older women.</p>",
