The body's immune system mistakenly attacks the synovial lining of joints causing inflammation-leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness.</li>\n<li>It typically affects small joints of the hands and wrists, often symmetrically, and can involve larger joints as the disease progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinical features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Morning stiffness lasting &gt;1 hour is a hallmark of RA-it typically improves with gentle activity or warmth.</li>\n<li>This phenomenon, also known as the \"gelling phenomenon\", reflects inflammatory activity peaking after periods of inactivity.</li>\n<li>It correlates with circadian peaks in pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-6) and relatively low night-time cortisol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Investigations in rheumatoid arthritis-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Routine blood investigations: Hb may be low; white cell counts are raised along with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.</li>\n<li>Rheumatoid factor (RF): The RF is an IgM autoantibody against the Fc region of IgG, seen in almost two-thirds of patients with RA. Its detection can suggest the diagnosis. However, early in the disease, the levels are lower; therefore, the sensitivity is lower, and hence, it is not useful for screening purposes.</li>\n<li>Neither is the presence of RF specific for RA, as it can be seen in 5% of healthy populations and diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), tuberculosis (TB), Sjogren's syndrome, syphilis, chronic liver disease, sarcoidosis, leprosy, infectious mononucleosis and malaria.</li>\n<li>Anti-cyclic citrullinated polypeptide (anti-CCP): Anti-CCP antibodies are positive in up to 98% of cases. These are more specific than the RA factor and may be positive very early in the course of the disease. Positivity indicates a bad prognosis.</li>\n<li>Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may also be raised in RA.</li>\n</ul>",

At slightly higher levels (2-4 ppm) it may produce mottling of teeth.</li>\n<li>In some parts of India and Africa, where fluorine concentration in the drinking water may be above 10 ppm- chronic fluorine intoxication (fluorosis) is endemic and results in skeletal anomalies.</li>\n<li>Characteristic pathological features are subperiosteal new bone accretion and osteosclerosis (increased bone density), most marked in vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, forearm and leg bones, together with hyperostosis at the bony attachments of ligaments, tendons and fascia.</li>\n<li>Despite the apparent thickening and density of the skeleton, tensile strength is reduced, and the bones fracture more easily.</li>\n<li>The first clinical manifestation is usually a stress fracture, back pain, bone pain, joint stiffness and neurological defects (due to hyperostosis encroaching the vertebral canal).</li>\n<li>Characteristic X-ray features are osteosclerosis, osteophytosis and ossification of ligamentous and fascial attachments. It can be radiologically mistaken for other osteosclerotic conditions such as Paget&rsquo;s disease, osteopetrosis, renal osteodystrophy, idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, etc.</li>\n<li>Note: Fluorine stimulates osteoblastic activity; fluoroapatite crystals are laid down in bone and these are usually resistant to osteoclastic resorption.
