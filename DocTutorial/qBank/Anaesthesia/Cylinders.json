      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>To estimate the remaining time in an oxygen E-cylinder, we can use the approximate formula derived from Boyle's Law, considering the typical initial pressure and volume of an E-cylinder. Given a remaining pressure of 1000 PSI and a flow rate of 5 L/min, the approximate formula for remaining time in hours is:</p>\n<p>t=(Remaining PSI&times;0.3)/Flow rate</p>\n<p>Substituting the given values: t=(1000 PSI&times;0.3)/5 L/mint=300/5t=60 minutes t=1 hour</p>\n<p>Thus, the remaining time is estimated to be <strong>1 hour</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>E-Cylinder Characteristics:</strong> For oxygen, the usual initial pressure (Pi) in an E-cylinder is approximately <strong>1900-2200 PSI</strong>, and its full volume (Vr) is approximately <strong>660 liters</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Principle (Boyle's Law):</strong> The pressure-volume relationship for gases in a cylinder generally follows Boyle's Law, which states that for a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature, the product of pressure and volume remains constant (P1V1=P2V2).</li>\n<li><strong>Exact Formula :</strong> t=(Pr&times;Vr)/(Q&times;Pi) Where:\n<ul>\n<li>Pr = Remaining pressure (PSI)</li>\n<li>Vr = Volume of the E-cylinder (liters), which is 660 L for oxygen.</li>\n<li>Q = Flow rate (L/min)</li>\n<li>Pi = Initial pressure (PSI), which is 1900 PSI.</li>\n<li>The 60 in the denominator (if converting minutes to hours directly in the formula).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Approximate Formula):</strong> This simplified formula is often used for quick estimation and builds in a margin of safety. It uses rounded values for Vr (down to 600 L) and Pi (up to 2000 PSI), leading to the 0.3 constant: t=(Remaining PSI&times;0.3)/Flow rate (The 0.3 factor comes from approx. 600L / 2000 PSI = 0.3 L/PSI).</li>\n<li><strong>Application to problem:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Remaining PSI = 1000 PSI.</li>\n<li>Flow rate = 5 L/min.</li>\n<li>Estimated time = (1000 PSI * 0.3) / 5 L/min = 300 / 5 = 60 minutes = 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For quick estimation of remaining oxygen time in an E-cylinder, use the approximate formula: Time (hours) = (Remaining PSI x 0.3) / Flow rate (L/min).</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong></p>\n<p>https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/fulltext/2004/04000/a_method_to_quickly_estimate_remaining_time_for_an.61.aspx</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>The pressure in a half-full \"E\" cylinder of nitrous oxide will still be approximately <strong>745 psi</strong>. This is because nitrous oxide is stored primarily as a <strong>liquid</strong> within the cylinder at 20&deg;C, and the gaseous phase above the liquid maintains a constant vapor pressure as long as liquid is present. The pressure will only begin to fall once almost all the liquid has evaporated and only the gaseous phase remains. Therefore, the volume remaining in the cylinder does not directly reflect the pressure until a significant portion of the gas is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pressure gauge on a nitrous oxide cylinder remains constant at approximately 745 psi (at 20&deg;C) as long as any liquid N2O is present.</li>\n<li>Weighing the cylinder is the only reliable method to determine the actual volume of nitrous oxide remaining.</li>\n</ul>",
