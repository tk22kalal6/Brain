      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>By increasing <strong>lung volume</strong> and improving <strong>alveolar recruitment</strong>, PEPP reduces the <strong>transpulmonary pressure</strong> required to inflate the lungs, hence reducing the <strong>work of breathing</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Decreases FRC- Option (A)</strong>: PEEP <strong>increases</strong>, not decreases, FRC. FRC is the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of passive expiration. By keeping alveoli open, PEEP increases this resting volume, improving oxygenation and reducing the risk of atelectasis. A decrease in FRC is associated with worsened oxygenation and lung collapse, which PEEP is designed to prevent.</p>\n<p><strong>Increases work of breathing (Option (B)</strong>: PEEP typically <strong>reduces</strong> the work of breathing by preventing repetitive alveolar collapse and reopening, which is energy-consuming. However, inappropriately high PEEP can increase intrathoracic pressures, reduce venous return, and overdistend alveoli, potentially leading to increased effort and ventilator asynchrony&mdash;but in general, <strong>therapeutic levels of PEEP reduce the work of breathing</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>No change in FRC (Option C)</strong>: <strong>Even modest levels of PEEP increase FRC</strong>. The primary physiological mechanism of PEEP is <strong>to maintain alveolar patency</strong>, which directly increases lung volume at end-expiration. This improves ventilation-perfusion matching and gas exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PEEP increases FRC </strong>and<strong> reduces the work of breathing.</strong></li>\n</ul>",
