      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>In ambulatory (day care) procedures, the goal is to ensure rapid induction and emergence from anesthesia with minimal airway irritation. Among inhalational agents, sevoflurane is best suited for this purpose due to its low blood-gas partition coefficient, allowing for rapid onset and recovery, and its non-pungent nature, which minimizes airway irritation, especially important in smokers.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Clinical Features Favoring Sevoflurane:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-irritating to the airway, ideal for smokers with reactive airways.</li>\n<li>Rapid induction and emergence from anesthesia.</li>\n<li>Suitable for mask induction and commonly used in outpatient settings<strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Isoflurane (Option A):</strong> Highly pungent and causes significant airway irritation; not suitable for induction or smokers with reactive airways.</p>\n<p><strong>Desflurane (Option B):</strong> Though it has rapid emergence, its pungency and tendency to cause <strong>airway irritation and coughing</strong> make it unsuitable for induction in smokers.</p>\n<p><strong>Nitrous oxide (Option D):</strong> While it offers rapid onset and offset, it does not provide sufficient anesthesia on its own for major surgeries like ORIF and can expand air-filled spaces, which may be risky.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sevoflurane</strong> is the best choice for outpatient surgery with general anesthesia in smokers; <strong>Desflurane and isoflurane</strong> are avoided due to airway irritation; <strong>nitrous oxide</strong> is inadequate as a sole agent.</p>",
