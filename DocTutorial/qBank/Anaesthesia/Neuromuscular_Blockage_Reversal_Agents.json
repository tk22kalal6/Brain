In the Phase I block, using cholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine increases acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction. This prolongs depolarisation and intensifies the block, rather than reversing it. Hence, cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated during Phase I block.</p>\n<p><strong>Presence of fade phenomenon (Option B): </strong>Incorrect. Fade refers to a progressive decrease in the strength of twitches during repetitive nerve stimulation (e.g., train-of-four or tetanic stimulation). Phase I blocks do not show fade; all twitches are equally reduced. Fade is characteristic of Phase II (or non-depolarising) blocks, not Phase I.</p>\n<p><strong>Presence of post-tetanic facilitation (Option D): </strong>Incorrect. Post-tetanic facilitation refers to increased twitch strength after a period of tetanic stimulation. This is seen in non-depolarising or Phase II depolarising blocks. In Phase I, the endplate remains persistently depolarised and unresponsive, so no post-tetanic facilitation is observed.</p>",

It increases heart rate by blocking muscarinic M<sub>2</sub> receptors at the sinoatrial (SA) node in the heart. These receptors are part of the parasympathetic system (vagal tone).</li>\r\n<li>When fentanyl causes bradycardia, pancuronium antagonizes this effect by peripherally inhibiting cardiac muscarinic receptors, thus reducing vagal input and increasing heart rate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&beta;-Adrenergic receptors (Option A):</strong> Incorrect because pancuronium is not a &beta;-agonist and does not act through &beta;-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Its effect on heart rate is vagolytic, not sympathetic in origin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Carotid baroreceptors (Option C): </strong>These are pressure sensors in the carotid sinus that detect changes in blood pressure and adjust heart rate via autonomic feedback loops. Pancuronium does not directly affect baroreceptors, nor is fentanyl-induced bradycardia mediated through them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Central vagal nuclei (Option D): </strong>Fentanyl acts here to increase parasympathetic output, causing bradycardia. However, pancuronium does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore does not act centrally at the vagal nuclei. It exerts its effects peripherally, making this option incorrect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong></p>\r\n<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4249029/</p>",
