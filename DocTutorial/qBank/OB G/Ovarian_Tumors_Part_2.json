Therefore, <strong>surgical intervention is indicated</strong>, and the ideal time for such surgery during pregnancy is the <strong>second trimester (14-16 weeks)</strong>. This timing minimizes the risk of miscarriage associated with first-trimester surgery and avoids the increased difficulty and uterine irritability of third-trimester surgery.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dysgerminomas are the most common malignant tumor diagnosed during pregnancy</strong>, but overall the <strong>most common ovarian cyst diagnosed in pregnancy is a dermoid cyst</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>most common ovarian tumor to undergo torsion in pregnancy is a dermoid cyst</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>most common time for an ovarian cyst to undergo torsion in pregnancy</strong> is the <strong>end of the first trimester and/or puerperium</strong>.</li>\n</ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V2NEETPGMCQ/202404028f9eafc9-be6c-4153-bb15-c6e4595b38c9.jpg\">\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Only follow up without surgical intervention (Option A):</strong> A <strong>15 cm cyst is too large</strong> to be safely managed with only follow-up, as it carries a significant risk of complications (torsion, rupture) and potential malignancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Cesarean delivery and ovariotomy at term (Option C):</strong> Waiting until term for a Cesarean delivery and ovariotomy is <strong>not ideal</strong> for such a large cyst. The <strong>risks of complications</strong> (torsion, rupture) increase as the pregnancy progresses, and managing a large cyst during delivery can complicate the Cesarean section itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Surgery after delivery (Option D):</strong> Similar to waiting until term, delaying surgery until after delivery exposes the patient to the <strong>risks of complications throughout the remainder of the pregnancy and puerperium</strong>.
