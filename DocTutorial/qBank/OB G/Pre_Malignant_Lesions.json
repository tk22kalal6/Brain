It has a high diagnostic accuracy (90-98%) compared to subsequent D&amp;C.</li>\n<li><strong>Dilatation and Fractional Curettage (D&amp;C):</strong> Fractional curettage is a definitive diagnostic method that allows for not only diagnosis but also assessment of the extent of growth by separately sampling the endocervix and uterine cavity. It has historically been the gold standard.</li>\n<li><strong>Hysteroscopy with Biopsy:</strong> This is increasingly considered the \"gold standard\" for endometrial cancer diagnosis as it allows direct visualization of the endometrial cavity and targeted biopsies of suspicious lesions, especially useful in cases of cervical stenosis, inadequate endometrial biopsy specimens, or persistent bleeding after a negative biopsy. However, for general screening in abnormal bleeding, a less invasive biopsy is often performed first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVS) (Option C):</strong> TVS is a useful adjunct. If endometrial thickness is greater than 4 mm or if a polypoid mass or fluid collection is present, it necessitates follow-up with histopathological diagnosis (e.g., endometrial biopsy or D&amp;C). TVS alone is not diagnostic for malignancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Pap Smear (Option A):</strong> A Pap smear is used for cervical cancer screening and is not a reliable test for endometrial carcinoma. Only a small percentage (30-50%) of patients with endometrial carcinoma will have a positive Pap test, usually in advanced stages.</p>\n<p><strong>CA-125 estimation (Option D):</strong> CA-125 is a tumor marker primarily used for monitoring ovarian cancer treatment or recurrence. It is not used as a diagnostic tool for endometrial carcinoma, although it may be elevated in advanced cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a red flag for endometrial carcinoma</strong> and requires immediate investigation.</li>\n<li><strong>Direct histological sampling of the endometrium</strong> (via endometrial aspiration biopsy or fractional curettage) is essential for diagnosis.</li>\n<li>While office-based endometrial biopsy is often the first step, <strong>fractional curettage</strong> remains a highly definitive diagnostic procedure, particularly when a comprehensive sample or assessment of extension is needed.</li>\n</ul>",
