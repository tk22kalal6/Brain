      "solution": "<p><strong><br /> Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Rice is often considered to have the best quality protein among cereals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While rice protein is also deficient in lysine, it has a higher proportion of other essential amino acids, making it relatively more balanced in terms of amino acid composition.</li>\n<li>Additionally, certain varieties of rice, such as brown rice, may have slightly higher protein content and nutritional quality compared to polished white rice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Wheat (Option A):</strong> While wheat is a staple cereal crop consumed worldwide, it is not considered to have the highest quality protein. Wheat protein is deficient in the essential amino acid lysine, which reduces its protein quality compared to other cereals.</p>\n<p><strong>Maize (Corn) (Option B):</strong> Maize is another widely consumed cereal, but its protein quality is relatively lower compared to some other cereals. Like wheat, maize protein is deficient in lysine, which affects its overall protein quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Jowar (Sorghum) (Option D):</strong> Jowar is a drought-tolerant cereal crop commonly grown in dry regions. While jowar is nutritionally rich and provides several essential nutrients, including protein, its protein quality is not typically considered as high as that of rice. Like other cereals mentioned, jowar protein is deficient in lysine.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The Codex Alimentarius Commission, established by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), develops international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These standards aim to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in the food trade.</li>\n<li>Codex standards cover a wide range of food products, additives, contaminants, and hygiene practices, providing globally recognized benchmarks for food safety and quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BIS standards (Option A):</strong> The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for formulating and certifying Indian Standards (IS) across various sectors, including food. While BIS standards ensure the quality, safety, and performance of products in India, they are specific to the country's regulatory framework and are not international food standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Agmark standards (Option C):</strong> The Agmark certification is a quality assurance mark issued by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI), Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. It applies to agricultural products such as grains, pulses, spices, and vegetable oils. Agmark standards ensure that these products meet specific quality parameters and are graded accordingly. However, Agmark standards are limited to agricultural commodities in India and do not encompass international food standards.</p>\n<p><strong>PFA standards (Option D):</strong> The Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act was an Indian legislation aimed at preventing food adulteration and ensuring food safety and quality within the country. However, the PFA Act has been repealed and replaced by the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA), which established the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Therefore, PFA standards are no longer applicable, and they do not represent international food standards.</p>",
