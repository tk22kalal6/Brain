The sender could be an individual, a group, or an organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Message:</strong>The sender formulates the message, which is the information or idea they wish to convey to the receiver. The message can be verbal, written, or non-verbal.</li>\n<li><strong>Channel:</strong>The message is then transmitted through a communication channel, which could be face-to-face interaction, telephone, email, social media, or any other medium through which communication occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Receiver:</strong>The receiver is the individual or group for whom the message is intended. They decode the message to understand its meaning.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback:</strong>After receiving the message, the receiver provides feedback to the sender. Feedback is the response or reaction of the receiver to the message and helps the sender assess whether the message was understood as intended.</li>\n</ul>",

It is considered the most effective method of motivating a couple to adopt family planning practices for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tailored Counselling</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Interpersonal communication allows healthcare providers to tailor their messages to the specific needs, concerns, and preferences of the couple.</li>\n<li>Providers can address individual questions, dispel misconceptions, and provide personalisedguidance based on the couple's circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Trust and Confidentiality:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Couples may feel more comfortable discussing sensitive topics, such as family planning, in a one-on-one setting with a trusted healthcare provider.</li>\n<li>Interpersonal communication promotes trust and confidentiality, enabling couples to openly express their concerns and receive confidential support.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Active Engagement:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In interpersonal communication, both parties are actively engaged in the conversation, allowing for a dynamic exchange of information.</li>\n<li>Providers can actively listen to the couple's concerns, clarify doubts, and offer relevant information in real-time, fostering a more interactive and engaging communication process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Empowerment and Decision-Making: </strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Through interpersonal communication, couples are empowered to make informed decisions about family planning based on their individual preferences and circumstances.</li>\n<li>Providers can offer comprehensive information about contraceptive options, benefits, and potential side effects, enabling couples to make decisions that align with their reproductive goals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong> options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Printed Material (Option A):</strong> These may not always be as effective as interpersonal communication in motivating couples. Printed materials lack the interactive nature of interpersonal communication and may not address specific questions or concerns that couples have.</p>\n<p><strong>Films and Television (Option </strong><strong>B</strong><strong>)</strong>: They may not allow for personalised interaction or address individual concerns. Additionally, the effectiveness of visual media in promoting family planning practices may vary depending on factors such as access, cultural relevance, and audience engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Group Discussion (Option C)</strong>: When it comes to motivating couples for family planning, individualised attention and privacy are often preferred. Group discussions may not allow for personalised counselling or address the specific needs of each couple in the same way that interpersonal communication does.</p>",
