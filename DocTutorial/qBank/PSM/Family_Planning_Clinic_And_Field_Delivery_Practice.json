      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Modern family planning services typically encompass a range of reproductive health services aimed at assisting individuals and couples in making informed decisions about the timing and spacing of pregnancies. These services aim to promote reproductive health and well-being, prevent unintended pregnancies, and provide support for individuals and families in achieving their desired family size.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation for other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>a. Screening for cervical cancer:</strong></p>\n<p>Many modern family planning services include screening for cervical cancer as part of comprehensive reproductive health care. Cervical cancer screening, typically performed through Pap smears or HPV testing, helps detect precancerous changes or early stages of cervical cancer, allowing for timely intervention and treatment. Screening for cervical cancer is important for promoting women's health and preventing cervical cancer-related morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>b. Providing services for unmarried mothers</strong>:</p>\n<p>Modern family planning services often include providing support and services for individuals, including unmarried mothers, who seek reproductive health care. These services may include contraceptive counselling, pregnancy testing, prenatal care, childbirth services, and postnatal care. Supporting unmarried mothers is essential for promoting maternal and child health and ensuring access to reproductive health care for all individuals, regardless of marital status.</p>\n<p><strong>d. Providing adoption services:</strong></p>\n<p>While adoption services may not always be directly integrated into family planning programs, many organizations and agencies that provide modern family planning services also offer support and resources for adoption. Adoption services assist individuals and couples who are unable to conceive or choose not to have biological children in expanding their families through adoption. Providing adoption services aligns with the broader goals of promoting reproductive choice, family formation, and child welfare.</p>",

However, it relies solely on past menstrual cycle data and assumes regularity in cycle length. This method is <strong>less effective</strong> compared to others because it <strong>does not account for individual variations in menstrual cycles</strong>, making it prone to inaccuracies, especially for individuals with irregular cycles. Therefore, it is not the most effective natural family planning method.<strong>(Option A ruled out)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2)Billing Method:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Billing method, also known as the <strong>cervical mucus method, involves tracking changes in cervical mucus throughout the menstrual cycle</strong> to identify fertile and infertile periods. While it is more effective than the calendar method as it directly observes hormonal changes related to ovulation, its effectiveness can be influenced by factors such as vaginal infections or medications that affect cervical mucus. Therefore, it may not be as reliable as other methods, such as the symptothermal method<strong>(Option B ruled out).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>3)<strong>Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The BBT method<strong> involves tracking basal body temperature daily to detect the slight increase in temperature that occurs after ovulation </strong>due to the release of progesterone.</li>\n<li>While it is more effective than the calendar method because it directly observes the hormonal shift associated with ovulation, it may not reliably predict the fertile window in all cases.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Vasectomy is widely considered to be the most cost-effective method of family planning for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long-term effectiveness:</strong> Vasectomy is a permanent form of contraception. Once a man undergoes a vasectomy, it is highly unlikely for him to father a child. This eliminates the ongoing costs associated with other temporary methods of contraception, such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which require regular refills and adherence.</li>\n<li><strong>One-time cost: </strong>Vasectomy is a simpler, faster and less expensive operation than tubectomy in terms of instruments, hospitalization and doctor's training. Cost-wise, the ratio is about 5 vasectomies to one tubal ligation.</li>\n<li><strong>Less invasive:</strong> Unlike female sterilization methods like tubectomy, vasectomy is a less invasive procedure with lower associated healthcare expenses. Tubectomy may require hospitalization and anaesthesia, which can increase overall costs. Vasectomy, on the other hand, can often be performed in an outpatient setting under local anaesthesia, reducing healthcare expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation for other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tubectomy (Tubal ligation)(Option B):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tubectomy is a surgical procedure for female sterilization that involves <strong>closing or blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent eggs from reaching the uterus</strong> for fertilization.</li>\n<li>While tubectomy is highly effective, it may involve higher initial costs and potential complications compared to vasectomy. Additionally, tubectomy may require hospitalization and anaesthesia, leading to higher healthcare expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Copper T(Option C):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copper T (Intrauterine Device or IUD) is a<strong> long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method</strong> that is highly effective at preventing pregnancy. While Copper T may have <strong>a higher initial cost compared to vasectomy</strong>, it can provide cost savings over time due to its long duration of effectiveness (up to 10 years). However, the cost-effectiveness of Copper T may vary depending on factors such as healthcare infrastructure, access to services, and individual preferences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)(Option D)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OCPs are a popular contraceptive method that involves taking daily pills containing hormones to prevent pregnancy. While OCPs are effective and convenient for many individuals, they involve ongoing costs for prescription refills and healthcare visits. Over a lifetime, these recurring costs can add up and may surpass the initial cost of vasectomy, making vasectomy a more cost-effective option in the long run.</li>\n</ul>",

During this fertile window, which typically spans several days around the time of ovulation, <strong>compulsory abstinence of sexual intercourse for nearly one half of every month is necessary</strong>.The length of the fertile window depends on factors such as the length and regularity of the menstrual cycle and the variability of ovulation timing.</li>\n<li>The calendar method does not require the use of contraceptives or devices, so it is associated with no financial costs<strong>(Option B):</strong>. However, it may involve the cost of tracking menstrual cycles using calendars, apps, or other methods.</li>\n<li>The calendar method is one of several fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs) that rely on tracking various fertility indicators, including menstrual cycle length, basal body temperature, and cervical mucus changes, to identify fertile and infertile days and hence the <strong>safe period</strong>.<strong>(Option C) </strong></li>\n<li>While <strong>ectopic pregnancy</strong> is rare, it is a <strong>potential complication of any contraceptive method, </strong>including the calendar method.Ectopic pregnancies may follow conception late in the menstrual cycle and displacement of the ovum;embryonic abnormalities may result from conception involving either an over-aged sperm or over-aged ovum<strong>(Option D)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The drawbacks of the calendar method are :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a woman's menstrual cycles are not always regular.
