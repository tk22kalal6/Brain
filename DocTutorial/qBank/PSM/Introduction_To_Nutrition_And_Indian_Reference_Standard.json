Fat deficiency can lead to various health problems, including dry skin, hair loss, hormonal imbalances, and impaired brain function. While the body can survive for longer periods without dietary fat compared to protein or carbohydrates, fat deficiency is still detrimental to overall health.</p>\n<p><strong>Vitamins and minerals (</strong><strong>Option D)</strong><strong>:</strong> Vitamins and minerals are essential micronutrients that play crucial roles in various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune function, and bone health. Deficiency of vitamins and minerals can lead to a wide range of health problems, depending on the specific nutrient lacking. While the body can store some vitamins and certain minerals, prolonged deficiency can have severe consequences for health.</p>",
