Children under two years have immature immune systems and respond poorly to polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines. Therefore, <strong>conjugate vaccines</strong> are preferred for effective protection against pneumococcal infections in this age group.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cystic fibrosis (Option C): </strong>People with cystic fibrosis have a higher risk of pneumococcal infections and are best protected using a combination of conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines rather than the polysaccharide vaccine alone.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recurrent otitis and sinusitis (Option D):</strong> Recurrent otitis media and sinusitis can involve Streptococcus pneumoniae, but the polysaccharide vaccine offers limited protection; additional preventive measures and treatments are often required.</p>",

Frequent strain changes are unnecessary because the bacterium is antigenically stable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Polio (Option C):</strong> Poliomyelitis is caused by three poliovirus serotypes, types 1, 2, and 3. Both the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) protect against all three serotypes, and unlike influenza, they also do not require frequent strain updates, as the virus is antigenically stable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Typhoid (Option D):</strong> Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, is prevented using Vi polysaccharide or Ty21a live attenuated vaccines. Strain changes are rarely needed, as these vaccines target stable antigens common to most S. Typhi strains.</p>",
