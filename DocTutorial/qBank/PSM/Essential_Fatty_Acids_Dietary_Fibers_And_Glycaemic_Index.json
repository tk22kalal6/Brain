      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Palm oil is a vegetable oil derived from the fruit of oil palm trees. It contains a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, particularly palmitic acid and stearic acid. Due to its high saturated fat content, palm oil is often used in food processing and cooking, especially in products like margarine, baked goods, and processed foods.</p>\n<p><strong>Soybean oil (Option A):</strong> Soybean oil is primarily composed of unsaturated fatty acids, including both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. It contains relatively low levels of saturated fatty acids compared to other oils.</p>\n<p><strong>Groundnut (Peanut) oil (Option B):</strong> Similar to soybean oil, groundnut oil is predominantly made up of unsaturated fatty acids, with lower levels of saturated fatty acids. It is not known for having the highest amount of saturated fats.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunflower oil (Option D):</strong> Sunflower oil is predominantly composed of unsaturated fats, including both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It contains lower levels of saturated fatty acids compared to palm oil.</p>",
