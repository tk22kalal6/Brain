Joint families involve multiple generations living together under one roof.</p>\n<p><strong>Applied to all nuclear families of 2 years duration </strong><strong>(Option D):</strong> This option limits the definition to only those atomic families that have been established for 2 years.

While orphanages may offer nurturing environments for children, they do not inherently serve as bridges between generations or transfer points of civilisation.</p>\n<p><strong>Recreational club</strong><strong>(option D)</strong>: Recreational clubs offer leisure and entertainment activities for their members, but do not typically serve as bridges between generations or transfer points of civilisation.

Therefore, social pathology directly addresses the relationship between disease and social conditions, making it the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation for other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Socialism (Option A):</strong> Socialism refers to a political and economic ideology advocating for collective ownership and control of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p> The poverty line can indeed be defined in terms of <strong>daily calorie intake</strong>. Caloric intake is a fundamental aspect of human nutrition and is closely related to food consumption and meeting basic energy needs. The poverty line is often set based on the minimum level of income or consumption required to afford a basic diet that provides an adequate number of calories to meet daily energy requirements. Therefore, this option is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation for other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Daily fat intake (Option A):</strong> While fat intake is important for nutrition, it is not typically used as a direct measure for defining the poverty line. Poverty lines are more commonly based on measures related to income, consumption, or basic needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Daily protein intake (Option B):</strong> Similar to fat intake, protein intake is essential for nutrition, but is not typically used as a direct measure for defining the poverty line. Poverty lines are usually based on measures related to income, consumption, or basic needs rather than specific nutrient intake.</p>\n<p><strong>Access to health services (Option D):</strong> While access to health services is an important aspect of poverty and can contribute to poverty alleviation, it is not typically used as a direct measure for defining the poverty line.
