By the year 2000, the BMW Rules were already in effect in India, having been established two years earlier in 1998.

It releases harmful chemicals and toxins into the air, soil, and water, contributing to air pollution and potentially causing serious health issues. Additionally, burning e-waste does not recover any valuable materials or resources from the discarded electronics.</p>\n<p><strong>Incineration (Option </strong><strong>B):</strong> Incineration involves burning waste at high temperatures, which can release hazardous pollutants and toxins into the atmosphere if not properly controlled. While some modern waste-to-energy incinerators are designed to minimize emissions, incinerating e-waste may still result in the release of harmful substances. Furthermore, incineration does not effectively recover valuable materials from e-waste for reuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Landfill (Option C):</strong> Landfilling e-waste is a common but problematic disposal method. Electronic devices contain various toxic substances, such as heavy metals and hazardous chemicals, which can leach into the soil and groundwater over time, posing environmental and health risks. E-waste also occupies valuable space in landfills and does not decompose easily, contributing to landfill overcrowding and potential contamination.</p>",

These pesticides have lower toxicity compared to those labelled with red, but they still pose risks if not handled properly. While green-coded pesticides may require less stringent precautions than red-coded ones, they still necessitate careful handling and storage to prevent harm to human health and the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Yellow (Option C)</strong>: Yellow colour coding is commonly used for less hazardous pesticides, which are classified as slightly toxic. These pesticides pose fewer risks compared to red and green-coded pesticides but still require proper handling and precautions to ensure safety. Yellow-coded pesticides may have lower toxicity levels and fewer adverse effects on human health and the environment, but they still need to be used responsibly.</p>\n<p><strong>Black (Option D)</strong>: Black is not typically used as a colour coding for pesticides based on toxicity levels.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incineration is the recommended method for the disposal of cytotoxic drugs in India and many other countries. Incineration involves burning the drugs at high temperatures in specially designed facilities called medical waste incinerators.</li>\n<li>This process helps to destroy the cytotoxic properties of the drugs and reduce them to ash, minimizing the risk of environmental contamination and exposure to toxic substances.</li>\n<li>Incineration is considered a safe and effective method for the disposal of cytotoxic drugs when carried out in accordance with appropriate regulations and guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation for why the other options are not correct:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deep burial (Option A):</strong> Deep burial is not a recommended method for disposing of cytotoxic drugs in India or elsewhere. Cytotoxic drugs are pharmaceutical agents that are toxic to cells and are commonly used in chemotherapy to treat cancer. Disposing of these drugs through deep burial can pose environmental risks as they may leach into the soil and groundwater, contaminating the environment and potentially harming ecosystems and human health.</p>\n<p><strong>Dumping (Option B):</strong> Dumping cytotoxic drugs is highly discouraged due to the potential environmental and public health hazards it poses. Improper disposal of cytotoxic drugs can lead to contamination of soil, water bodies, and air, resulting in adverse effects on the environment and human health. Dumping cytotoxic drugs without proper containment and treatment can contribute to pollution and pose risks to wildlife, aquatic organisms, and humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Autoclave (Option C):</strong> While autoclaving is a common method for sterilizing medical equipment and materials, it is not typically used for disposing of cytotoxic drugs. Autoclaving may not effectively deactivate or neutralize the toxic properties of cytotoxic drugs, and there may be concerns about the release of harmful substances during the autoclaving process. Therefore, autoclaving is not considered a suitable method for the disposal of cytotoxic drugs.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>Inertization, or encapsulation, is a method of treating biomedical waste by mixing it with cement or other inert materials to immobilize any harmful components and reduce its potential for leaching or spreading contaminants. This process helps to stabilize the waste and minimize its environmental impact. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Incineration (Op</strong><strong>tion A):</strong> Incineration is a process of burning waste at high temperatures to reduce its volume and convert it into ash, gases, and heat. It is commonly used for the disposal of biomedical waste, but it does not involve mixing waste with cement.</p>\n<p><strong>Shredding </strong><strong>(Option C)</strong>: Shredding involves cutting or tearing waste materials into smaller pieces. While shredding may be a step in some waste management processes, it is not specifically related to mixing biomedical waste with cement.</p>\n<p><strong>Vermicompost (Option D):</strong> Vermicomposting is a process of composting organic waste using worms to break down the material into nutrient-rich compost. It is not typically used for the disposal of biomedical waste or for mixing waste with cement.</p>",
