      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:<br /></strong> Diphenhydramine is a <strong>first-generation H1 receptor antagonist</strong>, widely used for allergic conditions such as hay fever. It is <strong>lipophilic</strong>, allowing it to cross the blood-brain barrier easily, and thus exerts significant <strong>CNS effects</strong>, the most prominent of which is <strong>sedation</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These older antihistamines <strong>block both H1 receptors</strong> and <strong>muscarinic (M3) receptors</strong>, contributing to their <strong>anticholinergic side effects</strong> (e.g., dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation), but sedation remains the <strong>most commonly reported adverse effect</strong>.</li>\n<li>Due to their sedative property, first-generation H1 blockers like diphenhydramine are <strong>not recommended before driving or operating heavy machinery</strong>.</li>\n<li>In contrast, <strong>second-generation antihistamines</strong> such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine are <strong>less lipid-soluble</strong>, and hence, have <strong>minimal sedative effects</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Muscarinic increase in bladder tone (Option A): </strong>Diphenhydramine <strong>blocks muscarinic receptors</strong>, which actually leads to <strong>decreased bladder tone</strong> and can cause <strong>urinary retention</strong>, especially in elderly males with prostatic hypertrophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Nausea (Option B): </strong>While nausea can occur with many drugs, it is <strong>not a characteristic or prominent adverse effect</strong> of diphenhydramine. In fact, some first-generation antihistamines like meclizine are <strong>used to treat nausea and motion sickness</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Nervousness, anxiety (Option C): </strong>Diphenhydramine <strong>does not typically cause CNS stimulation</strong>; rather, it causes <strong>CNS depression</strong>, leading to sedation. Nervousness or anxiety is more likely with stimulants or decongestants like pseudoephedrine.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Comparison of Antihistaminic Agents:</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509054a37c1dc-f4e0-416f-991b-2422fd0cbeed.png\">",
