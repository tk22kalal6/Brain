Hence, this would <strong>decrease</strong> excretion.</li>\n<li><strong>Statement D (Correct):</strong> <strong>Alkalinization</strong> of urine using <strong>NaHCO<sub>3</sub></strong> promotes the ionisation of weak acids, enhancing their excretion, a standard principle in overdose management.</li>\n<li><strong>Statement E (Incorrect): </strong>Absorption of weak acids is typically <strong>faster from the stomach</strong>, where the acidic environment favours the <strong>unionised form</strong> of the drug. Therefore, absorption would be <strong>slower from the intestine</strong> due to a higher pH.</li>\n<li><strong>Statement F (Incorrect): </strong>At <strong>blood pH (7.4)</strong>, a weak acid with <strong>pKa = 4.0</strong> will be predominantly <strong>ionised</strong>, while in <strong>stomach pH (1-2)</strong>, the drug remains mostly <strong>unionised</strong>.
