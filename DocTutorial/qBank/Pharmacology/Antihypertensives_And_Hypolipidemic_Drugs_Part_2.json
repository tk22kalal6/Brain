This is accomplished through 2 different pathways. In the direct pathway, HDL delivers cholesterol esters directly to the liver via a scavenger receptor (SCARB1) on the hepatocyte cell membrane. In the indirect pathway, the cholesterol in HDL is transferred to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the cholesterol ester transfer protein.</li>\r\n<li>Nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation help to raise HDL levels and have significant cardiovascular benefits.
