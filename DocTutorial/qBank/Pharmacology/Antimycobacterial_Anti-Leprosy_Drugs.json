Because of this similarity, isoniazid can compete with vitamin B6, in the synthesis of multiple neurotransmitters (including GABA), resulting in defective end products. Isoniazid also increases the urinary excretion of pyridoxine, and a frank deficiency of this vitamin can eventually develop.</li>\r\n<li>Vitamin B6, deficiency most commonly occurs in patients treated with isoniazid who are elderly, alcoholics, or who have other comorbidities (eg, kidney or liver dysfunction, diabetes mellitus).</li>\r\n<li>When isoniazid neuropathy occurs, it usually clinically manifests as peripheral neuropathy.
