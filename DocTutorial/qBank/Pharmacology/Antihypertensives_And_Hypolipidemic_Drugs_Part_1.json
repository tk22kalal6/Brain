Due to a loss of negative feedback regulation, treatment with <strong>ARBs typically leads to increased renin levels and increased renin activity</strong>, which in turn leads to <strong>increased levels of angiotensin II.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Option A:</strong> This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in low levels of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, vasoconstriction, and aldosterone release. Hence, decreased activation of angiotensin II receptors would lead to an increase in urinary sodium excretion, decreased vessel tone, and lower levels of aldosterone. The combination of these effects lowers blood pressure.</li>\n<li>Due to a loss of negative feedback regulation, treatment with ACE inhibitors would typically lead to an increase in renin levels and renin activity. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with aldosterone receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone),</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It competitively binds to aldosterone receptors in the late distal tubule and the collecting ducts, inhibiting the effects of aldosterone. Inhibition of aldosterone leads to decreased sodium reabsorption, resulting in increased urinary sodium excretion.</li>\n<li>Due to a loss of negative feedback regulation, treatment with aldosterone receptor antagonists leads to an increase in renin activity and downstream renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components (i.e., angiotensin II) and aldosterone, causing an increase in vessel tone. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option D: </strong>This combination of effects could be explained by treatment with direct renin inhibitors (e.g., aliskiren).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct inhibition of renin decreases renin activity, which leads to lower levels of angiotensin II (AT II) and aldosterone. Decreased levels of AT II and aldosterone result in decreased vessel tone and decreased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, resulting in increased urinary sodium excretion. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The same combination of effects could also be explained by treatment with beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol). Beta-blockers inhibit the production and release of renin, which leads to suppression of the downstream renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) components (i.e., angiotensin II and aldosterone) and, subsequently, mildly decreased vessel tone and increased urinary sodium excretion.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\" https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/NEETPGMCQ/202403082eaf1fba-c3c5-4971-af2f-22b7519d4714.jpg\"><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\" https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/NEETPGMCQ/20240308e4766001-158f-4bfd-9fbf-571f0c40e2fe.jpg\">",

Since essentially all patients with ADPKD (due to PKD1 or PKD2) defects develop renal cysts. It is essential to have an understanding of the effect of these cysts on the RAAS.</li>\n<li>The renal cysts impair perfusion of glomeruli, which triggers the secretion of renin by the juxtaglomerular complexes. The renin secretion triggers the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system. <strong>ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, such as captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril, directly interrupt this system by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.</strong> Furthermore, the <strong>ACE inhibitors increase renal blood flow and may provide renoprotective effects to hypertensive patients with this condition.</strong> <strong>Angiotensin receptor blockers</strong>, such as <strong>candesartan</strong> and <strong>losartan</strong>, are also considered to be first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension in adult polycystic kidney disease.</li>\n<li>When treating hypertension, the drug of choice should be selected based on the underlying cause of the hypertension, the appearance of a concomitant disease state, drug-drug interactions, and whether or not one drug will help improve or treat another non-hypertensive condition.

Symptoms typically appear within days of initiation but can also occur after weeks to years of therapy. Although angioedema can affect any tissue, it most commonly involves the tongue, lips, or eyelids. Laryngeal edema and difficulty breathing may also occur. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is due to bradykinin accumulation. Normally, ACE is responsible for bradykinin breakdown. ACE inhibitors prevent bradykinin degradation, leading to increased levels. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator that ultimately increases vascular permeability, causing significant angioedema.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p>\n<p>The patient has <strong>intermittent claudication</strong>, a classic symptom of <strong>peripheral arterial disease (PAD)</strong>. PAD results from atherosclerotic occlusion of lower extremity arteries and presents with exertional limb pain that resolves with rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Cilostazol</strong> is a <strong>phosphodiesterase III (PDE3) inhibitor</strong> that increases intracellular <strong>cyclic AMP (cAMP)</strong> levels in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platelets</strong>: increased cAMP inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing platelet shape change and granule release.</li>\n<li><strong>Vascular smooth muscle</strong>: elevated cAMP causes <strong>arteriolar vasodilation</strong>, improving blood flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these effects improve walking distance and reduce claudication symptoms. Cilostazol is the <strong>only drug approved specifically for symptomatic relief in PAD</strong>, alongside a <strong>graded exercise program</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Abciximab (Option A):</strong> A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist; inhibits final common pathway of platelet aggregation but has no vasodilator effect.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>This patient has most likely overdosed on beta blocker medications. Beta blocker overdose causes diffuse non-selective blockade of peripheral beta adrenergic receptors, causing depression of myocardial contractility, bradycardia, and varying degrees of AV block. The result is a low cardiac output state.</p>\n<p>Glucagon is the drug of choice for beta-blocker overdose. Glucagon acts on G protein-coupled receptors, increasing intracellular CAMP and thus increasing the release of intracellular calcium during muscle contraction. This increases heart rate and cardiac contractility. Improvements in heart rate and blood pressure may be observed within minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Synaptic release of glutamate (Option A): </strong>Irrelevant to glucagon's cardiovascular effects and beta-blocker overdose.</p>\n<p><strong>Decreased cAMP in vascular smooth muscle (Option B): </strong>Would exacerbate hypotension by reducing vasoconstriction, opposite to the clinical improvement seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Decreased DAG in vascular smooth muscle (Option C): </strong>Not involved in glucagon's mechanism, which principally elevates cAMP rather than altering DAG/PKC pathways.</p>",
