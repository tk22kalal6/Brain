      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>In normal individuals, a small amount of protein is excreted in urine daily, and this includes about <strong>8-10 mg/day of albumin</strong>, which is considered physiologically normal and not indicative of renal pathology. <strong>(Statement 1) </strong>Sustained proteinuria, particularly if it exceeds <strong>1 gram per day</strong>, strongly suggests <strong>glomerular disease</strong>, since glomerular filtration barrier damage leads to increased protein leakage into the urine. Therefore, persistent proteinuria in this range warrants thorough evaluation for conditions like membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or minimal change disease.<strong>(Statement 2)</strong></p>\n<p>Benign or transient proteinuria, on the other hand, can occur in several non-pathological states such as <strong>congestive cardiac failure (CCF)</strong>, <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>exercise</strong>, <strong>obesity</strong>, and <strong>stress</strong>. These states temporarily alter renal hemodynamics or increase glomerular permeability but do not reflect intrinsic kidney disease. Thus, they are classified as <strong>functional proteinuria</strong>, and often resolve once the underlying trigger is removed. <strong>(Statement 4)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Minimal change disease is characterized by highly selective proteinuria</strong>, primarily involving albumin. Non-selective proteinuria, which includes a wider range of plasma proteins like immunoglobulins, is more typical of more severe or chronic glomerular pathologies. <strong>(Statement 3)</strong></p>",

These features are classic for <strong>thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>TMA</strong> is a pathological process characterized by <strong>thrombosis in small vessels</strong>, leading to <strong>organ ischemia</strong>, <strong>microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)</strong>, and <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong>. In the <strong>postpartum setting</strong>, one must strongly consider <strong>atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)</strong>, a complement-mediated form of TMA. The <strong>absence of preeclampsia</strong>, the <strong>timing (5 weeks postpartum)</strong>, and <strong>severe renal impairment with MAHA and thrombocytopenia but normal clotting</strong> support this diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (Option A):</strong> DIC presents with <strong>thrombocytopenia and elevated LDH</strong>, but it is associated with <strong>abnormal coagulation studies</strong> (prolonged PT, aPTT, low fibrinogen), which are <strong>normal in this case</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Malignant hypertension (Option B):</strong> This can cause acute kidney injury and microangiopathic hemolysis; however, it typically doesn't cause significant <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong> or <strong>marked hemolysis</strong> to the degree seen here. Also, in TMA, hypertension is often <strong>secondary</strong> rather than the primary pathology.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-eclampsia (Option C):</strong> Pre-eclampsia occurs <strong>during pregnancy</strong>, not <strong>5 weeks postpartum</strong>. Although HELLP syndrome (a variant) shares some features, it is also typically a <strong>peripartum</strong> complication, not this delayed.</p>",
