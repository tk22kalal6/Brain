Examples include senna, cascara, aloe vera, rhubarb, frangula, and other herbal remedies.</li>\r\n<li>These compounds pass undigested to the colon, are converted by bacteria to active forms, induce apoptosis of the epithelial cells, and ultimately result in pigment deposition in macrophages.</li>\r\n<li>The condition typically emerges within 4-12 months of regular laxative use, and is extremely common in long-term users (e.g. 75-95% prevalence).</li>\r\n<li>Less commonly, similar pigmentation has been observed with chronic diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), NSAID use, or vitamin E deficiency-though these are rare causes. <strong>(Other options ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>",
