This allows red blood cell breakdown products to accumulate, <strong>reducing false-negative results from early sampling.</strong></li>\n<li>The CSF specimen should be examined by<strong> spectrophotometry</strong> for the presence of <strong>xanthochromia</strong> due to the presence of oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin.</li>\n<li>Lysis of the red blood cells and subsequent conversion of haemoglobin to bilirubin stains the spinal fluid yellow within 6-12 h. This xanthochromic spinal fluid peaks in intensity at 48 h and lasts for 1- 4 weeks, depending on the amount of subarachnoid blood.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Start ergotamine (Option A):</strong> Ergotamine treats migraine and is contraindicated in suspected haemorrhage.</p>\n<p><strong>MRI of the brain (Option B): </strong>MRI lacks the rapid sensitivity of CT in acute SAH and isn't indicated when CT is normal, but suspicion remains.</p>\n<p><strong>Perform a lumbar puncture immediately (Option C): </strong>Sampling too early may miss xanthochromia before haemoglobin breakdown, yielding false negatives.</p>",

They also need specialist assessment and investigation within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. Secondary prevention measures should be introduced as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, with consideration of individual risk factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The ABCD scoring system uses:</strong></p>\n<p>Age &gt; or equal to 60 (1)</p>\n<p>BP &gt; or equal to 140/90mmHg at initial evaluation (1)</p>\n<p>Clinical features (unilateral weakness 2, isolated speech disturbance 1, other 0)</p>\n<p>Duration of symptoms (&gt; or equal to 60 minutes, 10-59 minutes, &lt;10 minutes)</p>\n<p>Diabetes mellitus (1)</p>\n<p>Although you cannot calculate the ABCD score with the information given in this question, aspirin remains the most appropriate answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Carotid Endarterectomy: (Option B)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carotid endarterectomy has been established as an effective treatment for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients who are shown to have carotid artery stenosis. It reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death by 48% in a person with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis (&gt;70%) who has had a TIA. The peri-operative risk of disabling stroke or death is approximately 3%. Current guidelines recommend endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis, based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial which showed clear benefit. The endarterectomy should be performed as soon as the patient is fit for surgery, preferably within two weeks of a TIA.</li>\n<li>The benefit is marginal for symptomatic patients with 50-69% stenosis, but may be greater in male patients. NICE recommends these patients are also considered for endarterectomy. There is significantly less benefit for asymptomatic patients, even those with greater than 60% stenosis. Patients with less than 50% stenosis should not be considered for carotid surgery .</li>\n<li>Recurrent stenosis can occur in 1-20% of patients following endarterectomy, and re-operation is needed in 1-3% of cases. Ipsilateral strokes occur in 9% of patients following endarterectomy, and 26% of those treated with medical management alone (within 2 years).</li>\n<li>All patients with suspected non-disabling stroke or TIA who are considered as candidates for carotid endarterectomy should have carotid imaging within 1 week. If the patient has had a disabling stroke there is no real benefit in them undergoing the procedure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Modified-release <strong>dipyridamole</strong> <strong>(Option C) </strong>is indicated in combination with aspirin only once a TIA has been confirmed by a specialist. Alone, it is recommended only if aspirin is contraindicated or not tolerated.</p>\n<p><strong>Clopidogrel (Option D) </strong>is recommended in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke, rather than a TIA.</p>\n<p>Warfarin is only indicated for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or if the patient has atrial fibrillation.</p>\n<p>Please note that for this explanation, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria have been used.
