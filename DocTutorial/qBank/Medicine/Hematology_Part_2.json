The most serious risk is intracranial hemorrhage, especially in those with severely low platelet counts.</li>\n<li>Chronic ITP is an autoimmune condition characterized by the destruction of platelets due to autoantibodies, most commonly of the IgG type.</li>\n<li>These antibodies target platelet membrane glycoproteins (mainly IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX), leading to opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages.</li>\n<li>It may occur without an identifiable trigger (primary) or secondary to <strong>systemic lupus erythematosus</strong>, HIV, or B-cell malignancies like CLL.</li>\n<li>The antibodies bind to platelets in the circulation and are recognized by Fc receptors on phagocytes, <strong>promoting platelet clearance</strong>, especially in the spleen.</li>\n<li><strong>Splenectomy </strong>often improves platelet counts by removing the site of destruction and a source of antibody production.</li>\n<li>It typically affects adult women under 40, with a 3:1 female-to-male ratio. The disease develops gradually and is marked by mucocutaneous bleeding such as petechiae, ecchymoses, easy bruising, epistaxis, gum bleeding, melena, hematuria, or heavy menstrual bleeding.</li>\n<li>Serious bleeding like intracerebral hemorrhage is rare. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are usually absent in primary ITP and suggest alternative diagnoses.</li>\n<li>Isolated thrombocytopenia is seen with <strong>normal PT and PTT</strong>. Bone marrow may show increased or normal megakaryocytes, and the presence of<strong> large platelets</strong> in peripheral smear is considered supportive. Platelet autoantibody tests lack reliability and are not routinely used.

It affects <strong>both sexes equally</strong>, can occur at any age but often arises in young adults, and is not inherited.</li>\n<li>Patients may report<strong> passing dark or blood-stained urine</strong>, typically in the morning, though this is not always noticed.</li>\n<li>Many present with nonspecific signs of anemia, which may be discovered incidentally. Cytopenias such as <strong>neutropenia</strong> and<strong> thrombocytopenia</strong> may indicate marrow involvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Abdominal pain</strong> may occur due to thrombosis, and hepatic vein thrombosis may result in Budd-Chiari syndrome.</li>\n<li>Thrombosis is a major cause of death in PNH.</li>\n<li>Bone marrow findings often reveal <strong>erythroid hyperplasia</strong>, but in some cases may be hypocellular or aplastic. Laboratory features include normocytic or macrocytic anemia, <strong>elevated LDH</strong>, low haptoglobin, and hemoglobinuria.</li>\n<li>The disorder arises from a somatic mutation in the<strong> PIGA </strong>gene affecting the GPI anchor, which results in deficient expression of surface proteins like<strong> CD55 </strong>and <strong>CD59 </strong>that normally protect red cells from complement.</li>\n<li>This leads to uncontrolled <strong>complement-mediated hemolysis</strong>. The absence of CD59 particularly contributes to <strong>formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC)</strong>, causing red cell lysis.</li>\n<li>Platelet activation due to CD59 deficiency also contributes to thrombosis.</li>\n<li><strong>Flow cytometry</strong> is the <strong>diagnostic gold standard</strong>, identifying the absence of GPI-anchored proteins on granulocytes and red cells. A PNH diagnosis requires at least 5% of red cells and 20% of granulocytes lacking these proteins.</li>\n<li>Historically, treatment options were limited to bone marrow transplantation or supportive care. Introduction of <strong>eculizumab</strong>, a monoclonal antibody against C5, has significantly improved outcomes by reducing hemolysis and thrombosis. Bone marrow transplantation is still considered for young patients or those with marrow failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanations of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Blood cultures (Option A): </strong>Blood cultures would identify septicemia which can contribute to intravascular hemolysis. The clinical features in the given scenario does not suggest sepsis.</p>\n<p><strong>Gene analysis for G6PD deficiency (Option C): </strong>Mutations in the 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene lead to G6PD deficiency, which can lead to hemolysis with certain drugs, fava beans, and other <strong>oxidative agents</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Donath-Landsteiner antibody (Option D): Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria</strong> is a rare type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) that mainly affects<strong> children </strong>and is often preceded by a viral infection. It is usually a self-limiting condition and is identified by the presence of the Donath-Landsteiner antibody, which typically targets the P antigen on red cells.</p>",
