Normal serum iron levels range from 9-27 &micro;mol/L (50-150 &micro;g/dL), and TIBC typically falls between 54-64 &micro;mol/L (300-360 &micro;g/dL), giving a normal transferrin saturation range of <strong>25-50%.</strong> This saturation <strong>can vary diurnally</strong>.</li>\n<li>Serum ferritin is a marker of <strong>total body iron stores</strong>. In adult males, levels around 100 &micro;g/L reflect iron reserves of about 1 g, while premenopausal females typically have lower levels corresponding to ~300 mg of stored iron. Levels between 10 - 15 &micro;g/L indicate iron depletion.</li>\n<li>Ferritin, being an <strong>acute-phase reactant</strong>, can <strong>rise with inflammation</strong> or infection, sometimes exceeding 200 &micro;g/L, which generally suggests adequate or elevated iron stores despite potential functional iron deficiency.</li>\n</ul>",
