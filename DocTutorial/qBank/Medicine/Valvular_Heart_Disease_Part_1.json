      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>During <strong>pregnancy</strong>, the <strong>cardiac output increases by 30-50%</strong> due to increased <strong>plasma volume</strong> and <strong>heart rate</strong>, beginning as early as the <strong>second month</strong> and peaking around <strong>30 weeks</strong> of gestation.</li>\n<li>Simultaneously, there is a <strong>significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance</strong> due to the vasodilatory effects of progesterone and other factors.</li>\n<li>In <strong>aortic regurgitation (AR)</strong>, the <strong>regurgitant volume depends on systemic vascular resistance</strong>.</li>\n<li>As vascular resistance drops during pregnancy, <strong>less blood flows back into the left ventricle</strong>, resulting in <strong>reduced murmur intensity</strong>.</li>\n<li>This same mechanism applies to <strong>mitral regurgitation (MR)</strong> and <strong>mitral valve prolapse (MVP)</strong>, where murmurs may remain unchanged or even become softer during pregnancy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aortic stenosis (Option A):</strong> The murmur of AS becomes <strong>louder</strong> during pregnancy due to increased stroke volume and cardiac output across a fixed, narrowed valve.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitral stenosis (Option C):</strong> This murmur also becomes <strong>more prominent</strong> during pregnancy and is associated with a risk of <strong>pulmonary edema</strong>, especially during labor or fluid overload.</p>\n<p><strong>Coarctation of aorta (Option D):</strong> This condition also worsens due to <strong>increased cardiac output</strong> and can lead to <strong>hypertensive complications</strong>.

When the leaflets are still mobile, they remain wide open until the end of diastole and then close abruptly, producing a loud sound.</li>\n<li>The <strong>opening snap (OS)</strong> is an early diastolic sound caused by the <strong>sudden tensing of the valve apparatus</strong> as it opens under elevated left atrial pressure. This can only happen if the valve is <strong>flexible</strong> and not calcified.</li>\n<li>The <strong>mid-diastolic murmur</strong> results from <strong>turbulent flow across the stenotic mitral valve</strong>, best heard at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope in the left lateral position.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>These findings not only confirm the diagnosis but also have therapeutic implications.

As a result, <strong>S1 becomes soft</strong>, and the <strong>opening snap is absent or delayed</strong> due to reduced mobility. These patients are <strong>less suitable for PBMV</strong> and may require surgical valve replacement.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation (Option B):</strong> AF leads to <strong>irregularly irregular rhythm</strong> and <strong>variable S1 intensity</strong>, making the auscultatory findings less consistent. A classic loud S1 and opening snap are typically <strong>not heard</strong> in persistent AF.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitral stenosis with pulmonary hypertension (Option D):</strong> Pulmonary hypertension produces a <strong>loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound (P2)</strong> but does <strong>not affect the mitral S1</strong> or cause an opening snap. It often occurs in advanced mitral stenosis but is <strong>not characterized</strong> by the auscultatory findings in this case.</p>",
