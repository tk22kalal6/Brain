Asymptomatic colonisation is common, and transmission occurs through respiratory droplets.</li>\n<li>Pathogenesis: When it invades the bloodstream, the endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide) induces massive cytokine release, endothelial damage, DIC, and adrenal haemorrhage, leading to Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Thus, statements 1 (encapsulated) and 4 (nasopharynx as habitat) are both true.</li>\n<li>It is kidney-shaped: Incorrect.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation :</strong></p>\n<p>The organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It evades the host immune system primarily through pili-mediated attachment and antigenic variation, allowing persistence and repeated infections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus responsible for the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea.</li>\n<li>A hallmark of its pathogenesis is its ability to persist in the host despite an immune response, which it achieves through multiple virulence factors, the most important being:\n<ul>\n<li>Type IV pili (fimbriae):\n<ul>\n<li>These allow initial adhesion to the mucosal epithelium, essential for colonization of the urethra, cervix, rectum, or pharynx.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Antigenic variation of pili and outer membrane proteins (e.g., Opa proteins):\n<ul>\n<li>These structures undergo phase and antigenic variation, which prevents effective immune memory formation. Hence, reinfection is common despite prior exposure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This immune evasion is why no effective long-term immunity develops, and why vaccine development has been extremely difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Capsule production (Option A):</strong> Unlike Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae does not produce a polysaccharide capsule, making this an incorrect option.</p>\n<p><strong>Spore formation (Option C):</strong> N. gonorrhoeae is a non-spore-forming bacterium; spore formation is seen in organisms like Clostridium or Bacillus species.</p>\n<p><strong>Exotoxin production (Option D): N</strong>. gonorrhoeae does not produce classical exotoxins. Its pathogenic effects are primarily due to lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-induced inflammation and immune evasion, not secreted toxins.</p>",
