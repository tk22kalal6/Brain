These larvae <strong>actively penetrate the intact skin</strong>of anyone in the water. In the given clinical scenario the person closes his nose and mouth with fingers which is ineffective against the cercariae of schistosoma and thus he should get himself screened if he develops any of the symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong>Schistosoma haematobium causes Urogenital Schistosomiasis</strong>(formerly called Bilharzia).</li>\n<li>The adult worms live in the <strong>venous plexus around the bladder and urinary tract</strong>.

Infection is highly unlikely without swallowing the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Naegleria fowleri (Option C): </strong>It causes Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). This is a rapidly fatal infection of the brain. The amoeba enters via the nose and infects the brain tissue. Symptoms start with severe headache, fever, and vomiting, and rapidly progress to stiff neck, seizures, and coma.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Koch's postulate</strong> in question implies that a single, specific microbial agent consistently causes a specific disease. <strong>Trypanosomes</strong>, specifically Trypanosoma brucei species responsible for African Sleeping Sickness, violate this principle through <strong>antigenic variation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Trypanosoma brucei evades host immunity through <strong>variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs)</strong>, also called <strong>variant-specific surface antigens (VSSAs)</strong>. The parasite's surface is covered by a dense VSG coat, which elicits a strong antibody response that clears most parasites. However, a small subpopulation (&asymp;1 in 10⁶) spontaneously switches to a different VSG gene, producing a new surface antigen. The existing antibodies cannot recognize this new variant, allowing the parasite population to expand and cause another wave of parasitemia.</p>\n<p>This cycle of <strong>antigenic switching</strong> explains the <strong>recurrent fever spikes followed by apyrexia</strong> seen in African trypanosomiasis. Importantly, if parasites from an early infection wave are reintroduced into the same host, they would be neutralized immediately by pre-formed antibodies. The relapsing illness depends on the <strong>sequential emergence of novel VSG variants</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Masking of antigen (Option A)</strong> : Masking of antigen is used by schistosomes as an immune evasion mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Intracellular habitat (Option B)</strong> : Trypanosomes are primarily <strong>extracellular</strong> pathogens, found in the blood, lymph, and later cerebrospinal fluid. They do not have a significant intracellular phase like Leishmaniaor Plasmodium.</p>\n<p><strong>Resistance to phagocytosis (Option D)</strong> :the VSG coat may contribute to resisting certain host defenses, the fundamental reason for disobeying Koch's postulate is the change in the antigenic identity, not a general resistance to a single immune mechanism like phagocytosis. Leishmania inhibits phagocytosis.</p>",
