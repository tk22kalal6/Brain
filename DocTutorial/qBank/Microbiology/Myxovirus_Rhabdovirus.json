      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pigs </strong>serve as the most common mixing vessel for the emergence of new influenza virus strains.</li>\n<li>The three influenza types show distinct epidemiologic behavior: type C causes only mild, isolated respiratory illness and doesn't lead to epidemics; type B can occasionally trigger outbreaks, but it is <strong>type A</strong> that is responsible for widespread, global pandemics.</li>\n<li>Genetic studies of influenza A viruses from various regions support the idea that all mammalian influenza strains originate from an <strong>avian source</strong>.</li>\n<li>Among the 18 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes found in birds, only a few have crossed into mammals. For example, H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, and H9 are seen in humans, H1, H2, and H3 in pigs, and H3, H7 in horses.</li>\n<li>Similarly, only 2 of the 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes found in birds, N1 and N2, occur in humans.</li>\n<li>Avian influenza shows a wide clinical spectrum, from no symptoms to fatal disease in poultry like chickens and turkeys. In contrast, ducks often carry the virus without illness. In ducks, the virus replicates in <strong>intestinal cells </strong>and is excreted in feces into water, where it can remain infectious for long periods, especially at cooler temperatures.</li>\n<li>This suggests avian influenza may be <strong>transmitted via water</strong>, spreading from wild birds to domestic animals such as pigs.</li>\n<li>All known human pandemic influenza strains have arisen from genetic mixing (reassortment) between animal and human influenza viruses.</li>\n<li>Research indicates that pigs act as hosts for this reassortment because they have <strong>cellular receptors for both avian and human influenza strains</strong>.</li>\n<li>In terms of transmission, school-aged children are key carriers, with crowded school environments promoting airborne spread and facilitating household introduction of the virus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Birds (Option A): </strong>Birds (especially aquatic birds) are the <strong>primary reservoir</strong> of influenza A viruses. However, birds alone are not the usual mixing vessel; reassortment requires a host like pigs that can be infected by both bird and human strains.</p>\n<p><strong>Humans (Option B): </strong>Humans can be infected by influenza but generally <strong>lack dual receptor types</strong> to efficiently allow reassortment. Thus, they are not the major mixing vessel.</p>",

Drift requires multiple mutations to become epidemiologically significant.</li>\n<li>Influenza replication is rapid: host cell protein synthesis is halted by 3 hours post-infection, and new virions are released by 8-10 hours.</li>\n<li>Replication begins with HA-mediated attachment to <strong>sialic acid</strong>, followed by endocytosis and uncoating aided by low pH and M2 protein ion channels.</li>\n<li>Transcription occurs in the <strong>nucleus</strong>, where viral polymerase uses capped host primers to initiate synthesis.
