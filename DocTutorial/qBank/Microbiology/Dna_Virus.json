Patients, specifically children, with<strong> sickle cell disease</strong> or sickle cell trait are exceedingly more susceptible to Salmonella infections and particularly to Salmonella bacteremia and its complications such as <strong>osteomyelitis</strong> when compared to people with normal hemoglobin.</p>\n<p><strong>Haemophilus influenza (Option B): </strong>Individuals with sickle cell disease face heightened vulnerability to infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, largely due to impaired splenic function.Additionally, abnormalities in the alternative complement pathway contribute to poor bacterial opsonization. As a result, infections such as <strong>septicemia</strong> and <strong>meningitis </strong>caused by <strong>Streptococcus pneumoniae</strong> and<strong> Haemophilus influenzae</strong> are frequently observed but It does not lead to worsening anemia</p>\n<p><strong>Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option D): </strong>Patients with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk of pneumococcal infections but it does not lead to aplastic crisis.</p>",

Skin involvement typically affects moist, warm <strong>intertriginous areas</strong> like the axillae and groin, appearing red, moist, and sometimes vesicular.</p>\n<p><strong>Scrofula (Option D): </strong>Lymph node tuberculosis typically manifests as non-tender enlargement of lymph nodes, most frequently affecting the<strong> posterior cervical </strong>and supraclavicular regions, a presentation traditionally known as scrofula.</p>",

It may cause prolonged kidney infection without major harm and often involves the salivary glands.</li>\n<li>Cell-mediated immunity is suppressed during primary infection, contributing to <strong>viral persistence </strong>and delayed immune recovery.</li>\n<li>In immunosuppressed individuals, CMV infections are more severe and may lead to pneumonia, hepatitis, <strong>colitis,</strong> or disseminated disease. These individuals are at risk for reactivation of latent virus, and CMV can cause significant morbidity and mortality.</li>\n<li>Bone marrow and <strong>solid organ transplant recipients</strong> are particularly vulnerable, and CMV is a common cause of virus-associated leukopenia and rejection-related complications.</li>\n<li>In immunocompromised individuals, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection which is termed &ldquo;<strong>CMV syndrome</strong>&rdquo; typically begins with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, fever, general malaise, appetite loss, night sweats, and joint or muscle aches.</li>\n<li>Respiratory symptoms such as rapid breathing, low oxygen levels, and a dry cough suggest pulmonary disease.</li>\n<li>CMV can also affect the <strong>gastrointestinal tract</strong>, particularly in immunocompromised patients, where the involvement can range from localized to widespread. Among organ transplant recipients, <strong>colitis</strong> is the most frequently encountered manifestation. Additionally, CMV may cause ulcerations in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or colon, which can potentially lead to <strong>bleeding</strong> or <strong>perforation</strong>.</li>\n<li>CMV retinitis commonly presents with <strong>reduced vision</strong> due to macular involvement or floaters from vitritis, initially affecting one eye but progressing to both in about half of untreated cases.</li>\n<li>Retinitis appears as peripheral dense white retinal infiltrates with<strong> flame-shaped hemorrhages </strong>leading to a pizza pie appearance, extending along vascular arcades, with granular, non-central lesions being less aggressive (indolent) and central lesions being more fulminant and visually impairing.</li>\n<li>Congenital CMV infection can lead to developmental delays, or mental retardation. Infection can occur transplacentally, during delivery, or postnatally via breast milk.</li>\n<li>Infants infected in utero during<strong> primary maternal infection</strong> are at higher risk of symptomatic disease. While most neonatal infections are subclinical, some are chronic with persistent viral shedding.</li>\n<li>Intrauterine CMV can lead to serious complications like <strong>microcephaly</strong>, <strong>hepatosplenomegaly</strong>, retinitis,<strong> periventricular calcification</strong>, and <strong>sensorineural deafness</strong>.</li>\n<li>CMV causes a mild, mononucleosis-like illness in immunocompetent children and adults.</li>\n<li>Diagnosis of CMV involves detection of viral DNA by PCR, viral culture in fibroblasts, or serology for IgM and IgG.

While some infected individuals remain asymptomatic, others may present with yellow, <strong>frothy vaginal discharge</strong>, vulvovaginal irritation, discomfort during urination, and painful intercourse.

Despite various treatment attempts no consistently effective therapy has been established.</li>\n<li>Management often focuses on restoring immune function, promptly discontinuing immunosuppressants, and close monitoring for IRIS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Astrovirus (Option A): </strong>Astroviruses cause <strong>diarrheal disease</strong> and are excreted in large amounts in the stool. Transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route through contaminated food or water, person-to-person contact, or contact with contaminated surfaces. They are particularly recognized as pathogens in infants, children, elderly institutionalized individuals, and immunocompromised patients, and can be shed for prolonged periods in the latter group.</p>\n<p><strong>Papillomavirus (Option B): </strong>HPV belongs to the Papillomavirus family and can infect both cutaneous and mucosal surfaces, resulting in a range of <strong>wart</strong> types including skin, plantar, flat, and anogenital warts, along with <strong>laryngeal papillomas</strong>. They are also implicated in the development of multiple cancers such as <strong>cervical</strong>, vulvar, penile, anal, and some head and neck malignancies.</p>\n<p><strong>Parvovirus (Option D): </strong>Parvovirus B19 of the family parvoviridae is linked to several clinical conditions. In children and sometimes adults, it causes <strong>erythema infectiosum</strong> (fifth disease), which typically presents with a characteristic \"slapped-cheek\" rash and may be accompanied by joint pain. Individuals with preexisting hemolytic disorders like sickle cell disease may experience a <strong>transient aplastic crisis</strong>. In immunocompromised individuals, the virus can lead to persistent infections resulting in chronic anemia or pure red cell aplasia. Maternal infection may also transmit the virus to the fetus, potentially causing <strong>hydrops fetalis </strong>due to fetal anemia.</p>",
