Infected rodents remain lifelong carriers without illness, transmitting the virus horizontally among themselves.</li>\n<li>Human infection occurs via <strong>inhalation of aerosol</strong>s from rodent urine, feces, or saliva, with disease presence influenced by the geographic distribution of rodent reservoirs.</li>\n<li>HFRS is an acute infection causing<strong> interstitial nephritis</strong>, which can progress to acute renal insufficiency or renal failure in severe cases along with hemorrhagic tendencies.</li>\n<li>Laboratory rats have been linked to Hantaan outbreaks in scientific institutes and occupational exposure to rats can also cause infection. HFRS management is supportive, with prevention focusing on rodent control and avoiding contact with rodent excreta.</li>\n<li>HPS primarily manifests as adult respiratory distress syndrome and has mortality rates of 30% or higher, beginning with fever, headache, and myalgia, followed by rapidly developing<strong> pulmonary edema </strong>and respiratory failure, without hemorrhagic signs.</li>\n<li>Hantaviral antigens are found in endothelial cells and macrophages of the lungs, heart, spleen, and lymph nodes. The disease mechanism involves vascular endothelium damage.</li>\n<li>Diagnosis uses <strong>RT-PCR</strong> for viral nucleic acid, immunohistochemistry for viral antigens, or ELISA for specific IgM antibodies. A fourfold IgG titer rise between acute and convalescent sera is also diagnostic. Containment is challenging due to biosafety requirements.</li>\n<li>Treatment for HPS focuses on maintaining oxygenation and supporting hemodynamic function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>West Nile virus (Option A): </strong>West Nile virus infection is an <strong>arboviral encephalitis</strong> which commonly presents as a febrile illness with myalgia, sometimes accompanied by a maculopapular rash on the trunk, lymphadenopathy, retroorbital pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and arthralgia.</p>\n<p><strong>Leptospira (Option C): </strong>Leptospirosis can range from mild, flu-like illness with fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, abdominal discomfort, conjunctival suffusion, and sometimes aseptic meningitis, to severe disease known as <strong>Weil's syndrome</strong> marked by hemorrhage, jaundice, and acute kidney injury. Spread happens via breaks in the skin or through mucous membranes, particularly those of the eyes and mouth.</p>\n<p><strong>Brucella melitensis (Option D): </strong>Brucellosis is a bacterial disease of animals that spreads to humans either directly or indirectly, most often from <strong>infected domesticated ruminants </strong>and pigs. It typically presents with fever, often accompanied by profuse night sweats, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and chills, and may follow an undulating pattern with musculoskeletal symptoms in about half of patients.</p>",
