      "solution": "<ul>\n<li>Superantigens (SAgs) are a class of antigens that result in excessive activation of the immune system. Specifically it causes non-specific activation of T-cells resulting in polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release.</li>\n<li>Superantigens do not get processed by an antigen- presenting cell (APC).</li>\n<li>They attach directly to the MHC-II a1 domain and &amp;beta variable chain of TCR.</li>\n<li>There are two types of super-antigens: (i) endogenous, which are intracellular (e.g., virus) and (ii) exogenous, which extracellular (e.g., bacteria).</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>Microbial superantigens are medium-sized proteins (MW 22-29 kDa) characterised by high resistance to proteases.</p>\n<p>They initiate the release of (IL- 2), which results in massive proliferation of T lymphocytes. This ultimately leads to further release of a variety of cytokines which have profound effect on the immune system.</p>\n<p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height: auto; display: block; vertical-align: middle; border: 0;\" src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20250201b4537725-499b-4e1e-ac5c-ba006e059611.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Option (B): Produced by antigen-presenting cells to enhance presentation capabilities - They are protein molecules (e.g., staphylococcal enterotoxins) that activate very large numbers of T lymphocytes irrespective of their antigenic specificity.
