With only a few blood types, many individuals share the same blood type, making it a test that can only <em>exclude</em> paternity, not definitively prove it. For example, if the child has blood type A and the mother has blood type O, the father must have an A allele.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scenario describes a skin graft between individuals who are HLA-identical but unrelated. While HLA matching prevents hyperacute and acute rejection mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) differences, it does not account for the numerous mismatches in <strong>minor histocompatibility antigens</strong>.</li>\n<li>These minor differences are still recognized by the recipient's immune system over time, leading to a slow, progressive rejection process.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic rejection </strong>is the most likely outcome. It is a long-term process that occurs months to years after transplantation and is mediated by both T cells and antibodies reacting to these minor histocompatibility antigens. The constant, low-grade immune attack leads to fibrosis and narrowing of the blood vessels within the graft, eventually causing graft failure. Even with identical major histocompatibility genes, immunosuppressive therapy is necessary to prevent this long-term rejection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acute rejection (Option A):</strong> Acute rejection typically occurs days to weeks after transplantation and is primarily mediated by T cells recognizing mismatched major histocompatibility antigens. This is unlikely in an HLA-identical scenario.</p>\n<p><strong>Graft-versus-host disease (Option C):</strong> This occurs when immunocompetent T cells from the donor attack the recipient's tissues. It is most commonly seen in bone marrow transplants, which contain a high number of immunocompetent cells, and is not a typical response for a skin graft.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyperacute rejection (Option D):</strong> This is an immediate form of rejection that occurs within minutes to hours of transplantation. It is mediated by pre-existing antibodies in the recipient that recognize and react to donor antigens (a Type II hypersensitivity reaction). This is prevented by proper HLA and blood type cross-matching, making it unlikely in an HLA-identical scenario.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Even with a perfect <strong>HLA match between unrelated individuals</strong>, genetic differences in <strong>minor histocompatibility antigens</strong> will eventually trigger a slow, progressive immune response, making <strong>chronic rejection</strong> the most likely outcome without therapeutic intervention.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The statement \"Exert their effects by activating T-cells\" is the characteristic that does not distinguish superantigens from conventional antigens. Both superantigens and conventional antigens activate T-cells, but they do so through different mechanisms and to a different degree. Conventional antigens require specific binding and antigen processing to activate a small fraction of T-cells, while superantigens bypass this process to activate a much larger, polyclonal T-cell population.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250911dcda20cb-6d14-4729-99c3-3bd26f6abbd7.jpg\">\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Binding outside the peptide-antigen binding groove of MHC-II receptor (Option A):</strong> This is a true characteristic of superantigens, which distinguishes them from conventional antigens that are processed and presented within the groove.</p>\n<p><strong>Binding to the conserved V$\\beta$ region of the T cell receptor (Option B):</strong> This is a unique feature of superantigens, which bypass the need for a specific antigen-TCR interaction by binding to a more conserved region.</p>\n<p><strong>Not requiring costimulatory molecules (Option C):</strong> This is a key difference, as conventional T-cell activation typically requires both the MHC-TCR interaction and a costimulatory signal, while superantigens do not.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Both <strong>superantigens</strong> and <strong>conventional antigens</strong> ultimately activate T-cells. However, superantigens are distinguished by their ability to <strong>bind outside the MHC-II groove</strong>, interact with the <strong>conserved V beta region</strong> of the T-cell receptor, and <strong>do not require costimulatory molecules</strong> to elicit a massive, non-specific T-cell response.</p>",
