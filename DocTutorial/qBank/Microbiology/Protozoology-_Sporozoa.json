      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Plasmodium vivax shows a marked preference for infecting <strong>young red blood cells (reticulocytes)</strong>, owing to specific receptors on their surface that facilitate invasion. This selective targeting explains why P. vivax infections are generally less severe than those caused by P. falciparum, though relapses can occur due to <strong>hypnozoites</strong> persisting in the liver.</p>\n<p>After invasion, P. vivax merozoites develop into <strong>early trophozoites (ring forms)</strong> about 2.5-3 &micro;m in diameter, typically located centrally within the RBC. As they mature into <strong>late trophozoites</strong> (6-7 &micro;m), the infected RBC must enlarge to accommodate the growing parasite. Consequently, RBCs become <strong>pale, enlarged, and irregular</strong>, and show characteristic <strong>Sch&uuml;ffner's dots (stippling)</strong> on microscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Plasmodium falciparum(Option A):</strong>Plasmodium falciparum preferentially infects <strong>mature red blood cells (RBCs)</strong>. While P. falciparum can infect a wide range of red blood cells, it primarily targets <strong>older RBCs</strong> (those in the peripheral blood). Unlike ;P. vivax, which prefers younger cells, P. falciparum can infect any stage of RBC, but does not have a strict preference for young RBCs. It is known to cause the most severe form of malaria, often resulting in complications like cerebral malaria due to the formation of rosettes and sequestration of infected RBCs in small capillaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Plasmodium malariae(Option C):</strong>Plasmodium malariae does not have a strong preference for young or old red blood cells. It infects <strong>mature red blood cells</strong>, particularly those that are relatively old. P. malariae tends to cause a <strong>chronic infection</strong> that can last for many years, even decades, with a relatively low parasitic burden. The infection is usually less severe than P. falciparum, though it can lead to complications like nephrotic syndrome due to the long-term presence of the parasite in the bloodstream.</p>",
