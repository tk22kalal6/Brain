This mature cyst, which contains four nuclei, is the stage that is passed in the feces of an infected person and is capable of surviving in the environment.</li>\n<li>When a human ingests these mature cysts (typically through contaminated food or water), they pass through the stomach unharmed. In the small intestine, they excyst (break open) to release the active, invasive <strong>trophozoites</strong>, which then colonize the large intestine and cause disease. Therefore, the form responsible for initiating the infection is the quadrinucleate cyst.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V2NEETPGMCQ/202404153e553478-02af-4c88-b954-a1e56a9a0338.jpg\">\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202501212f30efc6-b890-47da-a3bd-04346a7fb772.jpg\">\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trophozoite (Option A):</strong> The trophozoite is the <strong>pathogenic, tissue-invasive form</strong> responsible for the actual symptoms (diarrhea, dysentery, tissue damage). However, it is <strong>not the infective form</strong>. Trophozoites are fragile and are destroyed by gastric acid if ingested; they cannot survive outside the host to transmit the infection.</li>\n<li><strong>Uninucleate cyst and Binucleate cyst (Option B and C):</strong> These are <strong>immature cyst stages</strong>. As a cyst matures in the intestine, it undergoes nuclear division, progressing from one nucleus to two, and finally to four. A uninucleate or binucleate cyst is not yet mature. If passed in stool, it may not be immediately infective, as it needs to mature further in the environment to become a quadrinucleate cyst. The definitive, environmentally stable, and transmissible infective form is the quadrinucleate cyst.</li>\n</ul>",
