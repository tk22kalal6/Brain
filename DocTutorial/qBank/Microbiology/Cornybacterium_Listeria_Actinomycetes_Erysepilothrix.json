      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Elek's gel precipitation </strong>is the conventional method to detect diphtheria toxin in vitro.</li>\n<li>A modified test (recommended by WHO's Diphtheria Reference Unit) is as follows: A filter paper disc impregnated with diphtheria antitoxin (10 IU/mL) is placed on a horse serum agar plate.</li>\n<li>At least 10 colonies are spot-inoculated 7-9 mm away from the disc and incubated for 48 hours.</li>\n<li>The antitoxin diffuses out of the disc and forms precipitin bands between the disc and the bacterial growth at the point where it meets the diphtheria toxin (diffusing out of the organisms).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nagler's reaction (Option A): </strong>The test is used primarily to <strong>detect the production of lecithinase</strong> by Clostridium perfringens, which is a <strong>key virulence factor</strong> responsible for tissue necrosis in conditions such as gas gangrene.</p>\n<p><strong>Principle:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The test involves the use of <strong>egg yolk agar</strong>(which contains lecithin).</li>\n<li>When the bacteria produce <strong>lecithinase</strong>, the enzyme <strong>hydrolyses lecithin</strong>, causing a clear zone around the bacterial growth due to the breakdown of the lecithin in the agar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Nagler's reaction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>control plate</strong>contains egg yolk without antitoxin.</li>\n<li>The <strong>test plate</strong>contains egg yolk with a specific <strong>antitoxin</strong> that neutralises lecithinase production.</li>\n<li><strong>A clear zone</strong>around the bacterial growth in the <strong>test plate</strong> indicates that <em> perfringens</em> has produced lecithinase.<br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250911e86ab741-04be-490a-b8a2-517411c42601.png\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Satelitism Test (Option C): </strong>Haemophilus influenzae colonies show satellitism when grown near S. aureus. This demonstrates the dependence of H. influenzae on the V factor, which is available in high concentrations near staphylococcal growth. Another differentiating test is growth around discs incorporated with X, V and XV factors. This helps in differentiating the species of Haemophilus.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250911a97a9bcb-d55a-4b38-ade7-3c8358697406.png\">\n<p><strong>CAMP Test (Option D):</strong> CAMP positive: CAMP factor (named after the discoverers: Christie, Atkins-Munch-Petersen) is a phospholipase produced by GBS that causes synergistic hemolysis with beta hemolysin produced by S. aureus. When GBS is streaked on a blood agar plate perpendicular to S. aureus, an enhanced arrowhead-shaped hemolysis is produced at their junction, pointing towards the GBS streak line.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250911e0abe9ba-4f2b-496c-828f-b263af45823d.png\">",
