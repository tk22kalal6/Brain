If T cell numbers decrease due to thymectomy, this would likely lead to a <em>decreased</em> germinal center size, not an increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased antibody production by plasma cells (Option C):</strong> With a decrease in T cells, particularly helper T cells, there would be reduced stimulation of B cells. This would consequently lead to <em>decreased</em> antibody production rather than an increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased bone marrow production of lymphocytes (Option D):</strong> This is not a direct result of thymectomy. The bone marrow produces lymphocytes independently of the thymus, and thymectomy primarily impacts the maturation and peripheral distribution of T cells, not their bone marrow production.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neonatal thymectomy impairs T-lymphocyte production</strong>, leading to a <strong>decreased size of T-cell rich areas</strong>, specifically the <strong>paracortical areas of lymph nodes</strong>.</p>",

The <strong>spleen is the largest secondary lymphoid organ</strong> and plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly against bloodborne antigens, and acts as a systemic filter for trapping circulating foreign particles.</li>\n<li><strong>Most common infections after splenectomy result from capsulated bacteria</strong>. The spleen is essential for clearing encapsulated bacteria from the bloodstream. Therefore, patients who have undergone splenectomy are at significantly increased risk of severe infections, especially <strong>pneumococcal infection caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></strong>, which is an encapsulated organism.

While <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (a Gram-positive bacterium) is a common cause of post-splenectomy infections, it is specifically its <em>capsule</em> that makes it a significant threat in asplenic individuals, rather than just its Gram staining property.</p>\n<p><strong>Gram Negative bacteria (Option D):</strong> This is also a broad category. While some Gram-negative bacteria are encapsulated (e.g., <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>) and thus pose a risk, the key factor for increased susceptibility post-splenectomy is the <em>capsule</em>, not just the Gram stain characteristic.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>spleen is crucial for clearing encapsulated bacteria</strong>, making <strong>capsulated bacteria the most common cause of severe infections after splenectomy</strong>, notably <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>C3b </strong>can act as an opsonin. Opsonins are extracellular proteins that, when bound to substances or cells, induce phagocytes to engulf those substances or cells. Opsonins act as bridging molecules, bringing the target and the phagocyte into contact and then usually activating the phagocytic receptor to induce engulfment. Other molecules that act as opsonins include C4b and C1q.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height: auto; display: block; vertical-align: middle; border: 0;\" src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V2NEETPGMCQ/2024042261d0ee7-0fa2-4ba0-be96-e410eef1148d.jpg\"></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>C3a (Option A):</strong> C3a is a chemoattractant and an anaphylatoxin, not an opsonin.</p>\n<p><strong>C5a (Option C):</strong> C5a is also a chemoattractant and an anaphylatoxin, not an opsonin.</p>\n<p><strong>C5-C9 complex (Option D):</strong> The C5-C9 complex forms the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which is an important immune effector of the complement terminal pathway, composed of complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)</strong> is controlled by genes known as <strong>HLA genes</strong>, which are located on chromosome number 6p.</li>\n<li>The <strong>HLA gene III (Class III MHC)</strong> region is responsible for coding a variety of proteins that are structurally distinct from the MHC Class I and Class II molecules.</li>\n<li>Specifically, the <strong>HLA gene III</strong> region codes for <strong>complement components like C2 and C4</strong>, as well as <strong>Heat Shock Proteins (Hsp)</strong> and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha).</li>\n<li><strong>HLA-G (Option D)</strong> is a non-classical MHC Class I molecule. As such, it is coded for by the <strong>HLA Class I region</strong> (HLA 1), not the HLA Class III region. Therefore, <strong>HLA-G</strong> is the correct answer as it is the exception.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>C2 (Option A):</strong> <strong>C2</strong> is a component of the complement system, and the HLA gene III region is known to code for complementary proteins, including <strong>C2</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>C4 (Option B):</strong> <strong>C4</strong> is another component of the complement system, and the HLA gene III region is known to code for complementary proteins, including <strong>C4</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hsp (Option C):</strong> <strong>Heat Shock Proteins (Hsp)</strong> are indeed coded for by the HLA gene III region.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>HLA Class III region codes for diverse immune-related molecules such as complement components (C2, C4) and heat shock proteins (Hsp)</strong>, which serve functions distinct from antigen presentation, whereas <strong>HLA-G is an MHC Class I molecule</strong> involved in immune tolerance.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250912-c4e78e1a-4c9b-41b5-82e7-64e9af0f2e10.png\">",
