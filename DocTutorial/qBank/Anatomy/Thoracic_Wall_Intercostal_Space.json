They function to <em>elevate</em> the upper ribs, thus increasing thoracic volume for inhalation, not depressing them for expiration.</p>\n<p><strong>The diaphragm primarily depresses the ribs, aiding in quiet expiration (Option C):</strong> This statement is incorrect. The diaphragm is the primary muscle of <strong>inspiration</strong>. Its contraction causes it to <em>descend (flatten)</em>, increasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity. Quiet expiration is largely a passive process driven by the elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall, with the diaphragm <em>relaxing and ascending</em>, not actively depressing ribs.</p>\n<p><strong>The levator costarum muscles are accessory muscles of expiration that pull the ribs downward (Option D):</strong> This statement is incorrect. The levator costarum muscles are small muscles that <strong>elevate the ribs</strong> when they contract, thus acting as accessory muscles of <strong>inspiration</strong>, not expiration. Their action helps to increase thoracic volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inspiration</strong> involves muscles that primarily <strong>elevate the ribs</strong> (e.g., external intercostals, serratus posterior superior, levator costarum, and diaphragm descent).</li>\n<li><strong>Expiration</strong> (especially forced) involves muscles that primarily <strong>depress the ribs</strong> (e.g., internal intercostals, serratus posterior inferior, and abdominal muscles).</li>\n</ul>",
