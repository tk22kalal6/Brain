It does not directly cause the absence of hypochlorous acid.</p>\n<p><strong>Deficiency of Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (Option D):</strong> G6PD deficiency impairs the generation of NADPH, which is essential for the NADPH oxidase enzyme to produce superoxide (O2-). Superoxide is then converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which MPO uses to make HOCl. So, while G6PD deficiency indirectly impacts the pathway, the direct cause of HOCl absence is MPO deficiency itself.</p>",
