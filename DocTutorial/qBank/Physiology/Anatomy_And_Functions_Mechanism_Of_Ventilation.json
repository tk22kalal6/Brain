      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The external intercostal muscles run obliquely downward and forward from rib to rib. The ribs act as pivots and are hinged at the back. When these muscles contract they elevate the ribs.</li>\n<li>Elevation of ribs increase the anteroposterior diameter by pump handle movement and transverse diameter by bucket handle movement.</li>\n<li>Normal tidal inspiration is an active process and expiration a passive one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAY:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The pump handle movement involves the upper ribs (1st to 6th), where the ribs and sternum move upward and forward, increasing the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax. This motion resembles the lifting of a pump handle.</li>\n<li>The bucket handle movement involves the lower ribs (7th to 10th), where the ribs move upward and outward, increasing the transverse diameter of the thoracic cavity. This motion is similar to lifting the handle of a bucket.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250317ed0760b1-e27b-488b-bfd8-0c091c365d92.jpg\">",
