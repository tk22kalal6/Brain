However, the question asks \"when,\" and \"birth at 28 weeks\" is also a valid and more severe criterion that necessitates screening. Both B and C are correct criteria. Given the options, 28 weeks represents an earlier and thus a more definite trigger for screening if the range is 34 weeks or less. Without further clarification on \"best,\" 28 weeks is unequivocally within the screening gestational age.</p>\n<p><strong>Neonatal seizure (Option D):</strong> Neonatal seizure is a neurological symptom and not a direct criterion for ROP screening.

CSR is known for its spontaneous resolution in many cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR) Characteristics:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> CSR involves hyper-permeable choroidal capillaries and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction, which together cause a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina at the macula.</li>\n<li><strong>Etiology/Risk Factors:</strong> Commonly seen in young males, particularly those with a stressful lifestyle, Type A personality, or a history of smoking, steroid use, OCP (oral contraceptive pill) usage, or pregnancy.</li>\n<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Patients typically present with a central scotoma or decreased central vision, often experiencing a hypermetropic shift (farsightedness).</li>\n<li><strong>Diagnosis (FFA):</strong> Fluorescein angiography (FFA) is performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ink blot pattern:</strong> This is the most commonly seen pattern, where the leak increases and enlarges (enlarging dot sign).</li>\n<li><strong>Smoke stack pattern (aka mushroom or umbrella configuration):</strong> This pattern is more specific, showing hyperfluorescence rising vertically and then spreading laterally.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Prognosis &amp; Treatment Indications:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Spontaneous resolution of fluid is common, especially if causative factors are removed.</li>\n<li><strong>Indications for treatment include:</strong> bilateral CSR, recurrent CSR, or in functionally monocular patients.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Modalities of Treatment:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-VEGF:</strong> Can be given as VEGF levels may be elevated.</li>\n<li><strong>Argon laser subthreshold photocoagulation:</strong> This is used only in cases where the leak is well-defined and not subfoveal (i.e., not directly under the fovea).</li>\n<li><strong>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT):</strong> Involves using verteporfin as a photosensitizer agent, which accumulates in target regions and decreases choroidal hyperpermeability. A common protocol is a half-dose (3 mg/m$^2$) of verteporfin infused over 8 minutes, followed by a low-power laser applied for 83 seconds (690 nm). PDT is particularly useful for subfoveal CSR where laser photocoagulation cannot be done.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Macular hole (Option B):</strong> A macular hole is a full-thickness defect in the fovea. While it causes central vision loss, spontaneous recovery is rare, and it typically does not involve neurosensory detachment in the way CSR does. The OCT would show a distinct foveal defect.</p>\n<p><strong>Myopic crescent (Option C):</strong> A myopic crescent is a benign finding in highly myopic eyes, representing an atrophy of the choroid and RPE adjacent to the optic disc. It causes a stable visual field defect, not sudden, transient vision loss, and is not associated with neurosensory detachment.</p>\n<p><strong>Vitreous hemorrhage (Option D):</strong> Vitreous hemorrhage can cause sudden painless vision loss due to blood obscuring the visual axis. While it can resolve spontaneously, the OCT would show blood in the vitreous cavity, not a neurosensory detachment of the macula, which is characteristic of CSR.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR)</strong> is a common cause of sudden painless vision loss in young to middle-aged males, often linked to stress and steroid use.</li>\n<li>Its hallmark is <strong>neurosensory detachment at the macula</strong> on OCT, and it frequently resolves spontaneously.</li>\n<li>FFA helps identify the characteristic \"ink blot\" or \"smoke stack\" leakage patterns.</li>\n</ul>",

A significant risk factor for CSR, especially in young males (implied by \"IT professional\"), is <strong>stress</strong>, including stress at the workplace. Therefore, ruling out stress as a causative factor is a likely correct statement.</li>\n<li><strong>Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR) Characteristics:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>OCT Findings:</strong> The provided image shows a <strong>neurosensory detachment</strong>, which is characteristic of CSR.</li>\n<li><strong>Etiology:</strong> Risk factors include young males, a stressful lifestyle, Type A personality, smoking, steroid use, OCP usage, and pregnancy. <strong>Stress is an important risk factor for CSR</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms include central scotoma or decreased central vision (often with a hypermetropic error) and <strong>metamorphopsia</strong> (distortion of images).</li>\n<li><strong>Fluorescein Angiography (FFA) Findings:</strong> FFA is done to confirm the diagnosis and typically shows specific leakage patterns:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ink blot pattern:</strong> This is the most commonly seen pattern, where the leak increases and enlarges (enlarging dot sign).</li>\n<li><strong>Smoke stack pattern (aka mushroom or umbrella configuration):</strong> This pattern is more specific, showing hyperfluorescence rising vertically and then spreading laterally.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>He must be a myopic (Option B):</strong> While myopia can be a risk factor for some retinal conditions, CSR is more often associated with hypermetropic error, and there is no strict requirement for the patient to be myopic.</p>\n<p><strong>FFA shows new vessels leak (Option C):</strong> FFA in CSR shows leakage from the choroid into the subretinal space, but it's typically a serous leak, not a \"new vessels leak\" in the sense of neovascularization as seen in conditions like PDR or AMD.</p>\n<p><strong>Petalloid appearance can be seen on FFA (Option D):</strong> A \"flower petal\" or \"petalloid\" appearance on FFA is characteristic of <strong>Cystoid Macular Edema (CME)</strong>, not typically CSR.
