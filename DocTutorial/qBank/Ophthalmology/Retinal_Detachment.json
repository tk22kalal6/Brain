      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The strongest indication for prophylactic treatment to prevent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment involves <strong>evidence of acute onset of symptoms and the presence of vitreous traction</strong>. This scenario is best exemplified by <strong>new onset of floaters</strong> in a patient with predisposing factors like high myopia and lattice degeneration. The decision to treat involves a careful assessment of the risks of treatment versus the risks of leaving the patient untreated.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>An asymptomatic flap tear in an eye with a cataract that is about to be rendered pseudophakic (Option B):</strong> Imminent cataract surgery is considered a less compelling indication on its own. However, the combination of impending cataract surgery with evidence of traction (as implied by a flap tear) becomes a strong indication for treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>An atrophic hole in a phakic patient whose other eye developed a retinal detachment (Option C):</strong> A history of detachment in the other eye is a less compelling indication for prophylaxis on its own. Atrophic holes typically carry a lower risk of detachment compared to flap tears as they do not involve vitreous traction.</p>\n<p><strong>Lattice degeneration in a pseudophakic patient with a family history of retinal detachment (Option D):</strong> Lattice degeneration, being pseudophakic (having undergone cataract surgery), and a family history of retinal detachment are considered less compelling indications individually for prophylactic treatment. Without acute symptoms or direct evidence of traction, the immediate risk of detachment in this scenario is lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acute onset of symptoms</strong> (like new floaters) combined with <strong>evidence of vitreous traction</strong> are the most compelling factors for prophylactic treatment to prevent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.</li>\n<li>Other factors like a history of detachment in the fellow eye or imminent cataract surgery become stronger indications when combined with evidence of traction.</li>\n</ul>",

Therefore, this patient should undergo a thorough <strong>peripheral retinal screening</strong>. The most appropriate test for this is <strong>Indirect Ophthalmoscopy with scleral indentation</strong>. If a retinal break is identified, prophylactic laser barrage should be performed to prevent RD.</p>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509086ef6e0e8-cf33-47d5-b1c7-968b1f3150be.png\">\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cycloplegic Refraction (Option A):</strong> Cycloplegic refraction determines the refractive error of the eye by paralyzing the ciliary muscle.
