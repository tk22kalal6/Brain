      "solution": "<p>Splenic function can be summarized into <strong>hematopoietic, reservoir, filtration, and immunity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hematopoietic </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>During fetal development between 3 to 5 weeks of fetal life, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions, which include white and red blood cell (RBC) production.</li>\n<li>This production is assumed by the bone marrow during the fifth month of gestation, and under normal conditions, the spleen has no significant hematopoietic function beyond this point.</li>\n<li>However, in certain pathologic conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome, the spleen is one of the main organs involved in extramedullary erythropoiesis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reservoir </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The spleen functions as a reservoir, where it pools in platelets. Normally one third of the platelets are pooled within the spleen.</li>\n<li>Thus, patients with splenomegaly are able to sequestrate large volume of platelets (up to 80%) with resultant thrombocytopenia.</li>\n<li>Due to that, after splenectomy, patients usually present with thrombocytosis which could be one of the factors that play a role in increasing thrombotic complications after splenectomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Filtration </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The splenic filtration process consists of two methods of blood flow, the closed and open systems.</li>\n<li>In the closed system, blood flows directly from arteries to veins. In the open system, the blood flows through the arterioles and then trickles through a sieve-like parenchyma made up of reticuloendothelial cells into the splenic sinuses before draining into the venous system.</li>\n<li>The cellular elements are directed toward these reticuloendothelial cells, in which cellular cleansing processes take place. These include removal of senescent cells, cellular inclusions (e.g., RBC nucleoli), and parasites and the sequestration of RBCs (for maturation) and platelets (reservoir).</li>\n<li>The plasma is directed to the lymphoid tissue, where soluble antigens stimulate the production of antibodies. RBC morphology, and thus RBC function, is maintained by splenic filtration. Normal RBCs are biconcave and deform easily. This plasticity allows passage through the microvasculature and optimizes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</li>\n<li>Imperfect RBCs with inclusions such as <strong>nucleoli, Howell-Jolly bodies</strong> (nuclear remnant), <strong>Heinz bodies</strong> (denatured hemoglobin), <strong>Pappenheimer bodies</strong> (iron granules), <strong>acanthocytes</strong> (spur cells), <strong>codocytes</strong> (target cells), and <strong>stippling</strong> cause these RBCs to undergo cleansing in the spleen.</li>\n<li>The <strong>presence of Howell-Jolly bodies on a peripheral blood smear is one of the most characteristic finding for asplenia;</strong> surgical or medical (hemoglobinopathies). Howell-Jolly bodies are strongly basophilic inclusion bodies found in the cytoplasm of RBCs and represent nuclei remnants that were unable to be cleared by a functioning spleen.</li>\n<li>Aged RBCs with decreased plasticity (&gt;120 days) become trapped and destroyed in the spleen.</li>\n<li>Abnormal erythrocytes that result from hemoglobinopathies such as <strong>sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, or pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD)</strong> are also trapped and destroyed by the spleen.</li>\n<li>The overall effect is worsening anemia, splenomegaly, and sometimes autoinfarction of the spleen. Similarly, the spleen is involved in platelet destruction in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Immunity </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It functions by a<strong>ntibody synthesis and phagocytosis. </strong></li>\n<li>Asplenic patients have been found to express subnormal immunoglobulin M levels, and their peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibit a suppressed immunoglobulin response.</li>\n<li>Other factors involved in the immune response are <strong>opsonins</strong>, such as <strong>properdin and tuftsin.</strong> Opsonins, produced in the spleen, exhibit reduced serum levels after splenectomy.</li>\n<li>Properdin, a globulin protein also known as factor P, initiates the alternate pathway of complement activation; this increases the destruction of bacteria and abnormal cells.</li>\n<li>Tuftsin, a tetrapeptide, enhances the phagocytic activity of mononuclear phagocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.</li>\n<li>Absence of a circulating mediator appears to result in suppressed neutrophil function. The spleen also plays a key role in cleaving tuftsin from the heavy chain of immunoglobulin G; thus, circulating levels of tuftsin are subnormal in asplenic patients.</li>\n<li>Additionally, splenic filtration may be particularly important for removal of microorganisms for which the host does not have a specific antibody.</li>\n<li>The immune functions of the spleen become evident after splenectomy, when patients are noted to be at risk for specific infections related to <strong>encapsulated bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitidis.</strong></li>\n<li>Asplenia and hyposplenism could be a result of surgical absence of spleen or lack of functioning of an anatomically present spleen. The most serious sequela is overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong>: Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery 28<sup>th</sup> Edition, Chapter 70, The Spleen, Pg: 1221.</p>",
