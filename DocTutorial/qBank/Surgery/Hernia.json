So, <strong>Impulse on coughing</strong>is positive, which is the key feature of a hernia.

If the hernia contains bowel, then it may become <strong>'obstructed'</strong>, partially or totally.

It presents as a mass or bulge below the inguinal ligament, in the upper thigh.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More common in women</strong>due to a wider pelvis, which creates a larger femoral ring.</li>\n<li>The hernia sac passes <strong>inferior and lateral</strong>to the pubic tubercle. This is a key differentiator from an inguinal hernia, which passes <strong>superior and medial</strong>&nbsp;to the pubic tubercle.</li>\n<li>The path of a femoral hernia is rigid and narrow, making it prone to complications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Clinical Significance of Femoral Hernia:</strong></p>\n<h4><strong>1. High Risk of Strangulation and Obstruction</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The femoral ring is a rigid, non-distensible opening.</li>\n<li>Because of this narrow opening, femoral hernias have the <strong>highest rate of strangulation</strong>among all abdominal wall hernias (up to 40% present as an emergency).</li>\n<li><strong>Strangulation</strong>occurs when the blood supply to the herniated tissue (e.g., intestine) is cut off by the tight neck of the hernia sac. This leads to bowel ischemia, necrosis (tissue death), and perforation.</li>\n<li><strong>Obstruction</strong>occurs when the herniated bowel loop blocks the passage of intestinal contents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>2. Diagnosis</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>They are often small and may not be noticeable to the patient until they become incarcerated (cannot be pushed back in) or strangulated.</li>\n<li>The bulge can be difficult to palpate, especially in obese patients.</li>\n<li>It can be misdiagnosed as an inguinal hernia, lymph node, or saphena varix (a dilation of the saphenous vein).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>3. The \"Crural Triangle\" and Richter's Hernia</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The space between the lacunar ligament (medially) and the femoral vein (laterally) is known as the <strong>crural triangle</strong>. This is the potential site of herniation.</li>\n<li>A <strong>Richter's Hernia</strong>is a dangerous variant where only <strong>one part of the circumference of the bowel wall</strong> becomes trapped and strangulated in the hernia sac. This can lead to bowel perforation without the classic signs of intestinal obstruction, making diagnosis even more difficult.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>4. Management</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the high risk of strangulation, <strong>surgical repair (herniorrhaphy/hernioplasty) is always recommended</strong>once a femoral hernia is diagnosed, even if it is asymptomatic.</li>\n<li>Emergency surgery is required for cases presenting with incarceration, obstruction, or strangulation.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202510131d1cedd7-7a94-4f2d-ac5e-802e09796ca3.png\"><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0;  \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V2NEETPGMCQ/20240321499e553f-58ce-4e94-a025-b213ae9c9ca1.jpg\"></li>\n</ul>",

Recent work has shown that lower incisional hernia rates and reduced infection rates are gained when smaller and closer bites are used with a 2/0 suture rather than traditional heavier materials.</li>\n<li>There is no evidence that interrupted sutures are better or worse than continuous. However, if continuous suturing is used, the tissue bites must not be too near the fascial edge or pulled too tight because they may cut out.</li>\n<li>It has also been confirmed that the optimal ratio of suture length to wound length is&nbsp;<strong>4:1 (Jenkins' rule)</strong>. If less length than this is used, the suture bites are too far apart or too tight and the converse applies if more length than this is used.</li>\n<li>Drains should be brought out through separate incisions and not through the wound itself because this leads to hernia formation.</li>\n<li>Recent reports have suggested that placement of a prophylactic mesh in patients at high risk of hernia formation will substantially reduce that risk.</li>\n</ul>",

However, they may be the only option in the presence of gross contamination such as <strong>peritonitis</strong>. The previous incision is opened along its full length to reveal any clinically unsuspected defects.</li>\n<li>Mesh can be placed in one of several planes as for umbilical hernia repair. The simplest approach is an <strong>onlay</strong>mesh but increasingly the <strong>retromuscular sublay repair</strong> is preferred by expert surgeons.</li>\n<li>Very large incisional hernias often require careful thought before treatment begins. <strong>Ramirez's component separation technique</strong>, which incorporates relaxing incisions in the external oblique aponeurosis and/or the posterior sheath, is very useful. It may then be reinforced with a mesh.</li>\n<li>Patients with poor quality or redundant skin may benefit from a wedge excision of skin and fat (lipectomy) to improve the abdominal contour postoperatively.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0;  \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V2NEETPGMCQ/202403218b314813-5b1f-4411-aef3-0d651b37d493.jpg\"></li>\n</ul>",
