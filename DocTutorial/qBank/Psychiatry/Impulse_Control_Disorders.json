In this case, the child's physical aggression, fire-setting, theft, and substance use go far beyond ODD</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) (Option C):</strong> IED is characterized by brief, sudden outbursts of aggression that are out of proportion to the situation, with euthymic mood between episodes. The behavior here is not episodic but persistent and patterned, involving multiple types of rule violations, not consistent with IED.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Option D):</strong> ASD involves deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, but not deliberate aggression, deceit, or rule-breaking. This child's behavior suggests intentional rule violation rather than social skill deficits or developmental delay.</p>",
