So, in the given scenario, the accused should be charged with POCSO.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>POCSO Act, 2012</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a comprehensive law to provide for the protection of children from the&nbsp;<strong>offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography</strong>, while safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating&nbsp;<strong>child-friendly mechanisms</strong>for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated Special Courts.</li>\n<li>The said Act defines a child as any person below eighteen years of age, and defines different forms of sexual abuse, including&nbsp;<strong>penetrative and non-penetrative assault</strong>, as well as&nbsp;<strong>sexual harassment and pornography</strong>, and deems a sexual assault to be \"<strong>aggravated\"</strong>under certain circumstances, such as when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-a-vis the child, like&nbsp;<strong>a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation for other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Act: (Option B)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refers to older legislation like The Children Act, 1960, which mainly dealt with the care, protection, and welfare of neglected or delinquent children.</li>\n<li>It has a limited or no direct role in handling sexual offences, especially after the enactment of POCSO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 22: (Option C)</strong></p>\n<p>It deals with the \"Act of a person of unsound mind\".
