This disorder is defined by excessive emotionality, attention-seeking behavior, and suggestibility. Individuals with this disorder are often theatrical and may exhibit shallow, rapidly shifting emotions.</p>\n<p>Explanation of Other Options:</p>\n<p><strong>Mania (Option A):</strong> Mania involves an elevated mood, increased goal-directed activity, and a reduced need for sleep. It is an episodic mood disorder, not a chronic personality trait, and its features do not align with Ms. Sunitha's consistent attention-seeking and dramatization.</p>\n<p><strong>Borderline personality disorder (Option B):</strong> This disorder is marked by emotional instability, impulsivity, fear of abandonment, and unstable relationships. It lacks the characteristic theatrical attention-seeking and focus on physical appearance typical of histrionic traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Narcissistic personality disorder (Option D):</strong> Narcissistic personality disorder presents with grandiosity, a sense of entitlement, and a strong need for admiration. While there might be an overlap in seeking attention, it typically lacks the emotional expressiveness and dramatic flair characteristic of histrionic behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>When a patient consistently displays dramatic, attention-seeking, and appearance-focused behaviors, especially in an extroverted and emotionally expressive manner, <strong>Histrionic personality disorder</strong> should be considered.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>This case describes a young adult with classic features of <strong>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Emotional lability:</strong> Sudden, intense mood swings in response to interpersonal stress (e.g., laughing to anger).</li>\n<li><strong>Unstable relationships:</strong> Alternating between idealization and devaluation, especially in romantic settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-injurious behavior:</strong> Cutting to relieve tension is a hallmark feature of BPD.</li>\n<li><strong>Fear of abandonment and identity disturbance:</strong> Extreme sensitivity to perceived rejection, and ongoing internal confusion (e.g., sexuality, body image).</li>\n<li><strong>Suicidal behavior:</strong> Past attempt suggests impulsivity and poor emotional regulation under stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>BPD typically emerges in adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with <strong>impulsivity</strong>, <strong>instability in mood and self-image</strong>, and <strong>maladaptive coping mechanisms</strong> like self-harm.</p>\n<p>Explanation of Other Options:</p>\n<p><strong>Depression (Option A):</strong> Depression is characterized by persistent low mood and anhedonia. While the patient reported feeling low, depression alone does not explain the rapid, situationally reactive mood changes, the interpersonal volatility, the self-harming behavior as a tension reliever, or the identity disturbance seen in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Anorexia nervosa (Option C):</strong> Anorexia nervosa involves body image distortion and an intense fear of weight gain. While this patient is preoccupied with her weight, the core features of emotional instability, self-harm, and unstable relationships are not primarily explained by anorexia nervosa alone. Eating disorders can be comorbidities with BPD, but BPD encompasses the broader range of symptoms presented.</p>\n<p><strong>Bipolar Disorder (Option D):</strong> Bipolar disorder involves episodic mood changes (alternating between distinct manic/hypomanic and depressive episodes). It does not typically account for the moment-to-moment emotional lability, situational reactivity, chronic interpersonal instability, or identity disturbance characteristic of BPD.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>When a patient displays a combination of emotional lability, unstable interpersonal relationships, self-harming behavior, identity disturbance, and fear of abandonment, <strong>Borderline Personality Disorder</strong> is the most likely diagnosis. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the most effective psychotherapy for this condition.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation of Answer:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The personality type most associated with competitiveness, urgency, hostility, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (specifically coronary artery disease and stroke) is <strong>Type A</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Type A personality is characterized by high ambition, impatience, hostility, and a pervasive sense of constant time pressure. Individuals with this pattern are often described as workaholics, intolerant of delays, and excessively focused on achievement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Other classification of personality</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Type B</strong>: Relaxed, non-competitive, emotionally balanced; protective against stress-related illness.<strong>(Option A ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Type C</strong>: Emotion-suppressing, passive, compliant; linked to higher <strong>cancer risk</strong> due to internalized stress.<strong>(Option B ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Type D</strong>: Characterized by <strong>negative affectivity</strong> and <strong>social inhibition</strong>, often appearing <strong>dysthymic or depressed</strong>, with a <strong>higher CAD risk</strong>. <strong>(Option C ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Type H</strong>: Known as the <strong>\"hardiness\" personality</strong>&mdash;resilient under stress, seeks <strong>control, commitment, and challenge</strong>; considered stress-protective.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Type A personality</strong> is strongly linked to competitiveness, urgency, hostility, and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (such as coronary artery disease and stroke) due to its driven and time-pressured nature.</li>\r\n</ul>",
