Even \"decaffeinated\" green tea can contain small amounts of caffeine, and some people are particularly sensitive to it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In sleep hygiene, avoiding any stimulants like coffee, cola, energy drinks, or green/black tea in the evening is strongly recommended.</li>\n<li>Caffeine can delay the onset of sleep, reduce total sleep time, and affect sleep quality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dos</strong><strong> for Good Sleep Hygiene</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain regular hours of bedtime and arising</li>\n<li>Have a light snack before bedtime if you're hungry</li>\n<li>Maintain a regular exercise schedule (but <strong>not right before bed</strong>)</li>\n<li>Give yourself about an hour to wind down before going to bed</li>\n<li>If you're worried about something at bedtime, write it down and deal with it in the morning</li>\n<li>Keep the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;ts for Good Sleep Hygiene</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t take naps during the day</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t watch the clock to see how bad your insomnia is</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t exercise right before going to bed</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t watch television in bed when you cannot sleep</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t eat a heavy meal before bedtime</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t drink coffee in the afternoon or evening</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t smoke a cigarette if you cannot sleep</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t use alcohol to help in going to sleep</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t read in bed when you cannot sleep</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t eat in bed</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t exercise in bed</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t talk on the phone in bed</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Using the bed only for sleep and intimacy (Option A):</strong> This is a core principle of sleep hygiene. The idea is to train the brain to associate the bed with only sleep and sex. Doing other activities like watching TV, working, or scrolling on the phone in bed weakens this association, making it harder to fall asleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Having a light snack like warm milk before bed (Option B): </strong>Light, healthy snacks (such as warm milk or a banana) can sometimes help with sleep. Milk contains tryptophan, an amino acid that helps promote the production of serotonin and melatonin, neurochemicals involved in sleep regulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoiding naps in the late afternoon (Option D):</strong> Late afternoon or evening naps reduce sleep pressure and can make it harder to fall asleep at night. Short naps (&le;30 minutes) earlier in the day may be refreshing, but longer naps or naps taken too late can disrupt the natural circadian rhythm.</p>",
