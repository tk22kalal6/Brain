      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>Countertransference refers to the therapist's emotional and behavioural responses toward the patient, which are influenced by the therapist's own unconscious feelings, personal experiences, and the patient's transference.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It involves the therapist's internal reactions-both conscious and unconscious-to the patient.</li>\n<li>These reactions may be evoked by the patient's transference or by traits and behaviours that unconsciously remind the therapist of someone significant from their past.</li>\n<li>In this scenario, the therapist's excessive talking and confrontation are likely emotional reactions triggered by the therapeutic interaction, rather than objective clinical responses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Displacement (Option B): </strong>This is when a person shifts emotions (often anger or frustration) from the original source to a safer target (e.g., yelling at a subordinate because of anger toward a boss). It applies to the patient or therapist displacing feelings-but in this scenario, it's not about redirecting emotion, it's about internal emotional reaction of the therapist, so not the best fit.</p>\n<p><strong>Projection (Option C): </strong>This is when a person attributes their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else (e.g., a jealous person accusing others of jealousy). There's no evidence here that the therapist is attributing their own feelings to the patient, so this doesn't apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Projective identification</strong> <strong>(Option D):</strong> This is a more complex defense mechanism, where someone induces feelings in another person that are then unconsciously experienced and expressed by that person. It could theoretically be involved, but this is more elaborate than what is described. The focus here is on the therapist's emotional response, not on a mutual unconscious dynamic, making countertransference a better fit.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Penis envy is part of the Electra complex, which Freud described in females. It involves a girl's envy of male genitalia and desire for a penis, not applicable to boys. Hence, this statement is incorrect in this context.</p>\r\n<p>This scenario illustrates Freuds Oedipus complex, which occurs during the phallic stage of psychosexual development (approximately 3-6 years of age).</p>\r\n<p>Key elements include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Erotic attachment to the opposite-sex parent</li>\r\n<li>Rivalry and fear of punishment (castration anxiety) from the same-sex parent</li>\r\n<li>Resolution through identification with the same-sex parent, leading to the development of the superego</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>This is a normal phase of psychosexual development (Option A):</strong> True. The phallic stage is a normal developmental period in Freud's theory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This is known as resolution of the Oedipus complex (Option B)</strong>: True. The boy resolves his conflict by identifying with his father, which helps him internalize societal norms and develop his superego.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It operates at the unconscious level by repression (Option D):</strong> True. The entire Oedipus complex operates unconsciously, and repression is used to keep these unacceptable desires out of conscious awareness.</p>",
