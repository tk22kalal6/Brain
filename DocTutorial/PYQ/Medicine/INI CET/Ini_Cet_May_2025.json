      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most frequent initial symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is joint and muscle pain (arthralgia and myalgia). SLE can affect multiple organ systems, each presenting with distinct clinical features:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Skin</strong>: Photosensitivity is a common dermatologic manifestation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Renal system</strong>: Proteinuria is often an early sign of kidney involvement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Neurologic system</strong>: Patients may experience cognitive dysfunction, psychosis, depression, or seizures.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular system</strong>: Pericarditis is a typical cardiac complication.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Respiratory system</strong>: Pleuritis is commonly observed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hematologic system</strong>: Anaemia is a frequent finding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The multi-system involvement highlights the diverse and systemic nature of SLE.</p>\r\n<p>Characteristic Findings in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/FMGEMCQ/2025092936db1668-9dd5-421e-9cec-e6cb1b1a2725.png\"><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/FMGEMCQ/20250929a030c344-63f4-45bb-941c-70571b9f88e6.png\">\r\n<p><strong>Explanations for other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Photosensitivity (Option A): </strong>Photosensitivity is a common skin manifestation of SLE, where patients develop rashes or other skin reactions after exposure to sunlight. While it is a recognized feature of the disease and included in diagnostic criteria, it is <strong>not as common</strong> as <strong>musculoskeletal symptoms like joint and muscle pain.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Nephrotic syndrome (Option C): </strong> Nephrotic syndrome can occur in SLE due to lupus nephritis, a serious form of kidney involvement. However, kidney disease tends to appear <strong>later in the disease course</strong> and is not the most common presenting symptom. It is also less frequently seen compared to musculoskeletal and skin manifestations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Seizures (Option D): </strong>Seizures are a possible neurological complication of SLE and are part of what is known as <strong>neuropsychiatric lupus</strong>. Although significant when present, seizures are <strong>relatively rare</strong> and certainly not among the most common initial or overall manifestations of the disease.</p>",

It affects various neural pathways, leading to a wide range of neurological symptoms that often fluctuate in severity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Common Clinical Features of MS:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sensory disturbances</strong>: These include <strong>numbness (hypesthesia)</strong> and <strong>tingling or \"pins and needles\" sensations (paresthesia)</strong>, often affecting the limbs or trunk.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Optic neuritis</strong>: Typically presents with <strong>blurred vision</strong>, <strong>reduced color perception</strong>, and <strong>decreased visual acuity</strong>, usually on one side (unilateral), but can also be bilateral.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Motor symptoms</strong>: Patients may develop <strong>limb weakness</strong>, often with <strong>spasticity</strong>, <strong>abnormal gait</strong>, and <strong>a positive Babinski sign</strong>, indicating upper motor neuron involvement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cranial nerve involvement</strong>: This may manifest as <strong>facial weakness</strong> and occasionally <strong>hearing impairment</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cerebellar signs</strong>: <strong>Ataxia</strong> and <strong>vertigo</strong> are common, reflecting cerebellar or vestibular involvement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bladder dysfunction</strong>: Often seen as <strong>urinary urgency</strong>, frequency, or incontinence due to neurogenic bladder.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lhermitte's phenomenon</strong>: Described as a <strong>sudden electric-shock-like sensation</strong> that travels down the spine when the neck is flexed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Uhthoff's phenomenon</strong>: Worsening of existing neurological symptoms when exposed to <strong>heat</strong>, such as during exercise or a hot shower.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Imaging in MS:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</strong> is the preferred diagnostic tool for MS due to its <strong>high sensitivity in detecting CNS lesions</strong>. A characteristic MRI finding is the presence of <strong>periventricular, ovoid lesions</strong> that extend <strong>perpendicularly from the ventricular surface</strong>, known as <strong>Dawson fingers</strong>. These findings are essential for diagnosis and monitoring disease progression.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanations for other Options:</strong> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Motor weakness (Option A): </strong>Motor weakness is a common feature in MS, especially as the disease progresses. However, it is <strong>less likely to be the initial symptom</strong> compared to sensory disturbances. When present, motor symptoms often involve spasticity, stiffness, or weakness in the legs or arms. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Ataxia (Option C): </strong> Ataxia, or lack of coordination, may occur in MS due to cerebellar involvement. While it is a recognized manifestation, it is <strong>not typically the first symptom</strong>. It usually appears later in the disease course or during relapses affecting the cerebellum or its connections </p>\r\n<p><strong>Seizures (Option D):  </strong>Seizures are relatively <strong>rare in MS</strong>, occurring in only a small percentage of patients. Although cortical lesions in MS can potentially lead to seizures, they are <strong>not a common presenting symptom</strong> and are far less frequent than sensory or motor signs.</p>",

While goitre can be seen in iodine deficiency, it <strong>does not explain the development of hyperthyroidism after iodine supplementation</strong>. It is more of a <strong>structural change</strong>, not a functional effect like the Jod-Basedow phenomenon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Medullary thyroid cancer</strong><strong> (Option D): </strong> <strong>Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)</strong> is a <strong>neuroendocrine tumor</strong> arising from <strong>parafollicular C cells</strong> of the thyroid that produce <strong>calcitonin</strong>, not thyroid hormones.

Currently, initiating SGLT2 inhibitors along with loop diuretics is considered beneficial in managing HFpEF.</p>\r\n<p>In patients with diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated a reduction in the risk of developing heart failure, suggesting their potential effectiveness in HFpEF as well. Additionally, angiotensin receptors-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) are being investigated as part of emerging therapies. Overall, management of HFpEF emphasizes controlling fluid overload, optimizing treatment of comorbid conditions, and minimizing factors that can worsen symptoms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation for other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Digoxin - to increase myocardial contractility</strong> <strong>(Option A):</strong> Digoxin primarily increases systolic function. HFpEF patients have <strong>preserved EF</strong>, so increasing contractility is <strong>not beneficial</strong> and does not improve mortality or hospitalizations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>lvabradine - to decrease heart rate and improve ventricular filling </strong><strong>(Option B): </strong>Ivabradine selectively lowers heart rate and can improve filling in <strong>HF with reduced EF (HFrEF)</strong> with sinus rhythm. In HFpEF, evidence for ivabradine improving outcomes is <strong>limited</strong> and not guideline-recommended.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ranolazine - to reduce angina</strong> <strong>(Option D):</strong> Ranolazine is an <strong>antianginal agent</strong>. It does <strong>not improve heart failure symptoms, hospitalizations, or long-term outcomes</strong> in HFpEF.</p>",
