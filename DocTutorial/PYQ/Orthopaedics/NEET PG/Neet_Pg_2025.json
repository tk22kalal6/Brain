As osteoclastic activity subsides, new lamellar bone fills resorption cavities, creating a <strong>mosaic pattern</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>In the late stage, bone becomes <strong>sclerotic</strong> and brittle.</li>\r\n<li>Clinically, PDB occurs equally in men and women, rarely before age 50, and may remain localised or widespread.</li>\r\n<li>Common sites are the <strong>pelvis</strong>, tibia, femur, and skull. Many patients are asymptomatic, with diagnosis often incidental via X-ray or elevated alkaline phosphatase.</li>\r\n<li>When symptomatic, it causes pain which is worse at rest or in warmth and deformities, especially in the lower limbs.</li>\r\n<li>Skull involvement can cause enlargement, ill-fitting hats, or basilar invagination (short neck appearance).</li>\r\n<li>Complications include <strong>cranial nerve compression</strong> (vision loss, facial palsy, deafness), otosclerosis, osteosarcoma, spinal cord compression, and spinal claudication. In some cases, it can lead to high-output cardiac failure.</li>\r\n<li>Radiographically, the resorptive phase shows osteolysis in the form of <strong>flame-shaped lesions, </strong>as shown below, and <strong>osteoporosis circumscripta</strong> in the skull.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509104b03c4f8-fa46-4131-ab4f-8aa30f11d267.png\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It then progresses to thick, sclerotic bone with coarse trabeculation. Stress fractures and deformity may occur, sometimes only recognised after fracture. Radionuclide scans reveal the distribution of active lesions.</li>\r\n<li>Biochemically, calcium and phosphate are usually normal, though immobilised patients may develop hypercalcemia. Serum ALP, especially bone isoenzyme, reflects activity and extent, and helps <strong>monitor treatment</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Treatment with<strong> IV zoledronate</strong> effectively induces remission, often lasting years, with minimal side effects apart from transient flu-like symptoms.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Osteomalacia (Option A): </strong>Osteomalacia is the adult counterpart of rickets, resulting from<strong> inadequate mineralisation of bone</strong>, leading to incompletely calcified osteoid that softens the skeleton, increasing fracture risk. In adults, calcium remains at the <strong>low-norma</strong>l range due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, with <strong>elevated PTH</strong> and <strong>ALP</strong>, low serum phosphate, and <strong>markedly reduced 25-OHD levels</strong> (typically &lt;10 nmol/L).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Primary hyperparathyroidism (Option B): </strong>Primary hyperparathyroidism, most often caused by a <strong>solitary adenoma</strong>, typically affects middle-aged women and may be asymptomatic or present with <strong>hypercalcaemia-related symptoms</strong> such as anorexia, abdominal pain, depression, and renal calculi. Biochemical tests reveal hypercalcaemia, <strong>hypophosphataemia</strong>, <strong>elevated serum PTH</strong>, and raised alkaline phosphatase in cases with osteitis fibrosa.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Osteoporosis (Option D): </strong>Osteoporosis is a condition marked by reduced bone mass and structural defects that make bones fragile and prone to fractures despite being normally mineralised. The cancellous bone becomes porous, and the cortices thinner, but biochemical parameters such as<strong> alkaline phosphatase</strong>, <strong>serum phosphorus</strong>, and calcium-phosphorus product remain within<strong> normal </strong>limits.</p>",
