The patient does not have signs of Wilson's disease, and <strong>lesion extraction</strong> would not be appropriate for a cataract.</p>",

Although fluorescein is a very effective stain for the diseased cornea, it is more difficult to detect fluorescein staining of the conjunctiva because of the poor scleral contrast. Fluorescein absorbs light in the blue spectrum (490 nm) and emits yellow-green light of a higher wavelength (530 nm); therefore, staining can be more readily viewed if a <strong>cobalt blue or yellow (blue-free) filter</strong> is used.
